https://openalex.org/W2012369631,"Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, and regulation of the enzymatic activity of IDHs is crucial for their biological functions. Bacterial IDHs are reversibly regulated by phosphorylation of a strictly conserved serine residue at the active site. Eukaryotic NADP-dependent IDHs (NADP-IDHs) have been shown to have diverse important biological functions; however, their regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Structural studies of human cytosolic NADP-IDH (HcIDH) in complex with NADP and in complex with NADP, isocitrate, and Ca2+ reveal three biologically relevant conformational states of the enzyme that differ substantially in the structure of the active site and in the overall structure. A structural segment at the active site that forms a conserved α-helix in all known NADP-IDH structures assumes a loop conformation in the open, inactive form of HcIDH; a partially unraveled α-helix in the semi-open, intermediate form; and an α-helix in the closed, active form. The side chain of Asp279 of this segment occupies the isocitrate-binding site and forms hydrogen bonds with Ser94 (the equivalent of the phosphorylation site in bacterial IDHs) in the inactive form and chelates the metal ion in the active form. The structural data led us to propose a novel self-regulatory mechanism for HcIDH that mimics the phosphorylation mechanism used by the bacterial homologs, consistent with biochemical and biological data. This mechanism might be applicable to other eukaryotic NADP-IDHs. The results also provide insights into the recognition and specificity of substrate and cofactor by eukaryotic NADP-IDHs.

Regulation of the enzymatic activity of IDHs is crucial for their biological functions. Eukaryotic cells express two distinct classes of IDHs that utilize either NAD or NADP as their cofactors and serve diverse biological functions. NAD-dependent IDH is localized to the mitochondrial matrix and is well known for its central role for energy production in the Krebs cycle. NADP-dependent IDHs (NADP-IDHs, EC 1.1.1.42) are primarily located either in mitochondria (1Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or cytoplasm (2Jennings G.T. Sechi S. Stevenson P.M. Tuckey R.C. Parmelee D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their potential catabolic role in the Krebs cycle, both mitochondrial and cytosolic NADP-IDHs are shown to play an important role in cellular defense against oxidative damage as a source of NADPH (3Jo S.H.

Moreover, all eukaryotic cytosolic IDHs contains a type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence at their C terminus (6Nekrutenko A. Hillis D.M. Patton J.C. Bradley R.D. Baker R.J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1674-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that is sufficient to direct proteins into peroxisomes (7Gould S.J. Collins C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cytosolic IDHs have been found in peroxisomes of yeast, human, and rat liver cells and are shown to be required for the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids as a provider of NADPH inside peroxisomes (8Henke B.

In contrast, Escherichia coli as well as other bacterial cells contain only a single NADP-IDH (EcIDH) whose structures and functions have been studied extensively (13Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E.

EcIDH functions at a critical juncture between the Krebs cycle and the glyoxylate cycle, and regulation of its activity controls the substrate flux between the two reactions (18LaPorte D.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The activity of EcIDH is regulated by the phosphorylation of Ser113, which is located at the isocitrate-metal ion-binding site (13Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H.

The phosphorylation reaction is reversibly catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme, IDH kinase/phosphatase (IDH-K/P) (18LaPorte D.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This regulatory mechanism has been proposed to apply to Bacillus subtilis NADP-IDH (BsIDH), which exhibits extensive sequence and structural similarities with EcIDH (20Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Singh S.K. Miller S.P. Dean A. Banaszak L.J. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7567-7573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanism of mammalian NADP-IDHs is still unclear. Although mammalian and bacterial NADP-IDHs share less than 20% sequence identity, the structure of porcine heart mitochondrial NADP-IDH (PmIDH) shows an overall structure very similar to its bacterial counterparts (22Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Structure-based sequence alignments indicate that mammalian NADP-IDHs have a strictly conserved serine at a position equivalent to Ser113 of EcIDH (6Nekrutenko A. Hillis D.M. Patton J.C. Bradley R.D. Baker R.J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1674-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Those results led to the suggestion that mammalian NADP-IDHs might also contain a phosphorylation site and are possibly regulated by kinases and phosphatases like their bacterial homologs (22Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We report here the crystal structures of human cytosolic NADP-IDH (HcIDH) in complex with its cofactor, NADP (designated as binary complex thereafter), and in complex with NADP, the substrate isocitrate, and Ca2+ (designated as quaternary complex thereafter). Structural comparisons of HcIDH with other NADP-IDHs reveal that HcIDH is likely to utilize a unique mechanism to self-regulate its activity that mimics the phosphorylation mechanism used by its bacterial homologs. The structural data also provide insights into the recognition and specificity of substrate and cofactor by eukaryotic NADP-IDHs. Protein Expression and Purification—The plasmid pET-22b(+) containing the recombinant HcIDH gene fused with a His6 tag at the C terminus was expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. E. coli cells transformed with the vector were grown overnight at 37 °C in 100 ml of LB media containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). The overnight culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB medium and grown to an A600 nm of 0.6. After 12 h of expression induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside at 20 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and suspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1%Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed on ice by sonication, and cell debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. HcIDH was purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The lysis extract was first loaded on the column and then washed with a washing buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl) to elute nonspecific binding proteins. The target protein was eluted finally with an elution buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl). The protein was concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml in a storage buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl). HcIDH consists of 414 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46.7 kDa. Dynamic light scattering and gel filtration analyses indicate that the protein is homogeneously dispersed and forms a homodimer in solution in both the presence and absence of substrate (data not shown). Biochemical assays indicate that the enzyme is active with a Michaelis constant (Km) of 12.4 μm and a maximum velocity of 41.9 μmol/min/mg. Enzymatic Activity Assay—The IDH activity of HcIDH was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the reduction of NADP to NADPH, which has an extinction coefficient of 6220 m-1·cm-1 at 340 nm. The standard reaction buffer (1 ml) consists of 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm NADP, 4 mmdl-isocitrate, and 2 mm MnSO4. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of HcIDH at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml or its appropriate dilution. The reaction rate was calculated as ΔA340/min. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection—Crystallization was conducted using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the HcIDH-NADP complex were grown at 4 °C in a drop with equal volumes of the protein solution containing 15 mg/ml HcIDH in the storage buffer and the reservoir solution (100 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 12% polyethylene glycol 20,000). Crystals of the HcIDH-NADP-isocitrate-Ca2+ complex were grown at 20 °C in a drop with equal volumes of the protein solution containing 15 mg/ml HcIDH, 10 mmdl-isocitrate, 10 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm NADP and the reservoir solution containing 100 mm MES, pH 5.9, and 20% polyethylene glycol 6,000. The diffraction data for the binary complex were collected from a flash-cooled crystal at 100 K using the F2 beamline at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source with a wavelength of 0.9791 Å and were processed, integrated, and scaled together with HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Diffraction data for the quaternary complex were collected from a flash-cooled crystal at 100 K using an in-house Rigaku R-Axis IV++ and CuKα radiation (wavelength of 1.5418 Å) and were processed and scaled together using CrystalClear (24Pflugrath J.W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as the search model. Cross-rotation function search and subsequent translation function search using the monomeric PmIDH produced two outstanding peaks, corresponding to two HcIDH monomers in the asymmetric unit. Structure refinement was carried out using CNS. Model building was performed with O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The free R factor was calculated with 5% of the data, and a bulk solvent correction was applied in all refinements. Strict 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) constraints were used in the early stage of refinement, but the two monomers in the asymmetric unit were refined independently in the later stage of refinement because of the conformational differences. In the initial difference Fourier maps there was strong residual electron density at the active site of each monomer, and the position and shape of the electron density match NADP very well. Because HcIDH is an NADP-IDH, we modeled this piece of electron density as NADP. Because no NADP was added during the purification process and in the crystallization solution, the bound NADP must have copurified together with the enzyme from the expression system. Electron density peaks in difference Fourier maps at a height of above 2.5 σ were assigned as water molecules if they had reasonable geometry in relation to hydrogen bond donors or acceptors from amino acids or other water molecules, and their B factors did not rise above 60 Å2 during subsequent refinement. The structure of the HcIDH quaternary complex was also solved with the molecular replacement method. We employed the monomeric and dimeric PmIDH and the monomeric and dimeric HcIDH-NADP complex as the search models, respectively. The dimeric PmIDH model produced the best results, which revealed two clear and outstanding solutions in cross-rotation function and translation function searches, corresponding to two HcIDH homodimers related by a pseudo 2-fold NCS in the asymmetric unit. Application of strict 4-fold NCS constraints could not decrease both the R and free R factors to below 30%. Therefore, NCS restraints were applied in the final stage of refinement. NADP, isocitrate, and Ca2+ at the active site have well defined electron density in the initial difference Fourier maps and were included in the refinement after the R factor was reduced to 26.5%. Water molecules were added gradually in the model, and refinement was based on the criteria described above. Overall Structures of HcIDH—The structure of the binary complex contains two HcIDH molecules in an asymmetric unit that forms an asymmetric homodimer. The final structure model contains two full HcIDH polypeptide chains each consisting of residues 1–414, two NADP molecules, and 154 water molecules. The region consisting of residues 271–286 in subunit A has well defined electron density (Fig. 1A), whereas its counterpart in subunit B is partially disordered and has discontinuous electron density. The structure of the quaternary complex contains four HcIDH molecules per asymmetric unit that form two homodimers related by a pseudo 2-fold NCS. The final structure model contains four full-length HcIDH molecules, four NADP molecules, four isocitrate molecules, four Ca2+ ions, and 914 water molecules. The region consisting of residues 271–286 in all four subunits of the quaternary complex is well ordered and has good electron density (Fig. 1B). A summary of the structure refinement and the final model statistics is given in Table I. The HcIDH monomer has a secondary structure fold and topology similar to other dimeric NADP-IDHs whose structures are known, specifically EcIDH (13Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), even though these enzymes share varying sequence identity (∼16–17% between mammalian and bacterial NADP-IDHs and ∼69% between HcIDH and PmIDH) (Figs. 2 and 3). Like other NADP-IDHs, HcIDH consists of three domains: a large domain, a small domain, and a clasp domain. The large domain comprises residues 1–103 and 286–414 and has a typical Rossmann fold. The small domain contains residues 104–136 and 186–285 and forms an α/β sandwich structure. The clasp domain ranges from residues 137 to 185 and folds as two two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets stacked on each other.Fig. 3Structure-based sequence alignment of HcIDH with other NADP-IDHs. The structures used in comparisons are PmIDH, EcIDH, and BsIDH. Invariant residues are highlighted as shaded red boxes, and conserved residues are indicated by open red boxes. The secondary structure of HcIDH in the quaternary complex is placed above the alignment. The alignment was drawn with ESPript (35Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The large and small domains are joined together by a β-sheet (Fig. 2). There are two clefts flanked on each side of the β-sheet. The large, deep cleft is formed by the large and small domains of one subunit and the small domain of the adjacent subunit and comprises the active site (Fig. 2). The active site cleft is hydrophilic in nature and is exposed to solvent and accessible to substrate and/or cofactor. It consists of the NADP-binding site and the isocitrate-metal ion-binding site. The small, shallow cleft is formed between the large and small domains of the same subunit and is located at the back of the large cleft (designated as the back cleft) (Fig. 2). In contrast to bacterial IDHs in which the back cleft is largely hydrophobic (13Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the small cleft in HcIDH is hydrophobic at the base and highly hydrophilic at the rim. This feature is also observed in PmIDH. The back cleft has been proposed to have functional importance (13Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the back cleft is involved in the regulation of conformational changes of HcIDH and may affect the function of the enzyme (see discussion later). The clasp domain functions as an interlock in all dimeric NADP-IDH structures that holds the two subunits together to form the catalytic active site (Fig. 2). Structural and sequence comparisons indicate that the clasp domain varies substantially in primary sequence and differs in three-dimensional structure among NADP-IDHs from different species (Figs. 2 and 3). In both HcIDH and PmIDH structures, the clasp domains of the two subunits in the homodimer interwind together to form two layers of four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets. However, the clasp domains of the bacterial enzymes form two anti-parallel α-helices and a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (13Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These differences can serve as indicators for phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses. Like other dimeric NADP-IDHs, HcIDH exists as a homodimer in solution in both the absence and the presence of substrate determined by dynamic light scattering and gel filtration analyses (data not shown) and forms a homodimer in the crystal structures. Similar to EcIDH, BsIDH, and PmIDH, the dimeric HcIDH has two active sites, each composed of amino acid residues from both subunits of the homodimer (see discussion later), suggesting that HcIDH most likely functions as a homodimer. The intersubunit relationship and interface contacts in the HcIDH quaternary complex are similar to those in the structures of EcIDH, BsIDH, and PmIDH. Dimerization is mediated by extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions primarily between the two clasp domains and between four α-helices of the small domains (α9 and α10 of each subunit) (Figs. 2 and 3). The dimer interface buries 3703 Å2 solvent-accessible surface of each monomer, corresponding to 18.5% of the surface area of the monomer. The buried surface area in EcIDH, BsIDH, and PmIDH is 3278 Å2 (17.3%), 3610 Å2 (18.5%), and 3404 Å2 (17.7%), respectively. The large buried surface area in the dimer interface suggests that these dimeric enzymes are very stable. However, in the HcIDH binary complex the two subunits of the homodimer adopt different conformations. Helix α10 of the small domain is completely unwound and intrudes into the active site in subunit A; in subunit B it is partially unwound and is extended into subunit A. Helix α9 in both subunits is expanded outwards (Figs. 2 and 3). The dimer interface buries 2867 Å2 solvent-accessible surface of each monomer, corresponding to ∼13.8% of the surface area of the monomer. Compared with the quaternary complex, the dimer interface in the binary complex is less compact and probably less stable. Isocitrate-Metal Ion-binding Site—In the structure of the HcIDH quaternary complex, an isocitrate molecule and a Ca2+ ion are found to bind at the active site of each subunit. The isocitrate substrate interacts with Thr77, Ser94, Arg100, Arg109, Arg132, Tyr139, and Asp275 of one subunit; Lys212, Thr214, and Asp252 of the adjacent subunit; 3 water molecules; NADP; and Ca2+. Most of these residues are strictly conserved in all NADP-IDHs, except Thr214, which is invariant in eukaryotic NADP-IDHs but is replaced with an Asn in bacterial enzymes. The α-carboxylate of isocitrate forms hydrophilic interactions with the side chains of Arg100, Arg109, Arg132, and Asp275 and the carbonyl group of the nicotinamide moiety of NADP. Its hydroxyl group makes hydrogen bonding interactions with the side chain of Asp275 and the side chains of Lys212 and Asp252 of the adjacent subunit. The β-carboxylate group has hydrophilic interactions with the side chains of Arg100, Arg132, Tyr139, and Asp275, and the side chain of Lys212 of the adjacent subunit. The γ-carboxylate group forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Thr77 and Ser94, the side chain of Thr214 of the adjacent subunit, and the 2′-OH group of the nicotinamide ribose of NADP. In addition, one α-carboxylate oxygen and the hydroxyl group of isocitrate chelate the Ca2+ ion. NADP-IDHs require a divalent metal ion, usually Mn2+ or Mg2+, for their enzymatic activity. In all structures of NADP-IDHs bound with a divalent metal ion, the residues involved in chelating the metal ion are strictly conserved. Substitution of Ca2+ for Mg2+ has very little effect on the structure of the active site with only slight changes of the coordination geometry of the metal ion in EcIDH. This substitution decreases drastically the enzymatic rate of EcIDH but does not significantly change the relative binding affinities of the substrate and the metal ion (15Stoddard B.L. Dean A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9310-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Mesecar A.D. Stoddard B.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1997; 277: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In protein structures Mn2+ and Mg2+ prefer to have six ligands, and Ca2+ prefers to have seven or eight ligands (27Glusker J.P. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our HcIDH quaternary complex, Ca2+ is coordinated by one α-carboxylate oxygen and the hydroxyl group of isocitrate, the main chain carbonyl oxygen, and the side chain Oδ-1 atom of Asp275, the side chain Oδ-1 atom (and possibly Oδ-2 atom) of Asp279, the side chain Oδ-2 atom of Asp252 of the adjacent subunit, and one water molecule and adopts a distorted pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry. This geometry is similar to that observed in the Ca2+-bound EcIDH structure but slightly different from the ideal octahedral geometry obse"

In response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), we find Rip1 phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, suggesting that Rip1 phosphorylation may stimulate its ubiquitination. To address the contribution of the kinase activity of Rip1 to its ubiquitination and to TNF-α signaling, we introduced wild type Rip1 and a kinase-inactive form of Rip1, Rip1D138N, into rip1-/- murine embryonic fibroblast cells by retroviral infection. TNF-α-induced ubiquitination of Rip1 is observed in Rip1D138N cells, supporting the argument that Rip1 autophosphorylation is not required for Rip1 ubiquitination. TNF-α-induced Ikk and p38 MAP kinase activation is normal, and the Rip1D138N cells are resistant to TNF-α-induced cell death, indicating that the kinase activity of Rip1 is not required to mediate its antiapoptotic functions. In the absence of Traf2, TNF-α-induced ubiquitination of Rip1 is impaired, suggesting that Traf2 may be the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the TNF-α-dependent, ubiquitination of Rip1. Finally, recruitment of the ubiquitinated Tak1 complex is dependent on the presence of Rip1, suggesting that Rip1 ubiquitination rather than its phosphorylation is critical in signaling.

The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Tnfr1, TNF receptor type 1; mTNF, murine TNF; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEFs, murine embryonic fibroblasts; IL, interleukin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ab, antibody; IKK, IκB kinase; Mkk, MAP kinase kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; MSCV, murine stem cell virus. is a major mediator of apoptosis as well as inflammation and immunity. It has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, sepsis, diabetes, and cancer (1Feldmann M. Maini R.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). TNF-α activates the transcription factors NFκB and activator protein-1 and exerts its effects by binding to two receptors, the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (Tnfr1 or p55) and the Tnfr type 2 (Tnfr2 or p75) (2Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). Signaling from the activated Tnfr1 is mediated by the adapter proteins Traf2 and the death domain serine/threonine kinase Rip1 (3Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar); yet, how Rip1 and/or Traf2 mediates activation of the downstream kinases remains unclear. Ubiquitination has been implicated in the regulation of the NFκB pathway as well as in many other biological processes. Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid protein that is highly conserved and, like phosphorylation, is essential for the degradation of proteins that respond to changes or stresses in the micoenvironment (6Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can stimulate or inhibit ubiquitination by affecting either the target protein or the ubiquitin enzymes. Typically, ubiquitin forms a linkage with proteins via one or more lysine residues. In vivo, Lys-48 polyubiquitin chains lead to the recognition and degradation of proteins by a proteasome. In contrast, Lys-63 linkages are not associated with the proteasomal degradation but have been implicated in other biological processes, including activation of the IκB kinase by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf6 (7Deng L.

Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). On TNF-α treatment, we found that Rip1 undergoes autophosphorylation and ubiquitination, suggesting that one or both of these posttranslational modifications may be important in Ikk or Mkk-6 activation. Studies in transfected cells suggest that the kinase activity of Rip1 is not required for TNF-α-induced Ikk or p38 MAP kinase activation (9Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); however, transfection of kinase-inactive Rip1 results in its oligomerization with Traf proteins and the subsequent activation of these pathways (5Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar, 10Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rip1 autophosphorylation triggers its ubiquitination and to test whether Rip1 ubiquitination contributes to MAP kinase activation, we introduced wild type rip1 and a kinase-inactive rip1 into rip1-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and examined TNF-α-induced ubiquitination of Rip1 as well as activation of Ikk and p38 MAP kinase. In response to TNF-α, both Rip1 and the kinase-inactive form of Rip1 are ubiquitinated, although phosphorylated Rip1 may be a preferred E3 substrate. In addition, TNF-α-induced activation of Ikk and p38 MAP is not affected in cells expressing an inactive Rip1 kinase, demonstrating that Rip1 autophosphorylation is not required for signaling. Although it is recruited to the Tnfr1, Rip1 ubiquitination is not observed when Traf-deficient cells are stimulated with TNF-α. Taken together, these studies suggest that TNF-α-induced Ikk and Mkk-6 activation is mediated by the ubiquitination of Rip1 and the subsequent recruitment of a ubiquitinated Tak1 complex. Preparation of Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts—Targeted disruption of the rip1 loci has been described previously (12Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Embryonic day-14 wild type rip1+/- and rip1-/- embryos were equilibrated overnight in trypsin at 4° C. Trypsin was activated by incubating at 37 °C for 15 min. The embryos were then dissociated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) containing 10% fetal calf serum. MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed on cells between passage 2 and passage 5.

In Vitro Kinase Assay—Wild type or rip1-/- cells infected with rip1 or rip1D138N retrovirus were plated at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm plate. The cells were left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for the time periods indicated. Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously (14Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 Production Assays—Wild type, rip1-/-, or rip1-/- cells infected with rip1 or rip1D138N retrovirus were plated at 3 × 104 cells/well on 24-well plates. The cells were left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 20 h. The supernatants were collected, and the levels of IL-6 produced from each cell line were assayed by an OptEIA mouse IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BD Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For all transfection studies, 293T cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/plate on 6-well plates. The transfected cells were lysed in 0.2 ml E1A buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA), immunoprecipitated with α-RIP Ab (BD Biosciences), and immunoblotted with α-HA Ab. Expression of transfected constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting with an α-HA Ab. Rip1 proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an α-RIP1 antibody. To determine whether Rip1 ubiquitination occurs at the Tnfr1, wild type cells or cells expressing kinase-inactive Rip1 were left untreated or treated with mTNF-α for the time periods indicated. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of endogenous lysis buffer (0.5 m Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaF, and 0.5 m sodium pyrophosphate) supplemented with a protease mixture inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), immunoprecipitated with α-TNFR1 antibody, and then immunoblotted with α-RIP1, α-TAK1, or α-TRAF2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In other experiments, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and immunoprecipitated with α-RIP Ab, and ubiquitinated Rip1 proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Boston Biochem). To determine p38-α-MAP kinase activity, 40 μg of total protein was immunoblotted with an α-phosphop38 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). To determine the relative expression levels of p38-α MAP kinase or Ikk, wild type rip1-/- or rip1-/- infected with rip1 or rip1D138N retroviruses were lysed, and 30 μg of total protein was immunoblotted with α-p38α Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with α-IKK-α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell Viability Assays—Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were plated overnight on 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were then treated with 10 ng/ml mTNF and 250 ng/ml cycloheximide for 20 h. Cells were then collected and assayed either for cell viability by trypan blue staining or for cell death by annexin V/phosphatidylinositol staining on triplicate cultures. Death Domain Kinase Rip1 Is Phosphorylated and Ubiquitinated on Tnfr1 Activation—Although biochemical and genetic studies have implicated the Rip1 kinase in TNF-α signaling (4Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B.

Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which Rip1 mediates the NFκB or p38 MAP kinase responses to TNF remain unclear. Both phosphorylation and, more recently, ubiquitination have been implicated in the activation of the IKK complex. To elucidate the role of Rip1 in the initiation of these pathways, wild type and rip1-deficient MEFs were left unstimulated or treated with TNF-α for 2, 5, and 10 min, and Rip1 protein was detected by immunoblotting. In the wild type MEF cells, we observed the presence of two forms of Rip1. On TNF-α stimulation, we observed induction of a slower, migrating form of Rip1. The presence of this form was abolished when the cell lysates were treated with λ-phosphatase, consistent with the idea that Tnfr1 activation stimulates Rip1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B). The kinetics of Rip1 phosphorylation with induction at 5 min after TNF-α stimulation suggest this is an early event in the TNF-α response and may function to initiate signaling. To examine whether Rip1 undergoes autophosphorylation or is phosphorylated by another kinase, we infected rip1-/- MEFs with a kinase-inactive version of Rip1 (Rip1D138N) or with MSCV2.2-IRES-GFP retroviral vector alone (not shown). Cells expressing kinase-inactive Rip1 failed to undergo TNF-α-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 1A), revealing that Tnfr1 activation stimulates Rip1 autophosphorylation. In addition to phosphorylation and similar to published studies (15Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 16Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D.

Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), the Rip1 kinase is polyubiquitinated when cells are stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 1C). Moreover, Rip1 ubiquitination in response to TNF-α is inhibited by agents such as methyl-β-cyclodextrin that disrupt lipid rafts (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Rip1 ubiquitination occurs once the activated Tnfr1 is recruited into lipid rafts. Kinase Activity of Rip1 Does Not Contribute to TNF-α-induced Ikk or p38 MAP Kinase Activation or TNF-α-induced IL-6 Production—The death domain kinase Rip1 undergoes two types of posttranslational modifications in response to TNF-α, but the precise functions of phosphorylated or ubiquitinated Rip1 in TNF signaling are unclear. We have previously demonstrated that TNF-α-induced Ikk and p38 MAP kinase activation are both impaired in rip1-deficient MEFs (12Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 14Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of the kinase activity of Rip1 in TNF-α-induced Ikk and p38 MAP kinase activation, we infected rip1-/- MEFs with MSCV2.2-IRES-GFP retroviruses that express wild type rip1, a kinase-inactive rip1D138N, or with the MSCV2.2-IRES-GFP retroviral vector alone. Cell lysates were prepared from wild type MEFs and from the infected rip1-/- MEFs, and the Rip1 protein expression levels were compared. Importantly, rip1-/- MEFs reconstituted with wild type rip1 or kinase-inactive rip1 expressed levels of Rip1 protein similar to those of wild type MEFs (Fig. 2), demonstrating that Rip1 overexpression and oligomerization are not induced in the infected cells. Wild type, rip1-/-, and rip1-/- MEFs infected with vector alone, wild type rip1, or with the rip1D138N retrovirus were left untreated or were treated with mTNF-α for 10, 30, and 60 min. To measure TNF-α-induced Ikk activation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα antibody, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed using glutathione S-transferase-IκB as the substrate. TNF-α-induced Ikk activation was not observed in cells lacking Rip1 (Fig. 2 and see Ref. 12Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), and TNF-induced NFκB activity was restored in rip1-/- cells reconstituted with wild type Rip1 or with a kinase-inactive version of Rip1 (Fig. 2A). To measure TNF-α-induced p38 MAP kinase activity, cell lysates were probed with a phospho-specific p38 MAP kinase antibody. TNF-α-induced p38 MAP kinase activation was not observed in rip1-/- MEFs (as described in Ref. 14Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, TNF-induced p38 MAP kinase activity was observed in TNF-α-treated wild type MEFs and in rip1-/- MEFs infected with the rip1 retrovirus (Fig. 2B, rip1-/-(rip1)) as well as the MEFs expressing the kinase-inactive version of Rip1. The NFκB and p38 MAP kinase pathways have been implicated in stress-induced cytokine production (18Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 19Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar), and TNF-α-induced IL-6 production is impaired in Rip1-deficient cells (14Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S.

To test whether the kinase activity of Rip1 contributes to TNF-α-induced cytokine production, we examined IL-6 production in response to TNF-α in the rip1-/-(D138N) cells. Treatment of wild type cells with TNF-α resulted in increased production of IL-6, whereas little or no TNF-α-induced IL-6 production was observed in rip1-/- cells (Fig. 2C and see Ref. 14Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TNF-α-induced IL-6 production was restored in the rip1-/- MEFs infected with wild type rip1 or rip1D138N retroviruses (Fig. 2C). Although the rip1-/-(D138N) cells exhibit a higher background of IL-6 production, a 4-5-fold increase in IL-6 production was observed when wild type MEFs or the rip1D138N-infected MEFs were treated with TNF-α. Consistent with the p38 MAP kinase and NFκB responses to TNF observed in rip1D138N cells, these experiments suggest that the Rip1 kinase activity does not contribute to TNF-α-induced p38 MAP kinase or Ikk activation. Kinase Activity of Rip1 Does Not Contribute to the Antiapoptotic Response to TNF-α—Previous transfection studies implicated the kinase activity of Rip1 in apoptosis and FasL-induced necrosis (11Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 20Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). To examine whether the Rip1 kinase regulates programmed cell death in mammalian cells, we treated wild type and rip1-/- MEFs with TNF-α and cycloheximide and quantitated the apoptotic cells. As expected, a rip1 deficiency sensitizes cells to TNF-α-induced cell death, consistent with the impaired NFκB response (Fig. 3B and see Ref. 12Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). The reintroduction of rip1 into these cells is nearly completely protective, which provides survival to 70% of the cells and correlates with the fact that 72.8% of the cells are GFP-positive and express Rip1 (Fig. 3A). Cells expressing a kinase-inactive Rip1 remain resistant to TNF-α-induced cell death, presumably because of activation of NFκB, indicating that kinase activity of Rip1 does not contribute to the antiapoptotic response to TNF-α (Fig. 2A). Rip1 Phosphorylation Is Not Required for Its Ubiquitination—In the TNF-α-induced ubiquitination of the inhibitor IκBα, phosphorylation stimulates recognition by the β-transducin repeat-containing protein/Skp1-Cul-F-box complex (21Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). To test whether Rip1 phosphorylation targets the protein for ubiquitination, cells were left untreated or stimulated with TNF-α for 30 or 60 min and immunoprecipitated with an α-RIP antibody, and then ubiquitinated Rip1 proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 4). Ubiquitinated Rip1 was induced by TNF-α stimulation, and polyubiquitinated Rip1 was also detected in cells expressing a kinase-inactive Rip1D138N only (Fig. 4). TNF-α-induced ubiquitination of Rip1 and Rip1D138N was inhibited when the cells were pretreated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, indicating that Rip1 ubiquitination may occur within lipid rafts (Fig. 4). Thus, consistent with the signaling data (Fig. 2), kinase-inactive Rip1 is polyubiquitinated in response to TNF-α, revealing that Rip1 phosphorylation is not required for TNF-α-induced ubiquitination. The previous experiments suggested that the ubiquitination of kinase-inactive Rip1D138N may be delayed in response to TNF-α, indicating that kinase-inactive Rip1D138N may be impaired in its ability to be recruited to the Tnfr1. To test this possibility, wild type and kinase-inactive Rip1D138N cells were treated with TNF-α, immunoprecipitated with an anti-TNFR1 Ab and then immunoblotted with an anti-RIP1 antibody. We observed a transient polyubiquitination of Rip at 10 min, co-incident with the activation of TNF-α-induced signaling (Fig. 5); however, Rip1 ubiquitination is transient, because polyubiquitinated Rip1 was not detected at the Tnfr1 at longer time points. Consistent with the signaling data (Fig. 2), Rip1 ubiquitination was also observed in TNF-α-treated cells expressing a kinase-inactive Rip1D138N (Fig. 5), indicating that the kinase-inactive Rip1 is recruited to the Tnfr1 and undergoes ubiquitination in response to TNF-α. Like IκB proteins, Rip1 is phosphorylated in response to TNF-α, but Rip1 phosphorylation is not required for its ubiquitination at the Tnfr1. Traf2 Ubiquitinates Rip1 at the Tnfr1—Although Rip1 ubiquitination has been observed by others (15Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C.

Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), the role of Rip1 phosphorylation in its ubiquitination has not been addressed, nor has the E3 ubiquitin ligase for Rip1 been identified. Both Traf2 and Traf6 have been shown to act as E3 ubiquitin ligases and to undergo autoubiquitination through Lys-63-ubiquitin conjugations (7Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 8Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNF-α has been shown to stimulate Traf2 polyubiquitination and oligomerization (22Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15429-15434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To obtain genetic evidence that Traf proteins ubiquitinate Rip1 in response to TNF-α, we examined Rip1 ubiquitination in traf2-/- and traf2-/-/traf5-/- MEFs. Three independent traf2-deficient cell lines were left untreated or stimulated with mTNF for 10 or 20 min, and the Tnfr1-associated signaling proteins were immunoprecipitated with an α-TNFR1 antibody. Immunoblotting with α-RIP antibody detected polyubiquitinated Rip1 in wild type MEFs treated with TNF-α for 10 min. By contrast, polyubiquitinated Rip1 was not detected in traf2-/- or in traf2-/-/traf5-/- cells treated with TNF-α (Fig. 6A). To demonstrate more directly that polyubiquitinated Rip1 is not detected in Traf2-deficient cells, we stimulated wild type and traf2-/- or traf2-/-/traf5-/- cells with TNF-α and immunoprecipitated the samples with the α-RIP antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. Polyubiquitinated Rip1 protein was readily detected in TNF-α-stimulated wild type cells but not in TNF-α-treated traf2-/- or traf2-/-/traf5-/- cells (Fig. 6, B and C). Taken together, these data suggest that Traf2 may be the E3 ubiquitin ligase that initiates TNF-α signaling, potentially by ubiquitinating Rip1. In the Absence of Rip1 a Ubiquitinated Tak1 Complex Is Not Recruited to the Tnfr1—These studies failed to reveal a role for the Rip1 kinase in TNF-α signaling, but they suggest that ubiquitinated Rip1 may recruit other ubiquitinated proteins (kinases) capable of activating the Ikk complex or Mkk-6. To test whether ubiquitinated Rip1 recruits the Tak1 kinase complex, known to be activated by ubiquitination, to the Tnfr1 (8Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), we treated wild type cells and rip1-/- cells with TNF-α for 5, 10, and 20 min and immunoprecipitated the Tnfr1-associated proteins. We observed the recruitment of a ubiquitinated Tak1 complex in wild type cells stimulated with TNF-α for 5 min (Fig. 7A). In contrast, in the absence of Rip1, TNF-α stimulation failed to induce recruitment of the Tak1 complex (Fig. 7A), suggesting that Rip1 and potentially ubiquitinated Rip1 are required for Tak1 recruitment to the Tnfr1. Traf2 recruitment, however, is unaffected by an absence of Rip1 and is readily recruited to the Tnfr1 when rip1-/- MEFs are stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 7B). We demonstrate that the death domain kinase Rip1 undergoes autophosphorylation and ubiquitination as early as 2-5 min after TNF-α stimulation. Rip1 autophosphorylation occurs within the cytoplasm and appears to precede Rip1 ubiquitination at the Tnfr1. These inducible, posttranslational modifications are reminiscent of those observed for IκBα and suggest that Rip1 autophosphorylation may trigger its ubiquitination; however, cells that express a kinase-inactive Rip1 undergo TNF-α-induced ubiquitination and respond normally to TNF-α. These data indicate that Rip1 autophosphorylation is not required for its recruitment to the activated Tnfr1 or for its ubiquitination in lipid rafts. Rip1 is required for the recruitment of a ubiquitinated Tak1 complex to the activated Tnfr1. Taken together, these studies suggest that Rip1 ubiquitination rather than its phosphorylation leads to Ikk and Mkk-6 activation. We provide genetic evidence that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf2 may be responsible for the ubiquitination of Rip1. Rip1 ubiquitination in response to TNF-α is not observed in cells lacking Traf2 or Traf 5 proteins. Although both proteins contain RING fingers, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity has been demonstrated only for Traf2 and Traf6 (8Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 22Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15429-15434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Traf2 may regulate TNF-α signaling by ubiquitinating Rip1 and potentially other members of the Tnfr1 pathway. TNF-α-induced ubiquitination of Rip1 is transient, suggesting that Rip1 ubiquitination may be regulated by de-ubiquitinating enzymes such as Cyld (23Trompouki E. Hatzivassiliou E. Tsichritzis T. Farmer H. Ashworth A. Mosialos G. Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 24Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G. Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Cyld overexpression can block NFκB activation induced by Rip1 or Traf2 overexpression (24Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G. Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), suggesting that polyubiquitinated Rip1 may be a Cyld substrate in vivo. Although Rip1 autophosphorylation is induced on TNF stimulation and the Rip1 serine/threonine kinase is recruited to the Tnfr1 on ligand binding, the kinase activity of Rip1 does not appear to participate in TNF-α signaling, nor is it required for down-regulation or termination of the TNF-α responses. Cells expressing a kinase-inactive Rip1 respond normally to TNF-α and terminate the NFκB and p38 MAP kinase responses with kinetics similar to TNF-α-stimulated wild type cells. These data indicate that the kinase activity of Rip1 does not regulate the TNF-α pathway but may mediate signals from other receptor pathways. Recently, Rip1 has been implicated in the Trif-dependent, Toll-like receptor-3 antiviral response (25Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the kinase activity of Rip1 may mediate Toll-like receptor-3 signals."

The name derives from the relationship of SUMO to the better characterized post-translational modifier ubiquitin (4Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). They are 18% identical at the amino acid level and show a clear similarity in their respective three-dimensional structures (5Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Whereas yeast and nematodes have a single SUMO gene, in humans and mice, the SUMO family consists of three members, SUMO-1, -2, and -3, which are encoded by separate genes. The mature forms of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are similar (∼95% identical), but less closely related to SUMO-1 (∼50% identical) (6Lapenta V. Chiurazzi P. van der Spek P. Pizzuti A. Hanaoka F. Brahe C.

Despite their close similarity, there is evidence that SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 are preferentially conjugated to distinct sets of target proteins. Whereas RanGAP1 is modified by SUMO-1, many as yet unidentified proteins are modified by SUMO-2/3 after exposure of cells to various stress stimuli (7Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Several groups independently identified SUMO-1, which is also known as PIC1, GMP1, SMT3C, UBL1, and sentrin (9Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to most polyubiquitinylated proteins, sumoylated proteins are not thereby targeted for degradation. SUMO-1 can even compete with ubiquitin for the same acceptor lysine in the target protein. In the case of IκBα, SUMO modification serves to protect the protein from ubiquitin-mediated degradation (14Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), whereas in yeast, DNA repair can proceed only after proliferating cell nuclear antigen is desumoylated to allow ubiquitination. Here, ubiquitination does not target the protein for degradation, but functions as a switch to activate the DNA repair function of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (15Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Therefore, despite their structural relationship, it appears that SUMO and ubiquitin conjugation can play distinct roles in modulating target proteins. Sumoylation can also regulate the subcellular localization of target proteins. For example, SUMO conjugation is required for both the nuclear pore and kinetochore localization of RanGAP1 (16Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 17Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 18Joseph J.

Cell. 2002; 10: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, sumoylation is analogous to ubiquitination because it involves a set of enzymes known as E1, E2, and E3, which act sequentially to conjugate SUMO to an internal lysine residue located within a conserved motif in target proteins (1Hay R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. J. Cell.

The human SUMO E1 enzyme comprises a heterodimer of the SAE1 and SAE2 proteins and forms a thioester bond with Gly97 of SUMO-1 (22Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 23Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Subsequently, SUMO-1 is transferred by trans-esterification to the SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9 (26Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 37: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 28Gong L.

Ubc9 can directly conjugate the C-terminal glycine of SUMO to the ϵ-amino group of lysines in target proteins that are situated in the consensus motif ΨKX(E/D), where Ψ stands for Val, Leu, Ile, Met, or Phe and X stands for any amino acid (14Desterro J.M.

Recognition of target protein substrates by Ubc9 involves a group of residues, adjacent to the active-site Cys93, that position the sumoylation motif for catalysis (31Tatham M.H. Chen Y. Hay R.T.

Therefore, SUMO conjugation does not have an absolute requirement for a SUMO E3 ligase in vitro (23Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Most recently, Xenopus topoisomerase II was shown to be a substrate for SUMO-2 specifically during M phase, thereby affecting the interaction of topoisomerase II with chromatin (63Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Here, we report on a set of novel endogenous target proteins for SUMO-2, identified using proteomics coupled with an affinity selection strategy based on a stable cell line expressing low levels of His6-SUMO-2. Plasmids Constructs and Antibodies—The cDNA for SUMO-2 was amplified by PCR using expressed sequence tag AI814334 (Medical Research Council Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research) and specific primers with BamHI and Asp718 restriction sites on the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The amplified fragment was subsequently inserted into the BamHI and Asp718 sites of pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). The previously published plasmid pcDNA3-HA-SUMO-2 (59Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) was used to obtain a BamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding SUMO-2. This DNA fragment was cloned into similar sites of the pcDNA3-His6 vector (56Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) to generate the pcDNA3-His6-SUMO-2 construct. This vector was digested with HindIII, blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase, and finally digested with EcoRI. The corresponding DNA fragment encoding His6-SUMO-2 was subcloned into the EcoRV and EcoRI sites of the pIRES-puro2 vector (Clontech). The cDNA for SART1 was amplified by PCR using expressed sequence tag BG257275 (Medical Research Council Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research) and specific extended primers compatible with the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The amplified fragment was subsequently inserted into pDON207, and EYFP-SART1 and T7-SART1 expression constructs were obtained using standard Gateway methods. Peptide antibody 2277 against SUMO-2 was generated in rabbit using the sequence MEDEDTIDVFQQQTG (Eurogentec). Both serum and affinity-purified antibody were used. Polyclonal antibody NRD.1 raised against full-length SUMO-2 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). A previously published polyclonal antibody against SUMO-2 (7Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), generously provided by Dr. H. Saitoh (Picower Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York), was used during initial studies. Note that the anti-SUMO-2 antibodies also recognize SUMO-3 because these SUMO family members are nearly identical. Other antibodies used were anti-PML monoclonal antibody 5E10 (a generous gift from Dr. R. van Driel, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), anti-hnRNP M monoclonal antibody D2-1F7 (a generous gift from Dr. J.-P. Fuchs (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France), anti-His5 monoclonal antibody (which recognizes 5 consecutive histidines, Novagen), and anti-green fluorescent protein monoclonal antibody 1814460 (which recognizes EYFP, Roche Applied Science). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were carried out using 2 μg of plasmid construct/100-mm dish and Effectene (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The stable HeLaEYFP-SUMO-2 cell line was selected by growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with G418 at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The stable HeLaHis6-SUMO-2 cell line was obtained by transfecting HeLa cells with 15 μg of pIRESpuro2-His6-SUMO-2 plasmid using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Selection was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with puromycin at a final concentration of 5 μm. For all stable cell lines, colonies were subcloned and then expanded for characterization. Microscopy and Image Analysis—Cells were grown on glass cover-slips and fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C in 60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.9) (64Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andrews P.D. Wickramasinghe S. Sleeman J. Prescott A. Lam Y.W. Lyon C. Swedlow J.R. Lamond A.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Subsequent manipulations were carried out at room temperature. Permeabilization was carried out for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum for 30 min if required and then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, washed, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma) at 0.3 μg/ml. After washing, cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Antibody 2277 (1:2000), antibody 5E10 (1:10) and anti-His5 antibody (1:50) were the primary antibodies used. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-, TRITC-, and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:350; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used. Three-dimensional images and sections were recorded on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 2TV Delta-Vision Restoration microscope (Applied Precision) using a Zeiss Planachromat (100 × 1.40 nuclear aperture objective) and a CCD-1300-Y/HS camera (Roper Scientific). Images were captured and processed by constrained iterative deconvolution using SoftWorx (Applied Precision). Images presented here are maximal intensity projections of Z stacks. Purification of SUMO-2 Conjugates—Proteins conjugated to His6-SUMO-2 were purified using a previously published method to enrich for nuclear bodies and RNA (65He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). 108 HeLa cells (either HeLaHis6-SUMO-2 or control parental HeLa) were isolated by trypsinization and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclei were isolated and washed with cytoskeletal extraction buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Subsequently, nuclei were digested with DNase I (Worthington) in buffer containing 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Chromatin was extracted using buffers containing 250 mm (NH4)2SO4 and 1 m NaCl or 2 m NaCl plus 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 150 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. All steps were performed at 4 °C, and buffers contained EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, extracted fractions were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 8 m urea, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture. His6-SUMO-2 conjugates were enriched on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (QIAGEN Inc.). Beads were successively washed at room temperature with 10 column volumes of first lysis buffer, then buffer A (8 m urea, 100 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.3), 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), then buffer A lacking Triton X-100, then lysis buffer plus 0.1% Triton X-100, and finally buffer A lacking Triton X-100. Conjugates were eluted at room temperature in 0.2 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. For experiments carried out to confirm the presence of hnRNP M and SART1 in the His6-SUMO-2-enriched fraction, cytoskeletal extraction buffer-isolated nuclei were lysed in lysis buffer and sonicated prior to the pull-down of His6-SUMO-2 conjugates. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were size-fractionated on Novex 4–12% BisTris gradient gels using MOPS buffer (Invitrogen) and subsequently transferred onto Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a submarine system (Invitrogen). Blots were stained for total protein using Ponceau S (Sigma). After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk powder, the membranes were incubated with anti-SUMO-2 antibody (1:1000), antibody 5E10 (1:100), antibody D2-1F7 (1:5000), or antibody 1814460 (1:1000). Anti-His5 antibody was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit (1:2000) and anti-mouse (1:5000) horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Pierce). Bound antibodies were detected via chemiluminescence with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometry—Both isolated SUMO conjugates and control samples (200-μl total volume) were reduced in lysis buffer lacking Triton X-100 by addition of 0.5 μg of dithiothreitol, alkylated by addition of 2 μg of iodoacetamide, and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C for 4 h and with trypsin for 8 h after dilution with 50 mm NH4HCO4 (pH 8.0). The resulting peptide mixtures were acidified by A-buffer (0.5% acetic acid and 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid) and desalted and concentrated using precolumns packed with poros R2 and oligo R3 reverse-phase material. The partially lyophilized eluate was reconstituted in A-buffer and pressure-loaded onto a pulled fused silica capillary with a 100-μm inner diameter and an 8-μm tip opening (New Objective) filled with Vydac 218MSB3 3-μm reverse-phase material. Peptides were eluted directly into a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex) with a 90-min linear gradient of 5–60% buffer B containing 80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, and 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid at a flow rate of 200 μl/min from a cross-flow splitter connected to an HPLC system (Agilent) and a high voltage power supply. Mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry measurements were acquired automatically for 1 and 1.5 s, respectively. Precursor ions were dynamically excluded for 60 s. Scripts in Analyst created a peak list on the basis of the acquired product ion spectra. A combined pea"

However, the precise role of Msx2 during osteoblast differentiation is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of Msx2 in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation in the multipotent mesenchymal cell lines C3H10T1/2 and C2C12 and in murine primary osteoblasts. Introduction of Msx2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity in C3H10T1/2 and C2C12 cells and promoted the calcification of murine primary osteoblasts. This effect of Msx2 was also observed in mesenchymal cells isolated from Runx2-deficient mice. Interestingly the expression of Msx2 was induced by bone morphogenetic protein 2 treatment in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. In contrast, Msx2 diminished peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression and adipogenesis of the preadipocytic cell line 3T3-F442A. Moreover Msx2 inhibited the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and C/EBPδ and blocked adipocyte differentiation of mesenchymal cells induced by overexpression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ. These data indicate that Msx2 promotes osteoblast differentiation independently of Runx2 and negatively regulates adipocyte differentiation through inhibition of PPARγ and the C/EBP family.

Differentiation and function of osteoblasts, which play an essential role in bone formation, are regulated by various hormones and cytokines, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PPRE, PPARγ binding element; TK, thymidine kinase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PPRE, PPARγ binding element; TK, thymidine kinase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. fibroblast growth factors, and the Wnt family (1Yamaguchi A.

However, the molecular events that regulate the process of osteoblast differentiation have not been fully clarified. Msx2, a homeobox gene, is a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila muscle segment homeobox. Msx2 is known to be induced by BMPs, which play critical roles in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation (2Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Msx2-deficient mice develop reduced bone formation, decreases in osteoblasts, impaired chondrogenesis, abnormal calvarial development, and defects in the ectodermal organs including the teeth, hair, and mammary glands (6Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic mice overexpressing Msx2 show enhanced growth of calvariae (7Liu Y.H. Kundu R. Wu L. Luo W. Ignelzi Jr., M.A. Snead M.L. Maxson Jr., R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to these genetic studies, in vitro studies have shown that Msx2 negatively regulates the transcription of the osteoblast-specific genes such as osteocalcin (12Towler D.A. Rutledge S.J. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1484-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Ryoo H.M. Hoffmann H.M. Beumer T. Frenkel B. Towler D.A. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1681-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore Msx2 has been shown to bind to Runx2 and inhibit its transcriptional activity (14Shirakabe K. Terasawa K. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These studies provide the notion that Msx2 serves as a negative regulator for osteoblast differentiation. To understand the complex role of Msx2 in osteoblast differentiation, we examined the effects of Msx2 on osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells. We found that Msx2 promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into the osteoblast lineage in a Runx2-independent fashion. In addition, we showed that Msx2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and the C/EBP family, thereby suppressing adipocyte differentiation of mesenchymal cells. Thus, our data provide the evidence that Msx2 is an important transcriptional regulator for the commitment of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and adipocytes. Cells and Reagents—C3H10T1/2, C2C12, and CHO-K1 cell lines were purchased from RIKEN cell bank and cultured in α-modified minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The 3T3-F442A cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Minoru Morikawa. Anti-Msx2, anti-PPARγ, and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Recombinant BMP2 was obtained from the conditioned medium of CHO-K1 cells infected with BMP2 adenovirus. The activity of BMP2 was determined by comparison with human recombinant BMP2. Isolation of Primary Osteoblasts and Mesenchymal Cells—The calvariae were isolated from 2- or 3-day neonatal mice and digested with 0.1% collagenase and 0.2% dispase for 7 min at 37 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and used as the primary mesenchymal cells. These cells contained a small amount of ALP-positive cells. The digested calvariae were sequentially digested four times with 0.1% collagenase and 0.2% dispase for 7 min at 37 °C. The last three groups of fractionated cells were collected and used as the primary osteoblasts. The cells showed ALP activity. Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells were isolated from the calvariae of Runx2-deficient embryos as described previously (15Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y.

In brief, the anterior region of calvariae from an embryo at embryonic day 18.5 was minced and cultured for 10–14 days in three-dimensional collagen gel (Cellmatrix, Nitta Gelatin Co.) with α-modified minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells outgrowing from the explants were retrieved by incubation for 30 min with 0.2% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industry, Osaka, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C and then cultured with α-modified minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Constructs and Transfection—Msx2 cDNA was isolated from BMP2-treated C2C12 cells by reverse transcribed PCR. The sequence of the cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, and then the cDNA was subcloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) tagged with Myc epitope at the N terminus. A mutant of Msx2 was generated by replacing arginine 172 by histidine using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The sequence of the mutant cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. PPARγ cDNA (16Tontonoz P. Singer S. Forman B.M. Sarraf P. Fletcher J.A. Fletcher C.D. Brun R.P. Mueller E. Altiok S.

PPARγ promoter fused to a luciferase construct was used as described previously (19Shi X. Shi W. Li Q. Song B. Wan M. Bai S. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transfection of C3H10T1/2 cells was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol (17Hata K. Nishimura R. Ikeda F. Yamashita K. Matsubara T. Nokubi T. Yoneda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Generation of Adenovirus—Recombinant adenoviruses carrying a wild-type or a mutant form of Msx2, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ were constructed by homologous recombination between the expression cosmid cassette (pAxCAwt) and the parental virus genome in 293 cells (RIKEN) as described previously (17Hata K. Nishimura R. Ikeda F. Yamashita K. Matsubara T. Nokubi T. Yoneda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) using an adenovirus construction kit (Takara). The adenovirus carrying Runx2 or PPARγ was used as described previously (17Hata K. Nishimura R. Ikeda F. Yamashita K. Matsubara T. Nokubi T. Yoneda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Nishimura R. Hata K. Harris S.E. Ikeda F. Yoneda T. Bone. 2002; 31: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The viruses showed no proliferative activity due to a lack of E1A-E1B (21Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Titers of the viruses were determined using a modified point assay (21Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Infection of recombinant adenoviruses with C3H10T1/2 cells, C2C12 cells, 3T3-F442A cells, primary osteoblasts, or mesenchymal cells was performed by incubation with adenovirus at 40 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) except where specifically indicated. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate) (22Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g and incubated with antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants were recovered as immunoprecipitate samples. These samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotted with corresponding antibodies, and visualized with horseradish peroxidase coupled to protein A (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) or horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Cappel) with enhancement by ECL detection kits (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—Cultured cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After a 20-min incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, the cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS for 2 h, incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody in 1% BSA in PBS, then washed six times with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated affinity purified anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). The cells were washed extensively with PBS and visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Luciferase Assay—PPRE-luciferase construct or PPARγ promoter construct was co-transfected with TK-Renilla luciferase construct (Promega) into C3H10T1/2 cells. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using specific substrates in a luminometer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was normalized by determining the activity of Renilla luciferase. Reverse Transcribed PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase (Wako Pure Chemical Industry) for 30 min. After denaturation of total RNA at 70 °C for 10 min, cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplifications were performed using the specific primers for mouse Msx2 (sense primer, 5′-TGAGGAAACACAAGACCAA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTCTATGGAAGGGGTAGGAT-3′). PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. After the PCR products were subcloned into TA cloning vector, the DNA sequences of the PCR products were determined. Determination of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—ALP activity was determined as described previously (22Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 or C2C12 cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 0.05% Triton X-100 solution. The ALP activity of the lysates was determined using p-nitrophenol phosphate as a substrate. The protein content of each lysate was measured using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). For cytochemical analysis, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and stained with a mixture of 330 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 165 μg/ml bromochloroindolyl phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris (pH 9.5). Alizarin Red Staining—The cultured calvaria cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and stained with 1% alizarin red solution for 5 min. Oil Red-O Staining—C3H10T1/2 or 3T3-F442A cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 20 min. After washing the cells twice with PBS and once with 60% isopropyl alcohol, the cells were stained with Oil Red-O solution (Sigma). The area of the cells stained with Oil Red-O was measured using an Image Pro Plus analyzer (Palmerton Inc.) (17Hata K. Nishimura R. Ikeda F. Yamashita K. Matsubara T. Nokubi T. Yoneda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Pull-down Assay—The nuclear extracts isolated from C3H10T1/2 cells were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated double-stranded PPRE oligonucleotide probe (sense primer, 5′-TCGATCCCGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCCCCTC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TCGAGAGGGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCGGGA-3′) and 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 4 h (20Nishimura R. Hata K. Harris S.E. Ikeda F. Yoneda T. Bone. 2002; 31: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). DNA-associated proteins were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads for 1 h, washed with the lysis buffer, and determined by immunoblotting with anti-PPARγ antibody. Statistical Analysis—All data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by a paired t test. Data represent mean ± S.D. Induction of Msx2 during Osteoblast Differentiation—To examine whether Msx2 is involved in the osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells, we first determined the expression of Msx2 using a multipotent mesenchymal cell line, C3H10T1/2, which differentiates into osteoblast cells upon stimulation with BMP2 (23Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 cells did not express Msx2 in an undifferentiated condition (Fig. 1A). However, when treated with BMP2, the cells showed distinct expression of Msx2 (Fig. 1A) along with the induction of ALP activity (Fig. 1B) (23Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Msx2 expression is associated with osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells and suggest the involvement of Msx2 in osteoblast differentiation. Induction of Osteoblast Differentiation of Mesenchymal Cells by Msx2—To examine the potential role of Msx2 in osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells, we introduced Msx2 into C3H10T1/2 cells using an adenovirus system. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, Msx2 is efficiently expressed in C3H10T1/2 cells upon infection with Msx2 adenovirus. Since Msx2 has been implicated in the proliferation of osteoblast precursor cells (6Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), we therefore determined the effect of Msx2 on the growth of C3H10T1/2 cells. We observed that the introduction of Msx2 marginally stimulated the proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that Msx2 is involved not only in the proliferation stage but also in the differentiation process during osteogenesis. To confirm this hypothesis, we next determined the effect of Msx2 on the osteoblast differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Introduction of Msx2 clearly induced ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 2, A, B, and C). This effect of Msx2 was also observed in a mesenchymal cell line, C2C12 (Fig. 2D), which possesses the capacity to differentiate into osteoblastic cells with BMP2 treatment (22Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Notably introduction of Msx2 increased ALP activity and calcification in primary osteoblasts isolated from mouse calvariae (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that Msx2 plays an important role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. To further understand the osteogenic activity of Msx2, we evaluated its effects on BMP2-induced calcification using a point mutant of Msx2 at arginine 172 that has less DNA binding activity and causes enlarged parietal foramina characterized by retarded or deficient ossification in humans (8Wilkie A.O. Tang Z. Elanko N. Walsh S. Twigg S.R. Hurst J.A. Wall S.A. Chrzanowska K.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the R172H mutant was introduced into the primary osteoblasts using an adenovirus system (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous reports (24Hirata K. Tsukazaki T. Kadowaki A. Furukawa K. Shibata Y. Moriishi T. Okubo Y. Bessho K. Komori T. Mizuno A. Yamaguchi A. Bone. 2003; 32: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), BMP2 induced calcification of primary mouse osteoblasts (Fig. 3B). Introduction of the mutant Msx2 markedly inhibited the activity of BMP2 in primary mouse osteoblasts (Fig. 3B). The mutant also blocked BMP2-induced ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 3C) but had no effect on proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1E). The data suggest that Msx2 plays a role in BMP2-regulated osteogenesis. Runx2-independent Regulation of Expression and Function of Msx2—Msx2 has been shown to physically associate with Runx2 and suppress its transcriptional activity (14Shirakabe K. Terasawa K. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and thus we examined whether Msx2 affects the osteogenic activity of Runx2. As we reported previously (20Nishimura R. Hata K. Harris S.E. Ikeda F. Yoneda T. Bone. 2002; 31: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), overexpression of Runx2 promoted the osteoblast differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Msx2 additively increased ALP activity in the presence of Runx2 (Fig. 2, B and C). The data indicate that Msx2 does not affect the osteogenic action of Runx2 and raises the possibility that Msx2 regulates osteoblast differentiation independently of Runx2. To address this issue, we examined the expression and function of Msx2 in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells that had been isolated from Runx2-deficient mice. Interestingly BMP2 clearly induced ALP activity in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells (Fig. 4A), although the induction of ALP activity by BMP2 treatment in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells was weaker than that of wild-type mesenchymal cells. These data suggest that another transcription factor(s) is involved in induction of ALP activity in Runx2-deficient cells. Treatment with BMP2 induced Msx2 expression in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells (Fig. 4B). However, we observed that overexpression of Runx2 did not induce Msx2 expression (data not shown). Furthermore Msx2 overexpression induced ALP activity in these cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2, B and C, infection of Msx2 had an additive but not synergistic effect on ALP activity in the presence of Runx2; this expression level was equivalent to that in wild-type calvaria osteoblasts in Runx2-deficient cells (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, Msx2 failed to induce Runx2 expression in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 4E). Collectively these results indicate that the expression and function of Msx2 is regulated in a Runx2-independent fashion. Msx2 Inhibited Adipocyte Differentiation of Mesenchymal Cells by Suppressing PPARγ,C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ—Since adipocytes share their origin with osteoblasts (25Prockop D.J. Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar, 26Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17647) Google Scholar) and the number of adipocytes appears to increase in the bone marrow of Msx2-deficient mice (6Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), we examined whether Msx2 is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. To address the issue, we examined the effect of Msx2 on adipocyte differentiation using a preadipocytic cell line, 3T3-F442A (27Morikawa M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of Msx2 profoundly suppressed the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells. Consistent with these results, Msx2 abolished the expression of PPARγ in 3T3-F442A cells (Fig. 5B). We next asked whether Msx2 is involved in the commitment of osteoblasts and adipocytes and tested the effects of Msx2 on C3H10T1/2 cells, which are able to differentiate into both osteoblastic and adipocytic cells in the presence of BMP2 (23Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As we and others have reported (17Hata K. Nishimura R. Ikeda F. Yamashita K. Matsubara T. Nokubi T. Yoneda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), BMP2 promoted the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells toward osteoblastic and adipocytic cells (Fig. 5, C and D), thus allowing us to determine the balance of osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis under this condition. The introduction of Msx2 enhanced BMP2-induced osteoblastogenesis but markedly inhibited BMP2-induced adipogenesis (Fig. 5, C and D). This result suggests that Msx2 plays a role in the commitment of mesenchymal cells. A nuclear receptor, PPARγ, plays a central role in adipogenesis (28Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Likewise we have recently demonstrated that the functional regulation of PPARγ is critical for BMP2-regulated adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells (17Hata K. Nishimura R. Ikeda F. Yamashita K. Matsubara T. Nokubi T. Yoneda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms by which Msx2 inhibits adipocyte differentiation, we examined the effect of Msx2 on the function of PPARγ. Overexpression of PPARγ using an adenovirus system induced adipocyte differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 6, A, B, and C). Msx2 inhibited the adipogenic effect of PPARγ (Fig. 6, B and C). Consistent with these results, Msx2 suppressed the transcriptional activity of PPARγ (Fig. 6D). To determine whether Msx2 affects the DNA binding capacity of PPARγ, we performed an oligonucleotide pull-down assay using a biotinylated probe containing the PPRE. We found that Msx2 interfered with the binding of PPARγ to PPRE (Fig. 6E). These data strongly suggest that Msx2 negatively regulates the function of PPARγ by suppressing its DNA binding activity, thereby inhibiting adipocyte differentiation. Msx2 has also been shown to antagonize C/EBP transcription factor in its role of regulating amelogenin gene expression (29Zhou Y.L. Lei Y. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29066-29075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C/EBP family is important for the regulation of adipogenesis in the early stage especially in the induction of PPARγ (30Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the introduction of Msx2 inhibited the expression of PPARγ (Fig. 5B), and thus we examined whether Msx2 is involved in the regulation of C/EBPδ and C/EBPδ during adipocyte differentiation. C/EBPβ, as well as C/EBPδ, promoted adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 7, A, B, C, D, E, and F). Msx2 overexpression clearly inhibited adipocyte differentiation induced by either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ (Fig. 7, B, C, E, and F). Furthermore Msx2 inhibited the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ on the PPARγ gene promoter, which is directly regulated by both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (Fig. 7G). Consistent with this, Msx2 significantly inhibited PPARγ induction by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (Fig. 7H). These results indicate that Msx2 plays a role in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation as well as in the later stages. Because C/EBPα is known to regulate adipocyte differentiation synergistically and harmoniously with PPARγ (28Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of Msx2 on C/EBPα. As shown in Fig. 8, Msx2 markedly suppressed the adipogenic action of C/EBPα. Thus, Msx2 is a negative transcriptional regulator for adipogenesis at multiple steps. Genetic studies in human diseases and mouse models suggest positive roles for Msx2 in osteogenesis (6Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 7Liu Y.H. Kundu R. Wu L. Luo W. Ignelzi Jr., M.A. Snead M.L. Maxson Jr., R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6137-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Wilkie A.O. Tang Z. Elanko N. Walsh S. Twigg S.R. Hurst J.A. Wall S.A. Chrzanowska K.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies based on transcriptional assays have raised the possibility that Msx2 functions as a repressor during osteoblast differentiation (13Ryoo H.M. Hoffmann H.M. Beumer T. Frenkel B. Towler D.A. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1681-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Shirakabe K. Terasawa K. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To understand the complexity of osteoblastogenesis regulation by Msx2, we investigated the functional roles of Msx2 in osteoblast differentiation using mesenchymal cell lines and primary mouse osteoblasts into which Msx2 had been introduced by an adenovirus system. Our results strongly suggest that Msx2 is an important transcriptional regulator for osteoblast differentiation. First, introduction of Msx2 induced ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 and C2C12 cells in the absence of BMP2. Second, Msx2 also promoted the calcification of primary mouse osteoblasts. Third, a mutant Msx2, which shows functional haploinsufficiency of DNA binding and dominantly causes enlarged parietal foramina (8Wilkie A.O. Tang Z. Elanko N. Walsh S. Twigg S.R. Hurst J.A. Wall S.A. Chrzanowska K.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), inhibited BMP2-induced calcification in primary mouse osteoblasts. These results are consistent with the phenotype seen in Msx2-deficient mice (6Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In contrast, we showed that Msx2 produced a marginal effect on the growth of C3H10T1/2 cells. Thus, Msx2 is most likely implicated in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation more than the proliferation of its precursor cells. Msx2 has been proposed to negatively regulate Runx2 function through physical association (14Shirakabe K. Terasawa K. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, when we co-introduced Msx2 together with Runx2, we found that Msx2 does not inhibit the osteogenic action of Runx2 but has an additive effect on Runx2. We have also observed that Msx2 does not affect the induction of osteocalcin by Runx2 (data not shown). These data suggest a Runx2-independent role for Msx2 in osteoblastogenesis. This notion is supported by our findings that Msx2 was able to induce ALP activity in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells and that this effect of Msx2 is additively increased by exogenous Runx2. In addition, BMP2 induced Msx2 expression in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. Collectively the data indicate that the BMP2-Msx2 axis, which plays a positive role in osteoblast differentiation, functions in a Runx2-independent fashion. The identification of the target genes of Msx2 may allow further dissection of the molecular basis by which Msx2 promotes osteoblast differentiation. Accelerated adipogenesis in the bone marrow cavity appears to be associated with osteoporosis or aging (31Meunier P. Aaron J. Edouard C. Vignon G. Clin. Orthop. 1971; 80: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 32Burkhardt R. Kettner G. Bohm W. Schmidmeier M. Schlag R. Frisch B. Mallmann B. Eisenmenger W. Gilg T. Bone. 1987; 8: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and thus the identification of the molecular mechanisms that control the balance between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis will contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis related to metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Our finding that Msx2 stimulates osteoblastogenesis but inhibits adipogenesis suggests that Msx2 is one of the transcriptional regulators involved in the regulation of the balance of osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis. Our data reveal that Msx2 inhibits adipocyte differentiation at multiple steps. Msx2 suppresses the function of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, both of which control adipogenesis in the early stage by regulating the transcription of the PPARγ gene. Consistently Msx2 inhibited the PPARγ gene promoter activity activated by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ and abolished PPARγ expression. In the latter step, Msx2 also inhibited the transcriptional activity of PPARγ by suppressing its DNA binding ability, consequently preventing adipocyte differentiation. In addition, Msx2 also inhibited C/EBPα-induced adipocyte differentiation. To support the notion that Msx2 is a negative regulator for adipogenesis, Msx2 was not expressed during adipocyte differentiation (data not shown). Thus, our findings demonstrate a novel function of Msx2, namely regulating differentiation of mesenchymal cells into adipocytes. In conclusion, our data suggest that Msx2 regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts independently of Runx2, whereas Msx2 inhibits the function of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and PPARγ, resulting in inhibition of adipogenesis. These findings advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation pathway of mesenchymal cells into the osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages.

We report here that activation of TRPV1 results in a marked intracellular acidification in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons and in a heterologous expression system. A characterization of the underlying mechanisms revealed a Ca2+-dependent intracellular acidification operating at neutral pH and an additional as yet unrecognized direct proton conductance through the poorly selective TRPV1 pore operating in acidic extracellular media. Large organic cations permeate through the activated TRPV1 pore even in the presence of physiological concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. The wide pore and the unexpectedly high proton permeability of TRPV1 point to a proton hopping permeation mechanism along the water-filled channel pore. In acidic media, the high relative proton permeability through TRPV1 defines a novel proton entry mechanism in nociceptive neurons.

Inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, serotonin, histamine, or prostaglandins further stimulate TRPV1 activity either by protein kinase C-dependent signals (11Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extracellular acidification shifts the activation of TRPV1 toward lower temperature or ligand thresholds by protonation of an amino acid located in the vicinity of the pore loop (18Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Although the role of the external pHext in modulating TRPV1 activity is well established, a possible impact of TRPV1 activation on the intracellular pH has not been studied. A Ca2+ influx component through activated voltage- or ligand-gated cation channels has been recognized to lower the intracellular pH (pHi) in neurons or in neuroendocrine cells (19Törnquist K. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 717-725PubMed Google Scholar, 20Irwin R.P. Lin S.Z. Long R.T. Paul S.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore asked the question whether activation of the Ca2+-permeable TRPV1 may also mediate intracellular acidification in native rat dorsal root ganglion neurons or in a heterologous expression system. Our results provide evidence for two independent TRPV1-mediated acidification signals, including an as yet unrecognized direct proton conductance through the activated TRPV1 pore. CFP-YFP and CFP-citrine Tandem Proteins—Expression plasmids encoding intramolecularly linked cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP-YFP tandem in pcDNA3) were constructed by in-frame ligation of the open reading frames of enhanced YFP or of citrine into the EcoRI and ApaI sites of pECFP-C1 (Invitrogen). Isolation of DRG Neurons—Explanted DRG from lumbar segments of male Wistar rats were sequentially digested with collagenase (type II; 3 mg/ml) for 50 min at 37 °C, and trypsin (type I; 1 mg/ml), followed by mechanical dissociation. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in fresh medium additionally containing 10% horse serum and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor. Neurons were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips 24–36 h before the experiments. Fluorescence Spectroscopy of the CFP-YFP Tandem—CFP-YFP tandem protein was extracted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by aspiration through a 27-gauge needle. Particulate material was removed (24,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and supernatants were diluted in 25 mm citric acid, 25 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Na2B4O7, 25 mm Tris, 25 mm KCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Emission spectra were recorded in a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B). Single Cell pHi Imaging—Loading of Fura-2 and single cell determination of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was carried out essentially as described previously (21Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For calibrated single cell pHi determination applying 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), cells were loaded with 0.5–0.8 μm BCECF/AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 30 min. Excitation spectra of free and protonated BCECF were determined in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells equilibrated in 128 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES supplemented with nigericin and monensin (10 μm each) and adjusted to pH 9.0 or 4.0, respectively. The relative concentrations of free and protonated BCECF in the probe were calculated by multivariate linear regression analysis (22Lenz J.C. Reusch H.P. Albrecht N. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to model the spectral properties of experimental data with stored spectra of the free and protonated indicator. Data were then converted to the pHi by using the calculation, pHi = 6.97– log ([BCECF-H]/[BCECF–]). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—To determine pKa values and Hill coefficients of the pH sensor proteins, the efficiency E of FRET-coupling between intramolecularly linked green fluorescent protein variants was measured by recording the fluorescence intensities of the donor during acceptor (YFP or citrine) photobleach (23Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For assessment of dynamic changes in the FRET efficiency, cells were imaged at three spectral settings: 430-nm excitation combined with a 460- to 500-nm emission filter (CFP channel) and 430- or 500-nm excitation combined with a 535- to 580-nm emission filter (FRET channel or YFP channel). The “FRET channel” was corrected for direct emission of CFP (30.6% of the CFP emission detected through the 460- to 500-nm band pass) and for the acceptor cross-excitation at 430 nm (2.41% of the YFP/citrine fluorescence intensity at 500 nm excitation). Correction factors were derived from measurements in cells that expressed either CFP, YFP, or citrine alone. Under the conditions used, the emission via FRET was 1.78-fold brighter than direct CFP emission. This correction was confirmed by the facts that (i) identical FRET efficiencies of about 51% were found in resting cells with either the spectroscopic approach or the acceptor bleach, and (ii) the sum of direct donor emission and corrected FRET signals remained constant during the acceptor bleach (data not shown). Thus, the FRET efficiency E was obtained by using the calculation, E = FFRET/(FFRET + 1.78 FCFP). Confocal Emission Spectroscopy—TRPV1- and CFP-YFP tandem-coexpressing cells were scanned with the 458-nm line of an argon laser, and emission was collected with a spectrally resolving array of photo-multipliers (Carl Zeiss, LSM-META). The laser intensity was adjusted to bleach the fluorochromes by less than 2% during the measurement. Emission spectra of the tandem protein were compared with stored spectra of CFP and YFP expressed alone by a regression-based linear unmix procedure to obtain images representing the actual signals emanating from both fluorochromes. These data were converted to pHi by comparing the measured ratio of CFP and YFP intensities with a lookup table representing pH-dependent changes of the fluorochrome emission. Electrophysiology—Whole cell recordings were performed as described previously (23Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the intracellular solution contained 110 mm cesium methane sulfonate, 25 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 3.62 mm CaCl2, 30 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The standard extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The NMDG solution consisted of 140 mm NMDG, 0.2 mm EDTA buffered with 10 mm HEPES, MES, or citrate and was titrated to appropriate pH with HCl. Currents in cell-attached patches were recorded using the pipette solution used for whole cell recordings and a bath solution containing 140 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) or 10 mm MES (pH 5.5), titrated with KOH. The bath solution was chosen to depolarize the cell to a potential close to 0 mV and to reduce currents through TRPV1 in the rest of the cell. The pipette potential was set at +60 mV (membrane potential –60 mV) and ramps from –80 to +80 mV applied at 5 s intervals. Currents at the patch potential of –60 mV were measured continuously and at –80 and +80 mV from voltage ramps. Capsaicin-induced Changes of the pHi in Rat Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons—In freshly isolated, fura-2-loaded DRG neurons, application of capsaicin (20 μm) led to a Ca2+ influx in a subpopulation of small to medium diameter neurons (Fig. 1A). The same class of neurons responded to capsaicin treatment with a sustained drop of the pHi from 7.12 ± 0.1 to 6.7 ± 0.08 (n = 5 independent experiments), as tested in BCECF-loaded cells. The acidification kinetic was delayed compared with the capsaicin-induced increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1B). Upon removal of external Ca2+, the intracellular acidification was completely abolished, but was restored by re-addition of Ca2+ (from pHi = 7.04 ± 0.02 in the absence of Ca2+ to 6.48 ± 0.02 60 s after re-addition of 1 mm Ca2+; Fig. 1C) indicating a Ca2+-dependent indirect coupling mechanism. In acidic extracellular media (pHext 6.0), nociceptive neurons responded to capsaicin treatment with a similar drop in pHi. Under these conditions, however, a significant part of the capsaicin-induced intracellular acidification signal persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (nominally Ca2+-free solution supplemented with 1 mm BAPTA; Fig. 1D). A subsequent readdition of 1 mm Ca2+ to the bath solution further decreased the pHi in the same cells that had already responded to capsaicin in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1D). Determination of [Ca2+]i in fura-2-loaded DRG neurons confirmed that no detectable Ca2+ influx remained in the acidic solution containing 1 mm BAPTA. We conclude that TRPV1-expressing neurons exhibit a second, Ca2+-independent mechanism of intracellular acidification, which operates at acidic pHext. A capsaicin treatment of DRG neurons at the more moderately acidic pHext of 6.5 still evoked a significant intracellular acidification signal in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (0.092 ± 0.017 pH steps within 60 s at pHext 6.5 as compared with 0.035 ± 0.037 pH steps within 60 s at pHext 7.4; both n = 5, p < 0.02). The weaker response of DRG neurons at pHext 6.5 as compared with pHext 6.0 most likely reflects the roughly 3-fold reduction in the driving force for proton entry. A possible direct proton flux through the TRPV1 pore was characterized in more detail after heterologous expression of TRPV1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 fibroblasts. Characterization and FRET-based Calibration of Genetically Encoded pH Sensor Proteins—To combine the transfection marker and the pH-sensing system, we took advantage of the pH sensitivity of yellow fluorescent protein and constructed expression plasmids encoding intramolecularly linked CFP-YFP or CFP-citrine tandem proteins. The heterologously expressed CFP-YFP tandem was localized in the cytosol and nuclei of living HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). As expected for intramolecular FRET, the extracted CFP-YFP tandem protein showed a dual emission peak with maxima at 476 and 535 nm when excited at 410 nm (Fig. 2B). Protonation of the extracted tandem protein resulted in a drop of YFP fluorescence and an increased emission of CFP. This indicates that the intramolecularly linked fluorochromes fold independently of each other and that FRET occurs between linked fluorochromes. Both FRET acceptors displayed almost no residual fluorescence below pH 5.5. Under the same conditions, CFP had an apparent pKa of 6.15, and its fluorescence dropped by only about 40% at pH 5.0 (data not shown). Thus, the tandem proteins represent genetically encoded pH sensors that can be calibrated on the basis of intramolecular FRET efficiencies. To more precisely define the FRET efficiencies in living single cells, the recovery of the donor fluorochrome emission was determined during selective bleach of the acceptor (Fig. 2C). In cells that were equilibrated with nigericin and monensin (10 μm each) in a K+-based HBS, pH 8.0, the photobleach of YFP in the CFP-YFP tandem was associated with about a 2-fold increase in the CFP intensity, whereas, under acidic conditions, the donor recovery was markedly reduced (Fig. 2C). The fractional acceptor bleach and the coincident increase in the donor emission (Fig. 2, D and E) fit to a linear dependence, and regression analysis yielded the respective FRET efficiencies. Maximal FRET efficiencies within the CFP-YFP and CFP-citrine tandem proteins at pH 8.0 were 56.6% and 63.1%, respectively. FRET-based titration revealed pKa values and Hill coefficients n (given in parentheses) of 6.2 ± 0.02 (–0.83) and 5.8 ± 0.03 (–0.59) for the CFP-YFP and CFP-citrine tandem proteins, respectively (Fig. 2, D and E, right panels). Because the FRET efficiency scales with the ability of the acceptor fluorochrome to absorb the donor emission, the pHi can be calibrated by the formula describing the pH-dependent titration of the acceptor, pHi = pKa + n–1 log (Emax/E – 1), where Emax is the maximal FRET efficiency at pH ≫ pKa, and E is the actual FRET efficiency. To assess dynamic changes of the actual FRET efficiency, we selected a spectroscopic approach, including a correction for bleeding of the donor and acceptor fluorescences into the FRET channel and a compensation for the higher quantum yield of FRET as compared with the direct emission of CFP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Heterologously Expressed TRPV1 Mediates an Intracellular Acidification—TRPV1-expressing, fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells bathed in a Ca2+-containing solution, pH 7.4, responded to the addition of 10 μm capsaicin with an immediate and long lasting increase in [Ca2+]i from ∼50 nm to about 1 μm (Fig. 3A). In BCECF-loaded HEK293 cells, TRPV1-transfected cells could only be indirectly identified by their distinct response pattern. Although 40% of the cells did not exhibit significant changes in pHi, about 60% of the cells (corresponding to the typical transfection efficiency in our hands) showed a decrease in the pHi from 7.22 ± 0.05 to 6.73 ± 0.12 60 s after addition of capsaicin (Fig. 3B). Upon coexpression with the CFP-YFP tandem, we observed a capsaicin-induced disruption of FRET from 49.5% ± 0.3% to 40.7% ± 1.0% corresponding to pHi values of 7.22 ± 0.02 in resting cells and 6.69 ± 0.05 60 s after agonist application (Fig. 3C). Because under these conditions virtually all fluorescent cells responded to capsaicin, the population of BCECF-loaded cells displaying an acidification upon TRPV1 stimulation (see Fig. 3B) most probably reflected the population of TRPV1-expressing cells. In vector-transfected control cells, capsaicin consistently failed to induce an intracellular acidification signal (data not shown) irrespective of whether coexpressed CFP-YFP or BCECF was used as the pHi sensor. Like in DRG neurons, TRPV1 stimulation failed to induce an intracellular acidification in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3, B and C, right panels) demonstrating that Ca2+ influx through TRPV1 accounts for the cytosolic acidification. When exposed to an acidic extracellular solution (pHext 5.5), the pHi of TRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells dropped only slightly from pHi 7.34 to 7.26 in 60 s, but subsequent addition of capsaicin induced a pronounced and sustained intracellular acidification (pHi 6.48 ± 0.03 60 s after the addition of capsaicin, six experiments; Fig. 4A). This sustained intracellular acidification remained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ yielding a drop in pHi from 7.22 to 6.29 ± 0.05 60 s after the addition of capsaicin (five experiments; Fig. 4B). Extracellular BAPTA (2 mm in Ca2+-free solution, pH 5.5) was sufficient to prevent capsaicin-evoked Ca2+ entry as tested in parallel in fura-2-loaded cells (data not shown). Unlike recent reports on TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores (24Liu M. Liu M.C. Magoulas C. Priestley J.V. Willmott N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5462-5472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), no Ca2+ release from internal stores was detectable under our conditions. Thus, like in nociceptive neurons, a second mechanism of TRPV1-induced intracellular acidification operates in an acidic environment irrespective of the presence of extracellular Ca2+. In Ca2+- and Na+-free acidic KCl solutions, protons are the only positive charge carriers that experience a strong driving force to enter the cell upon TRPV1 stimulation. In TRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells kept in isotonic KCl solution containing 2 mm BAPTA and 10 mm MES, pH 5.5, the pHi dropped from 7.08 to 5.88 ± 0.04 within the first minute after capsaicin treatment (five experiments; Fig. 5A). Almost identical values were obtained with CFP-citrine as the pHi indicator (Fig. 5B) indicating that the signals indeed reflect cytosolic acidification rather than increases in the cytosolic Cl– concentration. A permeation of protonated weak acids or bases may shuttle protons from the extracellular space to the cytosol. If protonated MES, the zwitterionic form of the extracellular buffer, permeates through TRPV1, it might mimic a proton conductance. A reduction of the MES concentration from 10 to 1 mm or a further increase to 50 mm (all buffers adjusted to pH 5.5) did not alter the capsaicin-induced acidification in TRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells. In addition, replacement of MES by 2% bovine serum albumin did not prevent the cytosolic proton accumulation. The TRPV1 pore blocker ruthenium red (10 μm), applied shortly after capsaicin, immediately abrogated the intracellular acidification (Fig. 5C). In line with the assumption that the TRPV1-mediated acidification is due to proton entry through the channel pore, expression of a dominant negative TRPV1NML676FAP mutation (25Kuzhikandathil E.V. Wang H. Szabo T. Morozova N. Blumberg P.M. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8697-8706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to transmit a capsaicin-induced intracellular acidification (data not shown). We conclude that the TRPV1-mediated acidification at acidic pHext represents a true proton entry pathway rather than a buffer shuttle, and our data provide evidence for a direct H+/H3O+ entry through the activated TRPV1 pore. Because capsaicin is not an endogenous TRPV1 ligand, we tested the ability of N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide) and N-arachidonoyldopamine (NADA) to activate acidification in TRPV1-expressing cells. In line with previous findings that anandamide is a low affinity partial agonist toward rat TRPV1 (10Olah Z. Karai L. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31163-31170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), 10–100 μm concentrations of this endocannabinoid were required to induce a significant acidification in TRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 5D). The subsequent addition of capsaicin further accelerated the acidification indicating that anandamide is a partial and/or low affinity agonist. NADA (10–30 μm), another endogenous TRPV1 activator (26Huang S.M. Bisogno T. Trevisani M. Al-Hayani A. De Petrocellis L. Fezza F. Tognetto M. Petros T.J. Krey J.F. Chu C.J. Miller J.D. Davies S.N. Geppetti P. Walker J.M. Di Marzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8400-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), induced a strong proton entry signal that was only poorly accelerated by the addition of 10 μm capsaicin (Fig. 5, E and F). Thus, NADA is more potent and effective than anandamide in activating TRPV1-dependent proton entry. To investigate whether proton entry is a common property of TRP channels, we tested TRPV1-related non-selective channels with known direct activators for direct proton permeability. Neither stimulation of TRPV4 by 4α-phorbol didecanoate (5 μm) nor activation of TRPC6 by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-s,n-glycerol (100–200 μm) nor stimulation of TRPM8 with 20 μm icilin induced an intracellular acidification in transiently transfected HEK293 cells in Ca2+-free acidic KCl solutions (data not shown). The pH-dependent spectral shifts of the CFP-YFP tandem can be assessed by detecting either excitation spectra, emission spectra, or both. Confocal emission spectroscopy (Carl Zeiss, LSM510-META) revealed a marked drop of the acceptor peak in the emission spectrum and a coincident increase in the donor emission (Fig. 6, A–D, upper panels). A regression-based spectral dissection of CFP- and YFP-derived signals and a subsequent computer-assisted comparison of the experimentally determined CFP/YFP ratios with a calibration curve of the CFP-YFP tandem protein yielded a pixel-by-pixel calibration of the pHi. Both the Ca2+-dependent acidification at neutral pH ext and the Ca2+-independent intracellular proton accumulation in acidic isotonic KCl not only lowered the cytosolic pH but also reached the nucleus without measurable delay (Fig. 6, A–D, lower panels). Thus, if TRPV1 is activated in the vicinity of the cell body, intracellular acidification signals may also reach the nucleoplasm. Because locally or systemically administered capsaicin or resiniferatoxin selectively eliminate TRPV1-expressing nociceptive neurons (21Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M.

Electrophysiological Recording of Proton Currents through TRPV1—A crude estimate of the proton entry that would be necessary to lower the cytosolic pH by about 1.5 unit revealed that a detectable amount of inward current should be carried by protons in acidic extracellular media. In whole cell patch-clamp experiments (clamped at –60 mV), capsaicin-stimulated heterologously expressed TRPV1 carried large inward currents with typical amplitudes of 5–15 nA, which would largely obscure an additional proton influx component. Moreover, the detection of a proton current is complicated by the proton-induced TRPV1 potentiation. Thus, a direct demonstration of proton currents requires the removal of other readily permeating cations. In neutral extracellular solutions with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) as the only positive charge carrier besides H+/H3O+, capsaicin treatment still activated currents that reversed at –76.2 ± 1.9 mV (mean ± S.E. of 11 cells; Fig. 7, A and B). The relative permeability of NMDG+ compared with Cs+ ( PNMDG+:PCs+=0.05) indicates an incomplete exclusion of the large cation from the TRPV1 pore. Likewise, other organic cations such as tetraethylammonium (TEA+) carried significant inward currents at least in the absence of extracellular mono- or divalent metal ions (Fig. 7A). Because NMDG+ had a low fractional permeability and is relatively insensitive to changes of the pH in the range of interest, we tested the effect of extracellular pH steps on capsaicin-induced currents in bath solutions with NMDG+ as the sole charge carrier besides H+/H3O+. A stepwise reduction of the pHext from 7.4 to 5.5 consistently induced reversible right-ward-shifts of the reversal potential by about 11 mV. When exposed to pHext 4.5, the reversal potentials shifted by 19 mV, and lowering the pHext from 7.4 to 3.5 induced a 41-mV positive shift of the reversal potential (Fig. 7, B and C). Positive shifts of the reversal potential of similar amplitude were observed on switching from pH 7.4 to 4.5 or 3.5 after replacing the Cs+ in the pipette solution by NMDG+ indicating that the rightward shift is caused by H+/H3O+ conductance rather than by a pH-dependent change of the PNMDG+:PCs+. Assuming independent permeation of different cations and a PNMDG+:PCs+ of 0.05, the reversal potentials ga"

Here, we demonstrated that activation of the P2Y2R induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). RNA interference targeting VEGFR-2 or inhibition of VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity abolishes P2Y2R-mediated VCAM-1 expression. Furthermore, VEGFR-2 and the P2Y2R co-localize upon UTP stimulation. Deletion or mutation of two Src homology-3-binding sites in the C-terminal tail of the P2Y2R or inhibition of Src kinase activity abolished the P2Y2R-mediated transactivation of VEGFR-2 and subsequently inhibited UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression. Moreover, activation of VEGFR-2 by UTP leads to the phosphorylation of Vav2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family GTPases. Using a binding assay to measure the activity of the small GTPases Rho, we found that stimulation of HCAEC by UTP increased the activity of RhoA and Rac1 (but not Cdc42). Significantly, a dominant negative form of RhoA inhibited P2Y2R-mediated VCAM-1 expression, whereas expression of dominant negative forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 had no effect. These data indicate a novel mechanism whereby a nucleotide receptor transactivates a receptor tyrosine kinase to generate an inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

Furthermore, our previous studies have shown that the development of intimal lesions in experimental models of atherosclerosis is closely associated with up-regulation of a functional P2Y2R (5Seye C.I.

The first direct evidence supporting a role for nucleotides in atherogenesis is the demonstration that local application of UTP to collared rabbit carotid arteries enhanced intimal hyperplasia and promoted infiltration of monocytes into the neointima (6Seye C.I.

More recently, we reported that activation of the P2Y2R in vascular endothelial cells induces VCAM-1 expression and promotes the adherence of monocytes (7Seye C.I. Yu N. Jain R. Kong Q. Minor T.

Similarly, VEGF, a pleiotropic factor that regulates multiple biological phenomena, including endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration, also stimulates endothelial cell expression of adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1, ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule-1), and selectins (8Kim I. Moon S. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These multiple responses are mediated through the interaction of VEGF with two receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 or VEGF receptor-1 and Flk-1/KDR or VEGF receptor-2 (8Kim I. Moon S. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that VEGFR-2 mediates the growth and migration of endothelial cells, the permeability of blood cells, and the expression of VCAM-1 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (9Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is increasingly apparent that VEGFR-2 serves as a point of convergence of multiple signals arising from diverse stimuli. VEGFR-2 transactivation follows activation of G protein-coupled receptors, including the endothelial differentiation gene product and the bradykinin receptor (10Tanimoto T. Jin Z. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42997-43001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Thuringer D. Maulon L. Frelin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2028-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that transactivation of VEGFR-2 may be involved in P2Y2R-mediated VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. Here, we show that P2Y2R activation by UTP induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Importantly, we demonstrated that inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFR-2 prevented UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression. Furthermore, we elucidated the structural determinants within the P2Y2R that are responsible for activating the signaling pathways involved in nucleotide-induced VCAM-1 expression. Materials—VEGF-165, rabbit anti-human Flk-1/VEGFR-2 polyclonal antibody, A/G PLUS-agarose, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody, and transfection grade eukaryotic expression vector pUSEamp (+) containing human dominant negative RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). A rabbit anti-VCAM-1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody against Vav2 (rabbit polyclonal) was generously provided by Dr. Keith Burridge (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). Anti-VEGF neutralization monoclonal antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Specific inhibitors for VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (SU1498) and Src (PP2) were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. The rat monoclonal anti-HA 3F10 affinity matrix was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Dominant negative Src (K296R/Y528F) and its control vector (pUSE) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Cell Culture and Transfection—HCAEC were cultured in endothelial basal medium-2 (Clonetics, Walkerville, MD) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HCAEC were used between the third and sixth passages. The retroviral vector pLXSN was used for stable expression of the human P2Y2R in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, as described previously (12Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrad R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Pérez L.I. González F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, plasmid constructs were delivered using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. P2Y2R cDNA Constructs—The open reading frame of the wild type human P2Y2R cDNA was modified using PCR to incorporate the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from influenza virus at the N terminus of the expressed protein as described previously (13Garrad R.C. Otero M.A. Erb L. Theiss P.M. Clarke L.L. Gonzalez F.A. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29437-29444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Three primers synthesized in the DNA Core Facility of the University of Missouri-Columbia (primer 1, 5′-AGGCTCGTACGCTTTGCCCGAGATGCCAAGGCTCGCCGCAGGCTGGGCCTGCGCAGATC-3′; primer 2, 5′-ATCATGGATCCTTACTTGGCATCTCGGGC-3′; and primer 3, 5′-CACACCCTAACTGACAC-3′) were used in PCR to generate cDNA encoding HA-tagged deleted (del) (using primer 1 and 3) or 4A (using primer 1 and 2) mutant P2Y2 receptors. After verification of the size of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, the products were purified using the PCR Wizard kit (Amersham Biosciences), digested with BsiWI and BamHI, and inserted into pLXSN. The mutant cDNAs were sequenced to verify that the mutations were incorporated correctly. siRNAs Treatment—The sense and antisense strands of siRNAs were: VEGFR-2, beginning at nucleotide 3172, 5′-GTGGATCTGAAACGGCGCTTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGCGACTCAATCTACTAGCT-3′ (antisense). The control siRNAs were: scrambler, beginning at nucleotide 3172, 5′-GCTAGTAGATTGAGTCGCCGGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGCGACTCAATCTACTAGCT-3′ (antisense). Double-stranded siRNAs were generated in the pRNAT-U6.1 Neo vector (GenScript) that carries a green fluorescent protein marker used to track transfection efficiency. HCAEC were transfected with VEGFR-2 siRNA or control scrambler siRNA for 48 h in normal culture medium. Activity Assay for Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42—A Rho activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was used to assess Rho activity in HCAEC. Briefly, HCAEC were cultured in 150-mm tissue culture dishes and stimulated with UTP for the times indicated in the figure legends. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and suspended in lysis buffer A containing 125 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, and the lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes. Fifty microliters of Rhotekin Rho-binding domain (RBD)-agarose were added to each tube for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (10 s, 14,000 × g, 4 °C) and washed three times with lysis buffer A. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and Western blot analysis was performed with anti-Rho antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The assay for Rac1 and Cdc42 was done using an immobilized GST fusion construct of the Rac1-binding domain of p65 Pak (p21Rac-binding domain that binds to Rac1-GTP but not to Rac1-GTP). Because Cdc42 also binds to the p21Rac-binding domain construct, the same assay was used to measure Cdc42 activity, except that the membranes were probed with an anti-Cdc42 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HCAEC or 1321N1 cell transfectants were washed with PBS and suspended in lysis buffer B containing 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% (w/v) protease inhibitor mixture. Protein concentrations were measured using the Coomassie protein assay reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce), and then 500 mg of the protein lysate were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA affinity matrix, anti-Flk1/VEGFR-2, anti-Vav2, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were collected by incubation with protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h when applicable and washed three times with lysis buffer B. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and then immunoblotting was performed. Immunofluorescence—Human 1321 astrocytoma cells stably expressing an N-terminal HA epitope-tagged human P2Y2R were grown to 60% confluence on coverslips in 35-mm dishes. The cells were serum-starved overnight followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with rabbit anti-HA (1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and mouse anti-VEGFR-2 (1:100) (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies that recognize cell surface epitopes. The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 1:200 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor™ 594- and goat anti-mouse Oregon Green™ 488-conjugated IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and re-equilibrated in serum-free medium for 1 h and then exposed to 100 μm UTP for 5 min at 37 °C, promptly washed in PBS, and immersed in PBS containing 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS, rinsed in ddH2O, and mounted on glass slides in ProLong® antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 system coupled with an Olympus IX70 microscope using 60× water immersion lens (numerical aperture 1.3). Data were processed with Laser Sharp 2000 software. Co-localization experiments with Alexa Fluor™ 594-conjugated IgG to detect VEGFR-2 and Oregon Green 488-conjugated IgG to detect the HA-tagged P2Y2R were performed at 590 nm excitation/617 nm emission and 496 nm excitation/524 nm emission wavelengths for the respective antibodies. UTP Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of VEGFR-2—We have shown previously that UTP induces VCAM-1 expression via P2Y2Rs in vascular endothelial cells (7Seye C.I. Yu N. Jain R. Kong Q. Minor T. Newton J. Erb L. González F.A. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). VEGF also stimulates the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules including VCAM-1 via activation of VEGFR-2 (9Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because ligand-independent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in many biological responses initiated by G protein-coupled receptors (11Thuringer D. Maulon L. Frelin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2028-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Seta K. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9019-9026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that activation of the P2Y2R would increase VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in HCAEC. Indeed, we detected a rapid and intense tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in HCAEC as early as 1 min after UTP stimulation, which reached a peak within 5 min (Fig. 1A). Importantly, treatment of HCAEC with anti-VEGF antibody did not suppress UTP-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, indicating that activation of VEGFR-2 did not occur secondarily to VEGF release (not shown). To determine whether the P2Y2R could mediate VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, we utilized G protein-coupled P2 receptor-deficient 1321N1 cells transfected with the human P2Y2R. We first verified that VEGF could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in 1321N1 cells prior to and after expression of the human P2Y2R (not shown). We then determined that UTP caused a time-dependent increase in VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in 1321N1 cells expressing the P2Y2R (Fig. 1B) but not in untransfected 1321N1 cells (not shown). Thus, our data clearly indicate that the P2Y2R can mediate transactivation of the VEGFR-2. RNA Interference Targeting of VEGFR-2 Inhibits P2Y2R-mediated VCAM-1 Expression—The rapid activation of VEGFR-2 by UTP prompted us to consider whether the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway was involved in UTP-induced P2Y2R-mediated VCAM-1 expression. To assess the role of VEGFR-2 in this process, siRNA was used to suppress the expression of the VEGFR-2 gene. Synthetic siRNAs of 21–23 nucleotides in length have been shown to silence cellular and viral gene expression in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo (15Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 16Song E. Lee S.K. Wang J. Ince N. Ouyang N. Min J. Chen J. Shankar P. Lieberman J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Results indicated that VEGFR-2 siRNA significantly decreased VEGFR-2 mRNA and protein levels 2 days after transfection (Fig. 2, A and B) without affecting UTP-induced mobilization of intracellular calcium (not shown). Treatment of HCAEC with VEGFR-2 siRNA completely inhibited UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, SU1498, a specific inhibitor of VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity, inhibited both UTP-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 3), indicating that activation of VEGFR-2 is necessary for P2Y2R-mediated VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC.Fig. 3Inhibition of VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation prevents UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression.A, HCEAC were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of SU1498 for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 μm UTP for 5 min. VEGFR-2 was immunoprecipitated (IP) and tyrosine phosphorylation (PY) was detected by immunoblotting (IB) as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. B, HCEAC were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of SU1498 for 30 min and stimulated with 10 μm UTP for 6 h, and VCAM-1 expression was determined by Western blot analysis. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-α-actin antibody. The data are representative of results from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) UTP-dependent Co-localization and Interaction of VEGFR-2 with the P2Y2R—To determine whether the VEGFR-2 and the P2Y2R co-localize upon UTP stimulation, 1321N1 cells were transfected with the wild type P2Y2R in which a HA epitope tag was incorporated at the N terminus to facilitate immunodetection of the receptor. In the absence of UTP, confocal microscopy of dual labeled cells showed no co-localization between the VEGFR-2 (red) and the P2Y2R (green) in 1321N1 cell transfectants (Fig. 4A). Upon UTP stimulation (100 μm, for 5 min), the P2Y2R and VEGFR-2 co-localized in the plasma membrane as indicated by the appearance of yellow staining due to the merged immunofluorescence from the P2Y2R and VEGFR-2 (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that activation of the P2Y2R facilitates its association with VEGFR-2. We next examined whether the P2Y2R and VEGFR-2 physically interact with each other. An anti-HA affinity matrix was used to immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged P2Y2R expressed in 1321N1 cells, enabling us to demonstrate that the P2Y2R and VEGFR-2 could be co-immunoprecipitated as early as 1 min after UTP stimulation (Fig. 4B). However, this interaction was transient because it was not observed 10 min after UTP stimulation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in 1321N1 cells persists for 10 min after UTP stimulation even though the physical interaction between VEGFR-2 and the P2Y2R was lost (Fig. 1B), suggesting that once phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 is initiated the activity of VEGFR-2 may be maintained through autophosphorylation. SH3-binding Sites in the C-terminal Domain of the P2Y2R and Src Kinase Activity Are Required for VEGFR-2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—It is unclear how the P2Y2R, which lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, activates VEGFR-2. It has been reported previously that the angiotensin II-type receptor, which also lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, can activate the EGF receptor through binding with the SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (14Seta K. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9019-9026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that Src kinase activity is necessary for transactivation of the EGF receptor by the P2Y2R (17Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23110-23117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that P2Y2R-mediated transactivation of the EGF receptor requires Src activity and two PXXP motifs in the C terminus of the P2Y2R that represent minimal consensus motifs for SH3 domain-binding proteins, including Src (18Liu J. Griffin K. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Gonzàlez F.A. Seye C.I. Weisman G.A. Erb L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8212-8218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We found that P2Y2R-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 was dependent on Src kinase activity, as demonstrated by concentration-dependent sensitivity to PP2, the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, expression of dominant negative Src abolished the physical interaction between VEGFR-2 and the P2Y2R (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Src plays a critical role in mediating UTP-induced activation of VEGFR-2. To test the role of the P2Y2R SH3-binding domains in UTP-induced transactivation of VEGFR-2, we stably expressed in 1321N1 cells P2Y2R cDNA encoding a mutant receptor (Fig. 5C) in which the PXXP sequences were deleted (del) or mutated to replace the prolines with alanines (4A). VEGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in 1321N1 cells expressing wild type or mutant P2Y2Rs (Fig. 5D). In contrast to cells expressing the wild type receptor, UTP failed to activate VEGFR-2 in cells expressing the del or 4A mutant P2Y2Rs (Fig. 5D). These data clearly indicate that the SH3-binding domains in the C terminus of the P2Y2R mediate UTP-induced transactivation of VEGFR-2. We also found that UTP did not induce VCAM-1 expression in cells expressing del or 4A mutant P2Y2Rs in contrast to cells expressing the wild type receptor (Fig. 6). Activation of RhoA Downstream of VEGFR-2 Mediates VCAM-1 Expression in HCAEC—We next sought to identify the signaling mechanisms downstream of VEGFR-2 activation that are responsible for UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression. Activation of the P2Y2R and VEGFR-2 are linked to activation of the small GTPase RhoA (19Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Vaillant N. Gadeau A.P. Desgranges C. Scalbert E. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1751-H1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46791-46798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the EGF receptor or the PDGF receptor leads to phosphorylation and activation of Vav2, a specific Rho exchange factor that activates RhoA (21Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell.

We found that UTP caused a strong time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 in HCAEC (Fig. 7A). UTP-induced Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment of cells with SU1498, an inhibitor of VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7B). Because Vav2 can activate all three major Rho family GTPases, including RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, we tested whether these G proteins were activated by UTP. Glutathione-Sepharose beads complexed to the GST constructs were used to affinity precipitate GTP-bound RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 8A, RhoA was activated as early as 2 min after stimulation of HCAEC with UTP and remained activated through 10 min. We found a transient but significant UTP-induced increase in the activity of Rac-1 in HCAEC, whereas Cdc42 was not activated (Fig. 8, B and C). To determine which of these G proteins was involved in UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression, we transiently expressed dominant negative forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in HCAEC. We found that expression of dominant negative forms of RhoA (but not Rac1 or Cdc42) blocked UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 9), indicating that RhoA (but not Rac1 or Cdc42) mediates VCAM-1 expression downstream of Vav2 activation.Fig. 8UTP stimulates the activity of RhoA and Rac1. HCAEC were treated with 10 mm UTP for the indicated times. Immunoblots of RhoA (A), Rac1 (B), and Cdc42 (C) are shown. The top panels show immunoblots of protein from cell lysates precipitated by either GST-RBD beads (for Rho-GTP) or GST-p21-binding domain. beads (for Rac1-GTP or Cdc42-GTP). The signal from the stimulated cell lysates was compared with signals from lysates loaded with guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) before precipitation with GST-RBD or PAK-1 p21-binding domain. The lower panels show immunoblots of total RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 in total cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 9Dominant negative RhoA inhibits VCAM-1 expression. HCAEC were transiently transfected with vector or dominant negative (DN) RhoA (A), Rac1 (B), or Cdc42 (C). After stimulation with 10 μm UTP for 6 h, VCAM-1 was analyzed by Western analysis.

We have reported previously that this G protein-coupled receptor mediates VCAM-1 expression and adhesion of leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells (7Seye C.I. Yu N. Jain R. Kong Q. Minor T.

The present study focuses on the mechanisms whereby P2Y2R activation increases the expression of VCAM-1. We demonstrated for the first time that activation of the P2Y2R in human coronary artery endothelial cells induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and the activation of Vav2, a Rho exchange factor, leading to the expression of VCAM-1. Two lines of evidence demonstrated the involvement of VEGFR-2 in this process. First, SU1498, a specific VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, diminished UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 3B). Second, selective inhibition of VEGFR-2 expression by siRNA inhibited the UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 2C). Ligand-independent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in many biological responses initiated by G protein-coupled receptors. It has been reported that activation of the endothelial differentiation gene in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase through activation of Flk1/KDR (10Tanimoto T. Jin Z. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42997-43001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). EGF receptor transactivation by G protein-coupled receptor ligands may involve activation of matrix metalloproteinases, release of membrane heparin-bound EGF, and binding of heparin to the EGF receptor (23Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 24Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). At the structural level, two SH3-binding sites (PXXP motifs) have been identified in the intracellular C terminus of the P2Y2R and have been shown to interact with Src and regulate the activity of the EGF and PDGF receptors (18Liu J. Griffin K. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Gonzàlez F.A. Seye C.I. Weisman G.A. Erb L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8212-8218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that PP2, the Src kinase inhibitor, decreased P2Y2R-mediated VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5A) consistent with the involvement of Src in EGF and PDGF receptor transactivation by P2Y2Rs (18Liu J. Griffin K. Santiago-Pérez L.I. Gonzàlez F.A. Seye C.I. Weisman G.A. Erb L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8212-8218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We also found that the P2Y2R and VEGFR-2 co-localized in cells upon UTP stimulation and demonstrated for the first time a direct interaction between these receptors in a UTP-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Deletion or mutation of the SH3-binding domains prevented UTP-induced expression of VCAM-1 (Fig. 6). Because transfection of dominant negative Src inhibited the P2Y2R-VEGFR-2 interaction, we concluded that Src binding to the SH3-binding domains in the P2Y2R mediates both the UTP-induced P2Y2R and VEGFR-2 interaction and the transactivation of VEGFR-2 involved in VCAM-1 expression. VEGF-stimulated expression of VCAM-1 is mediated mainly through nuclear factor κB (NFκB) activation with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated suppression (8Kim I. Moon S. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). P2Y2Rs in endothelial cells activate a variety of signaling pathways including but not restricted to the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases ERK 1/2 and p38, and the small GTPase RhoA (7Seye C.I.

However, it is unclear whether activation of the small GTPase Rho is involved in UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression. Previous work has demonstrated that Vav and Vav2, two members of the Dbl family of proteins, act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho family proteins (26Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 27Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Rho family proteins function as GDP/GTP-regulated molecular switches that cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state (28Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 29Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 30Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although Dbl family proteins stimulate GDP dissociation to promote the formation of the active GTP-bound protein, Rho family proteins are inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis (31Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated EGF- or PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 in hematopoietic cells (21Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have found that UTP induced a rapid but transient phosphorylation of Vav2 (Fig. 7A), a Rho exchange factor that activates RhoA (21Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and UTP-induced Vav2 phosphorylation was inhibited by SU1498 (Fig. 7B), a specific inhibitor of VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase activity. In addition, UTP failed to activate Vav2 in HCAEC transfected with VEGFR-2 siRNA (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that Vav2 is activated downstream of tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Our results indicate that RhoA and Rac1 (but not Cdc42) activities were increased by UTP in HCAEC (Fig. 8). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 in response to UTP suggests that Vav2 contributes to RhoA and Rac1 activity. Although we cannot conclude that elevation of RhoA and Rac1 activity was due to direct activation by Vav2, preliminary experiments (not shown) indicated that over-expression of a constitutively active Vav2 in HCAEC activates Rho and Rac1 (but not CdC42). Others studies have indicated that Vav2 overexpression elevates the activities of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 (21Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although our data demonstrated that Rho and Rac1 were both activated downstream from VEGFR-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, only RhoA activation is required for VCAM-1 expression, because expression of dominant negative forms of RhoA (but not Rac1 or Cdc42) blocked UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 9). In summary, results from the present study indicate that activation of the G protein-coupled P2Y2R promotes Src binding to SH3-binding motifs in the P2Y2R and facilitates the interaction and transactivation of VEGFR-2, resulting in the sequential activation of Vav2 and RhoA leading to VCAM-1 expression. The present study elucidated for the first time a novel mechanism whereby a nucleotide receptor interacts with a growth factor receptor to generate a pro-inflammatory response in vascular endothelial cells. Further delineation of the signaling pathway involved in this process may help prevent inflammation associated with atherosclerosis by limiting P2Y2R up-regulation and/or the consequences of P2Y2R activation.

However, the presence of sphingomyelin is not strictly necessary for the lytic activity of these toxins, which are also active in phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol mixtures (14Caaveiro J.M.M. Echabe I.

Therefore, other factors are likely to govern their mechanism of action. Mixtures of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol are characteristic of the so-called rafts, microdomains in which the concentration of membrane components (lipids or proteins) and their physicochemical properties are different from the surrounding environment. The increasing amount of information pointing to the existence of lipid domains in cell and model membranes and their implication in many crucial biological processes has been extensively reviewed (19Simons K.

One important characteristic of rafts is their resistance to detergent solubilization (27Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This property is associated with the fact that lipids in rafts exist in the liquid-ordered (Lo) phase, where their acyl chains are extended and ordered as in the gel phase but possess lateral and rotational mobilities characteristic of the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase (31Ipsen J.H.

Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Other examples of lipid phase coexistence are known, the most common one being probably the coexistence of gel and fluid phases in certain lipid mixtures or in pure lipid bilayers near the gel-fluid transition temperature (34Papahadjopoulos D. Nir S. Oki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 266: 561-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have analyzed a variety of parameters that determine the formation of distinct lipid phases (lipid composition, temperature, presence of different sterols, and enzymatic activity of phospholipase C). A strong correlation was found between the coexistence of lipid phases and the pore-forming activity of Eqt-II. Epifluorescence microscopy imaging of supported lipid monolayers revealed the preferential localization of this eukaryotic toxin at the interface between lipid phases.

Protein concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 3.61 × 104m–1 cm–1 (35Norton R.S. Maček P. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Labeling of Equinatoxin II with Texas Red™—To a 190 μm solution of Eqt-II in distilled water, 130 μl of 1 m NaHCO3 were added to raise the pH to 8.3. The labeling reaction was started by the addition of 200 μl of TR stock solution (5 mg/ml) (final Eqt-II/TR molar ratio of 5:1). The mixture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with constant stirring and protected from light. To inactivate any remaining free dye, 47 μl of hydroxylamine were added to the mixture, and the solution was stirred for an additional 30 min at room temperature. To purify the labeled protein, the mixture was loaded on a Sephadex G-15 column and eluted with 10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. 500-μl fractions were collected, and absorption spectra from 250 to 650 nm were measured. Protein concentration and the degree of labeling were determined as indicated by the manufacturer of the protein labeling kit. Leakage of Liposomal Contents—The appropriate lipids were mixed in organic solvent, evaporated thoroughly, and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 25 mm ANTS and 90 mm DPX. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by the extrusion method (36Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar), using polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 0.1 μm (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA). Nonencapsulated fluorescent probes were separated from the vesicle suspension through a Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Solution osmolarities were checked with an Osmomat 030 instrument (Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Phospholipid concentration was measured according to Bartlett (37Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 334: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The leakage of encapsulated solutes was assayed as described by Ellens et al. (38Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 26: 3099-3106Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The probe-loaded liposomes (final lipid concentration = 0.1 mm) were treated with the appropriate amounts of Eqt-II in a fluorometer cuvette at 25 °C with constant stirring. Changes in fluorescence intensity were recorded in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50 spectrofluorometer (Beaconsfield, UK) with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 350 and 510 nm, respectively. An interference filter with a nominal cut-off value of 470 nm was placed in the emission light path to minimize the contribution of the light scattered by the vesicles to the fluorescence signal. The percentage of leakage was calculated after the complete release of the fluorescent probe by the addition of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (final concentration = 0.1% w/v). When PLC was used, the assay was carried out under optimal conditions for its activity; buffer was 10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, and the experiment was carried out at 37.6 °C with constant stirring. Concentrations were 0.1 mm, 0.3 μm, and 1.5 units/ml for lipid, Eqt-II, and PLC, respectively. To stop the enzyme reaction, o-phenantroline was added at a final concentration of 6 mm. Surface Pressure Measurements—Surface pressure measurements were carried out with a MicroTrough-S system from Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) at 25 °C with constant stirring. The aqueous phase consisted of 1.1 ml of 10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The lipid, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), was gently spread over the surface. The desired initial surface pressure was attained by changing the amount of lipid applied to the air-water interface. After 10 min to allow for solvent evaporation, the protein was injected through a hole connected to the subphase. The final protein concentration in the Langmuir trough was 1 μm. The increment in surface pressure versus time was recorded until a stable signal was obtained. Supported Phospholipid Monolayers—Monolayers were formed by spreading chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v) solutions (1 mm) of the phospholipid mixture on top of a buffered subphase (10 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) in a thermostated Langmuir-Blodgett ribbon trough (NIMA Technologies, Coventry, UK). To allow the observation by epifluorescence microscopy, 1% (mol/mol) of NBD-PC was included. After 10 min to allow for solvent evaporation, monolayers were compressed at 25 cm2/min to an initial surface pressure of 20 mN/m. After 10 min for equilibration, TR-labeled Eqt-II from a 45 μm buffered stock solution was injected into the subphase. Insertion was followed by monitoring the increase in surface pressure. The surface pressure stabilized at 25 mN/m, and at this point, the monolayer was transferred onto glass coverslips at a velocity of 5 mm/min. The ribbon trough was provided with a feedback mechanism that kept the surface pressure constant by compressing the monolayer, thereby compensating the loss of material that took place during the transfer. Epifluorescence microscopy observation of the planar supported monolayers was carried out with a Zeiss Axioplan II fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images from NBD-labeled phospholipid and TR-labeled protein were recorded separately from the same sample by switching fluorescence filters to select the proper emission wavelength range. The experiment was carried out at 25 °C. Interaction of Eqt-II with SM-PC Mixtures—In most cases, the interaction of Eqt-II and other actinoporins with model membranes requires the presence of SM in the target membrane (6Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To gain more information on the interaction of Eqt-II with model membranes, we prepared LUV composed of SM and PC in different proportions. Protein-vesicle interaction was monitored through the release of fluorescent dyes that had been entrapped in the vesicles. In Fig. 1A, we observe a strong dependence of the release of encapsulated ANTS/DPX on the SM content of the vesicles. For SM molar fractions between 0.3 and 0.7, the percentages of leakage ranged from 44 to 54%, and maximum leakage was obtained when the mixture was approximately equimolar. When one of the two phospholipids predominated, the release was reduced to ∼25%, and for LUV made of 100% PC or 100% SM, the release was close to 8%. Next, we prepared lipid monolayers with PC/SM mixtures to determine whether this behavior could be observed in other model membranes. The initial surface pressure (π0) was set at 20 mN/m, and we measured the increase in surface pressure (Δπ) after injection of 1 μm Eqt-II into the aqueous subphase (Fig. 1A). The insertion followed the same pattern observed in LUV: 1) maximum values for Δπ (between 12 and 14 mN/m) were observed when the molar fractions of PC and SM were similar; 2) when one of the lipids predominated, Δπ was reduced to 8–9 mN/m, and 3) for 100% PC and 100% SM monolayers, Δπ was practically the same (5.3 and 5.5 mN/m, respectively). We also measured the “critical pressure” (πc) for different PC/SM mixtures (i.e. the initial surface pressure (π0) above which no Δπ is observed after injection of Eqt-II into the subphase). In all of the lipid compositions tested, the higher the π0, the smaller the Δπ, because tighter lipid packing prevented protein insertion (Fig. 1B). The critical pressures were calculated by linear fitting of the experimental Δπ versus π0 (initial surface pressure) values and extrapolation to Δπ = 0. Fig. 1C shows the πc values obtained for different SM/PC mixtures. Again, the highest πc values (around 36 mN/m) were observed in mixtures approximately equimolar and decreased when one of the lipids was predominant. This means that at intermediate SM molar fractions there are more binding sites available for Eqt-II, and more protein molecules are able to penetrate the monolayer. The mixtures producing maximum penetration were also associated with the maximum values of protein-induced leakage from LUV (Fig. 1A). The gel to liquid-crystal phase transition temperatures (Tm) for PC and SM are –5 °C (39Untracht S.H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4449-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 38 °C (40Shipley G.G. Avecilla L.S. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 126-131Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), respectively. A detailed phase diagram of egg PC and bovine brain SM has been published (39Untracht S.H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4449-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to those data, at our experimental temperature (25 °C), pure egg PC exists in the fluid lamellar phase. The addition of SM gives rise to a (PC + SM) fluid lamellar phase plus a pure SM gel phase. Phase separation is clear above 33 mol % SM, and above 90 mol % SM only the gel phase occurs. Our data (Fig. 1) show maximum protein insertion and maximum bilayer permeabilization at SM mol % between 30 and 70 (i.e. in the phase diagram region where phase separation predominates). In addition, binary phase diagrams at 23 °C of palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine and palmitoyl sphingomyelin mixtures also showed gel/fluid coexistence at palmitoyl sphingomyelin proportions between 30 and 70 mol % (41Almeida R.F.M. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2406-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the coexistence of gel and fluid lipid phases favors the degree of protein insertion and the extent of vesicle permeabilization. The Effect of Temperature—We studied the effect of temperature on the EqT-II-induced release of fluorescent solutes encapsulated in PC/SM (1:1) LUV (Fig. 2). The highest percentages of leakage were observed between 11 and 25 °C. At temperatures higher than 25 °C, the toxin activity started to decrease, a trend that was even more pronounced above 30 °C. Above 40 °C, the leakage was reduced to 13%. One possible explanation for this behavior would be a potential thermal destabilization of the protein. In a control experiment, we measured the fluorescence of 7.9 μm ANS in the presence of 2.6 μm Eqt-II as a function of temperature (data not shown). Between 16 and 54 °C, the ANS fluorescence remained low and constant, an indication that in this temperature interval the folding of the protein was compact (42Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Therefore, the decrease in EqT-II activity shown in Fig. 2 was not due to protein denaturation. However, a partial phase diagram for mixtures of SM and PC of natural origin (43Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 114: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reveals that, above 32 °C, only the fluid phase exists. The egg PC/bovine brain SM phase diagram (39Untracht S.H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4449-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also suggests that at 37 °C complete miscibility of these two lipids occurs. In addition, the phase diagram for the equimolar mixture of palmitoyl sphingomyelin/palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine shows that above 35 °C only the liquid-disordered phase exists (41Almeida R.F.M. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2406-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Thus, in our opinion, the temperature-dependent decrease in protein activity results from changes in the membrane structure associated with an increased lipid miscibility and the disappearance of coexisting lipid phases. Interaction of Eqt-II with PC/Cholesterol Mixtures—Actinoporins can also permeabilize PC-cholesterol membranes (14Caaveiro J.M.M. Echabe I. Gutiérrez-Aguirre I. Nieva J.L. Rodríguez-Arrondo J.L. González-Mañas J.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1343-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16De los Ríos V. Mancheño J.M. Lanio M.E. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3A, we represent the kinetics of Eqt-II-induced leakage of ANTS/DPX encapsulated in LUV made of PC-cholesterol (70:30). At mammalian physiological temperatures, there was almost no leakage. However, at lower temperatures, the release increased, and at 4 °C it was 22%. Fixing the temperature at 4 °C, the extent of leakage increased with the cholesterol content of the model membrane (Fig. 3B). Thus, the effect of cholesterol is temperature- and concentration-dependent. In lipid monolayers formed at an initial pressure of 20 mN/m, the increase in surface pressure after injecting 1 μm Eqt-II into the subphase depends linearly on the amount of cholesterol (Fig. 4A). We also observed a small increment in the critical pressures (Fig. 4B). The effects of cholesterol are not as conspicuous as those of SM but might be related with a similar feature (i.e. the formation of different lipid phases within the model membrane). At low temperatures, cholesterol is likely to interact with the phospholipid to form an Lo lipid phase in coexistence with the bulk fluid phase (44Thewalt J.L. Bloom M. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1176-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 45London E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 46Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8686-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), thereby favoring the lytic action of Eqt-II. Interaction of Eqt-II with SM-PC/Cholesterol Mixtures—The Lo phase has intermediate physical properties between the gel and the liquid-crystalline phases, and it has been related to the sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched lipidic domains known as rafts (19Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar, 23Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Molecular interactions between SM and cholesterol induce Lo-Ld phase coexistence in SM/PC/cholesterol mixtures (47Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2614-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have tested the effect of Eqt-II on model membranes having two different lipid compositions, namely SM-PC-cholesterol (50:35:15) and SM-PC-cholesterol (50:15:35). The results obtained were compared with those observed on the SM/PC (50:50) mixture. Fig. 5A shows the kinetics of Eqt-II-induced release of ANTS/DPX encapsulated in LUV. In the lipid mixtures containing cholesterol, the leakage was larger than in the SM/PC (50:50) control mixture. Moreover, release in the cholesterol-containing vesicles was less dependent on protein concentration (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the presence of cholesterol within the SM-containing model membrane renders it much more susceptible to the lytic activity of Eqt-II. Eqt-II inserted to a similar extent in SM-PC-cholesterol (50: 35:15) and SM-PC (50:50) monolayers, but the rate of insertion was faster in the cholesterol-containing mixture. In monolayers containing SM-PC-cholesterol (50:15:35), both the degree of protein penetration and the rate of the process increased as compared with the cholesterol-free monolayer (Fig. 6A). The critical pressure values also changed in the presence of cholesterol (Fig. 6B). Whereas the πc values for SM-PC-cholesterol (50:35:15) and SM-PC (50:50) were nearly the same (36.8 and 37.2 mN/m, respectively), the πc for SM-PC-cholesterol (50:15: 35) was 46.8 mN/m. At any given initial surface pressure value, more protein was able to insert into the SM-PC-cholesterol (50:15:35) monolayer than in the cholesterol-free films. This fact was particularly evident when the initial pressure approached 30 mN/m, a value that is thought to be close to the lateral packing of phospholipids in membranes (48Demel R.A. Geu"
https://openalex.org/W2071675093,"Most higher organisms have a system of innate immune defense that is mediated by a group of evolutionarily related, germ line-encoded receptors, so-called Toll-like receptors. In mammals Toll-like receptors signal in response to pathogen-associated microbial structures. For example, Toll-like receptor 2 appears to mediate responses to bacterial peptidoglycan and acylated lipoproteins and Toll-like receptor 4 to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. However, the structural principles that underlie recognition of these structures are poorly understood. Toll-like receptors have leucine-rich repeats in their extracellular domains and are thus believed to adopt solenoid structures, similar to that found in platelet glycoprotein Ib. Additionally, all Toll-like receptors contain N-linked glycosylation consensus sites, and Toll-like receptor 4 requires glycosylation for function. Toll-like receptor glycosylation is also likely to influence receptor surface representation, trafficking, and pattern recognition. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show here that purified human Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 proteins have secondary structure contents similar to glycoprotein Ib. We have also analyzed where consensus glycosylation sites are located in the extracellular domains of other human Toll-like receptors. We found that there are significant differences in the location and degree of conservation between sites in different Toll-like receptors. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have found that in Toll-like receptor 2 extracellular domain all four predicted glycosylation sites are substituted, although one site is inefficiently core-glycosylated and its removal drastically affects secretion. The remaining Toll-like receptor 2 glycosylation sites also contribute to efficient protein secretion, albeit to a lesser degree.

In humans, innate immune responses provide the first line of defense against invading bacterial pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan, and foreign nucleic acids are sensed by several different immune cell types such as macrophages and dendritic cells. These cells then mediate complex inflammatory and antiviral responses. Stimulation of dendritic cells by pathogen patterns is also required for T-cell maturation and the development of an adaptive immune response (see Ref. 1Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6094) Google Scholar for a review). In recent years it has become clear that the human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney. 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney. are required to mediate these responses. These molecules are single pass transmembrane receptors and are related to Drosophila Toll, a protein involved in dorsoventral patterning and antifungal innate immunity in the fly (2Gay N.J. Keith F.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Drosophila Toll and TLRs all have ectodomains with characteristic blocks of leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic signaling domain of about 200 residues called the Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain. The family of Toll receptors appears to use common components in the postreceptor signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of the transcription factor NFκB (5Buchanan S.G.S. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Bio. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). An important area in TLR research is to understand the way in which pathogen patterns are able to activate these receptors at the biochemical and structural level. In the case of Drosophila Toll, pathogen patterns indirectly activate an endogenous cytokine-like ligand, Spätzle, and this dimeric protein activates signal transduction by dimerizing the Toll receptor (7Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, the human TLRs appear to have a different mechanism of activation that involves co-receptor proteins and direct sensing of the pattern. For example, signaling by TLR4 probably requires direct binding of lipopolysaccharide to the accessory co-receptor protein MD2 and consequent dimerization of the receptors (8Gangloff M. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To study these molecular recognition events biochemically requires the production of the receptor domains in a pure and functional form. This has proved difficult to achieve, and there are few reports of expression and purification of receptor ectodomains in the literature. The ectodomains consist primarily of leucine-rich repeat sequences (LRRs), 24-amino acid motifs that fold together into a solenoidal structure (see Fig. 1). LRRs are found in a large superfamily of proteins (5Buchanan S.G.S. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Bio. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and seem adapted for the rapid evolution of diverse protein binding specificities. Although no structures of TLRs are presently known, the crystal structures of two related LRR extracellular proteins, platelet glycoprotein Ib (9Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A.P. Schiphorst M.E. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and the Nogo receptor (10He X.L.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z.G. Garcia K.C. Neuron. 2003; 38: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), have recently been solved in complex with specific protein binding partners. These structures show that unlike some other LRR proteins (for example, ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor (11Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar)) the convex surface of the LRRs is not α-helical but of variable, extended secondary structure (see Fig. 1). In this study we have described the expression and purification of TLR 2 and 4 ectodomains and have shown that they lack α-helical secondary structure. We have also probed the glycosylation status of TLR2. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that all four predicted sites are used and that one of these, the conserved site 4, is heterogeneously glycosylated. Mutation of all the sites severely affects the biosynthesis and secretion of the TLR2 ectodomain. Sequence Alignments and Bioinformatic Analysis—TLR protein sequences were retrieved from the EMBL data base using SRS (sequence retrieval system). Retrieved protein sequence accession numbers are as follows: human TLR1 Q9UG90, murine TLR1 Q9EPW5; bovine TLR2 Q9GL66, chicken TLR2 variant 1 Q9DD78, chicken TLR2 variant 2 Q9DGB6, equine TLR2 AAR08196_P, hamster Q9R1F8, human TLR2 O15454, macaca TLR2 Q95M53, murine TLR2 Q9DBC4, pig TLR2 AAQ84520, rat TLR2 variant 1 AAN86524_P, rat TLR2 variant 2 AAN86525_P, human TLR3 O15455, murine TLR3 Q91ZM4, rat TLR3 Q7TNI8; baboon TLR4 Q9TSP2, bovine TLR4 Q9GL65, feline TLR4 P58727, chimpanzee TLR4 Q9TTN0, equine TLR4 Q9MYW3, hamster TLR4 Q9WV82, human TLR4 Q9UM57, murine TLR4 Q9Z203, rat TLR4 Q9QX05; human TLR5 O15456, murine TLR5 Q9JLF7; human TLR6 Q9Y2C9, murine TLR6 Q9WTQ4, pig TLR6 BAC99317_p; human TLR7 Q9NR98, murine TLR7 Q923I1; human TLR8 Q9NYG9, murine TLR8 Q91XI7; dog TLR9 Q865B9_p, human TLR9 Q9NYC3, murine Q99MQ8, pig TLR9 Q865R8_p, rat TLR9 AAO91938; human TLR10 Q9BXR5. For analysis of site conservation, sequences from different species were aligned using ClustalW and color-coded using Joy (12Mizuguchi K. Deane C.M. Blundell T.L. Johnson M.S. Overingon J.P. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To analyze where sites were located within the LRR solenoid structure, individual LRRs were manually aligned based on the LRR definitions of Bell et al.(13Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Alignments were then colored using Joy as before. Structural representations were created using PyMol (www.pymol.org), based on the crystal structure of the Nogo receptor (10He X.L.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Cell Culture—Sf9 and T.ni cells for baculovirus generation and protein expression were grown in suspension culture in serum-free SF900 II medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% pluronic acid (Sigma). For the expression of glycosylation mutants HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were used and cultured in HEPES-modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cell (Sigma), supplemented with l-Gln, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). Expression of Recombinant Toll-like Receptors 2 and 4 —Expression constructs for residues 1–587 and 1–631 of the TLR2 and TLR4 extracellular domains, respectively, were generated by PCR on a vector containing the TLR2 open reading frame using a 5′ primer encoding a BamHI site and Kozac sequence and a 3′ primer encoding an rTEV protease cleavage site, His6 tag, STOP codon, and NotI restriction site, respectively. The PCR product was purified and cloned into the plasmid pFastBac (Invitrogen). A recombinant baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) with Sf9 cells. Large scale protein expression was carried out in T.ni cells by infection of 10-liter cultures at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and a cell density of 1.0 × 106 ml. The cell culture supernatant was harvested 3 days postinfection, concentrated to 500 ml using a tangential flow filtration unit (Pall Filtron), and the buffer exchanged to 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole. The concentrate was purified using Superflow Ni-NTA acid-agarose (Qiagen) on an ÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and further purified by gel filtration on Superdex 200 gel filtration columns (Amersham Biosciences). CD Spectroscopy and Data Analysis—TLR2 and TLR4 proteins were dialyzed into 20 mm NaCl 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and spectra recorded between 190 and 250 nm on a Aviv Model 215 circular dichroism spectrometer with a protein concentration of ∼10 μm. Raw data were averaged from duplicate runs and a buffer control subtracted. Data were analyzed using Excel software. Circular dichroism data were analyzed using the program Selcon3 (14Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). Raw CD data were converted to molar ellipticity and transferred into input files as outlined in the CDPro documentation. Secondary structure information for platelet glycoprotein Ib and Ng-R was retrieved from Protein Data Bank structure files (1GWB and 1OZN, respectively) using Procheck (15Laskowski R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Glycosidase Treatment—TLR2 samples were dialyzed into 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. For denatured samples, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS were added and the samples boiled for 10 min. Subsequently, 20 units of PNGase F, 100 milliunits of endoglycosidase H, 20 milliunits of neuraminidase, and/or 20 milliunits of O-glycosidase were added to 200 μl of protein sample as required; the final volume was adjusted to 260 μl. Mixtures were then incubated overnight at 37 °C and the samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE. TLR2 Mutagenesis and Expression of Mutants in HEK293 Cells— Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the instructions in the Stratagene QuikChange kit. The following primers (and their reverse complements) were used for mutagenesis (mutated codons in bold, changed bases in italics): N114S, atcc tat aat tac tta tct TCT tta tcg tct tcc tgg ttc aag ccc; S114N, atcc tat aat tac tta tct AAT tta tcg tct tcc tgg ttc aag ccc; N199D, aagt ttg aag tca att cag GAC gta agt cat ctg atc cttc; D199N, aagt ttg aag tca att cag AAC gta agt cat ctg atc cttc; T416A, tg ctc act ctg aaa aac ttg GCT cta aca ttg ata tca gta ag; A416T, tg ctc act ctg aaa aac ttg ACT cta aca ttg ata tca gta ag; N442D, ca gaa aag atg aaa tat ttg GAC tta tcc agc aca cga ata cac; D442N, ca gaa aag atg aaa tat ttg AAC tta tcc agc aca cga ata cac. The mutagenized inserts were sequenced and then backcloned into original pcDNA3.1 vector backbone to avoid mutations outside the sequenced insert region. For expression of the mutant constructs, plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were collected 72 h posttransfection. Supernatant samples (usually ∼1.5 ml) were collected and dialyzed against 2 × 5 liters of buffer A + 5 mm imidazole. Subsequently, the samples were loaded onto Ni-NTA acid spin columns in several centrifugation runs at 1500 rpm. Columns were then washed twice with buffer A containing 30 mm imidazole and His-tagged proteins eluted with 200 μl of 250 mm imidazole-containing buffer. Cells were collected by scraping and then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was subsequently lysed in 150 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer by incubation on ice for 30 min with pulse vortexing every 10 min. The sample was then centrifuged for 15 min in a chilled centrifuge and the cleared lysates transferred to a fresh tube. Both supernatant samples and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot using TLR2 antibodies (gift from G. Squires) (16Hausmann M. Kiessling S. Mestermann S. Webb G. Spottl T.

Bands were analyzed with Image J software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). A Single Conserved Glycosylation Site Is Present in TLR2 and Is Located on the Conserved Face of the Leucine-rich Repeat Solenoid—Analysis of the primary sequence of TLR2 ectodomains reveals the presence of four potential glycosylation sites. All of these lie within consensus leucine-rich repeats, and three are predicted to lie in the constant regions of the LRR (Fig. 1, A and B). Site 1 is predicted to be solvent-exposed on the convex surface of the LRR solenoid. By contrast, sites 2 and 3 are located on the concave surface but in a position predicted to be solvent-exposed and to make the asparagine residues available for modification. On the other hand, site 4 is located on the terminal residue of the parallel β-sheet of LRR16, a structure that forms part of the inner surface of the solenoid; access to this site in the folded state might be sterically restricted. We examined whether any of these four sites is conserved in the 11 TLR2 sequences currently known. As shown in Fig. 1C, only site 4 is conserved in all species; the other three are present in about 6 of 11 species. The Ectodomains of Toll-like Receptors 2 and 4 Are Secreted in a Monomeric and N-glycosylated Form when Expressed in Insect Cell Culture—The extracellular domains of TLR2 and TLR4 were secreted from Sf9 insect culture cells infected with baculovirus expression constructs. The proteins were purified from culture supernatants using metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2A). Both TLR2 and TLR4 ectodomains eluted as single peaks at positions that indicate the proteins are monomeric (Fig. 2B). To study the glycosylation status of TLR2, we treated samples with several glycosidases: PNGase F, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins; endoglycosidase H, which cleaves the chitobiose core of high mannose and some hybrid oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins; neuraminidase (also called sialidase), which releases terminal N-acetyl-neuraminic (sialic) acid structures from complex sugars; and O-glycosidase, which releases the disaccharide β-galactosidase (1–3)-GalNAc from O-glycans bound to serine or threonine (17Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Protein samples were denatured beforehand or left untreated and then incubated overnight in the presence of glycosidases at 37 °C under mildly denaturing or native conditions as indicated. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2C). Both protein preparations are insensitive to treatment with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase, which suggests that there is no or very little O-glycosylation. By contrast, both endoglycosidase H and PN-Gase F deglycosylate TLR2, demonstrating the presence of N-linked sugars. Circular Dichroism Spectra of TLR2 and TLR4 Indicate a Lack of α-Helical Structure—To analyze the secondary structure adopted by TLR2 and TLR4 ectodomains, we measured circular dichroism spectra of the purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, both samples display a negative band at ∼217 nm. This indicates the presence of β structure, but the lack of bands at 208 and 222 nm suggests a low content of α-helix in the proteins. The secondary structure content of the spectra was estimated using the program Selcon3 (14Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar) and compared with known LRR protein structures (Table I). This result strongly suggests that the LRRs of TLR2 and 4 adopt an overall architecture similar to that of platelet glycoprotein Ib and the Nogo receptor (see Fig. 1) (9Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S.

To conserve function and folding, sites 1 to 3 were changed to residues found at those positions in TLR2 from other species (Fig. 1C), and the fully conserved site 4 was mutated to aspartate, a residue frequently found at position 6 in other extracellular LRRs. The four mutant proteins were then expressed in HEK293 cells, followed by immunoblot assay of both supernatant and cell lysate samples (Fig. 4). Each successive mutation reduced the apparent molecular mass of the recombinant protein, demonstrating that the mutations prevented the addition of N-glycans. The wild-type TLR2 protein expressed in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, co-migrates with mutant 4, suggesting that mutant 4 is fully unglycosylated (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results demonstrate that each of the four sites is occupied in the wild-type TLR2 ectodomain. It is noticeable that not all protein bands are single species. In the supernatant samples where bands are generally broad and fuzzy, this is hard to distinguish, but in the cell lysate blot doublet bands are discernible. Analysis of these bands using ImageJ software confirms this observation (Fig. 4B). Differences in electrophoretic mobility manifesting themselves as multiplet bands are most likely caused by inefficient core glycosylation. That there are only doublet bands and no triplet or higher order multiplets is an indication that only one of the sites is partially glycosylated. The lower doublet band in lane 11 probably corresponds to unglycosylated protein because it co-migrates with mutant 4. In other samples, upper and lower bands correspond to mono- and diglycosylated (mutant 2), di- or triglycosylated (mutant 1) and so forth. The doublet is present in wild-type and all the mutants up to mutant 3 (lanes 8–11) but disappears in mutant 4 (lane 12). This suggests that site 4, the last remaining site in mutant 3, is the partially occupied site, removal of which generates a universally unglycosylated and unsecreted product. No Permutation of Double or Triple Glycosylation Mutants Restores Efficient Secretion of TLR2 Ectodomain—To determine whether any TLR2 ectodomain that retains a single, homogeneous glycosylation site can be efficiently secreted, the three remaining triple mutants were made. As shown in Fig. 5, none of these proteins is secreted by HEK293. However, a substantial amount of protein can be detected intracellularly, and it appears that the single glycosylation sites are used as the bands migrate more slowly than the mutant lacking all the sites. In addition, three further permutations not involving site 4 cannot be secreted (Fig. 6). Interestingly, although the single mutant lacking site 1 is secreted at only a slightly reduced level compared with wild-type, the site 4 single mutant is severely impaired. This points to the heterogeneous site 4 as being particularly critical for secretion of TLR2.Fig. 6Diglycoyslated mutants of TLR2 cannot support secretion.

Samples were collected and processed as before.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The expression studies and purification of TLR2 and TLR4 presented here show that folded and monodisperse proteins can be produced by baculovirus-infected insect culture cells in amounts sufficient for biochemical and structural analysis. The ability of the TLR2 ectodomain to be secreted in a heterologous expression system is consistent with the behavior of endogenous human TLR2. TLR2 is detected on the surface of monocytes, and TLR2 ectodomains are shed from these cells (19LeBouder E. Rey-Nores J.E. Rushmere N.K. Grigorov M. Lawn S.D. Affolter M. Griffin G.E. Ferrara P. Schiffrin E.J. Morgan B.P. Labeta M.O. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6680-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is proposed that shed TLR2 may have a physiological role in regulating responses to pathogens. The circular dichroism spectroscopy studies presented here indicate that the LRRs of TLR2 and TLR4 are likely to fold into an overall structure comparable with that of platelet glycoprotein Ib and the Nogo receptor. This finding has allowed us to predict the likely arrangement of the polysaccharide chains in TLR2 and TLR4 (see Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig. S1). We have shown that human TLR2 is glycosylated when expressed in a human cell line and thus confirmed the character of TLR2 as a glycoprotein. Although glycosylation of the cell surface TLR2 receptor protein may be different (20Wojczyk B.S. Stwora-Wojczyk M. Shakin-Eshleman S. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), our data suggest that all four glycosylation sites are modified in the mature TLR2 protein. Other studies suggest that this is also the case for TLR4. TLR4 requires glycosylation for receptor function (21Correia J.D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); its functional importance may be reflected in the high degree of conservation of TLR4 glycosylation sites, all of which are conserved (see Fig. S1). In TLR1 two of six and in TLR6 five of nine glycosylation sites are conserved across species. In TLR2, which features the least number of glycosylation sites in all TLRs, only site 4 is conserved. An analysis of predicted glycosylation sites in all the TLRs is presented in supplementary data (Table S1). The degree of conservation observed may reflect the requirements of glycosylation in receptor function. Interestingly, the conserved site in TLR2 shows inefficient core glycosylation, whereas all other sites are efficiently substituted. Thus, this site may be of importance for protein structure or secretion rather than for signaling function. In this regard, protein binding to both platelet glycoprotein Ib and the Nogo receptor does not require glycosylation but does involve interaction with LRR residues on the concave surface of the LRR solenoid. Comparing the TLR2 mutants generated here, the level of protein biosynthesis appears to be similar between the different mutants despite the differences in the nature and number of mutated residues. Our observations illustrate that glycosylation is an important determinant of TLR2 secretion in mammalian cells. All mutants are impaired in their level of secretion in comparison to wild-type protein, and not only entirely unglycosylated but also monoglycosylated mutants secrete poorly. The decrease in secretion between mutants 1 and 4 (Fig. 4) shows that the overall number of glycosylation sites has a strong influence on the ability of the protein to secrete, potentially by decreasing interactions of the nascent protein chain with the cellular folding machinery. Based on this data, TLR2 appears to belong to the group of glycoproteins that require most, if not all, glycosylation sites for secretion (22Hickman S. Kornfeld S. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 990-996PubMed Google Scholar, 23Taylor A.K. Wall R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the conserved site 4 is one of the major determinants for proper TLR2 biosynthesis. All mutants in Figs. 5 and 6 lack site 4 and do not secrete efficiently, although they still carry some glycosylation. On the other hand, mutants 1–3, which still have site 4, are secreted even though at decreasing levels (Fig. 4). Significantly, the single mutant lacking only site 1 retains a reasonable level of secretion, whereas the single mutant of site 4 cannot be detected in supernatants, again suggesting a particular importance for this glycosylation event. The role played by particular glycosylation sites in determining the ability of a protein to secrete has been studied before (20Wojczyk B.S. Stwora-Wojczyk M. Shakin-Eshleman S. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Assil I.Q. Abou-Samra A.B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Our data also suggest that this site is partially occupied, and this is consistent with enzymatic deglycosylation experiments (Fig. 2). It is conceivable that this is because of low accessibility on the inner LRR solenoid surface. Because this region has been implicated as the primary ligand binding region in LRR proteins, it is possible that site 4 is functionally important (27Recny M.A. Luther M.A. Knoppers M.H.

https://openalex.org/W1980084515,"STAT2 is a transcription factor critical to the signal transduction pathway of type I interferons (e.g. IFNα). STAT2 resides primarily in the cytoplasm and is tyrosine-phosphorylated after IFNα binds to cell surface receptors. In response to tyrosine phosphorylation STAT2 rapidly localizes to the nucleus and acquires the ability to bind specific DNA targets in association with two other proteins, STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor-9 (IRF-9). To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate cellular localization of STAT2, we investigated STAT2 nuclear trafficking both prior to tyrosine phosphorylation and after phosphorylation. Prior to phosphorylation, STAT2 is primarily resident in the cytoplasm, however, we found that it dynamically shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The nuclear translocation of latent unphosphorylated STAT2 was found to be dependent on its constitutive association with IRF-9, and the export of STAT2 from the nucleus was contingent upon the function of an intrinsic nuclear export signal within the carboxyl terminus of STAT2. STAT2 export could be inhibited with leptomycin B, indicating a nuclear export signal within STAT2 is recognized by the CRM1 exportin carrier. In contrast, following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT2 dimerizes with phosphorylated STAT1 and accumulates in the nucleus. In the absence of STAT1, STAT2 does not accumulate in the nucleus. In addition, subsequent to nuclear import of phosphorylated STAT2, it redistributes to the cytoplasm within an hour coordinate with its dephosphorylation in the nucleus. The regulation of STAT2 nuclear trafficking is distinct from the previously characterized STAT1 factor.

STATs serve as a link between the cell surface and the nucleus, and this requires their physical movement from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Such movement between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is a tightly regulated process that requires specific protein signal sequences and soluble shuttling carriers that recognize these sequences and mediate transport through nuclear pore complexes (16Rout M.P.

Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of proteins larger than 50 kDa requires the expression of a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The best characterized NLSs contain stretches of basic residues and are recognized by the mammalian importin-α adapter family. The importin-α proteins bind importin-β1, which mediates movement through the nuclear pore complex. The exit of proteins from the nucleus shares many properties with the import process. Export requires the presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) on proteins destined for the cytoplasm and requires recognition of the NES by soluble carriers called exportins. One of the exportins, chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), recognizes a common NES composed of a short hydrophobic sequence rich in leucine residues. Some proteins possess both NLS and NES sequences, and cellular localization is determined by the relative function of the NLS and NES. The function of these signals may be constitutive, or it may be regulated by masking, by post-translational modification, or by anchoring either in the cytoplasm or nucleus. In some cases a protein may not possess an intrinsic NLS or NES, but association with another protein serves to contribute these cellular localization signals. STAT1 and STAT2 do not appear to possess consensus NLSs that function autonomously, however, dimerization via SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions generates a conformational change that leads to a gain of NLS function (21Sekimoto T.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 dimers and STAT1·STAT2 dimers are rapidly imported to the nucleus and have been shown to interact with at least one specific importin-α family member, importin-α5. The DNA binding domain of STAT1 is critical for NLS function of the dimer and recognition of importin-α5. Nuclear export similarly is important in regulating the cellular localization of signaling proteins like the STATs. Binding to nuclear components, including DNA, can mask the NES and prevent nuclear export. The DNA binding domain of STAT1 contains a NES that can function autonomously and appears to be masked when STAT1 dimers are bound to DNA. Dephosphorylation in the nucleus releases STAT1 from DNA and exposes the NES to CRM1 resulting in the redistribution of STAT1 back to the cytoplasm. The DNA binding domain of STAT1 appears to have co-evolved with nuclear import and export signals to ensure it is in the right place at the right time, an elegant integration of its function as a signal transducer and activator of transcription. STAT2 is distinct among the STATs in its ability to bind to IRF-9 constitutively, and this property suggested that STAT2 localization may be regulated differently from STAT1 (7Martinez-Moczygemba M. Gutch M.J. French D.L. Reich N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20070-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IRF-9, also known as p48 or IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 γ (ISGF3γ), is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors that play diverse roles in immunity and cellular response to viral infections (8Veals S.A.

Characterized IRFs contain nuclear localization signals that allow their translocation to the nucleus, however, certain IRFs reside in a latent state in the cytoplasm of the cell and only redistribute to the nucleus following an activating trigger. The unifying characteristic of the members of the IRF family is the similarity of their amino-terminal DNA binding domains. Their diverse carboxyl domains are known to associate with distinct transcription factors, and this property contributes to their unique effects on gene expression. The carboxyl region of IRF-9 associates with the amino-terminal region of STAT2, and the ability of IRF-9 to bind DNA contributes to specific target recognition of the multimeric ISGF3. In this report we provide evidence that the unphosphorylated STAT2 molecule constitutively shuttles in and out of the nucleus. Unphosphorylated STAT2 is imported into the nucleus via association with IRF-9, but a functional NES in the carboxyl terminus of STAT2 results in localization of the STAT2·IRF-9 complex to the cytoplasm. Following tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFN signaling, STAT2 dimerizes with STAT1, and this conformational change results in a gain of NLS function, similar to what occurs with the STAT1 homodimer. STAT2 thereby appears to have evolved mechanisms that regulate its nuclear trafficking both prior to and subsequent to tyrosine phosphorylation. Cell Culture and Reagents—Fibrosarcoma cell lines HT1080, U3A (STAT1-deficient, gift of G. R. Stark, Cleveland Clinic Foundation Research Institute), U2A (IRF-9-deficient), and U6A (STAT2-deficient) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with 1000 units/ml IFN-α (gift from Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ) and 10 nm leptomycin B (gift from Barbara Wolff-Winiski, Novartis Research Institute, Austria). DNA transfections were performed with Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science). Plasmid Constructs—Expression plasmids pCDNA3-STAT1, pCDNA3-STAT2, and pCDNA3-IRF-9 were described previously (7Martinez-Moczygemba M. Gutch M.J. French D.L. Reich N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20070-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). STAT2 deletion mutations and gene fragments were amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into PCR-Blunt II TOPO (Stratagene) prior to subcloning upstream of green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene at the EcoRI site of EGFP-N1 (Clontech). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-STAT2 antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for immunofluorescence (1:500 dilution), Western blot analyses (1:1000 dilution), and immunoprecipitation (1.0 μg/mg). Rabbit anti-STAT2 phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used in Western blot analyses (1:1000 dilution). Rabbit anti-ISGF3-γ p48 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for Western blot analysis (1:500 dilution) and immunofluorescence. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were used as secondary antibodies (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for immunofluorescent staining. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was used as secondary antibody for Western blot analyses (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplexes were collected by binding to protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). Fluorescent Microscopy—Cells were plated on glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Endogenous proteins or exogenous proteins expressed in cells following 16-h transfection were evaluated using a Zeiss Axioskop (Carl Zeiss) equipped for epifluorescence with a GFP and rhodamine filter set (Chroma Technology). Images were captured with a Diagnostic Instruments Spot 2 camera (Sterling Heights, MI) and presented in Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Images are representative of reproducible results obtained from two to five independent experiments and correspond to the majority of untreated or transfected cells in a population of 100–300 cells as indicated in the figure legends. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-STAT2 phosphotyrosine or anti-STAT2 antibodies, followed by secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Importin Binding—The plasmids encoding human importin-α family members were described previously (29Kumar K.P. McBride K.M. Weaver B.K. Dingwall C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or were gifts of Drs. E. Hartmann and M. Kohler (University of Gottingen) (30Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importins were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (IVT kit Promega). Radiolabeled proteins were incubated with bacterially expressed GST or GST-IRF-9 bound to glutathione beads (Sigma). The binding buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% Tween 20, and 1% nonfat dry milk. Following incubation, the complexes bound to glutathione beads were washed, and proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. STAT2 Shuttles between Cytoplasm and Nucleus in the Absence of IFN Signaling—To investigate the cellular localization of STAT2 prior to and subsequent to IFN stimulation, endogenous protein was visualized microscopically by immunofluorescent staining. The results clearly demonstrated a cytoplasmic localization of latent unphosphorylated STAT2 in the absence of IFN stimulation (Fig. 1A, panel a). To determine whether unphosphorylated STAT2 is restricted to the cytoplasm or whether it translocates to the nucleus but is efficiently transported back to the cytoplasm, we tested the effects of leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the CRM1 exportin carrier. Treatment of cells with leptomycin B in the absence of IFN stimulation was found to cause the nuclear accumulation of STAT2 (Fig. 1A, panel b). This finding indicates that STAT2 normally shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but dominant nuclear export mediated by CRM1 maintains latent STAT2 levels in the cytoplasm STAT2 has been shown to interact with the non-STAT factor IRF-9 both prior to IFN stimulation and following IFN stimulation (7Martinez-Moczygemba M.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7278-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We previously identified the coiled-coil domain of STAT2 (138–230 amino acids) to be sufficient to interact with IRF-9 (7Martinez-Moczygemba M. Gutch M.J. French D.L. Reich N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20070-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of IRF-9 contains a DNA binding domain and a basic-rich NLS that mediates its nuclear localization. Cellular localization studies of IRF-9 have shown that overexpression produces a predominant nuclear presence; however, simultaneous overexpression of STAT2 leads to sequestration of IRF-9 to the cytoplasm (9Lau J.F. Parisien J.P. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7278-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This result prompted us to ascertain whether association of STAT2 with IRF-9 is required for nuclear translocation of unphosphorylated STAT2, or whether a constitutive nuclear localization signal is intrinsic to STAT2. To this end we analyzed localization of STAT2 in cells that lack endogenous IRF-9 (U2A cells) (32Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of STAT2 in U2A cells demonstrated that STAT2 resided in the cytoplasm of these cells regardless of leptomycin B treatment (Fig. 1A, panels c and d). The failure of STAT2 to accumulate in the nucleus of U2A cells after treatment with leptomycin B indicated that IRF-9 was required for STAT2 nuclear import in the absence of IFN. Although STAT2 localized in the nucleus following leptomycin B in the presence of endogenous IRF-9, the nuclear accumulation was not complete. This result suggested that the endogenous levels of IRF-9 were limiting. To investigate this possibility we overexpressed IRF-9 in U2A cells by transient transfection and evaluated localization of endogenous STAT2. Immunofluorescent staining of endogenous STAT2 demonstrated that STAT2 primarily resided in the cytoplasm of untreated cells overexpressing IRF-9 (Fig. 1B, panel a). Immunostaining of overexpressed IRF-9 in these same cells revealed a nuclear presence of IRF-9, suggesting endogenous STAT2 was limiting, and free IRF-9 accumulated in the nucleus (panel b). Leptomycin B treatment of these cells led to a significant localization of STAT2 to the nucleus, but only in cells overexpressing IRF-9 (panels c and d). These results suggest that endogenous STAT2·IRF-9 complexes normally shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells, and STAT2 provides a functional NES that localizes the complexes to the cytoplasm. IRF-9 Interacts with Specific Importins—A classic NLS has been identified within the amino terminus of IRF-9 that appears to be required for IRF-9 nuclear localization (9Lau J.F. Parisien J.P. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7278-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There are six characterized mammalian importin-α family members that share homologous domains. Although importin-α carriers are homologous, there is evidence for tissue-specific expression, inducible expression, and functional specificity of different mammalian family members (30Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nadler S.G. Tritschler D. Haffar O.K. Blake J.

To investigate whether IRF-9 is recognized by specific members of the importin-α family, we performed in vitro importin-α binding assays. Five importin-α family members were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-IRF-9 bound to glutathione beads. The bound importin proteins were eluted from the beads and detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2). IRF-9 was found to bind to a specific subset of importin-α family proteins. Interaction was readily detected with importin-α3 and importin-α4, and less well with importin-α7. This is in distinct contrast to the binding of STAT1 tyrosine-phosphorylated dimers to importin-α5 (21Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). STAT2 Contains a Functional NES within Its Carboxyl-terminal Domain—To identify the region of STAT2 responsible for its nuclear export, we generated STAT2 amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutations linked to GFP and evaluated the cellular localization of truncated proteins in the presence of IRF-9. Linear depictions of the mutations tested are shown in Fig. 3A. STAT2 mutations that retain the coiled-coil domain would be predicted to interact with IRF-9 and be imported into the nucleus by the constitutive NLS in IRF-9 (7Martinez-Moczygemba M. Gutch M.J. French D.L. Reich N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20070-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A functional NES in STAT2 will redistribute the STAT2·IRF-9 complexes to the cytoplasm, however, the use of leptomycin B will maintain STAT2 nuclear presence by blocking CRM1-mediated export. Deletion of a functional NES in STAT2 but maintenance of binding to IRF-9 should result in accumulation of STAT2 in the nucleus in either the absence or presence of leptomycin B. The STAT2-GFP constructs were co-transfected with IRF-9 into STAT2-deficient U6A cells to eliminate the contribution of endogenous STAT2 (Fig. 3B). Full-length STAT2 and STAT2 ΔN111 localized to the cytoplasm, but in the presence of leptomycin B they accumulated in the nucleus, consistent with the presence of a functional NES. The STAT2 ΔN235 lacks the coiled-coil domain that is responsible for binding to IRF-9, and, as expected, it did not translocate to the nucleus, demonstrating the IRF-9 requirement for nuclear import of STAT2. The carboxyl-terminal deletions STAT2 397ΔC, STAT2 682ΔC, and STAT2 732ΔC accumulated in the nucleus in the absence of leptomycin B, indicating that these proteins lost the functional NES activity. The smallest carboxyl-terminal deletion, STAT2 753ΔC, behaved as full-length STAT2 and accumulated in the cytoplasm unless cells were treated with leptomycin B, indicating the presence of the NES. Proper size and expression of deletion constructs were confirmed by Western blot (data not shown). These results together define a region between 732 and 753 amino acids that contains a sequence critical for STAT2 nuclear export. The Carboxyl Terminus of STAT2 Functions as an NES When Linked to GFP—To confirm that the STAT2 carboxyl terminus contains a functional NES, we evaluated whether this region could promote nuclear exclusion of a heterologous protein, GFP. The small size of GFP (∼27 kDa) and its lack of an intrinsic NLS or NES allow the protein to distribute between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 4A, panel a). Fusion of an NES-containing sequence to GFP should lead to its exclusion from the nucleus by active nuclear export. The carboxyl-terminal 200 amino acids (652–851) of STAT2 were fused to GFP and expressed in STAT2-deficient U6A cells to visualize its localization by fluorescence microscopy. The STAT2 652–851-GFP fusion was excluded from the nucleus, indicating the presence of a functional NES (panel b). A more carboxyl-terminal region of STAT2 (766–801 amino acids) linked to GFP was not excluded from the nucleus (panel d). A region of the DNA binding domain of STAT2 (389–407 amino acids) that shares homology to the NES region of STAT1 provided some cytoplasmic exclusion of GFP but notably only in cells expressing low levels of the construct (panel c). The predominant NES of unphosphorylated STAT2 therefore appears to span the carboxyl-terminal domain region of STAT2 between amino acids 732–753. This region contains several stretches of leucine residues that could contribute to nuclear export activity (Fig. 4B). To determine the contribution of individual leucine residues in this region, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the STAT2 652–851-GFP fusion. Leucine residues corresponding to amino acids 733, 740/741, 745, and 751 were replaced with alanine, and the mutations were tested for their effect on nuclear export (Fig. 4C). The L733A substitution had no apparent effect on export activity (panel a). However, LL740/741/AA, L745A, and L751A ablated the nuclear export function. These results indicate that a functional NES in the carboxyl terminus of STAT2 exists in amino acid region 740–751. STAT2 Requires STAT1 but Not IRF-9 for Nuclear Localization following IFN-α Stimulation—In response to IFN-α, STAT1 and STAT2 become tyrosine-phosphorylated and associate via SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. The STAT1·STAT2·IRF-9 complex, known as interferon stimulated factor-3 (ISGF3), forms in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear translocation (36Dale T.C. Imam A.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 37Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Nuclear transport of the tyrosine-phosphorylated ISGF3 complex appears to result from a conformational change of the proteins and recognition by the importin-α5 carrier (21Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C.

https://openalex.org/W2069061759,"Myb transcription factors, which contain three imperfect repeats in the Myb domain, are evolutionarily conserved members of the Myb superfamily. Vertebrate Myb proteins with three repeats, c-Myb, A-Myb, and BMyb, play important roles at the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. In plants, this type of Myb protein controls the G2/M phase by activating or repressing the transcription of cyclin B genes and a variety of other G2/M phase-specific genes. In tobacco, two genes for Myb activators, NtmybA1 and NtmybA2, are transcriptionally controlled and are expressed specifically at the G2/M phase. As we showed here, in addition to the control at the transcriptional level, activity of NtmybA2 is also controlled at the post-translational level. We found that the transactivation potential of NtmybA2 is repressed by a regulatory domain located at its carboxyl terminus and that specific classes of cyclins A and B enhanced NtmybA2 activity possibly by relieving this inhibitory effect. Mutations at the 20 potential sites of phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) in NtmybA2 blocked the enhancing effects of the cyclins on NtmybA2 activity. Recombinant NtmybA2 was phosphorylated in vitro by a CDK fraction prepared from tobacco BY2 cells. The kinase activity for NtmybA2 in the CDK fraction was cell cycle-regulated in BY2 cells, peaking at the G2/M phase when the level of transcripts of cyclin B is maximal. Taken together, our data suggest that NtmybA2 is phosphorylated by a specific cyclin/CDK complex(es) at G2/M and that this phosphorylation removes the inhibitory effect of its C-terminal region, thereby activating NtmybA2 specifically at G2/M.

In the eukaryotic cell cycle, molecular events occur in a well-defined and reproducible sequence. The periodic activation at the transcriptional level of genes that regulate the cell cycle is fundamental to this process. In animals, transcription of several genes induced at the G1/S transition is mainly controlled by the E2F/DP heterodimeric transcription factors (for review, see Ref. 1Lavia P. Jansen-Dürr P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 221-230Google Scholar). E2F-binding sequences are found in promoters from many genes that are transcribed at around the time of G1/S transition. Both E2F and DP factors have recently been identified in plants (for review, see Ref. 2Gutierrez C. Ramirez-Parra E. Castellano M.M. del Pozo J.C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 480-486Google Scholar), and some reports indicate that plant E2F/DP factors play a role at the G1/S transition (3Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Google Scholar, 4Chabouté M.E. Clément B. Philipps G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17845-17851Google Scholar). By contrast, different mechanisms for G2/M phase-specific transcription have been proposed in plants and animals. In animal cells, G2/M phase-specific transcription is mainly regulated by two repressor elements known as cell cycle-dependent elements (CDE) and cell cycle gene homology region (CHR) (for review, see Ref. 5Zwicker J. Müller R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 3-6Google Scholar). These elements are found in the promoters of various G2/M phase-specific genes, which include cdc25C (6Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Müller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Google Scholar), polo-like kinase (7Uchiumi T. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9166-9174Google Scholar), aurora A (8Ishigatsubo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10719-10726Google Scholar), and cyclin B2 (9Lange-zu Dohna C. Brandeis M. Berr F. Mössner J. Engeland K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 77-81Google Scholar). Mutation of the CDE and CHR elements allows elevated transcription during G1 and consequent loss of cell cycle-regulated expression. In plants, G2/M phase-specific genes do not contain these repressor elements; instead, they contain a common cis element called the M phase-specific activator sequence (MSA), 1The abbreviations used are: MSA, M phase-specific activator sequence; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; LUC, luciferase; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; 3Rmyb, three-repeat Myb; GAL4DBD, DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4; VP16, viral protein 16; CDKA, tobacco A-type CDK; MD-VP16, Myb domain of NtmybA2 fused to the VP16 activation domain; VP16AD, VP16 activation domain. which is necessary and sufficient for the G2/M phase-specific activation of promoters (10Ito M. Iwase M. Kodama H. Lavisse P. Komamine A. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 331-341Google Scholar, 11Ito M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 677-690Google Scholar). We showed previously that members of a group of Myb transcription factors bind to MSA elements and regulate transcription by activating or repressing promoter activity (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). The Myb family of proteins is characterized by a consecutively repeated and conserved domain of ∼50 amino acids, which is known as the Myb domain. Vertebrates have three Myb genes, c-Myb, A-Myb, and B-Myb; all three of them encode three repeats of the Myb domain (for review, see in Ref. 13Weston K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 76-81Google Scholar). These repeats are often designated R1, R2, and R3. Each of the Myb repeats is more closely related to other member of Myb family proteins than to other repeats within the same protein (14Rosinski J.A. Atchley W.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 74-83Google Scholar). By contrast, plants have much larger numbers of Myb genes, for example, the Arabidopsis genome contains more than 130 Myb genes. However, most plant Myb proteins contain only two repeats, which correspond to vertebrate R2 and R3 (for review, see Ref. 15Stracke R. Werber M. Weisshaar B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 447-456Google Scholar). Thus, such plant Myb proteins are often called R2R3-Myb. We recently identified three Myb proteins, NtmybA1, NtmybA2, and NtmybB, that bind to the MSA motif in tobacco (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). These Myb proteins contain three repeats (R1, R2, and R3), and each repeat is more closely related to the vertebrate Myb repeats than to the repeats from plant R2R3-Myb proteins. Thus, Myb proteins with three repeats from plants and animals constitute an evolutionarily conserved group in the Myb superfamily, and they are referred to collectively herein as three-repeat Myb (3Rmyb) proteins. Closely related 3Rmyb proteins are also found in Drosophila melanogaster and the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, but they are not found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans or in budding yeast (16Ganter B. Lipsick J.S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 21-60Google Scholar). Animals do not have Myb proteins that are related to plant R2R3-Myb proteins. In mammalian cells, all three known 3Rmyb proteins seem to play an important role in regulation of the cell cycle, acting specifically at the G1/S transition (for review, see Ref. 13Weston K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 76-81Google Scholar). Unlike 3Rmyb proteins in mammals, 3Rmyb proteins in plants control G2/M phase by regulating the transcription of G2/M phase-specific genes, such as cyclin B genes. A similar role at the G2/M phase was also reported for a 3Rmyb protein in D. melanogaster (17Okada M. Akimaru H. Hou D.X. Takahashi T. Ishii S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 675-684Google Scholar). In plants, a wide range of G2/M phase-specific genes seem to be regulated by 3Rmyb proteins. A recent analysis of the Arabidopsis transcriptome, using a DNA tip, revealed that 93 of 8,250 genes tested showed G2/M phase-specific expression, with kinetics of expression similar to those of cyclin B genes (18Menges M. Hennig L. Gruissem W. Murray J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41987-42002Google Scholar). Among these 93 genes, ∼20% include MSA consensus sequence YCYAACGGYY (where Y indicates C or T) in the promoter region, defined as the 1-kb region upstream of the site of initiation of translation. The tobacco NACK1 gene is the best-characterized example in this group of plant genes. The G2/M phase-specific transcription of NACK1 is dependent on the two MSA motifs in its promoter region (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). NACK1 is an M phase-specific kinesin-like protein that has been identified as an activator of NPK1, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that is required for formation of the cell plate during cytokinesis in tobacco (19Nishihama R. Soyano T. Ishikawa M. Araki S. Tanaka H. Asada T. Irie K. Ito M. Terada M. Banno H. Yamazaki Y. Machida Y. Cell. 2002; 109: 87-99Google Scholar). The two 3Rmyb proteins in tobacco, NtmybA1 and NtmybA2, are structurally related to each other and function as transcriptional activators, whereas NtmybB, with a less closely related structure, also binds to the MSA element but functions as a competitive repressor (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). We showed that both cyclin B and NACK1 promoters were activated by NtmybA1 and NtmybA2 and were repressed by NtmybB in cotransfection experiments. Levels of NtmybA1 and NtmybA2 transcripts oscillate during the cell cycle and are maximal at the G2/M phase, just before the level of transcripts of the cyclin B and NACK1 genes reach a maximum. By contrast, the level of the NtmybB transcript remains almost constant throughout the cell cycle (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). Thus, it seems plausible that transcription of G2/M phase-specific genes might be regulated by a balance between activation and repression by 3Rmyb proteins, which is further regulated by transcriptional control of NtmybA1 and NtmybA2 genes themselves. We report here that another level of regulation is operational for the cell cycle-regulated activities of NtmybA1 and NtmybA2. We show that the transactivation potential of NtmybA2 is repressed by the protein's own C-terminal region and that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) seem able to relieve this inhibitory effect, most probably via the direct phosphorylation of NtmybA2. Our results indicate that the G2/M phase-specific activities of NtmybA2 and, possibly, NtmybA1 are controlled by multiple mechanisms. Plant Material and Synchronization of Cells—Maintenance and synchronization of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY2 cells were performed as described previously (20Ito M. Criqui M.-C. Sakabe M. Ohno T. Hata S. Kouchi H. Hashimoto J. Fukuda H. Komamine A. Watanabe A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 983-992Google Scholar, 21Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Intl. Rev. Cytology. 1992; 132: 1-30Google Scholar). In brief, BY2 cells were synchronized by treatment with aphidicolin (5 mg/liter; Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 24 h and subsequent washing with fresh medium to release the aphidicolin block. Mitotic indices were determined by examining cells that had been stained with a 1% solution of orcein in a mixture (1:1; v/v) of lactic acid and propionic acid. Construction of Plasmids—The reporter plasmid containing the NACK1 promoter fused to a luciferase (LUC) reporter gene (NACK1p-LUC) was described previously (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). The 4×GAL4-LUC reporter plasmid contains four copies of a GAL4-responsive element upstream of a LUC reporter gene and has been described elsewhere (22Schwechheimer C. Smith C. Bevan M.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 195-204Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for full-length NtmybA2 (pJIT-NtmybA2) was constructed by inserting NtmybA2 cDNA at a SalI site located downstream of the double Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter in pJIT60 (23Guerineau F. Mullineaux P. Croy R.R.D. Plant Molecular Biology Labfax. BIOS Scientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1993: 121-147Google Scholar). A series of C-terminally truncated versions of NtmybA2, namely Δ187, Δ242, Δ568, Δ630, and Δ704, was generated by PCR from pJIT-NtmybA2 using a sense primer that corresponded to the sequence TATCCTTCGCAAGACCCTTC in the pJIT-60 vector, and the following antisense primers, which include SalI sites and stop codons: CCGTCGACTACTTTTTGACGGAACTATTCC (for Δ187), CCGTCGACTAGCATTCTGAAGCTTCCTCC (for Δ242), CCGTCGACTATATGCTCGAATTTTCGTTCAC (for Δ568), CCGTCGACTACCACAGCCTAAATGGAGTA (for Δ630), and CCGTCGACTATGCAGCCTCGTCAAACATAA (for Δ704). For construction of expression plasmids for each truncated protein, amplified fragments were digested with SalI and cloned at the SalI site that is located downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter in pJIT60. The expression plasmid for another C-terminally truncated protein, Δ412, was constructed by cloning the EcoRI/SalI fragment of pJIT-NtmybA2 at the EcoRI/SalI sites of pJIT60. Plasmid pGAL4/1×VP16 encodes the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 (GAL4DBD) fused to the activation domain of viral protein 16 (VP16) from herpes simplex virus downstream of the double CaMV35S promoter (22Schwechheimer C. Smith C. Bevan M.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 195-204Google Scholar). This plasmid was used as the expression plasmid for the GAL4-VP16 fusion protein. A variant of NtmybA2 lacking the N-terminally located Myb domain (NtmybA2ΔMD) and the C-terminally truncated version (NtmybA2ΔMDΔC) of this variant were generated by PCR from pJIT-NtmybA2 using the sense primer CCGGATCCTAGTTCCGTCAAAAAGAAATTGGACTC, which contains a BamHI site, and the following antisense primers, which include SalI sites and stop codons: CCGTCGACAAGTTCTACCTTGAAAGGACTTGC (for NtmybA2ΔMD) and CCGTCGACCTAGACGGCATCTGTACTTCCATC (for NtmybA2Δ-MDΔC). For construction of expression plasmids for two GAL4 fusion proteins, GAL4-NtmybA2ΔMD and GAL4-NtmybA2ΔMDΔC, amplified fragments were digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned at the BamHI/SalI sites of pGAL4/1×VP16, replacing the fragment that encoded the VP16 activation domain. Mutations in NtmybA2 at putative sites of phosphorylation by CDK were introduced by PCR using pJIT-NtmybA2 or its mutant derivatives as template. Primers were designed to encode changes from serine to alanine or threonine to alanine. A DNA fragment containing mutations T973A and S1032A was generated by PCR using the sense primer CGGGATCCCTACCTGCAACCTTTCAATAGGTAGGAGGAAGGAGCTGAAAAG and the antisense primer GACTGCAGGGGCATTTGCAGACGCACAGGAGGTCTTGGGAGGTGAAGCTCCAG. The amplified fragment, incorporating the mutations, was digested with PstI and BamHI and cloned at the PstI/BamHI sites of pJIT-NtmybA2, replacing the original PstI/BamHI fragment of pJIT-NtmybA2. To introduce mutations S906A and S912A, a sense primer, ATGAACCATGGAGCTTTCCAAGCTGAAGGAGCTTC, and an antisense primer, ATTTGCGCTCCTCGTATACGTG, were used for PCR, and the amplified fragment was digested with AccI and NcoI and cloned at the AccI/NcoI sites of pJITNtmybA2, replacing the original AccI/NcoI fragment. For mutagenesis of S849A, the sense primer GTCTTTCTTTCCACGTATACGAGGAGCGCA and the antisense primer CCATCTAGAGATGGAAGTAC were used for PCR. The amplified fragment was digested with AccI and XbaI and then cloned at the AccI/XbaI sites of NtmybA2, replacing the original AccI/XbaI fragment. To introduce mutations T518A and S551A, two different DNA fragments were generated by separate PCRs with different sets of primers, namely CCCTTTGAATCTGGTGCTCCTTGTGACAAC and AGTATTTGAAGGAGCTGTGCGAAAATCATT for one reaction and ATATAGAAAACCATCAGAGTTACTTGT and ATTCAAACATGTCCATTGGTGAACGAA for the other reaction. These reactions generated DNA fragments that encoded different regions of NtmybA2 that are adjacent to each other. These fragments were connected to each other by ligation. The product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and was then cloned at the BamHI/XbaI sites of pJIT-NtmybA2 or its mutant derivatives. The DNA fragment containing mutations T293A and S343A was obtained similarly by connecting two DNA fragments that had been generated by separate PCRs with the primer set, CATGCTCTGAATACTATGCCCCAGCCTTTGAAGAT and CATCAACTCCAGCGGAGCAATATTAGGTATGTCATCT for one reaction and the primer set GTGCTGAACTGGAGCTTGGGTCCTTCCTAT and CAGGATTCTTCAGGGCTCTTCATGCAGTGT for the other reaction. These fragments were connected by ligation. The product was digested by BamHI and XbaI and then cloned at the BamHI/XbaI sites of pJIT-N-tmybA2 or its derivatives. For mutagenesis of S922A and S939A, two oligonucleotides, CCTGCAGTCTGCTCACTCAATTGCTTCATCAATCCAATAGCATCATAGCTTCTGTCACCTGGAGCCATAAACAGTGCAAGATC and CCATGGTTCATCAACTCTCTTCTGTCAGCCCCAAGACTTGATAATGAACTTAATTTTGAGGATCTTGCACTGTTTATGGCTC, were annealed and extended by the Klenow fragment of the DNA polymerase. The resultant double-stranded DNA was digested with PstI and NcoI and cloned at the PstI/NcoI sites of pJIT-NtmybA2, replacing the original PstI/NcoI fragment. To introduce mutations T653A and S666A, PCR was performed with the sense primer GCGACACCGTGATTTGGTGGCACCTTTGTC and the antisense primer TTCTTTAATATAGAAGGTGCGCTGGTGAAA, with pJIT-NtmybA2 as template. The amplified fragment, containing the entire vector sequence, was circularized by end-to-end ligation, thereby creating a new plasmid with the mutations of interest. Introduction of mutations T8A, S609A, T625A, S632A, S799A, T898A, and S1013A was achieved with a QuikChange site-direct mutagenesis kit, in accordance with the instructions from the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sense primers were GTGATAGAATAAGCACTGCTTCAGATGGCACTAGC for T8A, GCACAGCAAGAGTACGCCCCTCTTGGCATCC for S609A, CTTCTGTGAACTGTCTTGCTCCATTTAGGCTGTGG for T625A, TTAGGCTGTGGGATGCACCATCTAGAGATG for S632A, GTGACCTGTTCTTCGCTCCTGATCGTTTTG for S799A, GCATATCTGGAGAAGCGCCTTATAAAAGG for T898A, and CAGTGAATGTGGAGCACCTGGAAAGGG for S1013A. The antisense primers were complementary to the respective sense primers. cDNA fragments encoding A1-, A3-, B1-, and D3-type cyclins from tobacco were amplified by PCR from plasmids that included cDNA for Ntcyc25 (24Setiady Y.Y. Sekine M. Hariguchi N. Yamamoto T. Kouchi H. Shinmyo A. Plant J. 1995; 8: 949-957Google Scholar), NtCYS (20Ito M. Criqui M.-C. Sakabe M. Ohno T. Hata S. Kouchi H. Hashimoto J. Fukuda H. Komamine A. Watanabe A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 983-992Google Scholar), NtCYM (20Ito M. Criqui M.-C. Sakabe M. Ohno T. Hata S. Kouchi H. Hashimoto J. Fukuda H. Komamine A. Watanabe A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 983-992Google Scholar), and NtcycD1 (25Nakagami H. Kawamura K. Sugisaka K. Sekine M. Shinmyo A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1847-1857Google Scholar), respectively. PCR was conducted with the following pairs of sense primers, each of which included a BamHI site, and antisense primers, each of which included NotI site: ACGGATCCATGGCGACGACCCAGAAT and ATGCGGCCGCTTAGCAGCTTATGTTCTGGA for Ntcyc25; ACGGATCCATGGCGAACGAAGAAAATAAG and ATGCGGCCGCTCAAGCATCATCAAAAAAACAAG for NtCYS; ACGGATCCATGGCTTCAAGAAACGTTCT and ATGCGGCCGCTATTCATATGAAGAAGCAGC for NtCYM; and ACGGATCCATGGGAATACAACACAATGAG and ATGCGGCCGCGAGGGCTGCCAACAG for NtcycD1. The amplified fragments were digested with NotI, filled in by Klenow fragment, and then digested with BamHI. These fragments were cloned at the BamHI/SmaI sites of pJIT60 to obtain the expression plasmid for each tobacco cyclin. The cDNA fragment encoding A2-type cyclin was obtained by digesting a plasmid that included Ntcyc27 cDNA (24Setiady Y.Y. Sekine M. Hariguchi N. Yamamoto T. Kouchi H. Shinmyo A. Plant J. 1995; 8: 949-957Google Scholar) with SalI and SmaI. This fragment was subcloned at the SalI/SmaI sites of pJIT-60 to create the expression plasmid for the A2-type cyclin. The cDNA fragment for A-type CDK (CDKA) of tobacco was amplified by PCR from the cdc2Nt1 cDNA clone (26Setiady Y.Y. Sekine M. Hariguchi N. Kouchi H. Shinmyo A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 369-376Google Scholar) with a sense primer that included a SalI site, GAGTCGACATGGACCAGTATGAAAAAGTT, and an antisense primer that included a NotI site, TGGCGGCCGCTCACGGAACATACCCAATAT. The amplified fragments were digested with NotI and SalI and cloned at the NotI/SalI sites located downstream of the CaMV 35 S promoter in pTH-2 (27Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Google Scholar), replacing a sequence that encoded green fluorescent protein. The resultant plasmid, pTH2-CDKA, was used for in vitro mutagenesis to obtain a dominant-negative form of CDKA in which the codon GAC (Asp-146) was changed to AAC (Asn-146). Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as described above, with the sense primer TGCTTTAAAGCTTGCAAACTTTGGATTGGCTA and the antisense primer TAGCCAATCCAAAGTTTGCAAGCTTTAAAGCA. The cDNA clones for Ntcyc25, Ntcyc27, NtcycD1, and cdc2Nt1 were generous gifts from Dr. Masami Sekine (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). All amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm that no errors had been introduced during PCR. The expression plasmid for the protein that consisted of the Myb domain of NtmybA2 fused to the VP16 activation domain (MD-VP16) was described previously (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). Transient Expression Assays with BY2 Protoplasts—Tobacco BY2 protoplasts were prepared from 3-day-old cells as described previously (28Evans D.A. Bravo J.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. Supplement. 1983; 16: 33-53Google Scholar). Protoplasts were transfected by polyethylene glycol-mediated direct gene transfer (29Bilang R. Klöti A. Schrott M. Potrykus I. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. A1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 1-16Google Scholar), and transfected protoplasts were cultured for 24 h at 27 °C. For each construct, five independent transfections were performed. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed according to the instructions form the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). For each transfection, we used 10 μg of expression plasmid and 20 μg of reporter plasmid, unless otherwise indicated. Cotransfection with the 35 S-Rluc construct, in which the reporter gene for Renilla reniformis luciferase is located downstream of the CaMV 35 S promoter, was performed to provide an internal control for the efficiency of transfection. Particle Bombardment—BY2 cells from an 8-day-old culture were diluted 10-fold with fresh medium, spread in a thin layer over filter paper, and then subjected to particle bombardment, which was performed as described previously (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). After bombardment, cells were suspended in fresh medium with or without aphidicolin (20 μg/l) and cultured at 27 °C. Cells were harvested 24 h after bombardment, and the activities of firefly luciferase and R. reniformis luciferase were determined as noted above. Assays of Kinase Activities in Vitro—For bacterial expression of recombinant protein, cDNA fragments that encoded the C-terminal region of NtmybA2 (amino acids 441-1042) with or without mutations were cloned at the BamHI/SalI sites of the pET28a vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The NtmybA2 recombinant protein tagged with His-T7 was produced in Escherichia coli (DE3) pLysS. After lysis of cells, the insoluble fraction was denatured and solubilized in 8 m urea and then the His-tagged recombinant protein was purified on a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The eluate was dialyzed and concentrated with an Ultrafree Biomax NMWL membrane unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and was used as a substrate for kinase reactions in vitro. Purification of a CDK fraction from BY2 cells and kinase reactions in vitro were performed as described previously (30Soyano T. Nishihama R. Morikiyo K. Ishikawa M. Machida Y. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1055-1067Google Scholar). In brief, BY2 cells were homogenized with HG150 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium o-vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% Nonidet P-40 plus 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml antipain), and centrifuged. Extracts of BY2 cells were rotated gently with 20 μl of p13SUC1-agarose beads (50% slurry; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of HG150 buffer and twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer that contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2,5mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium o-vanadate. The beads were resuspended in a reaction mixture (10 μl) that included 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. As protein substrate, NtmybA2 recombinant protein (4 μg) or histone H1 (2 μg; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the reaction mixture. Each reaction contained 100-120 μg of protein of p13SUC1 bead-purified fraction. For termination of the reaction, 2× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE was added, and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10-12% polyacrylamide) and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Incorporated radioactivity was visualized with a bioimaging analyzer (BAS1800; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). For analysis of recombinant NtmybA2 protein that included mutations at potential sites of phosphorylation by CDK, mutant and wild-type recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli and purified as described above. CDK fractions were prepared as described above from BY2 cells that had been arrested at prometaphase for enrichment of mitotic protein kinases. For induction of prometaphase arrest, BY2 cells were first synchronized by treatment with aphidicolin for 24 h. After release from the aphidicolin block, cells were cultured for 4 h in fresh medium without the drug, and then they were treated with propyzamide (Sumitomo Chemical, Osaka, Japan) at a final concentration of 6 μm. Cells were cultured in the presence of propyzamide for a further 6 h and then collected for preparation of the CDK fraction. Cell Cycle-regulated Activity of NtmybA2—We showed previously, in cotransfection experiments, that the MSA-containing promoters of the cyclin B and NACK1 genes are significantly activated upon expression of NtmybA1 or NtmybA2 (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Doonan J.H. Watanabe A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1891-1905Google Scholar). To determine whether the transactivation activity of NtmybA2 is dependent on the stage of the cell cycle, we performed cotransfection experiments with asynchronously dividing tobacco BY2 cells and with aphidicolin-treated BY2 cells that were arrested at the S phase. We introduced a reporter plasmid that contained the NACK1 promoter fused to a luciferase (LUC) gene (NACK1p-LUC) into BY2 cells by particle bombardment. We tested two different expression plasmids. One encoded the full-length NtmybA2 protein and one encoded a chimeric protein in which the Myb domain of NtmybA2 was fused to the VP16 activation domain (MD-VP16; Fig. 1A). NtmybA2 activated the NACK1p-LUC reporter construct in aphidicolin-treated BY2 cells, but the extent of activation was significantly lower than that observed in untreated cells. By contrast, the MD-VP16 fusion protein activated the NACK1 promoter to a similar extent in aphidicolin-treated cells and untreated cells (Fig. 1B). Our results indicated that the transactivation potential of NtmybA2 is regulated during the cell cycle and that the C-terminal region of NtmybA2 might possibly be a target of the regulation. The Activity of NtmybA2 Is Repressed by Its C-terminal Region—The domain structure of NtmybA2 is shown in Fig. 2A. The Myb domain, localized at the amino terminus, consists of three repeats and is responsible for DNA binding. In the Myb domain, NtmybA2 shows striking similarity to the vertebrate 3Rmyb proteins c-Myb, A-Myb, and B-Myb and to D. melanogaster Myb (12Ito M. Araki S. Matsunaga S. Itoh T. Nishihama R. Ma"

Following synthesis, MD-2 is either secreted directly into the medium as a soluble, active protein, or binds directly to TLR4 in the endoplasmic reticulum before migrating to the cell surface. Here we investigate the function of the secreted form of MD-2. We show that secreted MD-2 irreversibly loses activity over a 24-h period at physiological temperature. LPS, but not lipid A, prevents this loss in activity by forming a stable complex with MD-2, in a CD14-dependent process. Once formed, the stable MD-2·LPS complex activates TLR4 in the absence of CD14 or free LPS indicating that the activating ligand of TLR4 is the MD-2·LPS complex. Finally we show that the MD-2·LPS complex, but not LPS alone, induces epithelial cells, which express TLR4 but not MD-2, to secrete interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. We propose that the soluble MD-2·LPS complex plays a crucial role in the LPS response by activating epithelial and other TLR4+/MD-2- cells in the inflammatory microenvironment.

Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar): LPS binding protein extracts single molecules from LPS micelles and transfers them to CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface receptor that also exists as a serum protein. In turn, the CD14·LPS complex activates two proteins that comprise the essential signaling complex of the LPS response, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MD-2 (3Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y.

However, MD-2 is also secreted into the medium as a soluble, active protein (sMD-2) by primary cells such as immature dendritic cells (iDC), and by MD-2-transfected cell lines (8Visintin A.

The activity of sMD-2 was shown by its ability to bind to TLR4 and confer LPS responsiveness to cells that express TLR4 but lack MD-2 (8Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl.

In addition, it has been shown that CD14 is required for LPS binding to MD-2 (18Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or the TLR4·MD-2 complex (17da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J.

Taken together, these data have suggested a current model in which CD14 delivers LPS to a complex between TLR4 and MD-2, and that this interaction promotes signal transduction (18Visintin A. Latz E.

The purpose of the current investigation is to define the role of soluble MD-2 in the LPS response. We show that sMD-2 is a labile protein that loses most of its activity over a 24-h period at physiological temperature. Treatment with LPS stabilizes sMD-2 in a process that requires CD14, and when purified, the stable MD-2·LPS complex, in the absence of CD14 or free LPS, directly activates TLR4. Finally, we show that the MD-2·LPS complex has the capacity to trigger the release of cytokines by epithelial cells, which express TLR4 but not MD-2, and therefore fail to respond to LPS alone. We conclude that the activating ligand of TLR4 is a complex between LPS and MD-2, and that the soluble form of this complex can play a role in regulating the innate response to LPS. Reagents—The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-His6-horseradish peroxidase mAb (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), anti-FLAG M2 mAb, anti-FLAG M2 mAb peroxidase conjugate, and anti-biotin agarose (Sigma), allophycocyanin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Caltag, Burlingame, CA), anti-bovine CD14 mAb, CAM36A (VMRD, Inc., Pullman, WA), and anti-TLR4 mAb (HTA1216, a gift from Dr. Kensuke Miyake, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Phenol-extracted Salmonella minnesota Re 595 LPS and diphosphoryl lipid A from Escherichia coli F583 (Rd mutant), were from Sigma, and biotin LPS was a gift from Dr. Alberto Visintin (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Recombinant human CD14 (rCD14) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cells—The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). TLR4 reporter cells, HEK293 cells stably expressing human TLR4 and the NF-κB reporter plasmid, ELAM-1-luciferase, were a gift from Dr. Jesse Chow (Eisai Research Institute, Andover, MA). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The protein-free medium HyQ® PF 293 (Hyclone, Logan UT) was used for serum-free conditions. Human conjunctival epithelial cells (HCEC) (21Talreja J. Dileepan K. Filla M. Dileepan K.N. Stechschulte D.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: C57Google Scholar) were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium containing l-glutamine, 10% FBS, 15 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. Human monocyte derived iDC and culture supernatants were produced as described (8Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.H. Wyllie D.H. Dower S.K. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Expression Vectors—pEFBOS-MD-2-FLAG-His, encoding human MD-2 with C-terminal FLAG and His6 sequences, was provided by Dr. Miyake (7Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) and used to produce sMD-2. Human TLR4 and TLR9 fused at their C-terminal ends with enhanced green fluorescent protein (TLR4-GFP and TLR9-GFP), were generated by inserting the TLR in-frame into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Production of sMD-2—Two million HEK293T cells in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were transfected with 5 μg of pEFBOS-MD-2-FLAG-His using calcium phosphate. Control supernatants (mock) were prepared in the same way, except that the plasmid was omitted. After overnight transfection, cells were washed once and 10 ml of fresh medium was added. For production of serum-free sMD-2, the transfected cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and 10 ml of serum-free medium was added. Supernatants were collected 24 h later, centrifuged, and stored at 4 °C. Where indicated, sMD-2 was generated in medium containing 100 ng/ml LPS. MD-2 ELISA—Supernatants containing sMD-2 were added at 100 μl/well to anti-FLAG HS, M2-coated 96-well plates (Sigma), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Anti-His6 horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was added (100 μl per well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 100 μl of TMB substrate solution (R&D Systems) was added. The reaction was stopped using 1 m sulfuric acid (50 μl per well) and absorbance values were measured at 450 nm. MD-2 Activity Assay—TLR4 reporter cells (5 × 104 cells per well) were allowed to adhere in a 96-well tissue culture plate. To initiate the assay, medium was removed and 100 μl of MD-2 supernatant and, where required, 100 ng/ml LPS were added to each well. The cells were incubated 8–16 h at 37 °C, lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activities were determined by using a Luciferase Chemiluminescent assay kit (Promega). Each sample was measured in triplicate, and results are reported as average luciferase units (×10-3) ± S.D. In one experiment, HCEC cells (8 × 104 cells per well in a 48-well plate) were allowed to adhere 2 days, then incubated for 24 h with either LPS (100 ng/ml) or MD-2·LPS complex (1:4 dilution of purified sample) after which IL-6 and IL-8 were determined by ELISA (23Mazzoni A. Young H.A. Spitzer J.H. Visintin A. Segal D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). MD-2 Preincubation Conditions—In some experiments, sMD-2 was either preincubated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h, or produced in medium containing 100 ng/ml LPS, and in these cases, no additional LPS was added at the beginning of the assay. In other experiments, MD-2 samples were preincubated at 37 °C in the absence of LPS, and in these cases 100 ng/ml LPS was added at the beginning of the assay. For background stimulation, LPS was omitted altogether. Immunoprecipitations—For anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations, 1–2 ml of MD-2 containing supernatant was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 4.9 μg of anti-FLAG M2 mAb and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). For the biotin-LPS precipitations, 10 ml of MD-2 containing supernatant were incubated with 100 ng/ml biotin-LPS at 37 °C for 8 h. Supernatants were then incubated with 50 μl of monoclonal anti-biotin-agarose overnight at 4 °C. For all samples, beads were washed, spun, and boiled in either reducing or non-reducing SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 mAb peroxidase conjugate, and developed by using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). TLR4 Binding Assay—HEK293T cells (3 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plate) were transfected overnight with 1 μg of either TLR4-GFP or TLR9-GFP using calcium phosphate. After overnight transfection, cells were washed once and 2 ml of fresh medium was added. After 24 h, medium was replaced with MD-2 supernatants and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, and labeled with 20 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 mAb, 2 μg/ml anti-TLR4, or 2 μg/ml control antibody (MOPC300) followed by 2 μg/ml allophycocyanin-conjugated secondary antibody. The stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and FlowJo software. Purification of sMD-2—sMD-2 was purified by metal affinity chromatography using a 1-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel sulfate according to the manufacturer's protocol. MD-2-containing supernatants were passed through the column in 20–30-ml aliquots at 4 °C. The column was washed with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and the MD-2 was eluted in 3 ml of the same buffer but containing 250 mm imidazole. Purified sMD-2 was dialyzed at 4 °C against medium and filter sterilized before use. MD-2 concentrations were determined as previously described (8Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In brief, one sMD-2 sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and intensities were compared with known concentrations of a C-terminal FLAG-tagged standard protein (FLAG-BAP fusion protein, Sigma). The calculated molar concentration of this sample was used as the standard in an ELISA to determine molar concentrations of all sMD-2 samples. MD-2 Is Unstable at Physiological Temperature—MD-2, an essential component of the LPS signaling pathway, is secreted as a soluble form (sMD-2) that confers LPS responsiveness to cells expressing TLR4 (8Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that preincubation of sMD-2 at 37 °C prior to addition to TLR4 reporter cells resulted in a dramatic loss in activity. As seen in Fig. 1A, after 24 h at 37 °C the capacity of sMD-2 to confer LPS responsiveness to TLR4, as measured by NF-κB activation, decreased by ∼90% when compared with sMD-2 that had been kept at 4 °C (zero time point). During this same period, the amount of sMD-2 in solution remained constant as determined by ELISA and there was no change in apparent molecular weight by SDS-PAGE (data not shown), suggesting that the loss in activity was because of a non-covalent structural transition rather than proteolytic degradation or precipitation. We next asked whether sMD-2 lost the ability to bind either LPS or TLR4 at 37 °C. To examine LPS binding, we incubated sMD-2 with biotin-labeled LPS and immunoprecipitated with anti-biotin; LPS-bound MD-2 was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fig. 1B (upper panel) shows that sMD-2 maintained at 4 °C binds LPS, confirming previous results (9Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (lane 2). By contrast, sMD-2 that had been preincubated at 37 °C failed to bind LPS (lane 4). Immunoprecipitations with anti-FLAG confirmed that similar amounts of sMD-2 protein were present in each sample (Fig. 1B, lower panel). To determine whether the ability of sMD-2 to bind TLR4 was also lost at 37 °C, TLR4 expressing cells were incubated with sMD-2, and cell-bound MD-2 was detected by flow cytometry. As a negative control, sMD-2 was also incubated with cells expressing TLR9. Fig. 1C shows that sMD-2 maintained at 4 °C stained the TLR4 transfectants brightly, but gave weak staining on the TLR9 transfectants, as expected. However, after a 24-h preincubation at 37 °C the sMD-2 exhibited a substantial (85%) decrease in TLR4 binding. Thus, at 37 °C sMD-2 rapidly loses the ability to confer LPS responsiveness to TLR4 reporter cells, accompanied by a loss in LPS and TLR4 binding capacities. LPS Stabilizes MD-2—Because ligand binding often protects proteins from denaturation, we asked whether LPS would stabilize sMD-2 against loss of activity at 37 °C. Accordingly, we preincubated sMD-2 for 24 h at 37 °C with LPS and then assayed the samples for activity. As a control, sMD-2 was preincubated for 24 h without LPS, and LPS was added at the beginning of the activity assay. As seen in Fig. 2A, sMD-2 that had been preincubated with LPS was at least 10-fold more active than the control sample preincubated without LPS, and was as active as sMD-2 that had been kept at 4 °C. Treatment of inactivated (24 h, 37 °C) sMD-2 with LPS for 24 h at 37 °C failed to restore activity, indicating that inactivation at 37 °Cis irreversible (data not shown). To compare recombinant sMD-2 with its endogenously expressed counterpart, we collected conditioned medium from human iDC, a potent source of sMD-2-like activity (8Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.H. Wyllie D.H. Dower S.K. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that iDC supernatants lost activity at 37 °C and addition of LPS prevented this loss. Thus, recombinant sMD-2 closely resembles the endogenously produced protein. We also asked whether lipid A, the toxic portion of LPS (1Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), would stabilize sMD-2. Interestingly, lipid A activated TLR4 when added with sMD-2 to reporter cells but failed to stabilize sMD-2 during a 24-h preincubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2C). This observation suggests that the lipid A portion of LPS is responsible for TLR4 activation, whereas the carbohydrate portion mediates MD-2 stabilization. Because sMD-2 is derived from cells cultured for 24 h at 37 °C, a substantial amount of activity must be lost during production. To prevent this loss in activity, LPS was added to the culture medium of MD-2-transfected cells, and after 24 h supernatants were collected and assayed for activity. Parallel cultures not containing LPS were treated in the same way. The left two clusters in Fig. 3A show that immediately after culture, sMD-2 from the LPS containing supernatant was about 4–8-fold more active than sMD-2 produced in the absence of LPS, as estimated from sMD-2 dilutions giving similar activities. Conversely, these same two samples bound TLR4 to similar extents (Fig. 3B, left 2 clusters), indicating that sMD-2 can bind to TLR4 regardless of whether or not it has associated with LPS. The same sMD-2 samples were then incubated an additional 48 h at 37 °C. Following this incubation, the activity of the sMD-2 produced in LPS had decreased only slightly, whereas sMD-2 cultured in medium lacking LPS was inactive (Fig. 3A, right 2 clusters). The TLR4 binding capacity of sMD-2 also decreased after 48 h incubation at 37 °C, and LPS, in part, prevented this loss (Fig. 3B, right 2 clusters). From these results we can conclude that interaction with LPS prevents the loss of sMD-2 function that would otherwise occur at 37 °C. The MD-2·LPS Complex Triggers TLR4 —In view of our finding that LPS binds and stabilizes sMD-2, we asked whether the sMD-2·LPS complex, by itself, would activate TLR4. Accordingly, sMD-2 produced in LPS-containing cultures was purified by metal affinity chromatography and added in graded concentrations to TLR4 reporter cells. As seen in Fig. 4A, the purified sMD-2·LPS complex activated TLR4 at nanomolar concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, with the same activity as the sample prior to purification. As expected, purified sMD-2 from a culture not containing LPS failed to activate the TLR4 reporter cells, although this sample did activate TLR4 when LPS was added at the time of the assay (data not shown). To control for the possibility that our purification procedure failed to remove free LPS, we subjected supernatants from mock transfected cultures containing LPS (mock/LPS) to the same purification procedure. The purified mock sample was added to TLR4 reporter cells along with supernatants that contained unpurified sMD-2, which was shown to be active in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4B, right bar). If free LPS contaminated the purified mock sample, then combining it with sMD-2 would result in TLR4 activation. However, no activation was observed (Fig. 4B, middle bar), indicating that the amount of LPS remaining after purification was below our limit of detection. Thus, the MD-2·LPS complex activates TLR4 in the absence of free LPS. To demonstrate a physiological relevance for this finding, we treated HCEC with either LPS alone or with the MD-2·LPS complex and measured IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Similar to other types of epithelial cells, the HCEC express TLR4, but not MD-2 (21Talreja J. Dileepan K. Filla M. Dileepan K.N. Stechschulte D.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: C57Google Scholar, 24Abreu M.T.

Fig. 4C shows that HCEC in fact, respond to the sMD-2·LPS complex but not to LPS alone, indicating that the complex is essential for LPS recognition in some cell types. CD14 Is Required for MD-2 Stabilization, but Not for TLR4 Activation by MD-2·LPS—The studies described above were performed in medium containing FBS, which contains soluble CD14. CD14 is known to be required for LPS responsiveness at the low LPS levels used in the current study (25Haziot A. Ferrero E. Kontgen F. Hijiya N. Yamamoto S. Silver J. Stewart C.L. Goyert S.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). To examine the role of CD14 in the stabilization of sMD-2 by LPS, sMD-2, produced in serum-free medium, was preincubated with LPS for 24 h at 37 °C. Recombinant human CD14 (rCD14) was added either before or after the preincubation. As seen in Fig. 5A, sMD-2 displayed activity only when rCD14 was present during the preincubation with LPS. To provide further evidence for the involvement of CD14, we used an anti-bovine CD14 (anti-bCD14) mAb to neutralize the CD14 in serum-containing sMD-2 supernatants (Fig. 5B). When the anti-bCD14 was added before the preincubation with LPS, the stabilization of sMD-2 was inhibited. However, if the anti-bCD14 was added after the preincubation with LPS, there was no change in activity. Taken together, these results suggest that CD14 is required for the interaction between LPS and MD-2, as previously reported (17da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 18Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), but is not required for the activation of TLR4 by the sMD-2·LPS complex (20Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To provide direct evidence for the lack of involvement of CD14 in the interaction between the sMD-2·LPS complex and TLR4, anti-bCD14 mAb was added to purified sMD-2·LPS complex prior to transfer to TLR4 reporter cells. As seen in Fig. 4C, anti-bCD14 failed to block activation, ruling out the possibility that the purified complex contained a CD14 contaminant that was required for the activation of TLR4 by sMD-2·LPS. In the current study we demonstrate that the interaction of LPS with sMD-2 produces a stable, activating ligand for TLR4. Our results, summarized in Fig. 6, show that MD-2 is secreted as a labile molecule that, over a relatively short period of time at 37 °C, irreversibly decays into an inactive form (1Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) that is unable to bind either LPS (2Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar) or TLR4 (3Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). If, however, freshly synthesized sMD-2 is exposed to LPS and CD14, it converts to a stable MD-2·LPS complex (4Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) that is capable of activating TLR4 (5Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Purified MD-2·LPS complex activates TLR4 in the absence of free LPS or CD14. Thus, the MD-2·LPS complex by itself is competent to activate TLR4, and the principal role of CD14 is to aid in the formation of the MD-2·LPS complex, and not to facilitate the transfer of MD-2·LPS to TLR4, or to transfer LPS directly to TLR4. Of interest, a recent report indicates that sMD-2 produced by insect cells also binds LPS and activates TLR4 (20Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both freshly secreted sMD-2 and sMD-2·LPS complex bind to TLR4, but only the complex triggers a response. What, then, is different about the complex that permits it to activate TLR4? One possibility is that LPS induces a conformational change in sMD-2 and this conformation, rather than LPS itself, triggers TLR4. A similar situation occurs with the TLR prototypic receptor, Drosophila Toll, which recognizes protease-induced structural changes in the upstream protein, Spaetzle, rather than the pathogen itself (26Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 27Weber A.N. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.L. Gay N.J. Nat.

Immun. 2002; 70: 3546-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Akashi S. Nagai Y. Ogata H. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Hayashi S. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Int.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) discriminate between lipid A variants, suggesting that TLR4, as well as MD-2, interacts directly with the lipid A portion of LPS. To explain these findings, we prefer a model in which MD-2 “presents” LPS to TLR4, perhaps by directing the lipid A portion of LPS to one of the atypical leucine-rich repeats of TLR4 thought to be involved in ligand binding (28Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lipid A is able to activate TLR4 in the presence of MD-2, but, unlike LPS, does not protect MD-2 from inactivation at 37 °C (Fig. 2C). This suggests that MD-2 contains two functionally discreet binding sites for LPS, one for the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule that is involved in TLR4 activation, and a second site for the carbohydrate portion that mediates MD-2 stabilization. Subsequent to the binding of sMD-2·LPS, TLR4 transduces a signal that initiates inflammatory responses. Previous data suggest that the signaling event itself is the aggregation of TLR4·MD-2 complexes (18Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B.G. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48313-48320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Akashi S. Saitoh S. Wakabayashi Y. Kikuchi T. Takamura N. Nagai Y. Kusumoto Y. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Adachi Y. Kosugi A. Miyake K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), but how the interaction of MD-2·LPS with TLR4 would bring this about at the molecular level remains to be determined. Although many cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and B cells express both TLR4 and MD-2, other cells, such as epithelial cells express TLR4 but little or no MD-2 (21Talreja J. Dileepan K. Filla M. Dileepan K.N. Stechschulte D.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: C57Google Scholar, 29Abreu M.T. Thomas L.S. Arnold E.T. Lukasek K. Michelsen K.S. Arditi M. J. Endotoxin Res. 2003; 9: 322-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have shown, these cells depend upon sMD-2 for the generation of an inflammatory response to LPS. Thus, in microenvironments that are populated with appreciable numbers of TLR4+/MD-2- cells, sMD-2 would play a crucial role in shaping the inflammatory response. Based upon our results with the HCEC cells, we would expect, for example, that MD-2·LPS would induce epithelial cells to secrete IL-8, a chemokine that initiates potent anti-microbial responses by recruiting neutrophils to the site of inflammation. An important prediction for tissues that contain TLR4+/MD-2- cells is that the concentration of active sMD-2 in the interstitial fluids controls their responses to LPS. Presumably sMD-2 concentrations are maintained at low basal levels to guard against overwhelming inflammatory responses to Gram-negative bacteria, and the instability of sMD-2 at physiological temperature may provide a means for limiting its activity. However, at sites of inflammation local concentrations of sMD-2 may be increased, for example, by the recruitment of cells such as immature dendritic cells that secrete high amounts of sMD-2. Although we have dealt with the soluble form of MD-2 in this study, many types of cells co-express TLR4 and MD-2, and in these cells a portion of the MD-2 reaches the cell surface bound to TLR4. An important question posed by our studies is whether the soluble and TLR4-bound forms of MD-2 are similar in structure and function. Specifically, is the TLR4-associated form of MD-2, like its soluble counterpart, unstable at physiological temperature? In addition, does the sMD-2·LPS complex activate cells that express both MD-2 and TLR4? If so, is this mediated by an exchange of the entire MD-2·LPS complex, or of the LPS alone? Studies currently underway to answer these questions should provide important new insights into the biology of the innate response to LPS. We thank Dr. Alberto Visintin for providing us with the biotinylated LPS, Dr. Jessica Bell for help with the diagram, and Drs. Paul Roche and Jessica Bell for suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript."

A contemporary view of this process is that in so-called type II cells death receptor-activated caspase-8 cleaves the Bcl-2 family member Bid, which generates a truncated Bid fragment that collaborates with Bax, another Bcl-2 relative, to promote the release of mitochondrial factors necessary for activation of executioner caspases and apoptosis. Here we show that in some type II cells caspase-2 is necessary for optimal TRAIL-mediated cleavage of Bid. Down-regulation of caspase-2 using RNA interference significantly inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

TRAIL/Apo2L is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily that induces apoptosis through the death receptor or extrinsic apoptosis pathway (1LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar).

Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is believed to play an obligatory role in apoptosis initiation by death receptors, whereas the role of caspase-10, the only other caspase containing a death effector domain, remains controversial (3Sprick M.R. Rieser E. Stahl H. Grosse-Wilde A. Weigand M.A. Walczak H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4520-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, death receptor-activated caspase-8 can lead directly to the activation of downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3 in so-called type I cells (4Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In type II cells, the two prototypical pathways, extrinsic (death receptor) and intrinsic (mitochondrial), are interconnected by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid, producing a truncated Bid (tBid) fragment that promotes the mitochondrial release of the proapoptotic factors cytochrome c and Smac (6Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Once released into the cytoplasm, cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 to form the “apoptosome,” which leads to the activation of pro-caspase-9 and subsequent activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7. In parallel, mitochondrial-released Smac binds to members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family and thereby prevents IAP inhibition of caspase-3, -7, and -9 (7Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar, 8Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Historically, the placement of caspase-2 in these prototypical cell death pathways has been lacking (10Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of a severe phenotype in caspase-2-deficient mice (11Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) has lead to speculation that this enzyme does not play as significant a role in apoptosis as other family members. Nevertheless, several research groups (12Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 13Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A.

Orrenius S. J. Biol.

Ekert P. Harvey N. Marsden V. Cullen L. Vaux D.L. Hacker G. Magnusson C. Pakusch M. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Strasser A. Huang D.C. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have suggested that activation of this cell death enzyme occurs downstream of the mitochondria. Thus, the placement of caspase-2 in apoptosis pathways is controversial, and the exact function, mode of activation, and regulation of caspase-2 remain unknown. To further elucidate the TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway, we designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) toward many genes that reportedly play a role in apoptosis and used them as controls in siRNA library screens (16Deveraux Q.L. Aza-Blanc P. Wagner K.W. Cooke M.P. Hampton G.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Aza-Blanc P. Cooper C.L. Wagner K. Batalov S. Deveraux Q.L. Cooke M.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). During the development and validation of these siRNAs, we found that silencing caspase-2 expression suppressed TRAIL-induced apoptosis in several cell lines. Using siRNAs that specifically block distinct steps in the TRAIL pathway allowed us to place caspase-2 upstream of Bid cleavage in some cell types. Moreover, we provide evidence that caspase-2 activity but not its proteolytic processing is necessary for its role in Bid cleavage. Thus, for the first time, we reveal the involvement of caspase-2 in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and define the localization of caspase-2 within this pathway. Reagents—Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Soluble recombinant human TRAIL/Apo2L, composed of residues 114–281 was purchased from Calbiochem, and all other chemicals (including etoposide and staurosporine) were from Sigma. The DR5-specific agonist antibody was isolated from a functional screen for DR5 receptor-mediated cell killing. 2M. Nasoff and D. Knee, manuscript in preparation. Cell Culture and Cell Lines—The HCT116 human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, which either contain one intact Bax allele (Bax+/- genotype) or are Bax-deficient (Bax-/- genotype) (18Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), were kind gifts of Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The T3M4 human pancreatic cancer cells were kindly provided by Andreas Marti and Hans Graber (University of Bern, Switzerland). HeLa human cervix adenocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. siRNA Design and Transfection Protocol—The siRNAs against caspase-2, caspase-8, Bid, and XIAP were designed using three independent selection programs from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), Ambion, and Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (siRNA Picker), using published standard criteria, and the caspase-2 (cDNA position 94 (siC2-94)) was published by Lassus et al. (12Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The selected sequences were: siCaspase-2, cDNA position 510 (siC2–510): 5′-AA-CTTCCAGCTGGCATATAGG-dTdT-3′; siCaspase-8: 5′-AA-GGGUCAUGCUCUAUCAGAU-dTdT-3′; siBid: 5′-AA-GAAGACAUCAUCCGGAAUA-dTdT-3′; and siXIAP: 5′-AA-GGAGAUACCGUGCGGUGCU-dTdT-3′. siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon as double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides and transfected into the respective cell lines using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) at concentrations of 800 ng of siRNA plus 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000/1 × 105 cells/ml in a 6-well plate format with a final volume of 2 ml and reduced accordingly for the 96-well format. siRNA duplexes against luciferase GL3 RNA were used as a control (5′-AA-CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA-dTdT-3′). Cell Viability Assays—The MTT assay, which is a colorimetric assay based on the ability of viable cells to reduce a soluble yellow tetrazolium salt (MTT) to blue formazan crystals, was used to determine the amount of viable cells after down-regulation of specific genes with the respective siRNAs for 48 h followed by incubation with recombinant human TRAIL, agonistic anti-DR5 antibodies, and etoposide or staurosporine for an additional 24 h. Afterward, MTT dye solution was added for 4 h, the blue crystal product was solubilized overnight at 37 °C, and absorbance was measured at 570 nm. Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with different siRNAs for 48 h followed by treatment with TRAIL for 1, 3, or 6 h. After the indicated periods of time, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 containing hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCL, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). For each sample, 40 μg of protein was separated under reducing conditions on 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), the membranes were incubated for 1 h in 10% nonfat milk powder followed by a 1-h incubation with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-caspase-2 antibody (1:1000, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibody (1:1000, Pharmingen), rabbit anti-caspase-8 antibody (1:1000, Pharmingen), mouse anti-caspase-9 antibody 5B4 (1:1000) and mouse anti-caspase-10 antibody 4C1 (1:1000; MBL International Corp.), and rabbit anti-Bid antibody (1:1000, Pharmingen) or goat anti-actin antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween and then incubated with the respective peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified secondary antibody (1:5000, Bio-Rad) for 30 min. The membranes were washed again five times and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Kodak Biomax films. Caspase Assays—Caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities were assayed as described previously (4Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in 40 μl of caspase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 μm fluorogenic peptide Ac-DEVD-AFC. Activity was measured at the indicated times by the release of AFC from DEVD-AFC using a Molecular Devices fluorometer in the kinetic mode and with the 405-510 filter pair. For the assessment of caspase activity, 20 μg of total cell protein (Triton X-100 extracts) was used in 40 μl of caspase buffer (containing 100 μm DEVD-AFC). Silencing Caspase-2 Expression with Small Interfering RNAs Inhibits TRAIL-induced Cell Death—Several siRNAs that previously have been shown to specifically down-regulate their intended targets caspase-8 (17Aza-Blanc P. Cooper C.L. Wagner K. Batalov S. Deveraux Q.L. Cooke M.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), Bid (17Aza-Blanc P. Cooper C.L. Wagner K. Batalov S. Deveraux Q.L. Cooke M.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), caspase-2 (12Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and XIAP (16Deveraux Q.L. Aza-Blanc P. Wagner K.W. Cooke M.P. Hampton G.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected into HCT116 human colon adenocarcinoma cells to test their ability to suppress or enhance TRAIL-induced reduction in cell viability (Fig. 1, A and B). As would be expected for a type II cell line, siCaspase-8 and siBid protected, whereas siXIAP slightly enhanced, TRAIL-mediated reduction in cell viability. Notably, siCaspase-2 exhibited significant protection against TRAIL-induced cell death. Pretreating HCT116 cells with siCaspase-2 decreased TRAIL-induced apoptosis by at least 30%, whereas silencing caspase-8 or Bid inhibited TRAIL-mediated reduction in cell viability by ∼80 and 70%, respectively (Fig. 1A). The differences in magnitude of apoptosis suppression mediated by these siRNAs may reflect their differential efficacies, the protein half-lives of their targets, or the necessity for each of these proteins in the TRAIL pathway in this cell type. Regardless, these data implicate caspase-2 as a component of TRAIL-mediated cell death at least in HCT116 cells. The siRNA-targeting caspase-2 used in the experiments described above was rigorously characterized by Lassus et al. (12Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we designed a second siRNA-targeting caspase-2 to further validate our results. These two independent non-overlapping siRNAs were tested for their ability to diminish caspase-2 protein and influence TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Both siRNAs directed toward caspase-2 significantly inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death (Fig. 1C) and changes in cell morphology such as detachment, nuclear condensation, and production of apoptotic bodies (data not shown), which confirmed our previous results. Moreover, each caspase-2-specific siRNA efficiently silenced caspase-2 protein expression but not the expression of other proteins that were analyzed (Fig. 1, B and C; data for caspase-9 and -3 not shown). These data indicate that our results are not attributable to siRNA “off-target” effects or an RNA interference-induced interferon response, because two distinct non-overlapping siRNAs against caspase-2 exhibited a similar phenotype compared with control siRNAs and showed a specific down-regulation of caspase-2 among the caspase protein family members assessed. Reported concerns about nonspecific cytotoxicity with recombinant versions of human TRAIL, particularly with polyhistidine-tagged preparations (19Lawrence D. Shahrokh Z. Marsters S. Achilles K. Shih D. Mounho B. Hillan K. Totpal K. DeForge L. Schow P. Hooley J. Sherwood S. Pai R. Leung S. Khan L. Gliniak B. Bussiere J. Smith C. Strom S. Kelley S. Fox J. Thomas D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), prompted us to repeat our experiments with DR5-specific agonistic antibodies (DR5-A). These antibodies bind and activate DR5 but not other tumor necrosis factor receptors including DR4 and the TRAIL decoy receptors DcR1 and DcR2 (20Wagner K.W. King F. Nomoto K. Knee D.A. Hampton G. Nasoff M. Deveraux Q.L. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous studies using recombinant TRAIL, siCaspase-2 also suppressed DR5-A-mediated reduction in cell viability (Fig. 1D). To further evaluate the functional role of caspase-2 in apoptosis, we tested whether siCaspase-2 would also inhibit other agents that induce cell death. For these studies we used etoposide, a DNA-damaging topoisomerase II inhibitor, and staurosporine, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor. In contrast to TRAIL and DR5-A-induced apoptosis, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of caspase-2, caspase-8, or Bid did not inhibit etoposide- or staurosporine-mediated cell death pathways in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1, E and F). These results may suggest that caspase-2 functions upstream of the mitochondria in the TRAIL pathway because the TRAIL, staurosporine, and DNA damage cell death pathways reportedly share the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of downstream executioner caspases-3 and -7 but differ in events upstream of the mitochondria (5Barnhart B.C.

Clin. 2001; 19: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover these data indicate that the reported role of caspase-2 in stress-induced apoptosis (12Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) is cell-specific. Inhibitory Effect of siCaspase-2 for TRAIL-induced Apoptosis Is Cell Type-dependent—To determine whether our results were restricted to a single cell line, we expanded our study to include T3M4 human pancreatic cancer cells and HeLa human cervix adenocarcinoma cells. These cell lines were chosen because they were easily transfectable with siRNA oligonucleotides and were sensitive to TRAIL or DR5-A. siCaspase-2 suppressed TRAIL-induced cell death in T3M4 cells, again, to a slightly lesser extent than siCaspase-8 or siBid (Fig. 2A). In contrast to HCT116 and T3M4, HeLa cells did not require caspase-2 for TRAIL-induced apoptosis but were clearly dependent on caspase-8 and Bid (Fig. 2B). Thus, some but not all type II cells require the presence of caspase-2 for optimal TRAIL-induced cell death. siRNA Mapping of the TRAIL Cell Death Pathway—Silencing caspase-2 expression not only inhibited TRAIL-mediated reduction in cell viability assays it also suppressed caspase activation, the biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. Transfection of siCaspase-8, siBid, and siCaspase-2 but not control siRNAs inhibited TRAIL-mediated cell rounding and detachment in HCT116 cells (not shown) and caspase activation as measured by hydrolysis of the executioner caspase substrate DEVD-AFC (Fig. 3A). To define the position of caspase-2 in the TRAIL pathway, however, we examined caspase processing in these cells by Western blot analysis. In cells treated with the control siRNA, complete proteolytic processing of caspase-8 occurred beginning as early as 1 h after the addition of TRAIL (Fig. 3A). Based on a type II mechanism (5Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), active caspase-8 in turn cleaves the Bcl-2 family protein Bid. The resulting tBid promotes the mitochondrial release of Smac and cytochrome c. In the cytosol, cytochrome c catalyzes the formation of an Apaf-1·pro-caspase-9 complex, which facilitates caspase-9 autocatalytic processing and activation. Although active caspase-8 and -9 can directly process caspase-3, complete maturation and activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3 require mitochondrial release of Smac (22Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), which relieves IAP-mediated inhibition of these enzymes (7Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). This TRAIL-induced proteolytic cascade was readily observed by Western blot analysis in control siRNA-transfected cells treated with TRAIL (Fig. 3A, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac not pictured). Following siRNA-mediated reduction of caspase-8, TRAIL failed to induce Bid cleavage, and subsequent downstream proteolytic events were blocked (Fig. 3A). siBid treatment allowed caspase-8 activation but prevented the release of mitochondrial factors such as cytochrome c and Smac (data not shown) and caspase-9 processing (Fig. 3A). In TRAIL-treated cells that were transfected with siBid, active caspase-8 can initially cleave pro-caspase-3 to the p24 form of its large subunit (Fig. 3A). Complete processing to the active, mature p20 and p17 subunits, however, was blocked because this requires tBid-mediated release of mitochondrial factors, such as Smac (22Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These observations are in accordance with the lack of caspase-3 and -7 activity in TRAIL-treated cells in which caspase-8 or Bid expression was silenced by siRNA (Fig. 3A) and are consistent with numerous reports using a variety of other methods that have ordered or “mapped” the receptor-mediated type II cell mechanism for activation of executioner caspases (5Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 23Ozoren N. El-Deiry W.S. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) Caspase-2 Is Interconnected between Caspase-8 Activation and Bid Cleavage—siRNA-mediated silencing of caspase-2 expression allowed full caspase-8 activation but clearly diminished Bid cleavage and further events that are dependent on tBid, such as caspase-9 activation and complete maturation of caspase-3 (Fig. 3A). Concordantly, TRAIL-induced enzymatic caspase-3 and -7 activity in siCaspase-2-transfected cells was reduced by ∼60%, respectively (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that caspase-2 is required upstream of Bid in the TRAIL pathway. Similar to siCaspase-2-treated cells, cellular exposure to the substrate-based caspase-2 inhibitor Z-VDVAD-fmk suppressed TRAIL-induced Bid cleavage without influencing TRAIL-induced caspase-8 autocatalytic processing (Fig. 3B). Although data obtained using these peptidyl-based caspase inhibitors should be interpreted with caution because they lack absolute specificity, these results suggest that caspase-2 activity, rather than its presence alone, is required for Bid processing. Combined, these data place caspase-2 below caspase-8 but upstream of Bid cleavage in the TRAIL apoptosis pathway. In accordance with the role of caspase-2 proposed above, caspase-2 cleavage was not detected in TRAIL-treated cells containing siRNAs targeting caspase-8 (Fig. 3A). Caspase-2 cleavage, however, was also suppressed in Bid-silenced cells (Fig. 3A), which points to the proteolytic processing of caspase-2 occurring downstream of Bid cleavage, whereas our data indicate that caspase-2 functions prior to Bid cleavage. This could occur if proteolytic processing of caspase-2 were not required for its activation, which has been reported for other caspases (2Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H.

To examine this idea, we used Bax-deficient HCT116 cells (HCT116 Bax-/-) (18Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Because tBid requires association with Bax for mitochondrial release of Smac and cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of downstream executioner caspases, HCT116 Bax-/- cells are TRAIL-resistant (22Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 25LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Consistent with those data, we found that Bax deficiency had little affect on TRAIL-induced caspase-8 processing and subsequent cleavage of Bid but clearly suppressed caspase-9 processing (Fig. 4) and the maturation and activity of caspase-3 (data not shown), compared with the TRAIL-treated parental HCT116 Bax+/- cell line (Fig. 4). Similar to siBid-transfected HCT116 Bax+/- cells treated with TRAIL (Fig. 3A), caspase-2 processing was suppressed in TRAIL-treated HCT116 Bax-/- cells (Fig. 4). Notably, silencing of caspase-2 again suppressed TRAIL-induced Bid cleavage in these cells (Fig. 4). Based on these results, we propose that caspase-2 activity is required prior to Bid cleavage, whereas caspase-2 processing requires events downstream of Bax. Caspase-2 has not generated the same amount of interest as other family members, such as caspase-3, -8, or -9, in part because caspase-2 knock-out mice lack a severe phenotype. Recent reports implicating caspase-2 in stress-induced apoptosis, however, have suggested that these extrapolations based on genetically engineered mice may have underestimated the role of caspase-2 in apoptosis (12Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that caspase-2 is required for optimal TRAIL/Apo2L-induced cell death in certain type II cells. We show that down-regulation of caspase-2 using RNA interference significantly inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 human colon and T3M4 pancreatic cancer cells but not in HeLa cervical carcinoma cell lines. The molecular basis for why some cells require caspase-2 but others do not is unclear. Notably, however, deficiency in caspase-9 or caspase-3 reportedly induces compensatory caspase activation (26Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Momoi T. Srinivasan A. Nicholson D.W. Lazebnik Y. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus, the necessity of caspase-2 among cell types or populations may reflect distinct defects in apoptotic pathways arising during oncogenesis, which dictate the differential requirement for cell death components such as caspase-2. Although Lassus et al. (12Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) reported a role for caspase-2 in DNA damage-induced apoptosis using similar reagents, down-regulation of caspase-2 did not block etoposide-induced cell death in the cell lines we tested. Based on our results, however, the requirement for caspase-2 is clearly cell type-dependent, which may explain this discrepancy. Nevertheless, both studies point to a role for caspase-2 in the release of mitochondrial factors leading to the proteolytic processing of caspase-9 and the maturation of active caspase-3. Our data define that role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which implicates caspase-2 as necessary for optimal Bid cleavage in some type II cells. Consistent with these data, Alnemri and co-workers (13Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) found that caspase-2 engages the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by inducing the release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial apoptogenic factors into the cell cytoplasm. Moreover, using in vitro assays, these investigators found that physiological levels of purified caspase-2 cleaved cytosolic Bid protein, which in turn triggered the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria (13Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that our data do not address whether the role of caspase-2 in Bid processing is direct or indirect. Caspase-2 processing reportedly can be blocked by the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO or caspase-3, caspase-9, or Apaf-1 deficiency, which has led to the notion that caspase-2 functions downstream of the mitochondria and apoptosome formation (15O'Reilly L.A. Ekert P. Harvey N. Marsden V. Cullen L. Vaux D.L. Hacker G. Magnusson C. Pakusch M. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Strasser A. Huang D.C. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our results show that in TRAIL-treated cells, proteolytic cleavage of caspase-2 was not detected in cells with diminished Bid levels or in Bax-deficient HCT116 Bax-/- cells, which indeed places the processing of caspase-2 downstream of the mitochondria and activation of caspase-3. Silencing caspase-2 expression using siRNA or inhibition of its activity with Z-VDVAD-fmk, however, suppressed TRAIL-induced Bid cleavage and subsequent mitochondrial dependent events. Although these peptidyl-based caspase inhibitors lack absolute specificity, our data taken together support the idea that in some cell types caspase-2 is required for optimal Bid cleavage; however, caspase-2 proteolytic processing is dependent upon activities downstream of Bax (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, caspase-2 interdomain cleavage may indeed play a significant physiological role, for example, in stabilization of the active form of caspase-2, which is a proposed mode of activation for initiator caspases (2Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 27Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Thus, caspase-2 cleavage by downstream executioner caspases may facilitate a positive feedback mechanism (Fig. 5). As introduced above, two modes of caspase activation have been proposed (2Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). For executioner caspases like caspase-3 and -7, an active site is generated by interdomain cleavage (2Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). For initiator caspases like caspase-8 and -9, an active site is formed when inactive monomers are dimerized by macromolecular interactions, such as those organized in the DISC or in the apoptosome, and subsequent interdomain cleavage facilitates dimer stability (2Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of caspase-2 activation is unclear, our data indicate that initially it is not activated by the executioner caspase mode of interdomain cleavage. Caspase-2 and caspase-9 are the only caspases containing a CARD domain, which at least for caspase-9 has been shown to facilitate its recruitment to the apoptosome. Similarly, it is possible that the caspase-2 mode of activation takes place through dimerization in macromolecular complexes, which might be facilitated by its CARD-CARD domain interactions, such as those reported with RAIDD (28Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which also contains a death domain (DD), or with the CARD-containing DEFCAP protein (29Hlaing T. Guo R.F.

Consistent with this hypothesis are recent reports showing that caspase-2 is recruited to a large protein complex that contains neither cytochrome c nor Apaf-1 but is sufficient for caspase-2 activation (30Read S.H. Baliga B.C. Ekert P.G. Vaux D.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 9: 739-745Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Importantly, caspase-2 activation did not require interdomain cleavage (30Read S.H. Baliga B.C. Ekert P.G. Vaux D.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 9: 739-745Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In summary, we show for the first time that caspase-2 is involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in different human cancer cell lines. Mapping of the TRAIL-signaling pathway by Western blot analysis after siRNA-mediated silencing of caspase-8 and Bid revealed that caspase-2 is interconnected between caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage. Moreover, we provide evidence that caspase-2 processing is not necessary for its role in Bid cleavage. Based on our observations, we propose that caspase-2 is another point of regulation in the TRAIL death receptor pathway in certain type II cells.

https://openalex.org/W2131375669,"Manganese is known to cause central nervous system injury leading to parkinsonism and to contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Although mechanisms of manganese neurotoxicity are not completely understood, chronic exposure of various cell types to manganese has shown oxidative stress and mitochondrial energy failure, factors that are often implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). In this study, we examined whether exposure of cultured neurons and astrocytes to manganese induces the MPT. Cells were treated with manganese acetate (10–100 μm), and the MPT was assessed by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and in mitochondrial calcein fluorescence. In astrocytes, manganese caused a dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased the mitochondrial calcein fluorescence in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These changes were completely blocked by pretreatment with cyclosporin A, consistent with induction of the MPT. On the other hand, similarly treated cultured cortical neurons had a delayed or reduced MPT as compared with astrocytes. The manganese-induced MPT in astrocytes was blocked by pretreatment with antioxidants, suggesting the potential involvement of oxidative stress in this process. Induction of the MPT by manganese and associated mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes may represent key mechanisms in manganese neurotoxicity.

Induction of the MPT by manganese and associated mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes may represent key mechanisms in manganese neurotoxicity. Manganese is an essential element and an integral component of key enzymes such as glutamine synthetase and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; CsA, cyclosporin A, ΔΨm; mitochondrial inner membrane potential; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DFX, deferoxamine; HBSS, Hank's balanced salt solution; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester. (1Wedler F.C. Toms R. Schramm V.L. Wedler F.C. Manganese in Metabolism and Enzyme Function. Academic Press, New York1986: 221-238Google Scholar). However, excess deposition of manganese in the central nervous system often leads to neurological abnormalities, including manganism, the symptoms of which (hypokinesis, rigidity, and tremor) resemble Parkinson's disease (2Pal K.P.A. Samii A. Calne D.B. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 227-238Google Scholar). Manganism is an occupational health problem in workers employed in welding factories, manganese mines, and ferro-alloy plants (3Kaiser J. Science. 2003; 300: 927Google Scholar). In addition, the widespread use of the manganese derivative methylcyclopentadienyl manganese as an anti-knock agent in gasoline has evolved into a major environmental issue (4Kaiser J. Science. 2003; 300: 926-928Google Scholar). Further, manganese toxicity has been implicated in the mechanism of hepatic encephalopathy, a neurological condition associated with chronic liver failure (5Pomier-Layrargues G. Spahr L. Butterworth R.F. Lancet. 1995; 345: 735Google Scholar, 6Kreiger D. Kreiger S. Jansen O. Gass P. Theimann L. Lichtnecker H. Lancet. 1995; 346: 270-274Google Scholar). The mechanisms of manganese neurotoxicity are not completely understood. Several reports propose that manganese neurotoxicity is mainly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (7Verity M.A. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 489-497Google Scholar), leading to decreased oxidative phosphorylation (8Gavin C.E. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Toxicol. Appl. Phamacol. 1992; 115: 1-5Google Scholar). Manganese has also been shown to induce oxidative stress (9Sun A.Y. Yang W.L. Kim H.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 679: 358-363Google Scholar, 10Desole M.S. Esposito G. Migheli R. Fresu L. Sircana S. Miele M. De Natale G. Miele E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 192: 73-76Google Scholar, 11Chen C.J. Liao S.L. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 175: 216-225Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is considered a major factor in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) (12Castilho R.F. Kowaltowski A.J. Meinicke A.R. Bechara E.J.H. Vercesi A.E. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 479-486Google Scholar, 13Halestrap A.P. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Google Scholar). The MPT is a Ca+2-dependent process often associated with various other factors (14Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Google Scholar). The MPT is characterized by opening of the permeability transition pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane, resulting in increased permeability of this membrane to protons, ions, and other solutes ≤1500 Da. This increased permeability leads to a collapse of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm), colloid osmotic swelling of the mitochondrial matrix, defective oxidative phosphorylation, and cessation of ATP synthesis, ultimately resulting in mitochondrial failure (15Gunter T.E. Gunter K.E. Sheu S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 267: C313-C339Google Scholar). The MPT is characteristically blocked by cyclosporin A (CsA) (16Crompton M. Costi A. Hayat L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 915-918Google Scholar). Because manganese toxicity is associated with oxidative stress, a major inducer of the MPT, we examined the possible role of the MPT in the mechanism of manganese neurotoxicity. The MPT was assessed in cultured astrocytes and neurons after exposure to different concentrations of manganese acetate for variable time points. Materials—TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester) and calcein/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were from Sigma and were of analytical grade. Astrocyte Cultures—Primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from cerebral cortices of 1–2-day-old rats. Briefly, cortices were freed of meninges, minced and dissociated by trituration, passed through sterile nylon sieves, and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing penicillin, streptomycin, and 15% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 0.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 35-mm culture plates and maintained at 37 °C in an incubator equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cultures consisted of 95–99% astrocytes based on immunohistochemical staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein. 3–5-week-old cells were used for experiments. For each experiment, 6–8 culture plates were selected randomly from at least two different seeding batches. Astrocyte cultures were exposed to different concentrations of manganese acetate (10–100 μm) for 3–48 h. Neuronal Cultures—Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared by a modification of the method of Hertz and Martz (17Hertz L. Martz H. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 755-760Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were removed from 16–18-day-old rat fetuses and placed in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm KCl and 20% horse serum. The tissue was minced and mechanically dissociated with a pipette. Approximately 1–2 × 106 cells/ml were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm culture dishes. To prevent proliferation of astrocytes, cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added for 24 h to the culture medium 48 h after seeding. These cultures consisted of at least 95% neurons as determined by immunohistochemical staining for neurofilament protein; the remaining cells were astrocytes. Experiments were performed on cultures that were 6–8-days-old. Measurement of ΔΨm—The ΔΨm was measured with the fluorescent dye TMRE as previously described (18Rama Rao K.V. Jayakumar A.R. Norenberg M.D. Metab. Brain. Dis. 2003; 18: 113-127Google Scholar, 19Norenberg M.D. Rama Rao K.V. Jayakumar A.R. Jones E.A Meijer A.F. Chamuleau R.A.F.M. Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism in Liver Failure. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2003: 267-285Google Scholar). At the end of treatment, the culture medium was removed (duplicate plates per experiment; repeated two times), and the cells were loaded with TMRE in DMEM without phenol red and serum at a final concentration of 50 nm for 20 min. The cells were rinsed with DMEM and examined with a Nikon Diaphot inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with multivariant fluorescent filters. The fluorescence emission was recorded at 590 nm. At least 20 image fields with a similar degree of cell density in each experimental group were randomly captured with a cooled digital camera and the fluorescent intensities analyzed using the NIH software (Scion Incorporation, Frederick, MD). In each image field, the total number of pixels was quantified on a gray scale (0–255 counts). The mean pixel value in each image field was obtained and expressed as mean ± S.E. of the total number of mean pixel values in each experimental group. The fluorescent intensities were expressed as percent fluorescence change over control. To ensure that the total number of cells in each field was indeed similar, pilot studies were carried out in which nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (2 μm). The mean pixel value was obtained as above, the value was normalized to the total number of nuclei in the respective fields, and the results were compared with that of the procedure described above. The percent changes in the fluorescent intensities between control and experimental groups were identical when either approach was employed. To rule out the possibility that manganese directly quenches TMRE fluorescence (i.e. independent of the MPT), we incubated medium containing TMRE (50 nm) with 100 μm manganese acetate for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was measured spectrofluorometrically at an excitation λ 485 and emission λ 590. Manganese had no effect on medium TMRE fluorescence (data not shown). Mitochondrial Permeability Using Calcein Fluorescence—To demonstrate induction of the MPT, calcein fluorescence studies were carried out as previously described (18Rama Rao K.V. Jayakumar A.R. Norenberg M.D. Metab. Brain. Dis. 2003; 18: 113-127Google Scholar, 20Rama Rao K.V. Jayakumar A.R. Norenberg M.D. Neurochem. Int. 2003; 43: 517-523Google Scholar) following the method of Petronilli et al. (21Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa M. Biophys. J. 1999; 765: 725-754Google Scholar). This method allows one to directly visualize permeability changes in mitochondria in situ. Calcein/acetoxymethyl ester enters the cells and becomes fluorescent upon de-esterification. Co-loading of cells with cobalt chloride quenches the fluorescence in the cell, except in mitochondria, because cobalt is impermeable across mitochondrial membranes. However, during induction of the MPT, cobalt enters mitochondria and is able to quench the mitochondrial calcein fluorescence. At the end of manganese treatment (24 h), cultures were washed three to four times in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS; 144 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in fresh HBSS containing calcein/acetoxymethyl ester (1 μm) and cobalt chloride (1 mm) for 20 min. Following cobalt quenching, cultures were washed with HBSS, and images were collected within 30 min as described above. We have validated this method in cultured astrocytes by the addition of 500 μm CaCl2 along with the calcium ionophore A23187 (3 μm) to cultures (in HBSS) previously loaded with calcein and Co2+. The addition of calcium caused a significant decrease in the mitochondrial calcein fluorescence in a time-dependent manner (data not shown), consistent with the earlier report by Petronilli et al. (21Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa M. Biophys. J. 1999; 765: 725-754Google Scholar). To confirm that manganese has no effect on the loading of calcein into astrocytes, which otherwise would confound our results, astrocytes were incubated for 20 min in HBSS containing 1 μm calcein/acetoxymethyl ester but without CoCl2 in the presence or absence of manganese (100 μm). Images of normal and manganese-treated astrocytes were captured and subjected to fluorescence quantitation as described above. The results showed no difference in the fluorescent intensity in astrocytes in the presence or absence of manganese, indicating that manganese had no effect on calcein loading into astrocytes (data not shown). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Neuman-Keuls multiple test. Effect of Manganese on the ΔΨm in Cultured Astrocytes—To determine whether manganese treatment of cultured astrocytes was associated with a change in the ΔΨm, a consequence of the MPT, we treated astrocytes with various concentrations of manganese acetate (10–100 μm) for 3–24 h and determined the ΔΨm by TMRE fluorescence. Astrocytes exposed to 100 μm manganese showed a progressive dissipation of the ΔΨm as demonstrated by decreased TMRE fluorescence (Fig. 1). At 30 and 60 min, no change in TMRE fluorescence was observed, whereas at 90 min there was 20% (p < 0.05) reduction, which further declined to 50% (p < 0.01) at 3 h. This decline was maintained for up to 12 h. These changes in TMRE fluorescence were prevented by pretreatment with CsA (1 μm), consistent with induction of the MPT. Treatment of astrocytes with lower concentrations of manganese (10–25 μm) also dissipated the ΔΨm, but the effect was delayed and of lesser magnitude. For example, at 25 μm manganese concentration, dissipation of the ΔΨm was not evident until 12 h, the magnitude of which was less compared with 100 μm (Fig. 2). Similarly, 10 μm manganese showed a significant decrease in the ΔΨm only at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2). We further examined whether manganese was causing severe cell injury or death that might explain the collapse of the ΔΨm. Cells were exposed to manganese (25–100 μm) for 1 day, fixed in 10% neutral formalin for 30 min, stained with May-Grunwald/Giemsa and examined by light microscopy. Manganese at the concentrations and time employed above did not cause morphological alterations in cultured astrocytes (data not shown). Effect of Manganese on the ΔΨm in Neurons—Cultured neurons, even after exposure to 100 μm manganese, showed relatively little decrease in the ΔΨm, and the time course of this reduction was delayed as compared with astrocytes. At 3 h, manganese had no effect on TMRE fluorescence, whereas at 6 h a reduction in TMRE fluorescence was detected, but the extent of this decrease was far less compared with astrocytes (Fig. 3). The extent of decrease in mitochondrial calcein fluorescence was similar to that of TMRE fluorescence (data not shown). Effect of Manganese on the MPT in Astrocytes Using Calcein Fluorescence—We also employed the calcein fluorescence method to demonstrate the induction of the MPT. The findings in mitochondrial calcein fluorescence were similar to that observed with TMRE. Astrocytes exposed to 100 μm manganese showed a progressive dissipation of calcein fluorescence. At 30 and 60 min, no change in fluorescence was detected, whereas at 90 min there was a 20% (p < 0.05) reduction, which further declined to 50% (p < 0.01) at 3 h and remained at that level for up to 12 h (Fig. 4). This decrease of calcein fluorescence was also prevented by CsA (1 μm). Studies employing a lower concentration (10 and 25 μm) of manganese also paralleled the TMRE findings (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Quantitation of calcein fluorescence intensities.

DFX completely blocked the decrease in TMRE and calcein fluorescence in manganese-exposed astrocytes, whereas SOD and vitamin E partially blocked this effect (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).Fig. 7Effect of antioxidants on TMRE fluorescence intensities in cultured astrocytes.

These changes were completely blocked by pretreatment with CsA, indicating the involvement of the MPT in this process. The concentrations (25–100 μm) of manganese employed in the present study correspond to levels found in autopsied brains from patients with cirrhosis, a condition associated with deposition of high levels of manganese in the basal ganglia (5Pomier-Layrargues G. Spahr L. Butterworth R.F. Lancet. 1995; 345: 735Google Scholar, 6Kreiger D. Kreiger S. Jansen O. Gass P. Theimann L. Lichtnecker H. Lancet. 1995; 346: 270-274Google Scholar). Neurons exposed to high concentrations of manganese (100 μm) showed only a slight induction of the MPT as compared with astrocytes. The reason for the selective vulnerability of astrocytes to manganese is not known. Aschner et al. (22Aschner M. Gannon M. Kimelberg H.K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 730-735Google Scholar) and Tholey et al. (23Tholey G. Ledig M. Mandel P. Sargentini L. Frivold A.H. Leroy M. Grippo A.A. Wedler F.C. Neurochem. Res. 1987; 12: 45-50Google Scholar) have reported the presence of high affinity transporters for free manganese in astrocytes as well as the high capacity of astrocytes to accumulate manganese. In neurons, on the other hand, transferrin-bound manganese is preferentially transported rather than free manganese (24Suarez N. Eriksson H. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 127-131Google Scholar, 25Takeda A. Brain. Res. Rev. 2003; 41: 79-87Google Scholar). Therefore, readily available free manganese in astrocytes may be one reason for the greater vulnerability of astrocytes over neurons to manganese toxicity. Alternatively, because most of the manganese resides in mitochondria (26Wedler F.C. Ley B.W. Grippo A.A. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 1129-1135Google Scholar), mitochondrial heterogeneity among neurons and astrocytes (27Blokhuis G.G.D. Veldstra H. FEBS Lett. 1970; 11: 197-199Google Scholar) may also explain this phenomenon. In this context, it is noteworthy that Fiskum (28Fiskum G. J. Neurotrauma. 2000; 17: 843-855Google Scholar) demonstrated a greater resistance of neuronal mitochondria to the effects of Ca2+ overload on the induction of oxidative stress and subsequent opening of the permeability transition pore, as compared with astrocytic mitochondria. Consistent with the selective vulnerability of astrocytes to manganese toxicity, several reports indicate that morphological changes in astrocytes (Alzheimer type II astrocytosis) are the dominant neuropathological features of manganese neurotoxicity (29Pentschew A. Ebner F.F. Kovatch R.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1963; 22: 488-499Google Scholar, 30Olanow C.W. Good P.F. Shinotoh H. Hewitt K.A. Vingerhoets F. Snow B.J. Beal M.F. Calne D.B. Perl D.P. Neurology. 1996; 46: 492-508Google Scholar). This astrocytic change is also the characteristic pathological finding in hepatic encephalopathy, a condition in which manganese has been implicated in its pathogenesis (5Pomier-Layrargues G. Spahr L. Butterworth R.F. Lancet. 1995; 345: 735Google Scholar, 6Kreiger D. Kreiger S. Jansen O. Gass P. Theimann L. Lichtnecker H. Lancet. 1995; 346: 270-274Google Scholar). Although earlier work has not directly demonstrated the induction of the MPT by manganese either in intact cells or in isolated mitochondria, Allshire et al. (31Allshire A. Bernardi P. Saris N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 202-209Google Scholar) reported that manganese stimulates Ca2+ flux into isolated mitochondria, a process critical to the induction of the MPT. Studies by Bernardi et al. (32Bernardi P. Vasanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabo I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Google Scholar) demonstrated a competition between manganese and calcium for the same binding site on the permeability transition pore. Other studies (33Gavin C.E. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 445-453Google Scholar) also indicated that manganese inhibits Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria, suggesting the possibility that mitochondria are undergoing the MPT following manganese exposure. More recently, Zhang et al. (34Zhang S. Fu J. Zhou Z. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2004; 18: 71-77Google Scholar) have shown that high levels of manganese chloride (1 mm) caused a significant dissipation of the ΔΨm in isolated rat brain mitochondria, consistent with the induction of the MPT. Although mechanisms involved in the induction of the MPT by manganese are not known, manganese has been shown to induce oxidative stress. Manganese, being a transition element, is capable of existing in different oxidation states, including Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+. The transitional shift of Mn2+ to Mn3+ could lead to increased oxidant capacity of this metal. Accordingly, recent reports indicate that Mn3+ was more toxic compared with Mn2+ (35Chen J.Y. Tsao G.C. Zhao Q. Zheng W. Toxicol. Appl. Phamacol. 2001; 175: 160-168Google Scholar). Treatment of astrocytes with manganese increased free radical production and decreased the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, SOD and glutathione peroxidase (11Chen C.J. Liao S.L. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 175: 216-225Google Scholar). More recently, Zhang et al. (34Zhang S. Fu J. Zhou Z. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2004; 18: 71-77Google Scholar) reported the increased production of free radicals in isolated rat brain mitochondria exposed to manganese, in addition to the inhibition of various electron transport chain enzymes. Our data demonstrated that pretreatment of astrocyte cultures with antioxidants either completely blocked or significantly attenuated the manganese-induced MPT. Pretreatment with DFX, an iron-chelating agent, completely blocked the MPT by manganese. Consistent with this observation, HaMai et al. (36HaMai D. Campbell A. Bondy S.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 763-768Google Scholar) demonstrated that DFX was able to block manganese-induced free radical production in synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria. They suggested that DFX, by binding to Mn3+, could sequester manganese and thereby prevent free radical formation. Conversely, Roth et al. (37Roth J.A. Feng L. Dolan K.G. Lis A. Garrick M.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 76-83Google Scholar) reported that DFX potentiated manganese-induced cell death in PC12 cells by inhibiting energy metabolism. Such discrepancy may be because Roth et al. (37Roth J.A. Feng L. Dolan K.G. Lis A. Garrick M.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 76-83Google Scholar) employed a much higher concentration (300 μm) of MnCl2 for a longer period of time (24–48 h), whereas our studies employed only 100 μm manganese acetate for up to 6 h. Moreover, the DFX concentration (10 μm) employed by Roth et al. (37Roth J.A. Feng L. Dolan K.G. Lis A. Garrick M.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 76-83Google Scholar) was much lower than that used in our study (40 μm). In the present study, complete blocking of the manganese-induced MPT by DFX, in conjunction with significant attenuation of the same by SOD and vitamin E (Fig. 9), indicates a major role of oxidative stress in the induction of the MPT by manganese. These findings are consistent with reports demonstrating the attenuation of the MPT by various antioxidants in the setting of oxidative stress (38Jou M.J. Jou S.B. Chen H.M. Peng T.I. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 507-516Google Scholar, 39Higuchi H. Adachi M. Miura S. Gores G.J. Ishii H. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 320-328Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings clearly suggest that oxidative stress plays a major role in the induction of the MPT by manganese. Another potential mechanism by which manganese can induce the MPT is by inhibition of Ca2+ efflux from the mitochondria. Manganese is transported into mitochondria by the Ca2+ uniporter (40Gavin C.E. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 329-334Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that excessive accumulation of manganese in mitochondria results in inhibition of both Na+-dependent and -independent Ca2+ efflux (33Gavin C.E. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 445-453Google Scholar). Such mitochondrial Ca2+ overload may result in induction of the MPT (14Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Google Scholar, 41Dubinsky J.M. Levy Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 728-741Google Scholar). Despite induction of the MPT in cultured astrocytes and to a lesser extent in cultured neurons by manganese acetate, there were no significant morphological changes or evidence of cell death observed at the concentrations (25–100 μm) of manganese acetate employed in this study. These data are consistent with our earlier observations (42Hazell A.S. Norenberg M.D. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 1443-1447Google Scholar) that used manganese chloride (100 μm) as well as with those of other investigators (11Chen C.J. Liao S.L. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 175: 216-225Google Scholar, 43Spranger M. Schwab S. Desiderato S. Bonmann E. Kreiger D. Fandrey J. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 277-283Google Scholar). Although it is generally believed that induction of the MPT leads to cell death (apoptosis and or necrosis), several reports indicate that the MPT is a reversible process (16Crompton M. Costi A. Hayat L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 915-918Google Scholar, 44Kerr P. Suleiman M.S. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H496-H502Google Scholar). Studies by Petronilli et al. (45Petronilli V. Nicolli A. Costantini P. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Google Scholar) demonstrate a complete reversibility of the MPT in isolated mitochondria over several minutes. Employing intact osteosarcoma cells, Minamikawa et al. (46Minamikawa T. Williams D.A. Bowser D.N. Nagley P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 26-37Google Scholar) show a complete reversibility of the MPT without any evidence of cell death. Similarly, it has been reported that astrocytes subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation showed induction of the MPT without evidence of cell death (47Reichert S.A. Kim-Han J.S. Dugan L.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6608-6616Google Scholar). In this regard, it is noteworthy that our preliminary studies indicate that induction of the MPT in astrocytes when exposed to 100 μm manganese acetate for 6 h was completely reversed 48 h after removal of the manganese in the culture medium. 2K. V. Rama Rao and M. D. Norenberg, unpublished observation. Because the opening of the permeability transition pore is an “all or none” phenomenon (14Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Google Scholar), it is the number of mitochondria in a cell that are susceptible to pore opening rather than the degree of pore opening that is considered critical in the mechanism of cell death (apoptosis/necrosis) associated with the MPT (48Suleiman M.S. Halestrap A.P. Griffiths E.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 89: 29-46Google Scholar). The number of mitochondria undergoing the MPT will in turn depend on the degree of mitochondrial insult caused by an inducing agent (e.g. manganese). Therefore, it is conceivable that higher concentrations of manganese treatment for longer time periods result in cell death, possibly mediated by the MPT. In summary, we have shown that manganese preferentially induces the MPT in cultured astrocytes. Cultured neurons were far less affected by manganese exposure compared with astrocytes. The manganese-induced MPT was blocked by antioxidants, suggesting the potential involvement of oxidative stress in this process. Induction of the MPT by manganese and associated mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes may represent key mechanisms in manganese neurotoxicity.

High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the necessary cause for cervical cancer. E6 oncoprotein encoded by HPV plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis by interference with the host intracellular protein functions.

The overexpression of Tuberin overcomes the effect of E6 on S6 kinase phosphorylation. Binding with HPV16 E6 causes the proteasome-mediated degradation of Tuberin. A DILG motif and an ELVG motif located in the carboxyl-terminal of Tuberin are required for E6 binding. In addition, the Tuberin interaction region in E6 has been mapped in the amino-terminal portion of HPV16 E6, which is different from the binding domain with p53.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F55-F78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Based on their clinical outcomes, HPVs are grouped into high-risk and low-risk types. The high-risk types, such as HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, have been identified as the cause of cervical carcinoma (2Bosch F.X. Lorincz A. Munoz N. Meijer C.J.L. Shah K.V. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 244-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar). Two oncoproteins encoded by HPVs E6 and E7 are able to immortalize human epithelial cells in vitro (3Hawley-Nelson P.

Stremlau A. zur Hausen H. Nature. 1985; 341: 111-114Crossref Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), indicating that E6 and E7 functions are required for tumorigenesis. E6 interacts with a variety of host cell proteins and interferes with their functions. The high-risk HPV E6 proteins bind to tumor suppressor protein p53 for degradation (6Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). This observation provides an important functional clue in which E6 contributes to cell transformation. Several studies showed that additional E6 activities are required to reach full transformation potential (7Liu Y. Chen J. Gao Q. Dalal S. Hong Y. Mansur C. Band V. Androphy E. J.

However, the mechanism that coordinates E6 targeting cellular activities and leads to tumorigenesis currently remains unclear.

Tuberin suppresses the Rheb activity by reducing the GTP bound Rheb level in vivo (31Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified Tuberin as an intracellular target for HPV16 E6 protein. E6 binds and induces the degradation of Tuberin, leading to the destruction of its inhibitory function in regulation of S6 kinase activation in response to insulin stimulation. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Reagents—The different HPV GST-E6s were constructed by PCR amplification and insertion of the full-length E6s into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) at EcoRI/XhoI sites. The pCMV-Myc-16E6 was constructed by the insertion of PCR-amplified full-length HVP16 E6 into pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech). The resulting construct is in-frame with a Myc tag placed at the amino terminus. The GST-HPV16 E6 deletion mutants illustrated in Fig. 3A were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T-2. The resulting clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The TSC2-C-Gal4-AD contains the amino acid residues 1315–1807 of TSC2 and was acquired from a HeLa cDNA two-hybrid library (Clontech) by screening with the 16E6-Gal4-BD bait. The pCMV-HA-TSC2-C was generated by insertion of the EcoRI/XhoI fragment from the TSC2-C-Gal4-AD into the pCMV-HA plasmid (Clontech). The TSC2 cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1315–1560 (T1), 1560–1695 (T2), and 1695–1807 (T3) were subcloned into the pCMV-HA vector with the HA tag placed at the amino terminus (Fig. 2A). The pCMV-FLAG-TSC2 was generated by PCR with the FLAG tag in the amino terminus and subcloned into the pCDNA 3.0 vector (Invitrogen). All of the constructs generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids used for transfection were purified by the Qiagen plasmid mega kit. The HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18 were provided by Dr. zur Hausen. The full-length TSC2 expression vector with Xpress tag was provided by Dr. Jin Q. Chen. The plasmid pEGFP-N1 used as the control in the experiments was purchased from Clontech.Fig. 2S6K and S6 are phosphorylated in the cells expressing HPV16 E6 in the absence of insulin.A, COS-7 cells were transfected with indicated constructs. 24 h after transfection, cells were cultured in 0.5% serum for overnight. Cells were then stimulated with insulin (400 nm) for 30 min. The phosphorylation and expression of the endogenous Akt, S6K, and S6 were determined by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. B, HEK293 cells were transfected with different HPV E6 constructs and starved for 24 h after transfection. Cells were stimulated with insulin as above. The S6 kinase expression and phosphorylation were detected by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Anti-Tuberin (C-20), anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-green fluorescent protein, anti-Akt, anti-p70 S6K, and anti-phospho-Thr389 S6K antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-S6, anti-phospho-Ser235-Ser236 S6 and anti-phospho-Thr308 Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies were from Clontech. Anti-Xpress antibody was from Invitrogen. Anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma. MG132 was from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide was from Sigma. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A Gal4-based Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). The full-length HPV16 E6 gene constructed in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pAS2–1 vector was used as bait. The HeLa cDNA library was cloned into the Gal4-activating domain of the pACT2. The yeast strain Y190 was cotransfected with the pAS2-1-16E6 and pACT2-library DNA. HPV16 E6-interacting proteins were identified by growth on selection medium and expression of the β-galactosidase. Clones were retested for E6-specific interaction by comparing their interaction with the pAS2-1-16E6 and a negative control bait pLam5′ (human lamin-Gal4 DNA-binding domain hybrid, Clontech). GST-E6 Pull-down of Tuberin from Cold NIH 3T3 and BGC823 Cell Extracts—GST-E6s were expressed and purified as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The purified fusion protein was conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with protease inhibitors). Equal amounts of GST or GST-E6 proteins (∼5 μg) and 250 μg of cell lysate were used in precipitation. The mixture of GST-E6 beads and cell lysate was incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads then were washed three times with lysis buffer. The complexes were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE. Western blot was performed with anti-Tuberin antibody. In Vitro Binding Assays—The FLAG-tagged C-terminal portion of Tuberin was in vitro translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TnT system, Promega) and pre-cleared with glutathione-Sepharose beads. 20 μl of the in vitro translation product then was incubated with 25 μl of the different GST-E6 fusion protein beads. The reaction was carried out in total of 250 μl of reaction buffer as described above. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer (see above) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and HPV E6-associated Tuberin was detected by anti-FLAG antibody. Cell Culture and Transfection—All of the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of plasmids added to each plate was kept constant by including the appropriate amount of empty vector. In Vivo Degradation Assay—Cells were transfected with the indicated DNA balanced with empty vector to keep an equal amount and harvested 48 h after transfection. 40 μg of total protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The immunoblotting was carried out as described below. Cell Lysate Preparation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer described above. Protein concentration was estimated by BCA assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and probed with the indicated antibodies. Western blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrates (Amersham Biosciences). HPV16 E6 Interacts with Tuberin—During a yeast two-hybrid screen using HPV16 E6 open reading frame fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain as the bait, we identified several previous known E6-interacting proteins including IRF-3 (14Ronco L.V. Karpova A.Y. Vidal M. Howley P.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and E6TP1 (15Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another positive clone turned out from the carboxyl-terminal 492 amino acids of Tuberin. To confirm the interaction between Tuberin and HPV16 E6 and to determine whether this association is HPV type-specific, we performed a GST-E6 pull-down experiment to precipitate Tuberin from NIH 3T3 and BGC823 (a gastric carcinoma cell line) (for review see Ref. 36Deng G.R. Lu Y.Y. Chen S.M. Miao J. Lu G.R. Li H. Cai H. Xu X.L. Eh Z. Liu P.N. Cancer Res. 1989; 47: 3195-3198Google Scholar) cell extracts. GST-E6 fusion proteins from HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18 were incubated with cell extracts, respectively (Fig. 1A). Tuberin was expressed in both NIH 3T3 and BGC823 cells (Fig. 1A, input lines). GST-E6 from HPV16 was strongly associated with the endogenous Tuberin from both NIH 3T3 and BGC823 cells. In contrast, GST-E6 proteins from HPV6, HPV11, HPV18, and GST alone did not bind to Tuberin. These results suggest that HPV16 E6 specifically interacts with Tuberin. Two bands between 170- and 200-kDa molecular mass markers were detected by anti-Tuberin antibody in NIH 3T3 cells. This result is consistent with a previous report suggesting that the upper band represents the phosphorylated Tuberin (37Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A, lower panel, represents the amount of GST-E6 fusion protein used in the above experiment. As the positive control, the association of p53 with different HPV E6s was performed using the NIH 3T3 cell extracts (Fig. 1B). In contrast to Tuberin, p53 binds to both HPV16 and 18 E6s, although the binding affinity to HPV16 E6 was stronger. In our current system, p53 also showed very low binding activity to HPV11 E6. To further verify the association between HPV16 E6 and Tuberin, an in vitro binding assay was carried out. Consistent with the endogenous Tuberin, the in vitro translated carboxyl-terminal portion of Tuberin also bound to HPV16 E6 but not to HPV 6, HPV11, and HPV18 E6s (Fig. 1C). Expression of E6 Interferences with the S6 Kinase Phosphorylation Induced by Insulin—We next sought to determine the biological significance of the association of Tuberin with HPV16 E6. Recent studies (29Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar, 38Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 39Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Tuberin negatively controls the activation of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 in response to insulin stimulation. We examined whether the activation of S6 kinase was affected by the expression of HPV16 E6. Previous studies demonstrate (40Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) that S6 kinase is activated by phosphorylation on several residues in which the anti-phosphospecific antibody was used to analyze S6 kinase activity. COS-7 cells were transfected with TSC2 or E6 alone, or TSC2 plus E6. 24 h after transfection the cells were cultured in 0.5% serum overnight. Insulin was added to stimulate the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6. The phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 was determined by anti-phospho-S6 kinase and anti-phospho-S6 antibodies. The addition of insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 in COS-7 cells transfected with the vector (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Overexpression of TSC2 inhibited insulin stimulated S6 kinase and S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, the expression of HPV16 E6 alone resulted in the phosphorylation of both S6 kinase and S6 even in the absence of insulin (Fig. 2A, lane 5). The addition of insulin to the cells expressing E6 did not further increase the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 (Fig. 2A, lane 6), thus suggesting the effect of E6 on the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 was via insulin signaling pathway. More importantly, the effect of E6 on S6 kinase and S6 phosphorylation was overcome by coexpression of Tuberin (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that E6 targets insulin signaling by eliminating Tuberin suppressor function. A previous study (41Thomas M. Laura R. Hepner K. Guccione E. Sawyers C. Lasky L. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5088-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) shows that high-risk E6 proteins degraded the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues MAGI-2 and MAGI-3. MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 were associated with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) and enhanced its ability to suppress Akt activation (42Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore, E6 may indirectly activate Akt. To confirm that the phosphorylation of S6 kinase by expression of HPV16 E6 is a result of Tuberin elimination and not the indirect activation of Akt, the phosphorylation of Akt in these transfections was tested by Western blot using an anti-phospho-Akt antibody. In contrast to S6 kinase and S6, phosphorylation of Akt was not affected by expression of HPV16 E6 (Fig. 2A), indicating that the effect of E6 on phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 was mainly through abolishing TSC complex function. To test whether the other E6s that do not bind to Tuberin cause the activation of S6 kinase independent of insulin stimulation, HEK293 cells were transfected with the E6 constructs. The S6 kinase phosphorylation was detected by Western blot. In contrast to HPV16 E6, the expression of 6E6 and 18E6 did not result in the phosphorylation of S6 kinase (Fig. 2B) The Expression of HPV16 E6 Promotes the Degradation of Tuberin in HEK293 Cells—HPV E6 interferes with p53 function by degradation of the protein via ubiquitin-mediated pathway (6Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism showing that HPV16 E6 interrupts Tuberin function, we determined whether the expression of E6 affects the stability of Tuberin. HEK293 cells were transfected with an increased amount of the HPV16 E6 construct. The expressions of the endogenous Tuberin and p53 were determined by a Western blot. The levels of Tuberin and p53 were decreased, whereas the E6 expression level was increased (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the phosphorylation but not the expression of endogenous S6 was increased simultaneously with the decreased Tuberin expression, suggesting that the phosphorylation of S6 might result from the degradation of Tuberin. To determine that the decreased expression of Tuberin upon HPV16 E6 expression occurred after transcription, a Northern blot was performed. The expressions with different amounts of E6 did not affect the TSC2 transcription (Fig. 3B). The half-life of the Tuberin in the cells expressing E6 was compared with that in the cells without E6. HEK293 cells were transfected with either Xpress-tagged TSC2 or TSC2 plus E6. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide for the indicated hours. The Tuberin level was detected at different time points. The result is shown in Fig. 3C. The amount of Tuberin significantly reduced 4 h after cycloheximide treatment and completely vanished 6 h after treatment in the cells with E6. In contrast, without E6 expression, Tuberin slightly reduced 4 h after treatment and dramatically reduced but did not vanish 6 h after treatment (Fig. 3C). Previous studies revealed that HPV E6 proteins target and degrade intracellular partners through proteasomal degradation (43Gardiol D. Kuhne C. Glaunsinger B. Lee S.S. Javier R. Banks L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5487-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 44Glaunsinger B.A. Lee S.S. Thomas M. Banks L. Javier R.T.

To determine whether the Tuberin degradation is caused by this mechanism, HEK293 cells were transfected with Xpress-tagged Tuberin alone or with E6. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 3 h prior to protein extraction. The expression of exogenous Tuberin was high in the cells without E6 in both the presence and absence of MG132. The presence of E6 greatly decreased the Tuberin level. However, the Tuberin expression was recovered in the presence of MG132. In the presence of MG132, degradation of Tuberin was inhibited (Fig. 3D). Mapping of the E6-binding Region within Tuberin—A previous study (47Elston R.C. Napthine S. Doorbar J. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that screened HPV16 E6-binding peptides demonstrates that a 27-amino acid peptide homology to Tuberin bound to E6 and that the binding domain was DILG. The sequence analysis showed that the DILG domain is mapped to the amino acids corresponding to the positions 1396–1399 of Tuberin and located in the cDNA fragment of TSC2 identified from the yeast two-hybrid screen. In addition, a similar binding domain, ELVG, is located between positions 1351 and 1354 of Tuberin. To confirm the binding domain for HPV16 E6, three truncated constructs were analyzed (Fig. 4A). The pCMV-HA-TSC2-C contains the cDNA fragment isolated from yeast two-hybrid screen. The pCMV-HA-T1, T2, and T3 represent the different proportion of the pCMV-HA-TSC2-C as shown in Fig. 4A. COS-7 cells were transfected with the pCMV-HA-TSC2-C construct and the three truncated constructs. Cell lysates were made for GST-16E6 pull-down experiments. Consistent with previous experiments, GST-16E6 bound to the pCMV-HA-TSC2-C (Fig. 4B, lane 1). The truncated construct, pCMV-HA-T1, also associated with the GST-16E6 (Fig. 4B, lane 2), whereas the pCMV-HA-T2 (Fig. 4B, lane 3) and T3 (Fig. 4B, lane 4) did not. These results indicate that the amino acids 1315–1560 of Tuberin containing both DILG and ELVG domains have the E6 binding activity. To determine the effect of DILG and ELVG domains on E6 binding, the binding domain mutations were generated (Fig. 4C). The pCMV-HA-TSC2-Mu1 containing the substitution for DILG and the pCMV-HA-TSC2-Mu2 containing the substitution for ELVG partially reduced the binding activity to HPV16 E6 (Fig. 4D, lanes 1 and 2 compared with lane C). However, the binding activity of pCMV-HA-TSC2-Mu3 was totally abolished in which both DILG and ELVG sites were replaced (Fig. 4D, lane 3). These results indicate that both DILG and ELVG domains are required for Tuberin to associate with HPV16 E6. Identification of the Region in HPV16 E6 That Is Required for Interaction with Tuberin—To define the region of E6 responsible for binding to Tuberin, a series of HPV16 E6 deletions were generated as illustrated in Fig. 5A. GST-HPV16 E6 deletion fusions were used to test the binding capability with Tuberin. As shown in Fig. 5B, top panel, Tuberin binds to the HPV16 E6 deletion mutants 16E6-2-GST and 16E6-4-GST (lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, 16E6-1-GST, 16E6-3-GST, 16E6-5-GST, and 16E6-6-GST were unable to bind to Tuberin (lanes 1, 3, and 5). The amino acids 78–104 of 16E6 are overlapped in 16E6-2-GST and 16E6-4-GST and missed in the other constructs, indicating that the residues between 78 and 104 are the binding region for Tuberin. To further confirm the Tuberin binding region, a deletion mutant without the amino acids 78–104 was generated from the full-length HPV16 E6. The resulting GST fusion protein, 16E6-6-GST, failed to bind to Tuberin (lane 6), supporting that Tuberin binding region is located between amino acids 78 and 104 on HPV16 E6. We have demonstrated here that HPV16 E6, which is present in >50% of cervical cancers, interacts with the tumor suppressor protein, Tuberin, and interferes with its suppressor function in insulin-induced cell growth and proliferation signaling pathway, leading to the activation of S6 kinase downstream of Akt activation. The exogenous expression of E6 resulted in the degradation of the endogenous Tuberin. Expression of E6 in serum-starved cells was sufficient to induce S6 kinase and S6 phosphorylation without the addition of stimuli, whereas insulin stimulated the phosphorylations of S6 kinase and S6, suggesting that E6 activated the signaling component downstream of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Conversely, the overexpression of Tuberin blocked the S6 kinase phosphorylation and activation induced by E6, indicating that E6 targeted and interfered with Tuberin function in the insulin signaling pathway. The possible model for interference of Tuberin by HPV16 E6 leading to S6 kinase activation is illustrated in Fig. 6. Recent studies have placed the complex of Hamartin and Tuberin in the cell growth and proliferation pathway in which the complex negatively regulates both growth factor- and nutrient-dependent activation of TOR signaling to its downstream targets S6 kinase and 4EBP1 (48Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 573-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 49Krymskaya V.P.

Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The negative regulator role of the complex is achieved by Tuberin GTPase-activating protein activity toward Rheb. Overexpression of Rheb bypasses the nutrient induction to activate TOR signaling (31Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 32Saucedo L.J. Gao X. Chiarelli D.A. Li L. Pan D. Edgar B.A. Nat.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The TSC2 mutations derived from TSC patients are defective in GTPase-activating protein activity, suggesting that failure in the control of Rheb plays an important role in the pathology of TSC. Abrogation of Tuberin function by HPV16 E6 may therefore mimic the naturally occurring TSC2 mutations and contribute to HPV16-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis. Human papillomaviruses infect proliferating epithelial cells. The replication of high-risk types of HPV occurs in the differentiated cells, which contain little or none of the cellular replication components. To utilize the host replication machinery, the virus needs to modify the host cellular process and drive the differentiated cells to re-enter the cell cycle. HPV16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 have been found to independently modulate the ability of keratinocyte differentiation (54Jones D.L. Alani R.M. Munger K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 55Sherman L. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3269-3279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potentiality of virus oncoproteins to re-program the cellular process is gained by interfering with the key cellular protein functions. Targeting and degradation of p53 by E6 oncoprotein represent the most critical functional event, leading to an increase in host genetic instability. In addition to p53, more than a dozen cellular proteins have been identified as E6-interacting proteins (9Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of Tuberin as the cellular partner of HPV16 E6 provides the direct evidence that E6 targets the major growth and proliferation signal transduction pathway. In addition to Tuberin, HPV E6 proteins also target the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 for degradation (41Thomas M. Laura R. Hepner K. Guccione E. Sawyers C. Lasky L. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5088-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 have been reported to be associated with PTEN (42Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), the other negative regulator of the insulin-induced growth pathway, and enhance the ability of PTEN to suppress Akt activation. Therefore, the degradation of MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 by E6 may result in the abolishment of PTEN function. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of interference with the growth factor-mediated signaling pathway in E6-induced immortalization. Although the disruption of p53 by E6 shall demolish the fidelity of DNA replication, the abrogation of the cell growth and proliferation pathway may lead to uncontrolled growth and immortalization. The diverse activities of HPV E6 may represent the different sides of the coin. How those activities of E6 are coordinated to achieve the full malignancy is currently unclear and needs to be elucidated. In system used here, Tuberin bound to HPV16 E6 but not to HPV18 E6. The reason for this specificity might be due to the preferential binding motifs in different HPV E6 proteins. Several proteins are targeted by E6 through the PDZ motif. HPV18 E6 has a perfect PDZ binding motif, whereas HPV16 is suboptimal (56Thomas M. Glaunsinger B. Pim D. Javier R. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5431-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, proteins with PDZ motif may bind HPV18 E6 more efficiently. In contrast, the other proteins, such as IRF-3 and Tuberin binding to E6 through ELLG motif identified as (E/D)L(L/V)G, may favor HPV16 E6 (14Ronco L.V. Karpova A.Y. Vidal M. Howley P.M.

It cannot exclude the possibility that HPV18 E6 binds to Tuberin with very weak capability, which cannot be detected under current condition. Our results have shown that two E6 binding motifs in Tuberin are required to achieve the full binding activity. This is similar to the observation in tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (57Filippova M.

In contrast to its functional information, there is less clarity regarding the regions of E6 that are responsible for the association with the cellular partners. In this study, we have shown that residues 78–104 of HPV16 E6 are responsible for Tuberin binding. The corresponding region of HPV18 E6 was identified previously for the interaction with E6BP (58Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, unlike Tuberin, the associations of E6BP with E6 do not cause the degradation of E6BP. In addition, p53 and its binding partner E6AP bind to the separated regions of E6 that are as different as the Tuberin (59Thomas M. Pim D. Banks L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7690-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Moreover, some E6 mutants that are defective in p53 degradation remain the ability to induce cell immortalization (7Liu Y. Chen J. Gao Q. Dalal S. Hong Y. Mansur C. Band V. Androphy E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7297-7307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that multiple functions of E6 are involved in HPV-induced tumorigenesis. It would be interesting to investigate the link between the structure of E6 oncoprotein and its functional outcome. The biological activity of E6 mutants involved in Tuberin binding is undergoing exploration. We thank Dr. H. zur Hausen for HPV plasmids and Dr. J. Q. Cheng for TSC plasmids.

https://openalex.org/W2092022003,"The phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase/3-phospho-inositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)/Akt and the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have central roles in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation. Despite their importance, however, the cross-talk between these two pathways has not been fully understood. Here we report that PDK1 promotes MAPK activation in a MEK-dependent manner. In vitro kinase assay revealed that the direct targets of PDK1 in the MAPK pathway were the upstream MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. The identified PDK1 phosphorylation sites in MEK1 and MEK2 are Ser222 and Ser226, respectively, and are known to be essential for full activation. To date, these sites are thought to be phosphorylated by Raf kinases. However, PDK1 gene silencing using small interference RNA demonstrates that PDK1 is associated with maintaining the steady-state phosphorylated MEK level and cell growth. The small interference RNA-mediated down-regulation of PDK1 attenuated maximum MEK and MAPK activities but could not prolong MAPK signaling duration. Stable and transient expression of constitutively active MEK1 overcame these effects. Our results suggest a novel cross-talk between the phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase/PDK1/Akt pathway and the Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway.

These lipids, then, induce the activation of several members of the protein kinase A, G, and C (AGC) family of protein kinases including Akt/protein kinase B, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), protein kinase C isoforms (PKCs), and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (SGKs).

Activated Raf catalyzes the phosphorylation of its downstream kinases, MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2), through phosphorylation at Ser218 and Ser222 of MEK1 and at Ser222 and Ser226 of MEK2 in their activation loops (7Alessi D.R.

Activated kinases including Akt and MAPK1/2 mediate survival signal transduction and cell cycle progression by phosphorylating downstream key regulatory proteins (11Allan L.A. Morrice N. Brady S.

Because it has been reported that the activity of Akt or MAPK or both are elevated in many cancer cells, these molecules are thought to be suitable as molecular targets of anticancer drugs (1Lee Jr., J.T. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 486-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6594-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat.

PDK1 was originally identified as a kinase that could phosphorylate Akt on its activation loop (residue Thr308) (17Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Later works, however, have shown that PDK1 is not only an Akt kinase but also a kinase responsible for phosphorylating members of the AGC family of protein kinases: p70S6K, SGKs, PKCs, and p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) at the equivalent residues of Thr308 of Akt (reviewed in Ref. 13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). PDK1 itself is also a member of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases and is phosphorylated at the Ser241 residue (equivalent to Thr308 of Akt) in the activation loop. Since PDK1 expressed in bacteria was active and was phosphorylated at Ser241, it is thought that PDK1 phosphorylates itself at this site (20Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). During our analysis of the PDK1-mediated signal transduction pathway, we discovered an increase in the phosphorylated MAPK level of PDK1-transfected cells and saw that MAPK activation depended upon MEK activation. Sequence comparison of the residues around the PDK1-mediated phosphorylation sites in AGC kinases and MEK1/2 revealed that MEK1/2 possessed the PDK1-mediated phosphorylation sites. In vitro and in vivo analysis revealed that PDK1 could directly phosphorylate the sites (Ser222 of MEK1 and Ser226 of MEK2). To date, these sites were thought to be phosphorylated by Raf kinases. Because silencing of the PDK1 gene by siRNA decreased the phospho-MEK and phospho-MAPK levels and suppressed cell proliferation, PDK1 regulated the MEK/MAPK pathway by directly phosphorylating MEK1/2. Our results indicate the importance of PDK1 as a MAPK kinase kinase in MEK/MAPK signaling pathways.

Transient and Stable Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) or LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Stable mock, WT-MEK1, or DD-MEK1 transfectants were established by transfecting pUSEamp encoding nothing, WT-MEK1, or DD-MEK1 into HT1080 cells.

Cells were harvested and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 137 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm aprotinin) (26Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma), an anti-HA-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or an anti-Myc agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (23Fujita N.

Then the immunoprecipitated proteins or the cell lysates were electrophoresed and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with antibodies to Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr308), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), phospho-MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-c-Myc (Thr58/Ser62), phospho-p90RSK (Thr573) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), c-Raf-1 or PDK1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), MEK1 or phospho-Raf-1 (Ser338) (Upstate Biotechnology), FLAG tag (clone M2) or β-actin (Sigma), HA tag (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science), Myc tag (clone 9E10), ERK2/MAPK2, phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser218/222), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RSK2 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), or phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser222) (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Subsequently, membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, the membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Blots were scanned with an EPSON ES-2200 scanner supported by Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and quantified with NIH Image 1.62 software. siRNA Design and Transfection—Five siRNAs were designed from the human PDK1 sequence (PDK1-1 to PDK1-5). The coding strands of the siRNAs were as follows: GAAGCGGCCUGAGGACUUC (PDK1-1; directed to residues 228–246), UGGUGAGGACCCAGACUGA (PDK-1-2; directed to residues 83–101), UCCUUGGGGAAGGCUCUUU (PD-K1-3; directed to residues 260–278), GAGACCUCGUGGAGAAACU (P-DK1-4; directed to residues 929–947), and UGGAAGGAUACGGACCUCU (PDK1-5; directed to residues 989–1007). In our experiments to suppress human PDK1 expression in 293T, HT1080, and A549 cells, we used the most effective siRNA (PDK1-4) for further analysis. Nonsilencing control siRNA was purchased from Qiagen. The oligonucleotides had 3′ dTdT overhangs. The sequences of siRNAs targeted to both Akt1 and Akt2 (Aktc) or Raf-1 genes were reported previously (27Cioca D.P. Aoki Y. Kiyosawa K. Cancer Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R. Masuyama N. Cantley L.C. Gotoh Y. Kishi K. Shiota H. Ebina Y. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected with siRNAs using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent, according to the manufacturer's instruction. Immunostaining—Cells were transfected with pUSEamp-WT-MEK2 and pcDNA3-EGFP together with a pFLAG-CMV-2 vector encoding nothing (Mock) or ΔN51-PDK1. 24 h after transfection, cells were plated onto collagen-coated culture dishes. After incubation for a further 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. Permeabilization was carried out in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After incubation for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, the labeling was carried out by incubation overnight with a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by a 90-min incubation with AlexaFluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After washing the cells, we visualized them using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera. Purification of Recombinant GST-ΔN51-PDK1 and GST-ΔN51-PDK1 (K111A/D223A) Proteins—Cultures of BL21 Star Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) containing a pGEX 6P-3 plasmid encoding ΔN51-PDK1 or kinase-dead form of ΔN51-PDK1 (K111A/D223A) were induced for 2 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested, and recombinant proteins were purified using GST purification modules according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (24Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39360-39367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The proteins were further treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the GST tag. In Vitro Kinase Assay—To perform the in vitro kinase assay, recombinant, active Raf-1 or immunopurified, FLAG-tagged ΔN51-PDK1 was incubated with recombinant inactive MEK1 (0.3 μg/assay), recombinant inactive MAPK2 (1 μg/assay), or both in 50 μl (final volume) of kinase reaction buffer for PDK1 (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 15 mm magnesium chloride, and 180 μm ATP) or for Raf-1 (16 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 4 mm EGTA, 0.8 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm magnesium chloride, and 100 μm ATP) for 1 h at 30 °C. 5 μl of the mixture was then reacted with 20 μg of MBP in the presence of 100 μm ATP (final concentration) containing 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper, washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, air-dried, and subjected to Cerenkov counting. PDK1-mediated MEK phosphorylation was also estimated by incubating immunoprecipitated, FLAG-tagged ΔN51-PDK1, or the kinase-dead form of ΔN51-PDK1 (S241A) with recombinant inactive MEK1 (0.8 μg/assay) in kinase reaction buffer for PDK1 for 1 h at 30 °C. Appropriate amounts of recombinant ΔN51-PDK1 and the kinase-dead form of ΔN51-PDK1 (K111A/D223A) were also incubated with recombinant inactive MEK1 (1 μg/assay) in kinase reaction buffer for PDK1 for 2 h at 37 °C. Reactions were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with antibodies to phospho-MEK, MEK1, phospho-PDK1 (Ser241) (Cell Signaling Technology), and PDK1. In some experiments, WT or point-mutated MEK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and incubated with recombinant, inactive MAPK2 (0.5 μg/assay) in kinase reaction buffer for Raf-1 for 30 min at 30 °C, following immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phospho-MAPK and MAPK. In other experiments, MAPK activity was measured using a MAPK immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activation of MEK/MAPK Signal Transduction Pathway by PDK1—To analyze the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway, 293T cells were transfected with pUSEamp-MEK2 plasmid together with EGFP-expressing plasmid to detect the transfected cells. Overexpression of MEK2 alone could not induce MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, yellow arrowheads). Interestingly, co-expression of ΔN51-PDK1, which possesses almost the same activity as full-length WT-PDK1 (data not shown), resulted in the increased phospho-MAPK amount in the transfected cells (Fig. 1A, blue arrowheads). We then examined whether or not PDK1 directly activates MAPK. In vitro incubation of PDK1 with recombinant, inactive MAPK2 did not induce MAPK2 activation (Fig. 1B). We observed PDK1-induced MAPK activation in vitro only in the presence of both inactive MEK1 and inactive MAPK2, as we found with Raf-1 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, PDK1 cannot directly activate MAPK; it needs MEK for in vitro activation. The fact that the immunoprecipitated, kinase-dead form of PDK1 (S241A) failed to phosphorylate and activate MEK1 indicates that PDK1-dependent MEK1 activation is not mediated by other co-precipitated kinases (Fig. 1C) (data not shown). Moreover, in vitro incubation of recombinant inactive MEK1 with purified recombinant ΔN51-PDK1, but not the kinase-dead form of ΔN51-PDK1, increased the phospho-MEK1 levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). The results suggest that the target of PDK1 in the MAPK signaling pathway is not MAPK itself but rather its upstream kinase MEK. PDK1 was originally isolated as a kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Akt on its activation loop (Thr308 residue) (17Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B.

Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Later studies have shown that PDK1 is not only an Akt kinase, but it also regulates multiple kinases, which belong to the AGC family of protein kinases through phosphorylating Ser or Thr residues equivalent to Thr308 of Akt (13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 29Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of the residues around Ser222 in human MEK1 and Ser226 in human MEK2 in their activation loops showed that these residues had homology to the previously reported PDK1 phosphorylation sites in human Akt1, SGK1, and PAK1 (Fig. 1E) (13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 29Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To prove that MEK phosphorylation was PDK1-dependent, we examined the change in phospho-MEK1/2 levels with an anti-phospho-MEK antibody. The Cell Signaling antibody used recognized MEK1/2 only when MEK1/2 were phosphorylated at Ser218 and/or Ser222 in MEK1 and at Ser222 and/or Ser226 in MEK2. Immunoblot analysis showed that co-transfection of PDK1 increased the phospho-MEK1/2 levels in cells (Fig. 1F). Similar results were obtained using a Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody (sc-7995-R) that could recognize MEK1/2 when MEK1/2 were phosphorylated at Ser218 and/or Ser222 in MEK1 and at Ser222 and/or Ser226 in MEK2 (data not shown). We also found increased phospho-MEK levels when we used a BIOSOURCE antibody that specifically recognized phosphorylated MEK1 (Ser222) or MEK2 (Ser226) (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that MEK phosphorylation was accomplished by autophosphorylation, we generated a kinase-dead form of MEK1 by mutating Lys97 to Ala. As shown in Fig. 1G, PDK1 also increased the phospho-MEK1 (Ser218/Ser222) levels in KD-MEK1. Of note, the anti-phospho-MEK1/2 antibody used did not recognize DD-MEK in which both Ser218 and Ser222 residues had been substituted for the phosphomimic Asp residues. These results indicate that PDK1 activates the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway by directly phosphorylating MEK1/2. Kinase Activity of PDK1 Is Essential for MEK Phosphorylation—Since PDK1 increased the phospho-MEK levels in MEK-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1), we investigated whether PDK1 promoted the phosphorylation of endogenous MEK. When 293T and HT1080 cells were transfected with PDK1 alone, endogenous MEK1/2 were phosphorylated in a PDK1 dose-dependent manner, like Raf-1 did (Fig. 2A). Membrane targeting of PDK1 is important for phosphorylation and activation of Akt (22Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, membrane targeting was not necessary for PDK1-mediated endogenous MEK phosphorylation, because PH domain-deleted PDK1 (ΔPH-PDK1) also increased the phospho-MEK level (Fig. 2B). Transfection of kinase-dead forms of PDK1 (S241A-, V243P-, or D223A-PDK1) (17Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39360-39367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) did not increase the endogenous phospho-MEK levels (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the results, phosphorylation of MEK was dependent on the amounts of co-transfected WT-PDK1 but not the kinase-dead (S241A) form of ΔN51-PDK1 in cells (Fig. 2C). As reported previously (20Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), S241A-PDK1 had a weak kinase activity. That might be the reason why a slight increase in phospho-MEK level was observed when MEK1 was co-transfected with S241A-PDK1 (Fig. 2C). Because c-Raf-1 phosphorylation was not affected by WT- or ΔPH-PDK1 transfection (Fig. 2B), PDK1 would phosphorylate MEK without affecting c-Raf-1 activity. Consistent with the results, our previously identified PDK1 inhibitor UCN-01 (21Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) dose-dependently suppressed the PDK1-mediated MEK phosphorylation, in addition to Akt, in cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, kinase activity of PDK1 was essential for MEK phosphorylation. Because PDK1 is known to phosphorylate and activate multiple downstream kinases (13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 29Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of PDK1 downstream kinases on MEK phosphorylation. Akt and SGK were known to act as main mediators of PI3K/PDK1-regulated biological responses (12Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The increase in phospho-MEK levels was not observed in 293T cells that had been transfected with the active form of Akt1 or SGK1 cDNA although transfection of PDK1 or the active form of Raf-1 cDNA induced MEKl phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Thus, Akt and SGK might not be involved in MEK phosphorylation and MAPK activation. PDK1 is also known to phosphorylate and activate PKCs (13Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 18Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

At least six Rab11 effectors (family of Rab11-interacting proteins (FIPs)) have been shown to interact with Rab11 and are hypothesized to regulate various membrane trafficking pathways such as transferrin recycling, cytokinesis, and epidermal growth factor trafficking. In this study, we characterized interactions of FIPs with the Rab11 GTPase using isothermal titration calorimetric studies and mutational analysis. Our data suggest that FIPs cannot differentiate between GTP-bound Rab11a and Rab11b in vitro (50-100 nm affinity) and in vivo. We also show that, although FIPs interact with the GDP-bound form of Rab11 in vitro, the binding affinity (>1000 nm) is not sufficient for FIP and GDP-bound Rab11 interactions to occur in vivo. Mutational analysis revealed that both the conserved hydrophobic patch and Tyr628 are important for the GTP-dependent binding of Rab11 to FIPs. The entropy and enthalpy analyses suggest that binding to Rab11a/b may induce conformational changes in FIPs.

The entropy and enthalpy analyses suggest that binding to Rab11a/b may induce conformational changes in FIPs. Rab proteins constitute the largest family of small monomeric GTPases and play an important role in membrane trafficking pathways. More than 60 Rab proteins have been identified in the human genome (1Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 2Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and many of them have been implicated in the regulation of specific exocytic and endocytic transport steps. Several Rab proteins (Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, Rab9, Rab11, Rab15, Rab22, and Rab25) have been shown to localize to endosomes, consistent with the multiplicity of trafficking pathways mediated by these organelles (reviewed in Refs. 3Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref Scopus (2710) Google Scholar and 4Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Rab7 and Rab9 associate with late endosomes and lysosomes, whereas the rest of the endosomal Rab proteins have been shown to localize to either early or recycling endosomes. Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25 are three closely related Rab proteins that belong to the Rab11 subfamily (1Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H.

Rab11 family proteins have been shown to play an essential role in protein recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane (5Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), polarized transport in epithelial cells (6Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Whereas Rab11a and Rab11b are ubiquitously expressed, Rab25 is present exclusively in epithelial cells (10Goldenring J.R. Shen K.R.

The differential roles of the Rab11a and Rab11b isoforms remain unclear. Although several Rab11-binding proteins have so far been isolated (12Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol.

Rab proteins cycle between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound forms. In the GTP-bound form, they interact with effector proteins, and each Rab·effector complex is proposed to regulate a unique trafficking step/event such as vesicle docking, budding, transport, or fusion (3Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref Scopus (2710) Google Scholar, 16Segev N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recently, several Rab11 effector proteins, Rip11, FIP2, 1The abbreviations used are: FIP, family of Rab11-interacting protein; RCP, Rab-coupling protein; RBD, Rab11/25-binding domain; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tf, transferrin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-2-(thio)diphosphate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TfR, transferrin receptor. Rab-coupling protein (RCP), FIP3/eferin, and FIP4, were identified using biochemical and yeast two-hybrid methods (12Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to Rab11 binding, FIP3 and FIP4 also interact with ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases, thereby coupling these small GTPase families, allowing for potential cross-talk between two signaling pathways (17Hickson G.R. Matheson J. Riggs B. Maier V.H. Fielding A.B. Prekeris R. Sullivan W. Barr F.A. Gould G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2908-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All FIPs have a conserved C-terminal motif that is known as the Rab11/25-binding domain (RBD) (18Meyers J.M. Prekeris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49003-49010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on the presence of additional structural domains, FIPs are classified into three groups: class I FIPs (Rip11, FIP2, and RCP) containing a C2 domain, class II FIPs (FIP3/eferin and FIP4) containing EF-hand motifs, and the class III FIP (FIP1) with no homology to known protein domains (reviewed in Ref. 19Prekeris R. Sci. World J. 2003; 3: 870-880Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of the RBD that mediates the interaction of FIPs with Rab11, we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms of Rab11 and FIP interactions. It remains unclear whether different FIPs exhibit preferences for interaction with Rab11a or Rab11b isoforms. We still do not know whether these multiple effectors are capable of binding to Rab11a or Rab11b with affinities that are relevant to their physiological concentrations in cells. Interestingly, some recent work suggests that FIP2 and RCP bind to Rab11a in a GTP-independent manner (14Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Cantalupo G. Senic-Matuglia F. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27193-27199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). In addition, although several effector proteins have been identified for Rab11, little information is available on the affinities and thermodynamic properties of Rab11·effector complex formation. Thus, to understand the properties of Rab11 and FIP binding, we have performed isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) analysis on the interaction of class I FIPs with GDP- and Gpp(NH)p-bound forms of Rab11a and Rab11b. ITC analysis has been used previously to study several protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, as it directly measures enthalpy and the binding constant involved (22Ladbury J.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 23Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that all class I FIPs are capable of binding to the Gpp(NH)p-bound form of Rab11 with similar affinity. A weak interaction was also seen with the GDP-bound form of Rab11, although it was not sufficient to mediate GDP-bound Rab11 and FIP interactions in vivo. FIPs bound equally well to both isoforms of Rab11 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that Rab11a and Rab11b mediate redundant and overlapping functions. The free energy (ΔG) for Rab11·FIP complex formation is contributed by enthalpic factors and exhibits a strong enthalpy-entropy compensation effect. Mutational analysis of the conserved amino acids in the RBD of Rip11 indicates that the hydrophobic patch is crucial for Rab11·FIP complex formation. In addition to these conserved hydrophobic residues, Rip11 Tyr628 also plays an important role in FIP association with Rab11. Finally, our data suggest that FIPs form a high affinity homodimer, which interacts with two Rab11 molecules to form a heterotetramer. Plasmids and Reagents—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion constructs were prepared by cloning GST-Rip11, GST-FIP2, and GST-FIP3 into the baculovirus expression plasmid pAcGHLT-B (BD Biosciences) and Rab11a into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences). GST and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs with the Rip11 C-terminal fragment consisting of amino acids 490-652 (referred to as Rip11-F1) were described previously (18Meyers J.M. Prekeris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49003-49010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). pGEX-FIP2-F1 (amino acids 378-511) and pGEX-RCP-F1 (amino acids 479-659) constructs were also prepared. Gpp(NH)p was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Miscellaneous chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Alexa 647-conjugated transferrin (Tf) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, CA). Rabbit anti-Rip11 polyclonal antibody was described previously (12Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-RCP polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunization with recombinant RCP. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise specified. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression and Purification of Proteins—Site-specific mutations were introduced into the pGEX-Rip11-F1 or pEGFP-Rip11-F1 construct using a Stratagene PCR-based mutagenesis kit. The GST-Rab11, GST-FIP2-F1, GST-RCP-F1, and GSTRip11-F1 constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 Codon Plus (Stratagene). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (24Junutula J.R. De Maziere A.M. Peden A.A. Ervin K.E. Advani R.J. Van Dijk S.M. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The Gpp(NH)p- or GDP-bound forms of Rab11a and Rab11b proteins were prepared by processing through a series of nucleotide (Gpp(NH)p or GDP) exchange reactions in the presence of EDTA as described previously for Rab5 GTPase (25Christoforidis S. Zerial M. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 20: 403-410Google Scholar). Full-length FIPs were cloned into the baculovirus expression plasmid, and the GST fusion proteins were purified from insect cells using glutathione affinity column chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. In Vitro Binding Assays—Glutathione beads (50 μl) were coated with 5 μg of GST fusion protein and incubated with varying amounts of soluble protein in a final volume of 0.5 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of either GTPγS or GDPβS (0.5 mm) as indicated. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a nutator with constant rotation. The samples were pelleted at 2000 × g for 3 min and washed three times with 1 ml of reaction buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 1% SDS, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and either stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted. Gel Filtration Analysis—The oligomeric status of Rab11, Rip11-F1, and Rip11-F1 mutants and the Rab11·Rip11-F1 complex was determined by analyzing the proteins on a Superdex S200 column that was connected to a fast protein liquid chromatograph equipped with a UV280 monitor and a mini DAWN detector (Wyatt Technology Corp.). The native molecular mass of the protein was calculated from light scattering analysis using the software provided (Wyatt Technology Corp.). ITC—ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal LLC, Northampton, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Rab11 (8 μm) was loaded in the sample cell (in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm Gpp(NH)p or GDP; 1.426-ml volume) and titrated with Rip11-F1, FIP2-F1, GST-RCP-F1, and Rip11-F1 proteins in the same buffer (5-μl injections up to total of 40-50 injections). The titrations were performed while samples were stirred at 300 rpm at 25 °C or at the indicated temperature. An interval of 4 min between each injection was allowed for the base line to stabilize. The blank ITC titration was performed against buffer by injecting the corresponding FIP that was used in Rab11 titration. The blank subtraction was done for all data used for analysis. The data were fitted via the one-set-of-sites model to calculate the binding constant (K) using Origin software (Microcal, LLC). All proteins used in the ITC studies were either in the thrombin-cleaved form (Rab11, Rip11-F1, and FIP2-F1) or in the GST fusion form (GST-RCP-F1). The presence of GST did not interfere with the binding studies. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were cultured as described previously (18Meyers J.M. Prekeris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49003-49010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant GFP-Rip11-F1 constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). At 18-24 h post-transfection, the cells were plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips, grown overnight, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by quenching with 0.1 m glycine. The cells were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% saponin, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-Rip11 or anti-Rab11 polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After extensive washing, cells were incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 30 min, washed, and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M deconvolution microscope. RNA Interference Analysis—Rab11a and Rab11b isoforms were knocked down using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that were designed using human Rab11a and Rab11b sequences (Rab11a, 5′-aatgtcagacagacgcgaaaa-3′; and Rab11b, 5′-aagcacctgacctatgagaac-3′). Rab11a siRNA, Rab11b siRNA, or a mixture of Rab11a and Rab11b siRNAs was cotransfected into HeLa cells using LipofectAMINE 2000. Transfected cells were incubated for 74 h and analyzed for Rab11a and Rab11b expression by Western blotting or used for subcellular fractionation. The remaining cells were plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips, fixed, and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted deconvolution microscope. Anti-Rab11 primary antibodies were labeled with Alexa 488 and anti-Rip11 primary antibodies with Alexa 594 using a Zenon labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and were used for staining HeLa cells. FACS-based Tf Uptake and Recycling Assays—HeLa cells (80-90% confluent, T-75 flask) were transiently transected with GFP alone, GFP-Rip11-F1, GFP-Rip11-F1(Y628A), or GFP-Rip11-F1(I629E) using LipofectAMINE 2000. The cells were incubated with transfection mixture (60 μg of DNA and 120 μl of LipofectAMINE) for 3 h, and the medium was replaced. At 16 h post-transfection, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended first in complete medium and then subsequently in serum-free medium. FACS-based Tf uptake and recycling assays were done as described previously (36Peden A.A. Schonteich E. Chun J. Junutula J.R. Scheller R.H. Prekeris R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, for Tf uptake assays, the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 20 μg/ml Alexa 647-conjugated Tf, followed by incubation at 37 °C for various time intervals in the continuous presence of Alexa 647-conjugated Tf. To measure plasma membrane-associated transferrin receptor (TfR), cells were washed and analyzed after incubation at 4 °C. In all cases, the cells were washed and terminated by pelleting and resuspending the cells in 3% paraformaldehyde. Cell-associated Alexa 647-conjugated Tf was determined by FACS analysis. For recycling assays, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by internalization for 20 min at 37 °C in the continuous presence of Alexa 647-conjugated Tf. Cells were then washed and incubated in complete medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml unlabeled Tf for various times prior to fixation. The experiment was terminated as described above and analyzed on a BD Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with 488- and 647-nm lasers, gating for transfected cells (10,000 GFP-positive cells), and the amount of Tf internalized was determined. Rab11 Effector Proteins (FIPs) Form Homodimers—It has been previously suggested that FIPs can form homodimers and heterodimers, yet it remains unclear whether dimerization is dependent on Rab11 binding (26Wallace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test this, we produced recombinant full-length GST-FIP fusion proteins in insect cells and truncated FIPs in E. coli and tested their ability to form homodimers or heterodimers with other FIP family member proteins in the presence or absence of Rab11a. As shown in Fig. 1, soluble full-length Rip11 bound to GST-Rip11. The binding was specific to Rip11 (Fig. 1A), as there was no binding observed with GST alone or with other FIP family member proteins, FIP2 (Fig. 1B) or FIP3 (Fig. 1A). Similarly, FIP2 and FIP3 interacted with only FIP2 and FIP3, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that FIPs form only homodimers in vitro. Rab11a had no influence on FIP homodimerization, as FIPs formed homodimers in both its presence and absence (Fig. 1, A and B). Deletion of the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-490) of Rip11 had no effect on the Rip11-Rip11 interaction, whereas deletion of the C-terminal 28 amino acids completely abolished this interaction, indicating that the C-terminal region including the RBD (amino acids 630-652) is very important for homodimer formation (Fig. 1A). These results were further supported by cross-linking experiments showing that the Rip11-F1 protein formed a dimer in solution (data not shown). To confirm that Rip11 forms a homodimer, we performed gel filtration followed by light scattering analysis on Rip11-F1 (amino acids 490-652) alone or complexed with Rab11 (Fig. 2). Consistent with cross-linking results, Rip11-F1 eluted as a dimer (36 kDa), whereas Rab11 eluted as monomer (24.3 kDa) and the Rab11·Rip11 complex as a heterotetramer of 85 kDa (Rip11-F1 dimer + two Rab11 molecules).Fig. 2Gel filtration analysis of the Rab11·Rip11 complex and Rip11-F1 mutants. Gpp(NH)p-bound Rab11a, Rip11-F1, and the Rab11a-Rip11 complex in the presence of Gpp(NH)p were loaded onto a Superdex S200 gel filtration column. A280 elution profiles are shown as solid lines; the molecular masses calculated using light scattering data are shown as dots, and the corresponding numbers are indicated in parentheses. The predicted monomeric molecular masses of Rab11a and the Rip11 RBD are 24.4 and 18.3 kDa, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Class I FIPs Form Strong GTP-dependent Complexes with Rab11a and Rab11b—The binding affinity and thermodynamics of the interactions between Rab11 and FIP complexes were characterized using ITC analysis. Fig. 3 (A and B, upper panels) shows a typical calorimetric titration of Rip11-F1 with Rab11a at 25 °C in the presence of GDP and Gpp(NH)p, respectively. The size of the injection peaks decreased gradually as the injections progressed due to saturation of the binding sites. Fig. 3 (lower panels) shows the binding isotherm, in which the total heat per injection (kilocalories/mol of Rip11-F1 injected) has been plotted against the molar ratios of Rip11-F1 and Rab11a. Curve fitting the data using the identical-site model (Origin software) resulted in the following parameters: the binding constant (KB), stoichiometry (n), enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS). Both GDP- and Gpp(NH)p-dependent binding exhibited exothermic heat responses. The binding stoichiometry for the Rip11-F1 and Rab11a interaction was 0.5, indicating that one Rip11-F1 dimer bound to two Rab11a molecules. This agreed with the gel filtration analysis (Fig. 2). The affinity of Rip11-F1 for Gpp(NH)p-bound Rab11a (54 nm) was 17 times higher than that for GDP-bound Rab11a (950 nm). Similar results were obtained for the interaction of Rip11-F1 with Rab11b (Fig. 3, C and D). There was no exothermic heat response produced by the buffer control or with other Rab GTPases, indicating that the Rab11 and Rip11 interaction was specific and that ITC-based assays can be used to measure affinities between Rab proteins and their effector proteins (Fig. 3, E and F; and data not shown). The ITC data suggest that Rip11 interacts with Rab11a and Rab11b in vitro with similar affinity. To examine these interactions in vivo, we used siRNAs designed against Rab11a and Rab11b isoforms. As shown in Fig. 4, knockdown of Rab11a or Rab11b alone had no effect on Rip11 subcellular distribution, indicating that Rab11b can compensate for Rab11a and vice versa. In contrast, knockdown of both Rab11 isoforms (Fig. 4, C and F) resulted in redistribution of Rip11 from endosomes to the cytosol. To confirm this, we fractionated cells into the cytosol and membranes. As shown in Fig. 5, only double Rab11a and Rab11b knockdown resulted in translocation of Rip11 from membranes to the cytosol.Fig. 5Western blot analysis of Rab11 siRNA-transfected cells. HeLa cells were transfected in the absence (Mock) or presence of Rab11a siRNA, Rab11b siRNA, or Rab11a and Rab11b siRNAs, and cells were then incubated for 74 h. A, Triton X-100 extracts of these cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Rab11a, anti-Rab11b, and anti-Rab4 antibodies. B, Rab11 siRNA-transfected cells were lysed and fractionated into cytosolic (Ctyo) and membrane (Mem) fractions. These fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Rip11 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To gain additional insights into the interaction of Rab11 with FIP family effectors, we extended the ITC-based study to other Rab11 effector proteins, FIP2 and RCP, belonging to the Class I group of FIPs. The interactions of FIP2 and GST-RCP with Rab11a and Rab11b were studied under conditions similar to those for the Rab11-Rip11 interaction as described above. It is evident from Table I that a strong Gpp(NH)p-dependent interaction existed between FIP2 and Rab11a/b (∼40 nm), whereas the interaction with GDP-bound Rab11 was weak (>1000 nm), similar to the conditions for Rab11·Rip11 complex formation. Similar results were also obtained for the interaction of GSTRCP with Rab11, but with slightly decreased affinity (∼2-3-fold) compared with the Rab11-Rip11 interaction (Table I).Table IThermodynamic parameters for the association of Rab11 with Rab11 effector proteinsRab11-FIP-F1 complexKdEnthalpy (ΔH)Entropy (TΔS)Free energy (ΔG)nmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molRip11 titrationRab11a with GDP948−12.8−4.6−8.2Rab11a with Gpp(NH)p54.4−21.4−11.6−9.8Rab11b with GDP797−12.9−4.6−8.3Rab11b with Gpp(NH)p45.9−22.5−12.5−10FIP2 titrationRab11a with GDP1317−23.515.5−8.0Rab11a with Gpp(NH)p40−27.4−17.3−10.1Rab11b with GDP1106−22.5−14.4−8.1Rab11b with Gpp(NH)p44−27.7−17.6−10.1RCP titrationRab11a with GDP1178−16.7−8.6−8.1Rab11a with Gpp(NH)p107−25.7−16.2−9.5Rab11b with GDP1287−17.1−9.1−8.0Rab11b with Gpp(NH)p173−28.3−19.1−9.2 Open table in a new tab Rab11-FIP Interactions Are Thermodynamically Similar and Enthalpically Driven—The enthalpy changes associated with the formation of the Rab11·FIP complex were measured directly using ITC. The net ΔG and entropy (ΔS) were calculated using the following equations: ΔG = -RT ln K and ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, respectively. Negative enthalpy (-12.8 kcal/mol for GDP and -21.4 kcal/mol for Gpp(NH)p) and entropy (-4.6 kcal/mol for GDP and -11.6 kcal/mol for Gpp(NH)p) values were obtained for GDP- as well as Gpp(NH)p-dependent Rab11·Rip11 complex formation; thus, this interaction must be driven by enthalpic rather than entropic factors, as the net favorable ΔG is contributed by enthalpic factors (Table I). The enthalpy for Gpp(NH)p-dependent Rab11·Rip11-F1 complex formation was about two times higher, and the ΔG was about -1.5 to -2.1 kcal/mol larger than that with GDP-dependent Rab11·Rip11 complex formation at each temperature used in the study (Fig. 6A), indicating that Rab11 binds to Rip11 in the presence of Gpp(NH)p with higher affinity. The enthalpy change upon binding showed a strong temperature dependence, which was essentially linear (r = 0.99) (Fig. 6A). GDP- and Gpp(NH)p-dependent Rab11·Rip11 complex formation both displayed a strong enthalpy-entropy compensation, resulting in a relatively constant ΔG at all temperatures tested (Fig. 6B). The change in heat capacity (ΔCp) values were calculated by performing linear regression analysis on a ΔH versus T plot, yielding -0.84 and -0.97 kcal/mol/K, respectively, for both GDP- and Gpp(NH)p-dependent Rab11·Rip11 complex formation. The large negative ΔCp values may be indicative of a hydrophobic component to the binding and may mean that a conformational change accompanies the association of Rip11 with Rab11. The Conserved Hydrophobic Patch and Tyr628 Are Important for Rab11·Rip11 Complex Formation—The thermodynamic analysis of Rip11 and Rab11 interactions suggested that hydrophobic amino acid residues may play an important role in Rab11·Rip11 complex formation. The amino acid sequence alignment of FIPs in the RBD indicates that the conserved hydrophobic residues (marked with asterisks) form a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 7A) (18Meyers J.M. Prekeris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49003-49010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test the importance of these hydrophobic residues, we introduced a conservative substitution of the central core isoleucine residue (Ile629)"

Dab1 consists of an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain followed by a stretch of tyrosyl residues and a large carboxyl-terminal domain. At least two of the tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in vivo by the Src family kinase Fyn (2Arnaud L. Ballif B.A. Forster E. Cooper J.A. Curr.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 at these residues is essential for the transduction of the Reelin signal (4Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr.

It is not required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 or the activation of Src family kinases and PI3-kinase by Reelin (7Ballif B.A. Arnaud L. Cooper J.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 117: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mice expressing a carboxyl-terminal truncated Dab1 protein (p45) display normal brain development (13Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Development. 2002; 129: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although haploinsufficiency of the p45 allele causes a restricted phenotype characterized by positioning defects of late-born cortical plate neurons and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Interestingly, a serine residue near the carboxyl terminus of Dab1 is phosphorylated by Cdk5 in vivo (14Keshvara L. Magdaleno S. Benhayon D. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4869-4877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, which is also essential for the correct positioning of postmitotic neurons (reviewed in Ref. 15Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of this biochemical cross-talk remains unclear.How the Reelin signal in migrating neurons is terminated is not known. The Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 declines only after prolonged incubation periods (16Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Treatment of neurons with sodium orthovanadate did not significantly increase Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphotyrosine phosphatases do not play a major role in limiting the response to Reelin (16Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Dab1 protein levels is a common feature in mice carrying dysfunctional mutations of genes that encode key Reelin signaling molecules, namely Reelin itself (17Rice D.S. Sheldon M. D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Goldowitz D. Curran T. Development. 1998; 125: 3719-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its receptors apoER2 and VLDLR (18Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T.

Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic deficiency of components of the Reelin-Dab1 signaling cascade results in a reduced stoichiometry or absence of Reelin-induced Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations suggest that Reelin signaling might limit itself through a feedback mechanism, which regulates the protein levels of its target molecule Dab1 and depends on its tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Reelin.Here, we report that prolonged exposure of primary embryonic cultured neurons to Reelin reduces Dab1 protein levels. This effect of Reelin involves neither transcriptional nor translational regulatory mechanisms, but depends on the polyubiquitination and proteasomal targeting of Dab1. The proteasomal degradation of Dab1 requires Src family kinase but not PI3-kinase activation. Using genetic models of defective Reelin signaling, we demonstrate that Reelin-induced Dab1 degradation depends on apoER2 and VLDLR expression, and correlates with the number of functional Reelin receptor alleles. Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome interferes with normal cortical plate development. Our results establish Dab1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation as an important mechanism of regulating the cellular response to Reelin and suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery participates in the regulation of neuronal positioning.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The pharmacological inhibitors PP1 (4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1′-naphthyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), ALLM (calpain inhibitor II, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal), CA-074Me (N-(l-3-transpropylcarbonyl-oxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-isoleucyl-l-proline methyl ester), Z-Leu-Leu-CHO (carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucinal), roscovitine (2-(R)(1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine), and olomoucine (2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-methylpurine) were from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth, PA).

HEK-293 cells (CRL-1573, ATCC) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum were transfected with Fu-GENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and harvested 24 to 36 h after transfection.Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Antibodies—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v), Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, mixed with concentrated gel-loading buffer, and separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions. After protein transfer to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), the membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Tween 20 and 4% nonfat dry milk, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, followed by three washing steps with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween and incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) on a Kodak X-Omat Blue film. Scanned images of exposed films were processed with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator Software (San Jose, CA). Bands were quantified with Scion Image Beta 4.0.2 (Scion Corp.). Immunoprecipitation of Dab1 from cellular lysates (immunoprecipitation buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v), Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures) was carried out as described (8Bock H.H.

For the detection of ubiquitinated Dab1, N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm) was added freshly to the immunoprecipitation buffer (22Mimnaugh E.G. Bonvini P. Neckers L. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acid residues of mouse Dab1 and of mouse LDL receptor and the mouse monoclonal anti-Reelin antibody G10, which was kindly provided by Dr. André Goffinet (Brussels), have been described elsewhere (18Trommsdorff M.

The mouse monoclonal antibody P4D1 against ubiquitin, polyubiquitin, and ubiquitinated proteins and the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Cdk5 and FAK were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, the anti-Src antibody (clone GD11), and a rabbit antibody against Fyn were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit antibodies against AKT and ERK were bought from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and the polyclonal antibody against serine 473-phosphorylated AKT was from BioSource (Camarillo, CA).RNA Preparation, Northern Blot Analysis, and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cultured neurons after control or Reelin treatment for the indicated times with RNA-STAT60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). 20 μg of total RNA were separated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde-containing gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleic acids were cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. For hybridization (1 h at 68 °C) with RapidHyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences), 1 ng of a Dab1-specific probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) employing the RediPrime Random Primed labeling Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Purification from excess free nucleotides was done with MicroSpin G50 columns from Amersham Biosciences. Bound probe was detected by autoradiography.For real time PCR, first strand cDNA was synthesized from DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX)-treated total RNA with random hexamer primers using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription reagents from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The real time PCR was carried out with SyBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in 384-well plates using the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (25Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). All reactions were done in triplicate. The relative amount of all mRNAs was calculated using the comparative CT method (described in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin No. 2, Rev B, 2001). Cyclophilin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were used as invariant controls.Specific primers for Dab1 cDNA amplification were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Two different sets of Dab1 primer pairs were used, both of which were designed to bind to the corresponding mouse and rat cDNA sequences. Of the three murine Dab1 mRNA isoforms encoding proteins of 555, 217, and 271 residues (26Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the Dab217 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number Y08381) differs from the Dab555 mRNA (Y08379, rat AB072426) by a consensus splice donor sequence, encodes a further 18 residues before a stop codon, and terminates with a 3′-untranslated sequence that is different from Dab555. The Dab271 mRNA (Y08380) contains an additional exon that encodes 30 residues before a stop codon. Primer pair 1 (Dab1) bridges exons 2 and 3 of the Dab1 gene, which are shared by Dab555, Dab271, and Dab217 (forward primer 5′-GCCAAGAAAGACTCCAGGAAGA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GGACCCCTTCGCCTTTAAAC-3′). Primer pair 2 (Dab555), which bridges exons 9 and 10 (forward primer 5′-TTATGATGTGCCAAAAAGTCAACCT-3′ reverse primer 5′-AGTTCTAGTTGGGTCACAGCACTTAC-3′), was designed to detect the Dab555 mRNA only (13Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Development. 2002; 129: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The exon structure of the Dab1 gene was derived from a murine chromosome 4 genomic contig (NT_039264). The primer sequences used for the control genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and cyclophilin B) have been described elsewhere (25Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L.

Far less is known about the termination of the Reelin-induced signal. In line with earlier observations reporting down-regulation of Dab1 in neurons in response to long term treatment with Reelin (16Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we found a robust decrease in Dab1 protein levels after stimulating cultured forebrain neurons with Reelin for 8 h (Fig. 1A). A range of different membrane and cytosolic proteins was not affected by Reelin incubation (Fig. 1A), indicating that the effect on Dab1 levels was specific. Activation of the serine-threonine kinase AKT, a downstream target of Reelin, which requires tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 (6Beffert U. Morfini G. Bock H.H. Reyna H. Brady S.T. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49958-49964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), was not observed after prolonged treatment, which is in line with the disappearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1 (Fig. 1A). We found that the protein levels of Dab1 were reduced to about one-half of the initial amount after 2.5 h and were almost undetectable by immunoblotting after 6.5 h of treatment (Fig. 1B), whereas the levels of the serine-threonine kinase Cdk5 did not change.Reelin Induced Decrease of Dab1 Protein Levels in Cultured Embryonic Neurons—Northern blot analysis of neurons treated for 8 h revealed no decrease of Dab1 mRNA levels in response to Reelin (Fig. 1C). These results were confirmed by real time PCR. Two different primer pairs were designed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” which amplify either all three major Dab1 transcripts (bridging exons 2 and 3, named Dab1 in Fig. 1C), or full-length Dab1 (named Dab555) only (13Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Development. 2002; 129: 787-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression of Dab1 mRNA was not altered in response to Reelin treatment for 4, 8, or 16 h. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not abolish the difference in Dab1 levels of control- and Reelin-treated neurons (Fig. 1D). Altogether, these data suggest that the Reelin effect on Dab1 protein levels is neither transcriptionally regulated nor because of suppression of translation.Reelin Targets Dab1 for Proteasomal Degradation—Next, we used different pharmacological inhibitors to investigate if the Reelin-induced destruction of Dab1 is mediated by proteolytic degradation of Dab1. ALLN and ALLM, two peptide aldehyde inhibitors, blocked the Dab1 degradation (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6). Both compounds, also known as calpain inhibitors I and II, inhibit calpains as well as the proteasome (28Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar), a large enzyme complex that degrades ubiquitin-tagged cellular proteins (29Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar). ALLM also blocks cathepsins, lysosomal cystein proteases (30Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1990; 3: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the different inhibitory activities, more specific inhibitors were used. Chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases (31de Duve C. de Barsy T. Poole B. Trouet A. Tulkens P. Van Hoof F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2495-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar), and CA-074Me, a selective and irreversible cathepsin-B inhibitor, had no effect on Dab1 degradation at concentrations of 100 and 50 μm, respectively (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 10).Fig. 2Reelin signaling targets Dab1 protein for degradation by the proteasome.A, cultured neurons were incubated with control medium or Reelin in the presence of different inhibitors. The lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against Dab1 and Cdk5. ALLM (50 μm, lanes 3 and 4) and ALLN (25 μm, lanes 5 and 6) blocked the Reelin-induced degradation of Dab1 (lane 2, no inhibitor). The inhibition of the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin-B, which is also inhibited by ALLM, with the specific inhibitor CA-074 methyl ester (50 μm, lanes 7 and 8), or of lysosomal proteases with the general inhibitor chloroquine (100 μm, lanes 9 and 10), had no effect. B, the inhibitory effect of ALLN (lanes 6-8) and ALLM, also known as calpain inhibitors I and II, on Reelin-mediated Dab1 degradation is not because of inhibition of calpains. Immunoblots of neuronal lysates treated with different calpain inhibitors and control or Reelin are shown. FAK served as a loading control. The potent and selective calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 (lanes 1-5) had no effect on Dab1 degradation even at a concentration of 100 μm (lane 2), whereas carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucinal (Z-Leu-Leu-CHO), another calpain inhibitor with high selectivity over the proteasome, inhibited Dab1 degradation only partially at very high concentrations (50 μm, lane 12). C, proteasome inhibitors block Reelin-induced degradation of Dab1. MG-132 (10 μm, lanes 1 and 2), a reversible inhibitor, and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (*) (10 μm, lanes 3 and 4), an irreversible inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, both efficiently inhibit Reelin-induced Dab1 degradation (top panel). ERK (bottom panel) was used as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calpains are proteases that participate in cellular functions like cytoskeletal rearrangement, signal transduction, and apoptosis (32Goll D.E"
https://openalex.org/W2020294628,"The main hypothesis for prion diseases proposes that the cellular protein (PrPC) can be altered into a misfolded, β-sheet-rich isoform (PrPSc), which undergoes aggregation and triggers the onset of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Here, we compare the stability against pressure and the thermomechanical properties of the α-helical and β-sheet conformations of recombinant murine prion protein, designated as α-rPrP and β-rPrP, respectively. High temperature induces aggregates and a large gain in intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet (β-rPrP), a conformation that shares structural similarity with PrPSc. α-rPrP is highly stable, and only pressures above 5 kilobars (1 kilobar = 100 MegaPascals) cause reversible denaturation, a process that leads to a random and turnrich conformation with concomitant loss of α-helix, as measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In contrast, aggregates of β-rPrP are very sensitive to pressure, undergoing transition into a dissociated species that differs from the denatured form derived from α-rPrP. The higher susceptibility to pressure of β-rPrP can be explained by its less hydrated structure. Pressure perturbation calorimetry supports the view that the accessible surface area of α-rPrP is much higher than that of β-rPrP, which explains the lower degree of hydration of β-rPrP. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism of prion conversion and show how water plays a prominent role. Our results allow us to propose a volume and free energy diagram of the different species involved in the conversion and aggregation. The existence of different folded conformations as well as different denatured states of PrP may explain the elusive character of its conversion into a pathogenic form.

The prion protein (PrP) 1The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; rPrP, murine recombinant PrP; FT-IR, Fourier transform infrared; rPrP23–231, full-length recombinant murine PrP; PPC, pressure perturbation calorimetry; kb, kilobar. is known to be the major agent that causes transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar). The conversion from an α-helical (cellular PrP or denoted PrPC) to a β-sheet-rich structure (Prion Scrapie, denoted PrPSc) determines the onset of these particular diseases (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 2Weissmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3-6Google Scholar, 3Caughey B Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 235-242Google Scholar, 4Aguzzi A. Polymenidou M. Cell. 2004; 116: 313-327Google Scholar). The PrPC is anchored in the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol bridge and is rich in α-helical structure and highly soluble (5Pan K.-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar). In contrast, PrPSc is mostly insoluble and has a greater β-sheet content than PrPC (5Pan K.-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar, 6Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Google Scholar). However, in most cases, both prion isoforms are derived from PrP molecules displaying the same primary sequence, although the PrPSc may exist in variable truncated forms in vivo, because of its partial resistance to proteolysis (7Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Google Scholar). The mechanism of PrPC to PrPSc conversion is not yet completely understood. However, recent studies show that other macromolecules, such as nucleic acids, may participate in the conversion (8Cordeiro Y. Machado F. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Brentani R.R. Foguel D. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49400-49409Google Scholar, 9Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Nature. 2003; 425: 717-720Google Scholar, 10Caughey B. Kocisko D.A.

A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar), several studies have been published on the thermodynamic and structural properties of this unusual protein (11Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27517-27520Google Scholar, 12Riek R. Wider G. Billeter M. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most of these studies have used denaturing agents or an increase in temperature to assess the dissociation/denaturation of the prion protein (16Safar J. Roller P.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2206-2216Google Scholar, 17Torrent J. Alvarez-Martinez M.T. Heitz F. Liautard J.-P. Balny C. Lange R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1318-1325Google Scholar). Another tool for investigating the unfolding of PrP is high pressure, which has an advantage over other methods because its perturbation of macromolecules in solution depends solely on the volume change of the process under study (18Silva J.L. Foguel D. Royer C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 612-618Google Scholar). High pressure favors the formation of structures with lower volume, and application of pressure generally hydrates the hydrophobic interior of proteins (19Oliveira A.C. Gaspar L.P. Da Poian A.T. Silva J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 184-187Google Scholar, 20Royer C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 25: 201-209Google Scholar). Moreover, proteins with a large volume fraction of solvent-excluded cavities are highly sensitive to pressure (18Silva J.L. Foguel D. Royer C. Trends Biochem.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9831-9836Google Scholar). Thus, high pressure is a unique tool for exploring hydration and packing of proteins. More recently, misfolded proteins that form aggregates and amyloids, which are derived from partially folding intermediates at the junction between productive and off-pathway folding, have been studied as well (17Torrent J.

Other groups have utilized high pressure to study prion folding and inactivation but always in combination with other denaturing conditions (17Torrent J. Alvarez-Martinez M.T. Heitz F. Liautard J.-P.

Here, we describe the effects of high pressure on the full-length recombinant murine prion protein (rPrP23–231) and on the β-sheet-rich rPrP aggregates (β-rPrP), which are amyloid-like structures obtained by thermal treatment (29Rezaei H.

Brandts J.F. Brandts J.M. Plotnikov V. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 144-160Google Scholar) to probe the secondary structure and hydration of the protein, respectively. We find that, whereas α-helical rPrP undergoes aggregation at high temperature into a β-sheet-rich structure, it is markedly resistant to pressure, displaying almost no change in secondary structure up to 4 kilobars (kb). Denaturation of α-rPrP occurs at higher pressures and is totally reversible. Unlike native α-rPrP, the β-rPrP aggregates are highly susceptible to pressure and are readily dissociated at pressures below 4 kbar. In contrast to pressure, thermal denaturation of rPrP is an irreversible process. The overall hydration of α-rPrP and β-rPrP was evaluated by pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC), which provides information on the hydration of the proteins during thermal denaturation through measurement of the heat induced by small periodic changes of gas pressure (32Dzwolak W. Ravindra R. Lendermann J. Winter R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11347-11355Google Scholar, 34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Brandts J.M. Plotnikov V. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 144-160Google Scholar). Overall, our results show denaturation of recombinant full-length prion protein by high pressure without the use of temperature or denaturants; newly formed aggregates are less hydrated and have more cavities than native prion protein and late aggregates. Reagents and Protein Samples—All of the reagents used were of analytical grade. D2O for FT-IR spectroscopy was purchased from Aldrich. The rPrP23–231 cloned in pRSET plasmid (kindly given by Prof. R. Brentani and Prof. Vilma R. Martins) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by high affinity column refolding as described (35Zahn R. von Schrötter C. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Google Scholar). For the FT-IR spectroscopy experiments, purified rPrP was dissolved in D2O and then lyophilized three times to remove all H2O from the sample. The dried protein was dissolved to a concentration of 4% (w/v) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pD 6.5) in 99.9% D2O for all thermal experiments. Pressure-insensitive Tris-DCl buffer (10 mm, pD 7.5) was used for high pressure experiments. rPrP aggregates were obtained by incubation of the native protein (4%) at 50 °C for 2 and 48 h and are denoted β-rPrP and β-rPrPlate, respectively. rPrP at 2 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 was used for PPC experiments. High Pressure Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—For the temperature studies, protein solutions were loaded into a FT-IR cell with 4-mm-thick CaF2 windows separated by 50-μm mylar spacers. The temperature in the cell was controlled by an external water circuit and was increased gradually between 20 and 80 °C at 10 °C/h. A diamond anvil cell (High Pressure Diamond Optics Inc.) was used for the measurements under pressure. The samples were mixed with powdered α-quartz in a stainless-steel compartment (0.5 mm in diameter, 0.05 mm deep) (31Panick G. Malessa R. Winter R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6512-6519Google Scholar, 33Herberhold H. Marchal S. Lange R. Scheyhing C.H. Vogel R.F. Winter R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1153-1164Google Scholar), and changes in pressure were quantified by the shift of the quartz phonon band at ∼798 cm–1 (36Wong P.T.T. Moffatt D.J. Baudais F.L. Appl. Spectrosc. 1985; 39: 733-735Google Scholar). The pressure studies were carried out between 1 bar and ∼10 kbar. An equilibration time of ∼15 min was given before taking data at each temperature and pressure. FT-IR spectra were collected on a Nicolet Magna 550 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector operated at –196 °C. Spectra were generated by co-adding 256 interferograms collected at 2 cm–1 resolution and apodized with a Happ-Genzel function. Base-line data were obtained using buffer in D2O. The sample chamber was purged with dry, CO2-free air. Determination of peak position and curve fitting were performed with OMNIC (Nicolet, Madison, WI) and GRAMS (Galactic, Salem, NH) software, respectively. Integral intensities of the secondary structure elements were calculated by analysis of the deconvoluted amide I′ (the prime indicates that the solvent is D2O) vibrational mode of the IR spectrum with a band fitting procedure assuming a Gaussian-Lorentzian line shape function (30Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Google Scholar, 33Herberhold H. Marchal S. Lange R. Scheyhing C.H. Vogel R.F. Winter R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1153-1164Google Scholar). Fourier self-deconvolution of the IR spectra was performed with a resolution enhancement factor of 1.8 and a bandwidth of 15 cm–1. We note that the results of this method need to be treated with caution for the determination of absolute values of the secondary structure elements, because their transition dipole moments may be different and because theoretical predictions of the absorbance frequencies of model polypeptide secondary structures may be influenced by structural distortions, variable hydrogen/deuterium exchange, etc. No problems arise, however, from the application of the fitting method to the study of relative changes in conformations of the protein backbone, which was the primary goal of this study. The goodness of the fit reached using the Levenberg-Marquardt method was very satisfactory (R2 values were 98.7–99.6%; the noise level was ∼0.1%) when peak fitting of the amide I′ band was done with six mixed Gaussian and Lorentzian peak functions. The error in determination of the secondary structure elements from the relative peak areas of the amide I′ band (integral intensities) from different runs is approximately ±2%. For analysis of pressure-induced transitions of α- and β-rPrP, two conformational states were assumed, native (N) and unfolded (U). The standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG0 = –RTlnK) and the equilibrium constant for the reaction (K) depend on the standard volume change of the reaction according to the relation K(p) = K0exp(–pΔV/RT), where K(p) and K0 are the equilibrium constants of unfolding at pressure p and atmospheric pressure, respectively, and ΔV is the volume change of the reaction (18Silva J.L. Foguel D. Royer C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 612-618Google Scholar). Pressure Perturbation Calorimetry—PPC measurements were performed with a Valerian Plotnikov differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) equipped with PPC accessory from MicroCal. The PPC technique is described in detail elsewhere (32Dzwolak W. Ravindra R. Lendermann J. Winter R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11347-11355Google Scholar). In short, one can obtain valuable thermodynamic information on protein hydration, expansivity, and relative volume changes upon thermal denaturation (34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Brandts J.M. Plotnikov V. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 144-160Google Scholar) by measuring the heat change ΔQ, which is released upon small pressure changes, Δp, at temperature T. Through several reference measurements and knowing the thermal expansion coefficient of the solvent (αs) as well as the mass (m) and partial specific volume of the solute (V), it is possible to calculate the apparent thermal expansion coefficient (α) of the protein in solution (34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Brandts J.M. Plotnikov V. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 144-160Google Scholar), α = αs – ΔQ/(T ΔpmV). The relative volume change of the protein during unfolding or aggregation can also be calculated by measuring α(T) in a system undergoing a heat-induced transition and integrating the α versus. T plot over temperature (32Dzwolak W. Ravindra R. Lendermann J. Winter R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11347-11355Google Scholar, 34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Brandts J.M. Plotnikov V. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 144-160Google Scholar). At every temperature step, an identical small pressure jump of +5 bar was applied to both sample and reference cells using pressurized N2 gas. For the analysis, signals from the bufferbuffer, buffer-water, and water-water runs are subtracted from the sample buffer PPC run. The partial specific volume of mouse rPrP used for the volumetric calculations was 0.73 cm3 g–1. The stability of rPrP was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy using temperature and pressure as physical perturbations. The most useful IR band for the analysis of the secondary structure of proteins in aqueous media is the amide I band (which downshifts by ∼5 cm–1 when in D2O as solvent and is then labeled amide I′ band), which occurs between ∼1700 and ∼1600 cm–1 (31Panick G. Malessa R. Winter R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6512-6519Google Scholar). The amide I band represents 76% of the C=O stretching vibration of the amide group, coupled to the C–N stretching (14%) and C–C–N deformation (10%) mode. The exact frequency of this vibration depends on the nature of the hydrogen bonding involving the amide group, and this is determined by the particular secondary structure adopted by the protein. Using the analysis described under “Material and Methods,” the component bands representing α-helices, β-sheets, turns, and random structures can be determined. The percentages of these structures are estimated by expressing the areas of the component bands as a fraction of the total amide I area. (Table I). Because of the unknown transition dipole moments of the various secondary structure elements, no absolute values for the population of conformational states can be given. Curve fitting of the amide I′ spectra of rPrP revealed six bands, appearing at ∼1668 (turns), 1651 (α-helices), 1642 (random coil), 1628 (β-sheets), 1680, and 1613 (antiparallel β-sheets) cm–1 (Table I).Table IApproximate wave numbers of α-rPrP and β-rPrP secondary structure elements in the amide I′ region (1700-1600 cm-1) of the infrared spectra (in parentheses are the wavenumbers for mature β-rPrPlate)Secondary structureAmide I′ wavenumber (cm-1)Antiparallel β-sheets∼1680 (1689) and ∼1613 (1616)β-Sheets∼1628 (1635)Turns∼1668 (1673)α-Helices∼1651 (1659)Random coil∼1642 (1649) Open table in a new tab Effect of Temperature on the Structure and Stability of rPrP—To investigate the effect of temperature on the secondary structure of rPrP, we measured the heat-induced changes in the amide I′ region of the infrared spectrum in the temperature range from 20 to 80 °C. Selected FT-IR spectra of the prion protein are shown in Fig. 1A. The amide I′ band maximum in the native protein occurs at ∼1648 cm–1, which is typical for random coil-rich proteins (30Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Google Scholar). The temperature-induced denaturation is indicated by the appearance of new IR bands at 1613 and 1680 cm–1 and occurs at 43 ± 3 °C. These new IR bands are characteristic of the intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet resulting from aggregation of the denatured protein (37Ismail A.A. Mantsch H.H. Wong P.T.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 183-188Google Scholar). The evolution of changes in secondary structures with temperature is shown in Fig. 1B. Based on fitting the amide I′ band to obtain the subcomponents (Table I), the structure of the native protein at 25 °C contains 11% turns, 28% α-helices, 46% random coil, and 14% antiparallel β-sheet with ± 2% deviations (Fig. 1B). The NMR data for mouse rPrP23–231 yield were 10.0% turns, 25.8% α-helices, 62.2% random structures, and 1.9% β-strands, as calculated from mouse rPrP121–231 (1AG2.pdb) after adding the N-terminal segment 23–120 and assuming this domain to be completely random (38Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180Google Scholar, 39Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Google Scholar). rPrP loses α-helical structure and acquires a higher antiparallel β-sheet content during the temperature-induced denaturation process (Fig. 1). We use the term denaturation in a broad sense, because the loss of α-helices and the gain of β-sheet cannot be considered a typical unfolding transition. The relative content of α-helices decreases from 28% at 25 °C to 16% at 70 °C. Concomitantly, the protein also loses random coil structure (from 46% at 25 °C to 18% at 70 °C) and gains intermolecular β-sheet structure (up to 43%; Fig. 1B). Upon cooling from 80 °C to room temperature, the aggregation bands remain unchanged, indicating that the rPrP23–231 temperature-induced transition cannot be reversed by a simple temperature decrease (Fig. 1B, open symbols). The thermal transition was also observed by CD spectroscopy, which revealed a process highly dependent on protein concentration. 2Y. Cordeiro and J. L. Silva, unpublished results. We also found that aggregation, as measured by light scattering, paralleled the gain in β-sheet structure (data not shown). Effect of Pressure on the Structure and Stability of Native α-rPrP and Aggregated β-rPrP—To reach a better understanding of the PrP folding pathway, we also analyzed the stability of native rPrP against pressure, and we describe the differences between the pressure- and temperature-denatured states. To investigate the effect of pressure on the secondary structure of rPrP, we measured the pressure-induced changes in the amide I′ vibration mode in the range from 0.001 to 10 kbar at two selected temperatures (25 and 50 °C). At 25 °C, the prion protein (α-rPrP) is native, predominantly α-helical, and random. Fig. 2A shows spectra of α-rPrP as a function of pressure at 25 °C. Pressure-induced unfolding occurs above 4.5 kbar with a p1/2 of 5.4 ± 0.2 kbar and is indicated by changes in the amide I′ band region; the band becomes broader, and the intensity of the main peak decreases and shifts to lower wavenumbers, indicating a decrease in α-helical structures. The behavior of secondary structural changes upon isothermal sample pressurization is presented in Fig. 2B. During unfolding, which is reversible (Fig. 2, open symbols), α-helical structure decreases significantly, from 26 to 12%, and the content of turns increases from 12 to 19%. No marked changes are observed in random and β-sheet conformations within 12 h. In addition, we compared the stability of native α-rPrP with the aggregated β-sheet form obtained by thermal treatment. rPrP was incubated above the transition temperature (50 °C) for 2 h (referred to as β-rPrP) and 48 h (β-rPrPlate). The IR bands of the β-rPrPlate aggregate (at ∼1680 and ∼1613 cm–1) exhibit both a blue shift of ∼7 cm–1 compared with the β-rPrP aggregate (Table I), which might be due to the formation of an aggregated structure with weaker/fewer hydrogen bonding of the C=O groups. We subjected both types of aggregates (β-rPrP and β-rPrPlate) to pressure at 50 and 25 °C, respectively. The effect of high pressure on aggregated β-rPrP at a temperature above the thermal unfolding temperature was investigated up to 10 kbar. The inset in Fig. 3A shows β-rPrP spectra at 50 °C at 1 and 3.8 kbar; the amide I′ band has a shape typical of aggregated rPrP (Fig. 1A) with a broad maximum at 1641 cm–1 and two shoulders at 1613 and 1680 cm–1, a pattern that is characteristic of antiparallel β-sheets. The effect of pressure on the β-rPrP aggregates at 50 °C is dramatic. The aggregate dissociates at pressures between 2.5 and 4 kbar, with a p1/2 of 2.8 ± 0.1 kbar. The relative peak area of β-sheet structures decreases from ∼43 to ∼29%. However, the intermolecular β-sheet structures are not completely disrupted by pressure (Fig. 3A), resulting in a denatured species that is different from that obtained by pressure denaturation of α-rPrP. The content of random structures increases markedly (up to ∼41%) at the transition, whereas the population of α-helices decreases to ∼10% at 10 kbar. After pressure release and return to 1 bar, the protein acquires the same amount of intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet as it had before pressure treatment. Hence, unlike the thermal denaturation of the prion protein, the pressure-induced transition is reversible. Because the final data points (at 10–12 kbar) are different for the α-rPrP and β-rPrP structures, they clearly belong to different denatured states. The differences in pressure susceptibility between α-rPrP and β-rPrP are clearly visualized in Fig. 4. α-rPrP undergoes pressure denaturation at much higher pressures and with a smaller volume change than β-rPrP. Overall, the data indicate that formation of β-rPrP induces the appearance of solvent-excluded cavities, highly sensitive to pressure. We also studied the stability of β-rPrPlate against high pressure up to 12 kbar at two different temperatures, 25 and 50 °C (see Fig. 3B for the 50 °C data). Within experimental error, we could not detect any significant changes in the FT-IR spectra or in the population of secondary structure elements at either temperature over the whole pressure range covered, which indicates a marked pressure stability of these mature aggregates. Pressure Perturbation Calorimetry—We performed PPC measurements to further explore the changes in thermal expansion and volume of native rPrP and of the β-rPrP aggregate. The apparent thermal expansion coefficient α is depicted as a function of temperature between 10 and 95 °C for both samples (Fig. 5). These data clearly show that α of rPrP decreases markedly from 1.75 × 10–3 K–1 to a value near 0.3 × 10–3 K–1. Above ∼80 °C, α decreases only slightly. High α-values at low temperature and their decrease with increasing temperature are indicative of the presence of a significant number of structure-breaking hydrophilic groups on the surface of rPrP (34Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Brandts J.M. Plotnikov V. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 144-160Google Scholar, 40Ravindra R. Winter R. Chemphyschem. 2003; 4: 359-365Google Scholar). In other words, the solvent-accessible surface area is very high for α-rPrP. No identifiable peak occurs in the α(T) curve, indicating that the temperature-induced aggregation process does not involve detectable volume changes during the PPC run, very similar to the final insulin aggregation step (32Dzwolak W. Ravindra R. Lendermann J. Winter R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11347-11355Google Scholar). The changes in α(T) for β-rPrP (Fig. 5B) are much smaller than for α-rPrP (Fig. 5A), which is obviously because of the decrease in hydrated accessible surface area of the aggregated chains. Here, we present clear-cut evidence that the conversion of α-rPrP into β-rPrP involves a substantial change in hydration and accessible surface area as determined by high pressure FT-IR spectroscopy and pressure perturbation calorimetry. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy has been widely used to probe transitions in secondary conformation of proteins (6Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S.

In addition to the estrogen receptor (ER), tamoxifen binds with high affinity to the microsomal antiestrogen binding site (AEBS), which is involved in ER-independent effects of tamoxifen. In the present study, we investigate the modulation of the biosynthesis of cholesterol in tumor cell lines by AEBS ligands. As a consequence of the treatment with the antitumoral drugs tamoxifen or PBPE, a selective AEBS ligand, we show that tumor cells produced a significant concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of cholesterol precursors. Sterols have been purified by HPLC and gas chromatography, and their chemical structures determined by mass spectrometric analysis. The major metabolites identified were 5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol for tamoxifen treatment and 5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol and cholesta-5,7-dien-3β-ol, for PBPE treatment, suggesting that these AEBS ligands affect at least two enzymatic steps: the 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ8-Δ7-isomerase and the 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ7-reductase. Steroidal antiestrogens such as ICI 182,780 and RU 58,668 did not affect these enzymatic steps, because they do not bind to the AEBS. Transient co-expression of human 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ8-Δ7-isomerase and 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ7-reductase and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both enzymes were required to reconstitute the AEBS in mammalian cells. Altogether, these data provide strong evidence that the AEBS is a hetero-oligomeric complex including 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ8-Δ7-isomerase and the 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ7-reductase as subunits that are necessary and sufficient for tamoxifen binding in mammary cells. Furthermore, because selective AEBS ligands are antitumoral compounds, these data suggest a link between cholesterol metabolism at a post-lanosterol step and tumor growth control. These data afford both the identification of the AEBS and give new insight into a novel molecular mechanism of action for drugs of clinical value.

Two principal points remained unsolved: the first is the precise molecular nature of the AEBS and the second the explanation of the difference observed between the nanomolar affinity of AEBS ligands and their micromolar effectiveness for growth control and cytotoxicity. We have been involved in the identification of the AEBS for several years. The AEBS can be found in most tissues in mammals and is abundant in microsomes of liver that contained 20–30× the amount found in tumor cell lines (18Chailleux C. Poirot M. Mesange F. Bayard F. Faye J.C. J. Recept. Res. 1994; 14: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For this reason, the liver have been chosen for the purification of the AEBS but the pharmacological profiles of the AEBS found in the liver and in tumor cell lines such as MCF-7 cells (a mammary adenocarcinoma cell line) have been reported to be different, suggesting a possible difference in the composition of the AEBS in the two systems (19Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 541-551PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the AEBS from rat liver was a hetero-oligomeric multiprotein complex that contained subunits that were not directly involved in the binding of tamoxifen such as the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) (20Mésange F. Sebbar M. Kedjouar B. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Bayard F. Delarue F. Faye J.C. Poirot M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the carboxyl-esterase (ES-10), and the liver fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) (21Mesange F. Sebbar M. Kedjouar B. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Bayard F. Poirot M. Faye J.C. Bioconjug. Chem. 2002; 13: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins have been implicated in lipid metabolism: mEH is a bile acid transporter (22von Dippe P. Amoui M. Stellwagen R.H. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18176-18180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and carboxylesterase has cholesterol esterification properties (23Becker A. Bottcher A. Lackner K.J. Fehringer P. Notka F. Aslanidis C. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but were related to the AEBS found in normal liver because ES-10 and FABP were not found in tumor cell lines. The AEBS was also initially described as an intracellular receptor for histamine (HIC) by Brandes and co-workers (24LaBella F.S. Queen G.M. Brandes L.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). They have proposed that the AEBS/HIC might be a cytochrome p450 CYP 3A4. Recently, two different groups have reported that an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, the 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ8-Δ7-isomerase (D8D7I), when expressed in yeast, displayed a high affinity binding site for tamoxifen, suggesting that this site might be the AEBS (25Paul R. Silve S. De Nys N. Dupuy P.H. Bouteiller C.L. Rosenfeld J. Ferrara P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Loison G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1296-1302PubMed Google Scholar, 26Moebius F.F. Reiter R.J. Bermoser K. Glossmann H. Cho S.Y. Paik Y.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). D8D7I was first described as the emopamil binding site (EBP), or the SR 31747A binding protein 1 (SRBP1) because it bound the voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker emopamil and the immunosuppressive and antitumoral drug SR-31747A when expressed in yeast (25Paul R. Silve S. De Nys N. Dupuy P.H. Bouteiller C.L. Rosenfeld J. Ferrara P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Loison G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1296-1302PubMed Google Scholar, 26Moebius F.F. Reiter R.J. Bermoser K. Glossmann H. Cho S.Y. Paik Y.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However D8D7I did not exhibit binding capacities for [3H]tamoxifen when expressed in mammalian cells, suggesting that D8D7I was not sufficient by itself to constitute the AEBS (26Moebius F.F. Reiter R.J. Bermoser K. Glossmann H. Cho S.Y. Paik Y.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However the basic problem was that none of these proteins exhibit the molecular mass of 40 kDa that we have previously determined as being the size of the binding subunit of tamoxifen on the AEBS using photoaffinity labeling (27Poirot M. Chailleux C. Fargin A. Bayard F. Faye J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17039-17043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report the consequences of the treatment by tamoxifen or PBPE, a selective AEBS ligand, on the biosynthesis of cholesterol in different tumor cell lines, including human adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7. We have focused on cholesterol precursors of the C-27 series and have determined the amount and the structure of the metabolites that accumulated in cells when they were treated with these drugs. We report in this study that tamoxifen and the selective AEBS ligand PBPE produced a massive accumulation of 5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol and/or 5α-cholesta-5,7-dien-3β-ol that suggests an inhibition of the D8D7I and the 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ7-reductase (DHCR7), two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Co-expression of D8D7I and DHCR7 in COS-7 cells produced a high affinity binding site for tritiated tamoxifen that displayed the pharmacological profile of the AEBS found in tumor cells. Immunoprecipitation followed by tamoxifen binding to the immunoprecipitate complex showed that D8D7I and DHCR7 are associated proteins necessary for the reconstitution of the AEBS. Chemicals—PBPE, DPPE, N-morpholino-2-[4-(benzyl)-phenoxy]-ethanamine·HCl (MBPE), and N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(tertiobutyl)-phenoxy]-ethamine (t-BuPE) were synthesized as previously described (6Poirot M. De Medina P. Delarue F. Perie J.J. Klaebe A. Faye J.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 2007-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). trans-1,4-Bis(2-chlorobenzylaminomethyl) cyclohexane dihydrochloride (AY 9944) was synthesized in the laboratory, and its purity was greater than 98%. BD 1008 was kindly provided by Dr W. D. Bowen (National Institutes of Health), BM 15,766 was from Roche Applied Science (Pernzberg, Germany). CI-628 was from Park Davis. ICI 164,384 was from Astra Zeneca Pharmaceutical (Wilmington, DE). Raloxifene, RU 58,668 and RU 39,411 were kindly provided by Dr. P. van de Velde from Aventis (Romainville, France).

Tamoxifen, 4-OH-tamoxifen, clomiphene, cholesterol-oleate, lanosterol, cholesterol, lathosterol, desmosterol, 6-ketocholestanol, 7-ketocholesterol, and 7-dehydrocholesterol were from Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents were from Prolabo (Paris, France). N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl)trifluoro acetamide was from Fluka. Other compounds and chemicals were from Aldrich-Sigma. Anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) mouse monoclonal antibody (16B10 clone) was from Eurogentec (Anger, France). The pCMV-LacZ reporter plasmid was kindly provided by H. Paris (Toulouse, France). Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells (a human breast cancer cell line expressing estrogen receptors) were initially obtained from M. Rich (Michigan Cancer Foundation). These cells were adapted to grow in a chemically defined medium (28Jozan S. Tournier J.F. Tauber J.P. Bayard F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar): in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1.2 mm glutamine (pH 7.4 at 23 °C), 0.08 unit/ml human recombinant insulin, and 0.1 mg/ml human apo-transferrin and were called MCF-7WS. MDA-MB-231 (a human breast cancer cell line that does not express estrogen receptors) and SAOS-2 (a human osteosarcoma cell line) cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection. These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1.2 mm glutamine, pH 7.4, at 23 °C, and 4% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2. Treatment of Cells with Drugs—MCF-7ws were grown to 70% confluence. At day 0, tamoxifen, PBPE, ICI 182,780, RU 56,668 or 17β-estradiol at concentrations of 0.5 μm, 0.5 μm, 0.5 μm, 0.5 μm, and 10 nm, respectively were added in ethanolic solution. The final concentration of ethanol (0.1%, v/v) did not interfere with the biosynthesis of cholesterol in cells. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and counted. 0.1 μCi of [14C]cholesterol (Isotopchim, specific activity is 1898 MBq/mmol) as internal standard and 0.05% butylated hydroxytoluene (5 mg/ml) were added to cells. Cells were then immediately processed for extraction of unsaponifiable lipids (29Ways P. Hanahan D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 318-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and resuspended in 40 μl of methanol. For each condition 8 × 107 to 108 cells were used for analysis. Kinetics were performed by treatment of MCF-7ws with tamoxifen and PBPE for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Dose response studies were done with increasing concentrations of tamoxifen and PBPE for 48 h of incubation with MCF-7ws cells. Tests on other cell lines were performed with 5 μm tamoxifen or 10 μm PBPE for 48 h. Comparative tests with other drugs were performed by a 48 h treatment of MCF-7 cells using 5 μm antiestrogens or 10 μm of the other drugs. Sterols were extracted as described above. The percentage recovery of sterols during their purification was 80–90% as judged by the amount of radioactivity recovered. Silver Nitrate Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—TLC was carried out with silica gel 60 from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Plates were pulverized with a solution of 0.1% (w/v) silver nitrate in acetonitrile in the absence of light, and then wrapped in aluminum foil before drying in an oven under reduced pressure at 110 °C over 1 h. Sterols from the extracts were analyzed by silver nitrate thin layer chromatography with methanol/acetone (57:2, v/v) as the mobile phase (29Ways P. Hanahan D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 318-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shefer S. Salen G. Batta A.K. Honda A. Tint G.S. Irons M. Elias E.R. Chen T.C. Holick M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1779-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Samples were detected by spraying with 50% sulfuric acid in methanol (v/v) and by heating the chromatogram on a hot plate. The standards used for calibration were cholesterol oleate, lanosterol, lathosterol, cholesterol, desmosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol at 1 mg/ml in n-hexane or ethanol. Retention factors (RF) were determined for each spot on the TLC as the ratio between the distance of migration of the eluate from the deposit and the distance of the solvent from the deposit. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—Samples were first passed through a Sep-Pack cartridge (Vac C18 1 cc, Waters) equilibrated with methanol. Reverse phase HPLC was carried out with a PerkinElmer system (series 200 DAD) coupled to a diode array detector. This system enable us obtain an in-line UV spectrum of the chromatographic peaks. The column, Lichrosorb C18 5 μm (25 cm × 4 mm), fitted with a Lichrosorb C18 5 μm (0.5 cm × 4 mm) guard cartridge, was developed isocratically, as described by Popjak et al. (31Popjak G. Meenan A. Parish E.J. Nes W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6230-6238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with methanol/water (96:4, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm or at 282 nm, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The relative retention times (RRT) were measured by comparison with the retention time of cholesterol (RRT cholesterol is 1). Quantification of sterols were carried out using a calibration curve established with authentic corresponding sterols except for zymostenol for which the mass was estimated using the calibration curve for cholesterol because both compounds had a similar molar extinction coefficient at 210 nm. Gas Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)—Fractions that were collected from the HPLC column were reduced to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and treated with a mixture (0.1 ml) of N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide/pyridine (50:50, v/v) for 30 min at 60 °C. The reagents were evaporated under nitrogen flux, and the trimethylsilyl ether derivatives (TMS) were dissolved in hexane. GC/MS analyses were carried out using an HP 5935 instrument housing a fused silica column DB5 (25 m × 0.32 mm) coated with a 0.25 μm layer of S.E.-30, DB-1 ending in the ion source. The oven temperature was about 60 °C during the injection, after 3 min was rapidly increased to 200 °C, and was then programmed from 200 to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min and from 250 to 300 °C at a rate of 6 °C/min. Subcloning Human cDNA for D8D7I and DHCR7—Total RNA from Hela or MCF-7 cells was obtained by a rapid thiocyanate procedure (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding for D8D7I and for DHCR7 were obtained by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from total RNA by using the superscript preamplification system (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) with random hexamers for the reverse transcription step. For PCR, oligonucleotides with the EcoR1 restriction site were used, matching the first 15 and last 16 bases, respectively, of the open reading frame of the cDNA encoding the human emopamil-binding protein (D8D7I) (33Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7551-7557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or matching the first 15 and last 16 bases, respectively, of the cDNA encoding the human DHCR7 (34Moebius F.F. Fitzky B.U. Lee J.N. Paik Y.K. Glossmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The amplification products were cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pSG5 vector (35Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) to give pSG5-D8D7I and pSG5-DHCR7. Constructs of HA N-terminal-fused D8D7I and DHCR7 were made as follows: the nucleotide sequence coding for a peptide epitope YPYDVPDYA from hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus was fused to the N terminus of the D8D7I (HA-D8D7I) and DHCR7 (HA-DHCR7), using the polymerase chain reaction. The amplification product was cloned into the EcoR1 restriction site of the pSG5 vector. Plasmids were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination technique (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). Expression of HA-D8D7I and HA-DHCR7 in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A dose response curve was first carried out to estimate the optimum amount of DNA required for the best transfection. Plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells using the polyethylenenimine methodology (37Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5640) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells per dish and transfected under identical conditions with a constant quantity of plasmid (8 μg/dish). In experiments, cells were transfected with 3.75 μg of each plasmid encoding for protein and completed, if necessary, with empty vector (pSG5) to keep the total amount of DNA constant. 3.75 μg of each plasmid/dish gave maximal expression of both proteins as measured by Western blotting of the total protein extract with an anti-HA antibody. For Western blotting, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for HA-DHCR7 or HA-D8D7I. For co-immunoprecipitation, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for HA-DHCR7 and/or D8D7I. For binding experiments, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids coding for DHCR7 and/or D8D7I with or without the HA tag. For all experiments, COS-7 cells were also transfected with 50 ng of pCMV-lacZ to measure the efficiency of transfection and mock-transfected cells were transfected with 8 μg of pSG5 plasmid that lacked a DNA insert. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the luminescence derived from 10 μl of each sample incubated in 200 μl of 1 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and used to correct transfection efficiency among the different treatment groups (luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit, Clontech). Western Blotting—The transfected cell pellet was thawed with 100 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) and was homogenized by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein content was determined by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The proteins were incubated in one volume of 2× Laemmli gel loading buffer and incubated at 60 °C for 20 min, and then 40 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at constant current. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then saturated with saline buffer (10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-HA (16B10 clone) antibody. Membranes were washed three times with saline buffer containing 1% nonfat dried milk and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Visualization was achieved with an ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorescence measured either by autoradiography or using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences). Binding Assay—48 h after transfection, cells were scraped and suspended in 100 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.15–0.3 TIU/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were homogenized by 6 successive freeze/thaw cycles and microsomal fractions prepared as described earlier (20Mésange F. Sebbar M. Kedjouar B. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Bayard F. Delarue F. Faye J.C. Poirot M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were conducted as described previously (6Poirot M. De Medina P. Delarue F. Perie J.J. Klaebe A. Faye J.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 2007-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Microsomes (10 μg) were incubated in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm thioglycerol) with various concentrations of [3H]tamoxifen (specific activity: 84.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) from 0.1 to 25 nm for 18 h at 4 °C. After incubation, bound and free radioligands were separated using Sephadex-LH20 gel filtration (1.5 ml), and the radioactivity of the flow-through was counted in a β counter. Competition assays with tamoxifen, PBPE, CI-628, clomiphene, 4-OH-tamoxifen, ICI 164,384, 7-ketocholestanol, t-BuPE, BD 1008, U-18,666A, cholestanol, cholesterol, lathosterol, zymostenol (5α-cholesta-8-en-3β-ol), desmosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and 17β-estradiol on whole cell lysates of transfected COS-7 cells were performed using eight concentrations of unlabeled test ligand ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 nm with a single concentration of [3H]tamoxifen of 3 nm. Incubation and separation of bound and free radioligand were performed as described above. Binding and competition assays were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm tamoxifen and was always less than 20% of total binding. Binding data were determined using the Graphpad Prism program (version 3). 5α-Cholest-8-en-3β-ol (zymostenol) was purified by HPLC following the procedure described above after MCF-7ws treatment with 1 μm tamoxifen. HPLC peaks with a RRT of 0.93 from five injections were pooled, concentrated, and then submitted to a second HPLC purification under the same conditions. The product was evaporated to dryness and then dissolved in absolute ethanol. The concentration of 5α-cholest-8-en-3β-ol was measured by UV analysis. Binding on the AEBS from MCF-7 was conducted exactly as described previously (6Poirot M. De Medina P. Delarue F. Perie J.J. Klaebe A. Faye J.C. Bioorg. Med.

https://openalex.org/W2054807014,"The heme oxygenase family of enzymes catalyzes the metabolism of heme to biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). At least two isoforms exist, heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) and heme oxygenase-2 (HO2), which are encoded by separate genes. HO2 is selectively enriched in neurons, and substantial evidence suggests that HO2-derived CO functions as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. However, a molecular mechanism for the rapid activation of HO2 during neuronal activity has not been described. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified calmodulin as a potential regulator of HO2 activity. Calmodulin binds with nanomolar affinity to HO2 in a calcium-dependent manner via a canonical 1–10 motif, resulting in a 3-fold increase in catalytic activity. Mutations within this motif block calmodulin binding and calcium-dependent stimulation of enzyme activity in vitro and in intact cells. The calcium mobilizing agents ionomycin and glutamate stimulate endogenous HO2 activity in primary cortical cultures, establishing in vivo relevance. Calcium-calmodulin provides a mechanism for rapid and transient activation of HO2 during neuronal activity.

Calcium-calmodulin provides a mechanism for rapid and transient activation of HO2 during neuronal activity. Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are increasingly appreciated as neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system (1Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 105-131Google Scholar). Most neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles with only a small percentage released following each neuronal depolarization and large storage pools remaining for succeeding neural volleys. Neither NO nor CO is stored in vesicles so that their release following neuronal depolarization is presumably coupled to activation of their respective biosynthetic enzymes, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; iNOS, inducible NOS; eNOS, endothelial NOS; CK2, casein kinase-2; CzCl, calmidazolium chloride; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HO2, heme oxygenase-2; HO1, heme oxygenase-1; aa, amino acid(s). 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; iNOS, inducible NOS; eNOS, endothelial NOS; CK2, casein kinase-2; CzCl, calmidazolium chloride; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HO2, heme oxygenase-2; HO1, heme oxygenase-1; aa, amino acid(s). and heme oxygenase-2 (HO2). For NO, calcium influx into depolarized neurons binds to calmodulin, activating nNOS (2Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Google Scholar). No mechanism for rapid activation of HO2 has yet been reported. Recently we showed that CK2 (casein kinase-2) phosphorylates and activates HO2 (3Boehning D. Moon C. Sharma S. Hurt K.J. Hester L.D. Ronnett G.V. Shugar D. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 129-137Google Scholar). In brain cultures, protein kinase C phosphorylates and activates CK2. Since protein kinase C can be activated by calcium, neuronal depolarization and associated calcium entry might activate protein kinase C to phosphorylate and activate CK2, which in turn phosphorylates and activates HO2 (3Boehning D. Moon C. Sharma S. Hurt K.J. Hester L.D. Ronnett G.V. Shugar D. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 129-137Google Scholar). However, it is not likely that this mechanism would be rapid enough to provide CO for most instances of neurotransmission. In the present study we report the binding of calmodulin to HO2 in a calcium-dependent fashion. In response to calcium mobilization by ionomycin and the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in neurons, we observe physiologic activation of HO2 and formation of the heme metabolite, bilirubin. Thus, as with NO, CO formation in neurotransmission reflects calcium-calmodulin activation of the biosynthetic enzyme. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Amino acids 1–292 of rat HO2 were cloned by PCR into the EcoR1/PstI sites of pGBKT7 to express HO2 as a fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by Western blotting, and a rat brain cDNA library fused to the activating domain was transformed into PJ69-4A yeast. Yeast transformants were grown on –Leu/-Trp/–Ade/–His plates. All colonies were re-streaked onto the same medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal), and colonies that turned blue were sequenced. Expression Constructs—Rat HO2 amino acids 1–292 was cloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression vector pGEX 4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) by PCR. Forward primer rHO2F was 5′-TTGAATTCATGTCTTCAGAGGTGGAG, and reverse primer was 5′-TTTTGCGGCCGCCTTCCTCAGCACAGCCAT. Rat HO2 amino acids 1–90 and 1–55 were cloned using rHO2F forward primer and reverse primers rHO90R (5-TTTTGCGGCCGCGTGGTCCTTGTTGCGATC) and rHO55R (5-AAGCGGCCGCTCATTTGACAAACTGGGTATT), respectively. Site-directed mutations F56A, F56E, L57A, L57Q, F66A, and F66E in rat HO2 were introduced using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences of the mutagenic primers are available as supplementary Table I. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Rat HO2 in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) has been described previously (3Boehning D. Moon C. Sharma S. Hurt K.J. Hester L.D. Ronnett G.V. Shugar D. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 129-137Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assays—Binding of GST fusion proteins to calmodulin was assayed by rotating 20 μg of fusion protein with 20 μl of calmodulin-agarose (1.8 mg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA ± 5 mm CaCl2). The agarose beads were washed three times with 500 μl of buffer A ± CaCl2. The washed beads were quenched directly with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was used to determine HO2 binding using either an anti-GST antibody (Sigma) or in some cases an anti-HO2 antibody (4Baranano D.E. Wolosker H. Bae B.I. Barrow R.K. Snyder S.H. Ferris C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15166-15173Google Scholar). Analysis of the site-directed mutants was performed by incubating 2 μg of GST fusion protein with 10 μg of purified calmodulin (Sigma) in 500 μl of buffer A ± calcium. Interacting complexes were immobilized on GST-agarose, washed, and analyzed by Western blotting. Input of HO2 protein was analyzed by Ponceau S staining, and pull-down of calmodulin was visualized with anti-calmodulin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). Co-immunoprecipitation—Rat cortex was cut sagitally into left and right hemispheres; one hemisphere was homogenized in buffer A with calcium, and the other without calcium in buffer A. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and 100 μg of the supernatant was precleared of rat immunoglobulin with pansorbin (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HO2 antibody overnight in the presence or absence of calcium. Where indicated, the peptide calmodulin antagonist at 10 μm (comprising amino acids 290–309 of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) was included in the immunoprecipitation. Immunocomplexes were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-HO2 and anti-calmodulin. Enzyme Assays—Heme oxygenase activity was measured essentially as described previously (3Boehning D. Moon C. Sharma S. Hurt K.J. Hester L.D. Ronnett G.V. Shugar D. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 129-137Google Scholar) with a modified assay buffer consisting of 150 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES 7.5, 500 μm BAPTA, and 100 μm deferoxamine. Free calcium concentrations were calibrated using a calcium-selective mini-electrode and confirmed using fluorescent dyes. Recombinant cytochrome P450 reductase (Sigma), 1 mm reduced β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′-phosphate, and 15 μm [55Fe]hemin (RI Consultants LLC, Hudson, NH) were added just prior to the start of each assay. GST-HO2 was added at a concentration determined for each preparation to be within the linear range of the assay. In some experiments, GST-HO2 was phosphorylated for 1 h at 30 °C with recombinant CK2 as described elsewhere (3Boehning D. Moon C. Sharma S. Hurt K.J. Hester L.D. Ronnett G.V. Shugar D. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 129-137Google Scholar). Bilirubin Measurement—Approximately 107 cells were assayed for bilirubin formation in triplicate per experiment, with each experiment repeated three times. Where indicated, cells were preincubated with 20 μm calmidazolium chloride (CzCl; Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) prior to agonist addition. Agonists were applied for 10 min, after which an equal volume of ethyl acetate was added and the cells were vortexed vigorously for 5 min to extract cellular bilirubin. Control plates without agonist treatment were quenched at time zero (just before agonist addition) and after the 10 min time course. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature, and the organic phase was removed into a fresh tube and evaporated under a nitrogen gas stream. The residue was resuspended in 50 mm NaOH, and the absorbance was measured at 440 nm. Bilirubin standards (0.05, 0.5, 5.0, and 25 nmol) were freshly prepared in 50 mm NaOH and processed in the same manner as the biological samples to generate a standard curve for quantitation of bilirubin formation. A small aliquot of cells was saved from each condition for protein measurement and Western blotting. Bilirubin formation in HEK 293 cells was nominal unless HO2 was transfected, demonstrating the validity of this assay for measuring HO2 activity. All manipulations were performed in dim light. Data Analysis—Nonlinear curve fitting to the 4-parameter logistic equation y = min + (max – min)/(1 + (x/EC50)Hillslope) was used to determine EC50 values using SigmaPlot software (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was evaluated using unpaired two-tailed t tests on data points from at least three separate experiments. Data comparisons were deemed significant if p was <0.02. In yeast two-hybrid analysis utilizing HO2 without the C-terminal transmembrane domain as bait, we identify calmodulin as a binding partner (Fig. 1). Analysis of the primary sequence of HO2 using an algorithm to detect calmodulin binding sites (5Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Google Scholar) indicated that the region encompassing amino acids 56–76 on the N-terminal region of the protein was likely to bind calmodulin (Fig. 1A). Manual inspection of this sequence revealed three separate 1–10 consensus calmodulin binding motifs encompassing amino acids (aa) 56–65, 57–66, and 66–75. The 1–10 motif is characterized by bulky aromatic/hydrophobic residues at the 1st and 10th position on an α-helix (6Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) is a closely related inducible enzyme for which the crystal structure has been elucidated (7Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Google Scholar). Sequence alignment and mapping of the HO2 sequence onto the HO1 structure reveals that only the 1–10 motif encompassing amino acids 66–75 resides on an α-helix (Fig. 1A; supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, we predict that 1–10 (aa 66–75) is the primary binding site. To test this hypothesis, we examined the binding of HO2 expressed as a GST fusion protein to calmodulin immobilized on agarose beads (Fig. 1B). The full-length protein lacking the transmembrane domain, HO2 (aa 1–292), binds robustly in a calcium-dependent fashion to calmodulin, as does HO2 (aa 1–90). By contrast, HO2 (aa 1–55), the N-terminal portion of the enzyme lacking the predicted calmodulin binding consensus sequence, fails to bind calmodulin-agarose. To elucidate which consensus 1–10 motif is responsible for binding of HO2 to calmodulin, we performed site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1C). Mutation of phenylalanine 56 to alanine or glutamic acid fails to alter calcium-dependent binding of HO2 to calmodulin, suggesting that 1–10 (aa 56–65) is not responsible for calmodulin binding. Similarly, mutation of leucine 65 to alanine does not alter binding (data not shown). Surprisingly, conversion of leucine 57 to alanine results in constitutive high-affinity binding. Mutation of this residue to glutamine, the corresponding residue in HO1, does not affect binding to calmodulin. In contrast, mutation of phenylalanine 66 to either alanine or glutamic acid virtually abolishes binding. Combined with the lack of effect of mutation L57Q and the presence of the 1–10 (aa 66–75) motif on an α-helix (supplementary Fig. 1), these data strongly suggest that calmodulin binds to 1–10 (aa 66–75). One parallel between NOS and HO is the existence of discrete constitutive and inducible forms of the enzymes. Inducible NOS (iNOS) is not normally activated by stimuli that increase intracellular calcium, but instead new iNOS protein synthesis occurs following stimuli such as endotoxin exposure (8Lowenstein C.J. Glatt C.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6711-6715Google Scholar, 9Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Google Scholar, 10Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A. Troso T. Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Google Scholar). iNOS binds calmodulin at low physiologic calcium levels so that stimuli that increase intracellular calcium do not alter enzyme activity (11Stevens-Truss R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15638-15645Google Scholar). The inducible HO isoform, HO1, has 50% homology in the sequence encompassing the 1–10 motif of HO2 but lacks one of the key amino acids of the motif, phenylalanine 75 (Fig. 1A). As predicted by the absence of this amino acid, we detect negligible binding of HO1 to calmodulin in the presence or absence of calcium (Fig. 1D). To ascertain whether endogenous HO2 and calmodulin interact in mammalian tissues, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain extracts (Fig. 1E). We observed robust, calcium-dependent co-immunoprecipitation of calmodulin with HO2, which is reversed by calmodulin antagonist (Fig. 1E). We demonstrate a direct requirement of calcium-calmodulin for HO2 catalytic activity (Fig. 2). Calcium stimulates HO2 in the presence of 100 nm calmodulin with an EC50 of ∼300 nm (Fig. 2A). This concentration is consistent with physiologic levels that would occur during neuronal depolarization. Calmodulin potently stimulates enzyme activity with an EC50 of 2 nm, similar to the potency of calmodulin in activating nNOS (2Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Mutation of Phe-66, a key amino acid in the 1–10 motif for calmodulin binding (Fig. 1C), abolishes activation of the enzyme. The importance of calmodulin is further substantiated by inhibition of HO2 activity with the calmodulin antagonist CzCl with an IC50 of 8 μm, similar to its potency in blocking other calmodulin-dependent processes (12Asano M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 764-773Google Scholar, 13Sampaio-Maia B. Soares-Da-Silva P. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 245-252Google Scholar, 14Agullo L. Garcia A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 323: 119-125Google Scholar). Another calmodulin antagonist, W7, also inhibits the calcium-calmodulin dependent activation of HO2 (data not shown). We wondered whether the phosphorylation of HO2 by CK2 synergizes with or antagonizes calmodulin activation, and thus we examined the influence of calcium-calmodulin on the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated enzyme (Fig. 2D). The effect of CK2 pre-phosphorylation on calmodulin activation was examined at 10 nm and 10 μm calcium. As reported previously (3Boehning D. Moon C. Sharma S. Hurt K.J. Hester L.D. Ronnett G.V. Shugar D. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 129-137Google Scholar), phosphorylation by CK2 triples enzyme activity at low calcium levels. No further stimulation occurs in the presence of calmodulin with either 10 nm or 10 μm calcium. To evaluate the role of calcium-calmodulin in regulating HO2 activity in intact cells, we employed HEK 293 cells transfected with HO2 and primary cortical neuronal cultures (Fig. 3). In transfected HEK 293 cells, the calcium ionophore ionomycin markedly activates the recombinant enzyme as evidenced by the increased production of the HO2 metabolite bilirubin, with stimulation prevented by the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium (Fig. 3A). Mock transfected cells are not responsive to ionomycin because of low endogenous levels of HO2 (Fig. 3A, inset). HO2 with Phe-66 mutated to glutamate is not activated by ionomycin. In cortical cultures ionomycin increases bilirubin formation 4.5-fold with stimulation blocked by CzCl (Fig. 3B). The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate also stimulates bilirubin formation, with stimulation blocked by CzCl. Serotonin (10 μm) fails to stimulate bilirubin formation in cortical cultures. Levels of bilirubin in serotonin-treated cultures, the same as in basal cultures, are decreased by CzCl, indicating that calcium-calmodulin activation of HO2 determines basal levels of bilirubin. Our findings indicate a rapid activation of HO2 in intact cells by calcium-calmodulin. How does this mechanism interface with HO2 activation by CK2? We did not observe any influence of calcium-calmodulin upon CK2 activation of the enzyme. CK2 phosphorylates HO2 at Ser-78 (rat sequence), only three amino acids away from the calmodulin binding site on the same α-helix (supplementary Fig. 1). We hypothesize that conformational changes induced by calmodulin binding and by phosphorylation of Ser-78 are similar and thus are not additive. Acute exposure of cortical neurons to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate increased HO2 activity in a calcium-calmodulin-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Other groups have shown that stimulation of metabotropic (15Lin C.H. Lo W.C. Hsiao M. Tung C.S. Tseng C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 308: 1213-1218Google Scholar, 16Lo W.C. Chan J.Y. Tung C.S. Tseng C.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 454: 39-45Google Scholar) and ionotropic (17Leffler C.W. Balabanova L. Fedinec A.L. Waters C.M. Parfenova H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H74-H80Google Scholar, 18Parfenova H. Fedinec A. Leffler C.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2003; 23: 190-197Google Scholar, 19Fiumana E. Parfenova H. Jaggar J.H. Leffler C.W. Am.

Pharmacol. 2002; 450: 43-48Google Scholar) glutamate receptors leads to increased CO production. Leffler et al. (17Leffler C.W. Balabanova L. Fedinec A.L. Waters C.M. Parfenova H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H74-H80Google Scholar) found in cerebral microvessels that tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocks CO production in response to glutamate, whereas manipulations of intracellular calcium have no effect. Notably, ionomycin treatment in calcium-replete medium has no effect on CO production in the microvessels, and depletion of internal calcium stores in calcium-free medium does not affect CO production in response to glutamate. In that study (17Leffler C.W. Balabanova L. Fedinec A.L. Waters C.M. Parfenova H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H74-H80Google Scholar), the microvessels were exposed to 1 μm ionomycin and/or 100 μm glutamate for a minimum of 30 min whereas CO was allowed to accumulate within the headspace. These manipulations would be expected to cause secondary effects on cellular physiology, including induction of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and apoptosis. Therefore it is unclear whether the actions of glutamate in cerebral microvessels are truly calcium-independent. This discrepancy can also be explained by glutamate activating a separate, calcium-independent pathway in endothelial cells, requiring the activation of tyrosine kinases. Activating HO2 by calcium-calmodulin in stimulated neurons presumably occurs on a millisecond time scale and thus is consistent with requirements for synaptic transmission. Other physiologic processes regulated by CO are more long term. For instance, CO regulates the long term adaptation to odorant stimulation in olfactory neurons (22Zufall F. Leinders-Zufall T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2703-2712Google Scholar, 23Leinders-Zufall T. Shepherd G.M. Zufall F. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1498-1508Google Scholar) and mediates slow relaxation of the internal anal sphincter (3Boehning D. Moon C. Sharma S. Hurt K.J. Hester L.D. Ronnett G.V. Shugar D. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 129-137Google Scholar, 24Watkins C.C. Boehning D. Kaplin A.I. Rao M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2631-2635Google Scholar). Conceivably CK2 phosphorylation mediates these longer term activations of HO2. Analogous differential roles for calcium-calmodulin-dependent and phosphorylation-dependent stimulations occur for endothelial NOS (eNOS). Thus, acetylcholine, by releasing intracellular calcium, rapidly activates eNOS to initiate blood vessel relaxation, whereas long term relaxation mediated by shear stress and vascular endothelial growth factor maintain vasodilation by activating Akt kinase to phosphorylate eNOS, increasing enzyme activity in a calcium-independent fashion (25Fulton D.

To identify the protein factor, we used ProteinChip Array technology. Protein fractions obtained from the conditioned medium released by PMNs were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis with immobilized pH gradient strips. Most of the protein spots, with molecular masses of 17 kDa, were sequentially subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. The 17-kDa peptide band was identified as interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Biological activities of IL-1β were further determined; IL-1β altered the shape of CECs from polygonal to fibroblastic morphologies in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas neutralizing IL-1β antibody, neutralizing antibody to FGF-2, and LY294002 blocked the action of IL-1β. IL-1β greatly increased the levels of FGF-2 mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner; IL-1β stimulated expression of all isoforms of FGF-2. IL-1β initially induced nuclear accumulation of FGF-2 and facilitated translocation of FGF-2 to plasma membrane and extracellular matrix. IL-1β activated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, the enzyme activity of which was greatly stimulated after a 5-min exposure to IL-1β. This early and rapid activation of PI 3-kinase greatly enhanced FGF-2 production in CECs; pretreatment with LY294002 hampered the induction activity of IL-1β. These observations suggest that IL-1β takes part in endothelial to mesenchymal transformation of CECs through its inductive potential on FGF-2 via the action of PI 3-kinase.

Corneal fibrosis represents a significant pathophysiological problem that causes blindness by physically blocking light transmittance. One clinical example of corneal fibrosis observed in corneal endothelium is the development of a retrocorneal fibrous membrane (RCFM) 1The abbreviations used are: RCFM, retrocorneal fibrous membrane; CECs, corneal endothelial cells; ECM, extracellular matrix; PMNs, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; CEMF, corneal endothelium modulation factor; IL, interleukin; SELDI-TOF MS, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; EMT, endothelial mesenchymal transformation; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IEF, isoelectric focusing. in Descemet's membrane (1Brown S.

In RCFMs, corneal endothelial cells (CECs) are converted to fibroblast-like cells; the contact-inhibited monolayers of CECs are lost, resulting in the development of multilayers of fibroblast-like cells (3Kay E.P. Cheung C.C. Jester J.V. Nimni M.E. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1982; 22: 200-212Google Scholar, 4Leung E.W. Rife L. Smith R.E. Kay E.P. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6: 15-23Google Scholar). These morphologically altered cells simultaneously resume their proliferation ability and deposit a fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) in the basement membrane environment. An in vitro model to elucidate the molecular mechanism of RCFM formation led us to the finding that activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were able to transform the type IV collagen-synthesizing polygonal endothelial cells to type I collagen-synthesizing fibroblastic cells (5Kay E.P. Smith R.E. Nimni M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7116-7121Google Scholar, 6Kay E.P. Nimni M.E. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 502-512Google Scholar, 7Kay E.P. Smith R.E. Nimni M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5139-5146Google Scholar). We also reported that the partially purified protein fractions obtained from the conditioned media of the activated PMNs demonstrated the same modulation activities as the PMNs themselves did (8Kay E.P. Gu X. Ninomiya Y. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 663-672Google Scholar, 9Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435Google Scholar). Thus, the partially purified protein fraction was designated corneal endothelium modulation factor (CEMF). Among a number of proteins in the CEMF fraction, we showed that a 17-kDa protein band caused the cell shape change of CECs (9Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435Google Scholar). In the present study we identified the 17-kDa protein obtained from inflammatory cells (PMNs) as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) using ProteinChip Array technology, also known as surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). We further attempted to determine the potential novel function of IL-1β in CECs. IL-1β is a major proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (10Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1991; 77: 1627-1652Google Scholar, 11Dinarello C.A.

Numerous studies report that both IL-1α and IL-1β orchestrate the inflammatory process by inducing the production and release of secondary cytokines; IL-1β stimulates the expression of a variety of genes necessary for the wound repair processes (19Schmidt J.A.

Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 173: 46-62Google Scholar). Among them, both IL-1α and IL-1β markedly stimulate synthesis and release of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (23Cronauer M.V. Stadlmann S. Klocker H. Abendstein B. Eder I.E. Rogatsch H. Zeimet A.G. Marth C. Offner F.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1977-1984Google Scholar), osteoblasts (24Sobue T. Zhang X. Florkiewicz R.Z. Hurley M.M. J. Biol.

We also reported that CECs treated with CEMF produced high levels of high molecular weight and ECM isoforms of FGF-2 (26Gu X. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2252-2258Google Scholar). FGF-2, a ubiquitous, multifunctional growth factor, is present in Descemet's membrane (8Kay E.P. Gu X. Ninomiya Y. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Metab. 1992; 75: 1436-1441Google Scholar, 29Sherman L. Stocker K.M. Morrison R. Ciment G. Development. 1993; 118: 1313-1326Google Scholar, 30Slack J.M.W. Darlington B.G. Heath J.K. Godsave S.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 197-200Google Scholar). Among the five isoforms of FGF-2, the 18-kDa ECM isoform employs cell surface FGF receptors to relay signals that mediate a variety of cellular activities (31Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Google Scholar, 32Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Google Scholar), whereas the high molecular weight isoforms of FGF-2 exert intracrine activity, the mechanism of which is yet to be defined (33Delrieu I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 6-10Google Scholar). In our previous studies (8Kay E.P. Gu X. Ninomiya Y. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 663-672Google Scholar, 9Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435Google Scholar, 26Gu X. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2252-2258Google Scholar) we reported that FGF-2 is the direct mediator for endothelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) observed in CECs. Among the phenotypes altered during EMT, we reported that FGF-2 directly regulates the cell cycle progression through the action of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, thus leading to a marked stimulation of cell proliferation (34Gu X. Seong G.J. Lee Y.G. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2326-2334Google Scholar, 35Lee H.T. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1521-1528Google Scholar). We also reported that FGF-2 induces a change in cell shape from a polygonal to a fibroblastic morphology and that it induces a reorganization of actin cytoskeleton via PI 3-kinase (36Kay E.P. Park S.Y. Ko M.K. Lee S.C. Mol. Vis. 1998; (www.moluis.org/moluis/v4/p22)Google Scholar, 37Lee H.T. Kay E.P. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 624-634Google Scholar). Similarly, PI 3-kinase is known to directly regulate cell cycle progression and morphogenetic pathways in other cell systems (38Collado M. Medema R.H. Garcia-Cao I. Dubuisson M.L.N. Barradas M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 249-261Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI 3-kinase is activated by proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor or IL-1 (43Lee S.E. Chung W.J. Kwak H.B. Chung C.-H.

We attempted to link inflammatory responses to the different set of cellular responses triggered by growth factors. To test this hypothesis, we tested whether FGF-2 was inducible by IL-1β. In the present study we demonstrated that IL-1β released by PMNs initiates EMT because it induces FGF-2, which is a direct mediator for EMT. We also showed that activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway is required to mediate the biological activities of IL-1β. Thus, this study indicates the sequential activation of CECs by IL-1β and FGF-2 in the context of inflammatory responses and non-physiological wound healing. Materials—FGF-2 was from Intergen (Purchase, NY); IL-1β, PD98059, cycloheximide, LY294002, anti-β-actin, and anti-IL-1β antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. All SELDI-TOF MS materials were from Ciphergen (Fremont, CA). Radiochemicals were from ICN (Irvine, CA). The anti-p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase antibody was from BD Biosciences, and monoclonal anti-FGF-2 antibody was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Rhodamine-phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mounting solution and biotinylated secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Cell Culture—Rabbit eyes were purchased from Pel Freeze (Rogers, AR). Isolation and establishment of rabbit CECs were performed as previously described (5Kay E.P. Smith R.E. Nimni M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7116-7121Google Scholar). Briefly, the Descemet's membrane-corneal endothelium complex was treated with 0.2% collagenase and 0.05% hyaluronidase (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) for 90 min at 37 °C. Primary cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in a 5% CO2 incubator. First passage CECs that were maintained in DMEM containing 15% fetal calf serum (DMEM-15) were used for all experiments. For subculture, confluent cultures were treated with 0.05% trypsin and 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. In some experiments the Descemet's membrane-corneal endothelium complex was peeled and incubated with one of the following conditions in growth medium (DMEM-15): IL-1β, IL-1β with anti-IL-1β antibody, or IL-1β with LY294002. After 4 days of incubation, the Descemet's membrane-corneal endothelium complex was plated on slide glass and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The tissue was then stained for filamentous (F)-actin with rhodamine-phalloidin (1:100 dilution) at 37 °C for 10 min. Preparation of Partially Purified CEMF—All animal care procedures were in accordance with the research guidelines set forth by the University of Southern California on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were obtained from rabbits and isolated as described previously (9Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435Google Scholar). All the methods and procedures have been presented previously (9Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435Google Scholar). Protein Preparation, Protein Assay, SDS-PAGE, RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and PCR Amplification, Western Blotting Analysis, Immunofluorescent Analysis, Confocal Microscopy, and Measurement of PI 3-Kinase Enzyme Activity—All detail methods and procedures have been presented previously (35Lee H.T. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1521-1528Google Scholar, 47Ko M.K. Kay E.P. Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 1-9Google Scholar, 48Lee H.T. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 3816-3825Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Our preliminary studies revealed that the optimum sample size was 500 μg of protein for the 11-cm Immobiline™ DryStrip Gel strips (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on 11-cm, pH 5.5–6.7 Immobiline™ DryStrip Gel strips using a Protean isoelectric focusing cell apparatus (Bio-Rad) for 35 kV-h at 20 °C. Strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6.0 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% dithiothreitol, then for 10 min in the same buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide. Equilibrated immobilized pH gradient strips were loaded onto 4–15% precast SDS gel and overlaid with ReadyPrep-agarose in 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6.0 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) glycerol containing bromphenol blue. Gels were electrophoresed at 50 mA/gel at room temperature. The two-dimensional gels were stained with Bio-Safe™ Coomassie G250. In-gel Tryptic Digestion—Protein spots of 17-kDa range were manually excised from the gel. Spots were destained and dehydrated with 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile (v/v) and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Sequencing grade trypsin (12.5 ng/μl; Promega, Madison, WI) in digestion buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3, (pH 7.8) containing 5 mm CaCl2) was added to the dried gel and incubated on ice for 1 h for reswelling. After the supernatant was removed, 30 μl of digestion buffer was added, and digestion was continued at 37 °C overnight. The tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel with 20 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) and twice with 5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile. The pooled supernatants were dried by vacuum centrifugation. The peptides were reconstituted with a solution containing acetonitrile/water (5/95, v/v) and trifluoroacetic acid. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The enzymatically digested protein samples were analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS (49Merchant M. Weinberger S.R. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1164-1167Google Scholar, 50Caputo E. Moharram R. Martin B.M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 321: 116-124Google Scholar, 51Leak L.V. Liotta L.A. Krutzsch H. Jones M. Fusaroa V.A. Ross S.J. Zhao Y. Petricoin III, E.F. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 753-765Google Scholar) in a Ciphergen Protein Biology System II using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. Before SELDI-TOF MS analysis, H4 (C18 hydrophobic surface) ProteinChip surface was pre-equilibrated with 50% acetonitrile for 2 min at room temperature. One μl of the peptide samples was spotted on a H4 ProteinChip Array surface and allowed to dry. Because the digestion was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-type conditions, the normal washing steps for SELDI-TOF MS were omitted. 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix saturated in 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to the H4 ProteinChip Array surface. Row data were analyzed using the computer software provided by the manufacturer. Protein identification based on peptide mass fingerprint was performed with Mascot Search-Fit (Swiss-Prot) software (www.matrixscience.com). Real-time PCR—Primers were designed by using Primer Express software v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to detect the transcriptional level of the FGF-2 (sense, 5′-AGGAGAGCGACCCACACATCAA-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCCAGCAGTCTTCCATCTTCC-3′) that generates a 119-bp product. A housekeeping gene, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, was used for the control reaction (sense, 5′-CGGCTTGCTCGAAATGTGAT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCAAGGGGGGCTATAAGTTCTTT-3′). Real-time PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions on a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics) with FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics). A 2-μg aliquot of 1:10-diluted cDNA sample (2 μl of H2O was used as a negative control for each run) was added to 18 μl of SYBR Green I master mix containing each primer at a concentration of 100 pm and 3 mm MgCl2. The thermal cycle conditions were 10 min at 95 °C for preincubation followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C, 5 s at 58 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C. For analysis, the CT value was defined as the number of PCR cycles required for the fluorescence signal to exceed the detection threshold value. The relative levels of FGF-2 transcript were normalized by subtracting the CT values of phosphoribosyltransferase. The CT value of IL-1β-treated samples (CTn) was then compared with that of the untreated samples (CT1). The relative fold difference was calculated with the formula: relative fold difference = 2(CT1 – CTn) = 2(ΔCT). Each assay was performed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Values with p < 0.01 were considered as significantly different. Identification of CEMF—We had reported that CEMF induced de novo synthesis of all isoforms of FGF-2 (8Kay E.P. Gu X. Ninomiya Y. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 663-672Google Scholar, 26Gu X. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2252-2258Google Scholar). We further reported that the 17-kDa peptide band among CEMF fractions was able to change the shape of CECs from a polygonal to a fibroblastic morphology (9Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435Google Scholar). To identify the 17-kDa protein we used proteomic technology; that is, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel trypsin digestion of protein spots and SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry (49Merchant M. Weinberger S.R. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1164-1167Google Scholar, 50Caputo E. Moharram R. Martin B.M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 321: 116-124Google Scholar, 51Leak L.V. Liotta L.A. Krutzsch H. Jones M. Fusaroa V.A. Ross S.J. Zhao Y. Petricoin III, E.F. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 753-765Google Scholar). The 17-kDa peptide-containing protein sample obtained from the conditioned medium of PMNs (Fig. 1A) was separated first by isoelectric focusing on immobilized pH gradient Immobiline™ DryStrip Gel strips followed by reduction and alkylation before the second-dimension separation on SDS-PAGE in an orthogonal direction (Fig. 1B). Individual protein spots with molecular masses of 17-kDa removed from the gel matrix were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and peptide mass mapping was carried out by SELDI-TOF. The MS analysis of one peptide with the mass/charge (m/z) value of 2075 (Fig. 1C) was unambiguously identified by Mascot search as a peptide from IL-1β (Fig. 1D; the underlined sequences, shown in italics). The 17-kDa protein of the CEMF fraction was further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using anti-IL-1β antibody (Fig. 1E). The fact that IL-1β is a key factor in the CEMF was further confirmed with neutralizing IL-1β antibody (Fig. 1F); a fraction of cells treated with CEMF became elongated, whereas neutralizing IL-1β antibody was able to block the action of CEMF. One major activity that CEMF demonstrated was modulation of cell morphology from a polygonal to an elongated fibroblastic shape (6Kay E.P. Nimni M.E. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 502-512Google Scholar, 8Kay E.P. Gu X. Ninomiya Y. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 663-672Google Scholar, 9Kay E.P. Gu X. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2427-2435Google Scholar). Cellular activity of IL-1β in CECs was, therefore, determined using its effect on cell shape change. When cells were treated with IL-1β at 5 ng/ml for a designated time ranging from 30 min to 72 h, it appeared that the cytokine required a prolonged time to modulate cell shape; cells treated for 24 h began to acquire an elongated cell shape in some foci, whereas the majority of cells maintained a polygonal cell morphology, suggesting a mix of populations both responding to IL-1β and non-responding. When cells were treated for 48 h or longer, the fibroblastic cells outgrew the non-responding cells (Fig. 2A). These findings are exactly the same as the observations we had made with the activated PMNs in CEC cultures (6Kay E.P. Nimni M.E. Smith R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 502-512Google Scholar). The optimal concentration of IL-1β for causing cell shape change after 24 h of exposure to the cytokine was found to be 5 ng/ml, whereas neutralizing antibody to IL-1β blocks the modulating activity of the cytokine on cell shape (Fig. 2C). Up-regulation of FGF-2 Expression by IL-1β—To explore whether IL-1β induced FGF-2 synthesis in CECs, we used real-time PCR to measure the steady-state levels of FGF-2 mRNA in cells stimulated with IL-1β. The steady-state level of the FGF-2 transcript increased in a dose-dependent manner; in response to IL-1β stimulation (5 ng/ml), the steady-state level of FGF-2 mRNA was increased more than 2-fold compared with the levels in the untreated cells (Fig. 3A). We also determined FGF-2 mRNA levels in CECs treated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 1–72 h (Fig. 3B). The relative amount of FGF-2 transcript was increased in a time-dependent manner; IL-1β gradually induced FGF-2 transcription for up to 24 h, and the inductive potential of IL-1β reached a maximum at the 48-h treatment. To determine whether expression of FGF-2 was also increased at the protein level, cells treated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 30 min to 72 h were analyzed by immunoblotting analysis using anti-FGF-2 antibody (Fig. 4A). In the absence of IL-1β stimulation, CECs showed a very low level of FGF-2 (both 18-kDa and high molecular mass isoforms). Expression of FGF-2 isoforms was increased in cells treated for 8 h, after which the levels of FGF-2 were greatly increased in a time-dependent manner (12–16-fold during the 24–72-h stimulation). We further investigated whether IL-1β had an effect on protein stability; cells were treated with cycloheximide in the absence or presence of IL-1β to block protein synthesis. Cells treated with cycloheximide alone showed a half-life of FGF-2 of ∼4 h, and IL-1β did not change the stability of FGF-2 (Fig. 4B). Our previous study demonstrated that CEMF not only maintains the persistent localization of FGF-2 in the nuclei but promotes the distribution of FGF-2 in the ECM (26Gu X. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2252-2258Google Scholar). To examine whether IL-1β also regulates subcellular localization of FGF-2, cells stimulated with IL-1β were stained with anti-18-kDa FGF-2 antibody. Cells maintained in DMEM-15 showed a relatively moderate nuclear staining of FGF-2 (Fig. 5A, control). Progressively differential subcellular localization of FGF-2 was observed as the exposure time to IL-1β was extended; cells treated with IL-1β for up to 8 h demonstrated a moderate nuclear staining of FGF-2, whereas a strong nuclear staining and relatively appreciable cytoplasmic staining of FGF-2 were observed in the cells treated for 24 h. A prominent membrane staining in addition to the strong nuclear staining of FGF-2 was observed in the cells treated for 36 h, whereas cells treated for 48 h demonstrated multilocations of FGF-2, including nuclei, cytoplasm, membrane, and ECM. When cells were simultaneously treated with IL-1β and LY294002, PD98059, or neutralizing antibody to IL-1β, both LY294002 and the neutralizing antibody to IL-1β were able to block accumulation of FGF-2 in locations other than the nuclei, whereas PD98059 (an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway) did not alter the IL-1β-induced multiple subcellular localization of FGF-2 (Fig. 5B). IL-1β Induces FGF-2 Expression through PI 3-Kinase Pathways in CECs—CECs predominantly employed PI 3-kinase pathways for the mitogenic and morphogenetic pathways stimulated by FGF-2 (34Gu X. Seong G.J. Lee Y.G. Kay E.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2326-2334Google Scholar, 36Kay E.P. Park S.Y. Ko M.K. Lee S.C. Mol. Vis. 1998; (www.moluis.org/moluis/v4/p22)Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fig. 5B suggests that IL-1β may utilize PI 3-kinase pathways for its activity on FGF-2 expression. Therefore, we determined whether IL-1β was also able to activate PI 3-kinase activity. Cells were briefly stimulated with the cytokine (1–60 min) to determine the kinetics of PI 3-kinase activation; PI 3-kinase activity was determined by measuring the phospholipid product, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, from the immune complex precipitated with anti-PI 3-kinase (p85 subunit) antibody. A strong activation of the enzyme was observed in cells treated with IL-1β for 5 min (6.7-fold) or 10 min (8.3-fold), after which the activation of PI 3-kinase was markedly decreased (Fig. 6A). When cells were pretreated with LY294002 for 40 min followed by stimulation with IL-1β for 10 min, activation of PI 3-kinase was greatly decreased (Fig. 6B). To determine whether such a rapid and early activation of PI 3-kinase by IL-1β was sufficient to mediate stimulation of FGF-2 synthesis, cells were treated with the cytokine for 10 min, then maintained in growth medium without IL-1β for 1–24 h. There was a marked increase of FGF-2 production at the protein level for up to 24 h; even within the first hour after a brief stimulation with the cytokine, FGF-2 synthesis was increased by 3-fold, and 8 h after the stimulation with IL-1β, a 7-fold increase of FGF-2 production was obser"
https://openalex.org/W1984920494,"Members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of receptors induce apoptosis by recruiting adaptor molecules through death domain interactions. The central adaptor molecule for these receptors is the death domain-containing protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD). FADD binds a death domain on a receptor or additional adaptor and recruits caspases to the activated receptor. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) signals apoptosis through two receptors, DR4 and DR5. Although there is much interest in TRAIL, the mechanism by which FADD is recruited to the TRAIL receptors is not clear. Using a reverse two-hybrid system we previously identified mutations in the death effector domain of FADD that prevented binding to Fas/CD95. Here we show that these mutations also prevent binding to DR5. FADD-deficient Jurkat cells stably expressing these FADD mutations did not transduce TRAIL or Fas/CD95 signaling. Second site compensating mutations that restore binding to and signaling through Fas/CD95 and DR5 were also in the death effector domain. We conclude that in contrast to current models where the death domain of FADD functions independently of the death effector domain, the death effector domain of FADD comes into direct contact with both TRAIL and Fas/CD95 receptors.

Binding of Fas ligand (FasL) to a preformed Fas/CD95 trimer (1Siegel R.M. Frederiksen J.K. Zacharias D.A. Chan F.K. Johnson M. Lynch D. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Google Scholar) results in dimerization of two trimers (2Holler N. Tardivel A. Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Hertig S. Gaide O. Martinon F. Tinel A. Deperthes D. Calderara S. Schulthess T. Engel J. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1428-1440Google Scholar) and higher levels of oligomerization (3Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Google Scholar). These activated receptors signal the apoptotic response by recruiting FADD to the cytoplasmic DD of the receptor to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). FADD consists of two distinct domains, a DD that binds to the DD of Fas/CD95 and a death effector domain (DED) that binds to DEDs on caspase-8 and caspase-10 (4Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Google Scholar). The DD and DED have similar structural folds consisting of six anti-parallel α-helices, and both form globular protein structures whose only known function is to interact with other proteins (5Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Google Scholar). Thus, it is thought that binding of ligand to Fas/CD95 results in the recruitment of FADD through DD interactions followed by caspases through DED interactions. The induced proximity of two or more initiator caspases in a complex with FADD and the receptor results in their dimerization and activation (6Donepudi M. Sweeney A.M. Briand C. Grutter M.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 543-549Google Scholar, 7Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing leads to a fully processed, active form of the caspase that can dissociate from the receptor complex. Once activated, these caspases can then cleave and activate effector caspases such as caspase-3 and other substrates to induce the characteristic phenotypes associated with apoptosis.Activation of TNF receptor 1 requires an additional adaptor protein, TRADD. Binding of TNFα to TNF receptor 1 results in the recruitment of TRADD (8Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar) followed by FADD (9Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Google Scholar, 10Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar), again through DD interactions. Similar to the Fas/CD95 receptor, recruitment of FADD to the complex leads to the recruitment and activation of caspase-8. Of note, recent studies suggest that the TRADD/FADD/caspase-8 complex dissociates from the receptor during TNF-induced apoptosis, implying an additional layer of regulation (11Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Google Scholar, 12Harper N. Hughes M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25534-25541Google Scholar). Nonetheless, FADD is essential for TNF-induced caspase activation because FADD-deficient cells fail to undergo apoptosis when treated with TNFα and a dominant negative form of FADD that consists of only the DD can block TNF-induced death (13Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Google Scholar, 14Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Google Scholar).There is much interest in TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) because of its reported ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells without affecting normal cells (15Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A. Blackie C. Chang L. McMurtrey A.E. Hebert A. DeForge L. Koumenis I.L. Lewis D. Harris L. Bussiere J. Koeppen H. Shahrokh Z. Schwall R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 155-162Google Scholar, 16Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be useful for treating cancer. There are two “signaling” receptors DR4 and DR5, which, similar to Fas/CD95, contain death domains. In addition, there are two “decoy” receptors, DcR1 and DcR2, that have truncated or completely absent DDs (17LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Google Scholar), suggesting that the DD is essential for apoptotic signaling through TRAIL. FADD is necessary for signaling through DR4 and DR5 because dominant negative FADD blocks TRAIL signaling (14Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Google Scholar), and FADD-deficient Jurkat cells do not undergo TRAIL-induced death (18Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 241-243Google Scholar). FADD, caspases-8 and caspase-10 are recruited to the TRAIL DISC, but TRADD was not detectable in this complex (19Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Google Scholar, 20Sprick M.R. Weigand M.A. Rieser E. Rauch C.T. Juo P. Blenis J. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 599-609Google Scholar). These reports led to a model similar to that of Fas/CD95 in which FADD binds directly to both TRAIL receptors rather than through an adapter molecule (21Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 759-760Google Scholar).Recently, we made the surprising discovery that specific mutations in the FADD DED could prevent binding to Fas/CD95 (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar). This suggests that the FADD DED contributes to the interaction with the Fas/CD95 receptor and that the DED and DD of FADD do not function independently as suggested in previous models. Here we show that mutations in the DED of FADD also prevent binding of FADD to DR5 and are unable to rescue TRAIL signaling in FADD-deficient cells. Compensating second site mutations that restore binding of such a FADD mutation to DR5 were identified in the DED of FADD and restore TRAIL-induced activation of caspases, further indicating a role for the DED in coordinating the FADD-DR5 interaction. Using a reverse two-hybrid approach we were able to identify only one mutation in the FADD DD that showed differential binding between Fas/CD95 and DR5. These data suggest that the same residues in both the DED and DD of FADD regulate binding of FADD to Fas/CD95 and DR5.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Antibodies and reagents were purchased from the following sources: caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-FADD (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY), anti-GFP (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-actin and anti-FLAG (Sigma), FasL (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), recombinant human TRAIL and anti-His6 antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).Plasmids—pGB14 was made by cloning the ADH1 promoter, Gal4 DNA-binding domain, multiple cloning site, ADH1 terminator cassette from pGBKT7 into the KpnI and SacI sites of pRS314. DR5 (amino acids 209-412), Fas (amino acids 177-335), and full-length catalytically inactive caspase-8 were made by PCR on the corresponding cDNA (23Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Google Scholar) and by cloning the product into pGB14. Full-length TRADD was cloned into pBTM-116. pACT3 and pcDNA-Puro plasmids have been described previously (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar). Full-length FADD and FADD-DD (amino acids 79-208) were cloned into pEGFP-C2 or pACT3. The cytoplasmic domains of DR5 (amino acids 209-412) or Fas (amino acids 177-335) were cloned into pEGFP-C2. Amino acids 1-208 of FADD or 272-469 of DR5 were cloned C-terminally to FLAG. A more complete description of plasmids, maps, and sequences are available upon request.Cell Lines—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (24Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804Google Scholar) stably expressing FADD mutations were made by electroporating pcDNA3.1-Puro constructs and selecting for stable transformants as previously described (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of pEGFP construct plus 2 μg of FLAG or FLAG-FADD using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in a 10-cm plate. After 18 h the cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors), and the soluble fraction was incubated with 30 μl of M2-agarose (Sigma) for 4 h a 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in Tris-buffered saline, and precipitated GFP fusions were detected by immunoblot.DISC Immunoprecipitations—20 × 106 BJAB cells were treated with 1.0 μg/ml nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma) or monoclonal antibody 631 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) cross-linked with an equal amount of anti-mouse Fc (Sigma) for 30 min. The precipitations were carried out using protein A/G-agarose beads essentially as described (19Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Google Scholar), and the bound proteins were detected by immunoblot.Two-hybrid Assays—Strains Y190 (MATa his3 ade2 trp1 leu2 gal4 gal80 cyh2, LYS2:Gal1-HIS3 URA3:Gal1-LacZ), DY6877 (MATa ade2 can1 his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 URA3:8xLexA-LacZ), and LY26 (MATα can1 his3 leu2 met15 trp1 ura3 gal4::hisG gal80::hisG LYS2::LexA(op)-HIS3 TetO-ADE2 ho::KanMX::GAL1-TetR) were used for directed two-hybrid assays and reverse two-hybrid screens essentially as described (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar). Strain Y190 was used for quantitative β-galactosidase assays as previously described (25Morgan M. Thorburn J. Thomas L. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Thorburn A. Cell Death & Differ. 2001; 8: 696-705Google Scholar).Caspase Activation—Jurkat cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in growth medium + 1 μg/ml cycloheximide. The cells were incubated for 6 h with FasL (2 ng/ml) or TRAIL (50 ng/ml cross-linked with an equal amount of anti-His6), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then harvested in Triton X-100 lysis buffer then analyzed by immunoblot.Modeling of FADD Mutations—Free energies were obtained by using the thermodynamic cycle of (wild type protein-mutant protein) - (wild type residues - mutant residues). To determine the free energy for each mutant state and the wild types, the solvated energy was computed from snapshots taken from a 500 ps Molecular Dynamics simulation (one for each mutant/wild type) and averaged over each trajectory. Residue energies were obtained by taking the protein simulations, deleting all of the protein except the mutated residue(s) and computing the solvated energy for each snapshot. The generalized born molecular volume with surface area (26Lee M.S. Salsbury Jr., F.R. Brooks III, C.L. J. Chem. Phys. 2002; 116: 10606-10614Google Scholar, 27Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B.

Res. 2000; 33: 889-897Google Scholar) approach was used to obtain the solvation energy and added to the CHARMM22 (28MacKerell Jr., A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D.

B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Google Scholar) force field energy to obtain the solvated energy for each snapshot.RESULTSFADD Binds Directly to DR5—We performed DR5 DISC immunoprecipitations to see whether FADD precipitated in the endogenous DR5 DISC. BJAB cells were stimulated for 30 min with either nonspecific IgG or an agonistic monoclonal antibody against DR5 (αDR5), and the DR5 DISC was precipitated. Consistent with previous reports (19Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Google Scholar, 20Sprick M.R. Weigand M.A. Rieser E. Rauch C.T. Juo P. Blenis J. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 599-609Google Scholar), we were able to detect both FADD and caspase-8 in cells stimulated with αDR5 but not in cells stimulated with IgG (Fig. 1A).Although it has been suggested that FADD binds directly to DR5 (21Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 759-760Google Scholar), other reports indicate that an adaptor protein such as TRADD (29Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 821-830Google Scholar) or DAP3 (23Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Google Scholar) might be involved in recruiting FADD to the DR5 DISC. We therefore used a yeast two-hybrid assay to test for interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of DR5 and full-length FADD. Fas/CD95 was used as a positive control because it is known to interact directly with FADD (30Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Google Scholar). Both Fas/CD95 and DR5 interacted with FADD in yeast, suggesting that DR5 is recruited directly to the activated TRAIL receptor complex (Fig. 1B).To test whether FADD could bind directly to DR5 in mammalian cells, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with full-length FADD and the cytoplasmic domains of DR5 and Fas/CD95. Empty FLAG vector or FLAG-tagged FADD was transfected into HeLa cells with GFP-tagged Fas/CD95 or DR5 cytoplasmic domains. FLAG complexes were immunoprecipitated, and interaction was detected by immunoblotting for GFP. As shown in Fig. 1C, both Fas/CD95 and DR5 co-precipitated with FLAG-FADD but not with empty vector. We also observed a modest decrease in the amount of GFP-DR5 remaining in the lysate after immunoprecipitation. We conclude that similar to the Fas/CD95 model, FADD binds directly to DR5.The Death Effector Domain of FADD Modulates Binding to DR5—Using a reverse two-hybrid strategy, we previously identified mutations in the DED of FADD that prevent binding to Fas/CD95 (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar). These mutations do not disrupt overall protein structure because the mutated proteins still bind both TRADD and caspase-8 and are able to transduce caspase signaling in response to TNFα in mammalian cells (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar). Using a directed yeast two-hybrid assay, we tested these FADD mutations to see whether they affected binding to DR5. A mutation in FADD at arginine 71, which is located in the loop between helices 5 and 6 of the DED (31Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Google Scholar), to either tryptophan or alanine prevented binding to DR5 (Fig. 2A). This suggests that similar to Fas/CD95, the DED of FADD participates in binding to DR5.Fig. 2The DED of FADD regulates binding to DR5.A, a directed yeast two-hybrid assay was used to test for interaction of DR5, Fas, TRADD, and caspase-8 with empty vector (pACT3), wild type FADD, or FADD DED mutations. Changes in arginine 71 to either alanine or tryptophan prevented interaction with both DR5 and Fas/CD95 while retaining interaction with TRADD and caspase-8. B, FADD-deficient Jurkat cells were stably transfected with GFP vector, wild type FADD, or FADD mutants. The level of FADD protein was determined by immunoblot. C, stable Jurkat cells were left untreated or stimulated with TRAIL, and caspase-8 and caspase-3 processing was measured by immunoblot. Only cells expressing wild type FADD showed any processing, indicating that arginine 71 is required for FADD binding to DR5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test whether FADD DED mutations could transduce TRAIL signaling, we stably expressed GFP, FADD, FADD (R71W), or FADD (R71A) in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (24Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804Google Scholar). Jurkat cells express very little DR4 so almost all TRAIL signaling is through DR5 (19Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 611-620Google Scholar). FADD-deficient Jurkat-GFP cells do not express any FADD protein that can be detected by immunoblotting, and the expression level of wild type FADD and the FADD mutations was similar between each cell line (Fig. 2B). The earliest signaling event after ligand binding is the recruitment of FADD and processing of caspase-8; FADD mutations that cannot bind to DR5 should therefore be unable to rescue TRAIL-induced caspase-8 processing. These cells were treated with TRAIL, and caspase-8 processing was measured by immunoblot. The cells expressing wild type FADD showed cleavage of caspase-8 in response to TRAIL, whereas cells expressing GFP or the FADD DED mutations did not (Fig. 2C). We also measured caspase-3 processing because it is cleaved and activated by caspase-8. Caspase-3 was cleaved only in cells expressing wild type FADD (Fig. 2C). Therefore, FADD proteins containing the DED point mutations that prevent binding to DR5 cannot rescue the phenotype associated with FADD deficiency. These data indicate that the binding phenotype observed in yeast correlates with signaling ability in mammalian cells and the DED of FADD modulates binding to DR5.Mutations That Restore Binding to DR5 Are Located in the DED of FADD—We next sought to identify secondary compensating mutations that would restore binding of FADD DED mutations to DR5. Using a forward two-hybrid approach, we performed a second round of random mutagenesis on FADD (R71A) and screened for second site mutations that restore the binding activity of FADD (R71A) (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar). The second site mutations were located in helix 5 of the FADD DED: glutamate 61 to lysine, leucine 62 to phenylalanine, and glutamate 65 to lysine. These mutations restored binding of FADD (R71A) to both DR5 and Fas/CD95 (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Helix 5 of the DED regulates binding of FADD to DR5 and Fas/CD95.A, second site mutations in FADD R71A of glutamates 61 to lysine (R71A E61K), leucine 62 to phenylalanine (R71A L62F), and glutamate 65 to lysine (R71A E65K) restore binding to both DR5 and Fas/CD95 as measured in a directed yeast two-hybrid assay. B, FADD expression in cells stably transfected with the second site FADD mutations was determined by immunoblot. Jurkat cells expressing the second site FADD mutations were treated with TRAIL (C) or FasL (D), and caspase-8 and caspase-3 processing was detected by immunoblot. Each of the second site mutations rescued DR5 and Fas/CD95-induced caspase processing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We introduced FADD molecules with these double mutations into FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 3B) and measured caspase processing after treatment with TRAIL. Cells expressing FADD (R71A) did not show caspase-8 or caspase-3 processing when treated with TRAIL, whereas cells expressing FADD (R71A) along with a second site compensating mutation in the DED showed strong TRAIL-induced caspase cleavage (Fig. 3C). Thus, DR5-induced processing of caspase-8 and caspase-3 is prevented by mutations in the DED of FADD and second site mutations that are also in the DED restored processing. Furthermore caspase processing occurs only in response to treatment with the ligand, indicating that it is in response to receptor activation. The same second site mutations also restored Fas/CD95-induced caspase cleavage (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that FADD uses the same surface of the DED, specifically helix 5, to bind both DR5 and Fas/CD95.Full-length FADD Binds Better to DR5 than the Death Domain Alone—Dominant negative FADD, which consists of the DD alone, can inhibit signaling through TRAIL, indicating that the DD is sufficient for binding to DR5 when overexpressed (14Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Google Scholar). Because the DED is important for the interaction between DR5 and FADD, we reasoned that full-length FADD might bind better than the DD alone. Constructs expressing either the FADD-DD or full-length FADD were tested for interaction with DR5 in yeast. To measure this interaction we used β-galactosidase assays, which allow us to quantitate each interaction. We observed about a 20% increase in binding of DR5 to full-length FADD compared with the DD alone (Fig. 4A). We performed immunoprecipitation experiments with FLAG-tagged DR5 and GFP-tagged FADD or FADD-DD to measure this interaction in mammalian cells. Full-length FADD co-precipitated with DR5 to a much greater extent than the death domain alone (Fig. 4B). Thus, both the DD and the DED of FADD contribute to the interaction with DR5.Fig. 4DR5 binds to full-length FADD better than the death domain alone.A, the interaction of DR5 with full-length FADD or the DD alone was tested in yeast using quantitative β-galactosidase assays. DR5 showed no interaction with empty vector (pACT3) but was able to interact with both of the FADD constructs. However, the interaction with full-length FADD was about 20% higher than the DD alone. B, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-DR5 along with GFP, GFPFADD-DD, or GFP-FADD; FLAG complexes were precipitated, and interaction was measured by immunoblotting for GFP. Full-length FADD interacted with DR5 to a greater extent than the DD alone. IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Death Domain of FADD Can Discriminate between DR5 and Fas/CD95—Because all of our data indicate that binding of FADD to DR5 and Fas/CD95 is very similar, we attempted to identify residues in FADD that are required for binding to one receptor but not the other. We performed a reverse two-hybrid screen to identify mutations in FADD that prevent binding to Fas/CD95 but retain binding to DR5. We screened more than 10 million randomly mutated FADD molecules but were able to identify only a single mutation that discriminated between Fas/CD95 and DR5 binding. A change in valine 108 to glutamate (V108E) in the DD of FADD prevents binding to Fas/CD95 but does not alter binding to DR5, TRADD, or caspase-8 (Fig. 5A). We also screened for mutations in FADD that prevent binding to DR5 but retain interaction with Fas/CD95 but were unable to find such a mutation. This implies that other than valine 108, the same residues that are required for FADD binding to DR5 are also required for Fas/CD95 binding.Fig. 5Valine 108 is essential for binding of FADD to Fas/CD95.A, a reverse two-hybrid screen identified valine 108 as essential for binding to Fas/CD95. Interaction with other death domain-containing proteins was determined by a directed yeast two-hybrid assay. B, the level of exogenous FADD or FADD (V108E) in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells is shown by immunoblot. C, Jurkat cells expressing GFP, FADD, or FADD (V108E) were stimulated with TRAIL or FasL, and caspase processing was measured by immunoblot. FADD (V108E) is able to transduce TRAIL signaling but not FasL signaling.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether FADD (V108E) rescues signaling in response to activation of DR5 or Fas/CD95 in mammalian cells, we introduced this FADD mutation into FADD-deficient Jurkat cells. The expression level of FADD (V108E) along with cells expressing wild type FADD or GFP is shown in Fig. 5B. These cells were treated with TRAIL or FasL, and caspase processing was measured by immunoblot. GFP cells did not show caspase processing when treated with TRAIL or FasL, whereas cells expressing FADD showed both caspase-8 and caspase-3 processing (Fig. 5C). Cells expressing FADD (V108E) underwent caspase processing in response to TRAIL but not when treated with FasL (Fig. 5C). Thus, FADD (V108E) is able to bind DR5 and transduce TRAIL signaling but is unable to bind Fas/CD95 or transduce signaling through FasL.DISCUSSIONWe and others have reported that the DED of death domain proteins can regulate binding of the DD (22Thomas L.R. Stillman D.J. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34343-34348Google Scholar, 32Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Google Scholar). Previously we identified mutations in the DED of FADD that prevent binding to Fas/CD95. These FADD mutations did not cause gross conformational changes because binding to TRADD and caspase-8 was still intact. Here we show that mutations in the DED of FADD also prevent binding to DR5. Cells expressing FADD with a mutation in the DED were unable to transduce TRAIL signaling, whereas second site compensating mutations within the DED were able to restore FADD binding to DR5 and rescue TRAIL signaling. Computer modeling indicates that these mutations do not disrupt the overall protein structure because the effect on free energy for most mutations was small (Fig. 6A). FADD R71A L62F is the only mutation with a significant change in free energy, but this mutation actually leads to a more stable structure. Interestin"

Sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X is a major capping group of L-selectin ligands. N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 6-sulfation is essential for the ligand activity, and is catalyzed by GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferases (GlcNAc6STs) of which GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 are expressed in HEV. Here, we report that mice deficient in GlcNAc6ST-1 were impaired in the elaboration of sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X in HEV and that an epitope of L-selectin ligands recognized by the MECA-79 anti-body was greatly reduced or abolished in the abluminal aspect of HEV. Lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches was significantly reduced in GlcNAc6ST-1 null mice. These results demonstrate that GlcNAc6ST-1 is involved in lymphocyte homing in vivo, and indicate that GlcNAc6ST-1 and -2 play complementary roles. The importance of GlcNAc6ST-1 is particularly high-lighted by its involvement in lymphocyte homing to Peyer's patches where GlcNAc6ST-2 expression is undetectable.

Polymerase Chain Reaction—Aliquots of ∼0.5 μg of DNA were mixed with 20 μl of 1× Taq DNA polymerase buffer containing 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 2.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was carried out at 94 °C for 3 min, with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. To screen for homologously recombined DNA, GlcNAc6ST-1 primers were used: 5′-AAGCCTACAGGTGGTGCGAA-3′ (GST2KO-F) and 5′-CAGGACTGTTAACCCGCTCA-3′ (GST2KO-R). The PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The wild-type allele gave a 0.5-kb band, whereas the mutated allele gave no band. Neo primers were also used: 5′-CAGCGTCTTGTCATTGGCGA-3′ (Neo3) and 5′-GCTCTTCGTCCAGATCATCC-3′ (Neo4). The wild-type allele gave no band, whereas the mutated allele gave a 0.6-kb band.

A complete hematological profile was obtained using a Hemavet 850 automated hematological analyzer (CDC Technologies Inc., Oxford, CT). Freshly isolated lymphoid organs of 12-week-old Gn6st-1 +/+ and -/- mice were place in a cold PBS and teased with two 25-gauge needles to prepare a uniform single cell suspension. The prepared suspension was rinsed with PBS. Trypan blue negative cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Immunofluorescence Staining—Mouse (9- to 12-week-old) tissues were embedded in the Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc., Torrance, CA) and frozen in 2-methylbutane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections (10 μm thick) were prepared on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min, and then allowed to dry for 30 min. Sections were incubated with blocking solution (PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal mouse serum) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were reacted with MECA-79 (rat IgM; 1.0 μg/ml) (30Hemmerich S. Bistrup A. Singer M.S. van Zante A. Lee J.K. Tsay D. Peters M. Carminati J.L. Brennan T.J. Carver-Moore K.

The sections were washed in PBS and then incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM (1.5 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, sections were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin (Sigma) and mounted in FluorSaver™ reagent (Calbiochem). All antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution described above. The digital images were recorded with a digital camera system (Axio-Cam, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a Nikon OPTIPHOT-inverted microscope and an Epi-Fluorescence Equipment EF-D Mercury Set (Nikon). To distinguish the MECA-79 epitope in the abluminal aspects of HEV from the epitope in the luminal aspects, a two-step in vivo/ex vivo staining approach was employed (35Bistrup A. Tsay D. Shenoy P.

Unlabeled MECA-79 (50 μg/mouse in 100 μl of PBS) was infused into the tail veins of mice and allowed to circulate for 30 min. Mice were killed and cryostat sections were prepared as described above. The MECA-79 epitope in the abluminal aspect of HEV was detected using biotinylated MECA-79 (1.0 μg/ml) (30Hemmerich S. Bistrup A. Singer M.S. van Zante A. Lee J.K. Tsay D. Peters M. Carminati J.L.

Immunohistochemical Analysis with AG223 Antibody—The AG223 monoclonal antibody (murine IgM) was produced using 6-sulfo Lewis X ceramide as the immunogen (14Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K.

On enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, AG223 antibody reacted with 6-sulfo Lewis X ceramide, and to a lesser extent, with 6,6′-disulfo Lewis X ceramide. The AG223 antibody was not reactive to Lewis X ceramide, 6′-sulfo Lewis X ceramide, or 3′-sulfo Lewis X ceramide (21Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.W. Kurosawa N. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R.

The tissue sections were immunostained with biotinylated AG223 antibody after digestion with 0.02 units/ml neuraminidase (from Arthrobacter ureafaciens, Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto Japan) in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 30 min. The avidin-biotin complex was used with a Vectastain® ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The reaction was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride followed by counterstaining with 1% methyl green (14Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H.

In Vitro Adherence Assay—Axillary and brachial lymph nodes of 9- to 12-week-old GlcNAc6ST-1 +/+ and -/- mice were dissected and frozen in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. compound. The assay was performed as described previously (37Rosen S.D. Chi S.I. True D.D. Singer M.S. Yednock T.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1895-1902PubMed Google Scholar). Cryostat sections (10 μm thick) were adhered onto 3-well epoxy-coated slides (Carlson Scientific, Peotone, IL) and air dried for 30 min. Then, sections were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, for 20 min on ice. Sections were overlaid with 100 μl/well of a suspension (8 × 106/ml) of L-selectin-expressing lymphoma cells (i.e. 38C13) (9Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm HEPES and 1% bovine serum albumin. The slides were rotated (80 rpm) using a gyratory shaker. In some cases, L-selectin-expressing 38C13 cells were treated with MEL-14 antibody (rat IgG2a; 10 μg/ml) for 20 min before being added to sections. The number of cells bound per HEV was quantitated as described previously (37Rosen S.D. Chi S.I. True D.D. Singer M.S. Yednock T.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1895-1902PubMed Google Scholar). MEL-14 antibody generated from hybridoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) was purified on a column of recombinant Protein G-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). In Vivo Homing Assay—Lymphocyte homing in vivo was carried out based on published procedures (12Maly P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G.

Mesenteric lymphocytes from 5- to 10-week-old ICR mice were isolated and then labeled with 5 μm 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA; Molecular Probes). After being washed with PBS, the cells (1.7 × 107 in 100 μl of PBS) were injected into the tail veins of age-matched (12-week-old) Gn6st-1 +/+ and -/- mice. One hour after injection, the animals were sacrificed and secondary lymphoid organs were dissected. Lymphocytes in these organs were teased out with two 25-gauge needles. The fractional content of CMFDA-positive cells in lymphocyte suspensions of these organs was determined by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). For each suspension, the data on 500,000 cells were analyzed and acquired with CellQuest™ software (BD Biosciences). The data were normalized for each animal (fractional value of CMFDA-positive cells divided by the mean of the fractional values for all of the wild-type mice within the experiment). This normalization procedure allowed pooling of data from four separate experiments. To determine the contribution of L-selectin to lymphocyte homing in Gn6st-1 +/+ and -/- mice, we employed L-selectin null mice (38Borsig L. Wong R. Hynes R.O. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2193-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Splenocytes from L-selectin null mice and wild-type mice were isolated and then labeled with CMFDA and CMRA (Molecular Probes) dyes, respectively. The cells were mixed in an equal number (3.4 × 107 cells total in 200 μl of PBS for an animal) and injected intravenously into either Gn6st-1 +/+ or -/- mice. One hour after injection, fractional contents of CMFDA-positive and CMRA-positive cells were determined in each recipient organ by flow cytometry as described previously (30Hemmerich S. Bistr"
https://openalex.org/W1975068237,"The octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts a wide range of effects on the cardiovascular system but has also been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. Ang II is formed by cleavage of Ang I by angiotensin-converting enzyme, but there is also evidence for non-angiotensin-converting enzyme-dependent conversion of Ang I to Ang II. Here we address the role of mast cell proteases in Ang II production by using two different mouse strains lacking mast cell heparin or mouse mast cell protease 4 (mMCP-4), the chymase that may be the functional homologue to human chymase. Ang I was added to ex vivo cultures of peritoneal cells, and the generation of Ang II and other metabolites was analyzed. Activation of mast cells resulted in marked increases in both the formation and subsequent degradation of Ang II, and both of these processes were strongly reduced in heparin-deficient peritoneal cells. In the mMCP-4–/– cell cultures no reduction in the rate of Ang II generation was seen, but the formation of Ang-(5–10) was completely abrogated. Addition of a carboxypeptidase A (CPA) inhibitor to wild type cells caused complete inhibition of the formation of Ang-(1–9) and Ang-(1–7) but did not inhibit Ang II formation. However, when the CPA inhibitor was added to the mMCP-4–/– cultures, essentially complete inhibition of Ang II formation was obtained.

Lorenzo O. Ruperez M. Esteban V. Suzuki Y. Mezzano S. Plaza J.J. Egido J. Hypertension. 2001; 38: 1382-1387Google Scholar, 2Kim S. Iwao H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 11-34Google Scholar). Of the diverse biological activities of Ang II, its effect on heart function has undoubtedly received the most attention, and various strategies for minimizing the effect of Ang II on blood pressure are of major clinical impact in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Ang II is formed from Ang I (1DRVYIHPFHL10) by cleavage of the Phe8–His9 bond. A major pathway for the formation of Ang II is the cleavage of Ang I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The involvement of ACE in Ang II formation in vivo was recently confirmed by gene targeting (3Wei C.C. Tian B. Perry G. Meng Q.C. Chen Y.F. Oparil S. Dell'Italia L.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 282: H2254-H2258Google Scholar). However, the latter study indicated that although the ACE-catalyzed pathway was the dominant route for Ang II production in blood, the knockout of ACE did not reduce Ang II levels in tissues, indicating that other mechanisms are operating in the generation of extravascular Ang II. Although this alternative pathway for Ang II generation is still not entirely clarified, a number of in vitro and in vivo studies implicate mast cell (MC) chymase as the tissue converter of Ang I to Ang II (4Dell'Italia L.J. Husain A. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2002; 17: 374-379Google Scholar). Chymases are serine proteases specifically expressed by MCs and stored in their secretory granule (5Miller H.R. Pemberton A.D. Immunology. 2002; 105: 375-390Google Scholar, 6Caughey G. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 1353-1357Google Scholar). Upon MC activation and degranulation, the chymases, together with other MC products, e.g. carboxypeptidase A (CPA) and tryptases, are released in complexes with heparin proteoglycan (7Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Google Scholar, 8Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Google Scholar). The chymases are divided into an α- and a β-family; humans only express one α-chymase, whereas rodents also express various β-chymases. Originally, it was thought that only the α-chymases generated Ang II and that the β-chymases exclusively catalyzed the inactivating cleavage between Tyr4 and Ile5 (9Chandrasekharan U.M. Sanker S. Glynias M.J. Karnik S.S. Husain A. Science. 1996; 271: 502-505Google Scholar). However, more recent data have shown that the murine β-chymases mouse mast cell protease 1 (mMCP-1) and mMCP-4 both can generate Ang II, although mMCP-4 also produces the inactivating Tyr4–Ile5 cleavage in purified systems (10Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Google Scholar, 11Saito K. Muto T. Tomimori Y. Imajo S. Maruoka H. Tanaka T. Yamashiro K. Fukuda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 773-777Google Scholar). It is important to note that although a role for chymase in extravascular Ang conversion is strongly indicated by a number of studies, this notion has not gained support from gene knock-out studies. In this work our aim was to study the role of MCs in the generation of Ang II by using a mouse strain carrying a targeted deletion of N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 2 (NDST-2), an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of MC heparin. The absence of NDST-2 leads to a global storage defect for all of the various MC proteases, including chymase (7Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Google Scholar, 8Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Google Scholar). Furthermore, we used a mouse strain lacking mMCP-4, the chymase that may represent the functional counterpart to the human chymase (12Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Google Scholar). As a model for extravascular Ang II formation we used the peritoneal cell ex vivo system. An advantage of this experimental system is that it employs intact cells with the participating compounds in their appropriate milieu, instead of purified components or tissue extracts where cellular functions are compromised. Materials—Ang I (Sigma), Ang II (Sigma), Ang(5–8) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland), Ang-(1–7), Ang-(1–9), Ang-(5–10) (XCP/Xaia Care HB, Gothenburg, Sweden), α1-antichymotrypsin (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK), calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma), Captopril (Sigma), potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (Calbiochem), chymostatin (Sigma), Ham's/F12 medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany), an Ang II-ELISA kit (Bachem, St. Helens, UK), and the Source-5RPC ST 4.6/150 reversed phase column (Amersham Biosciences) were from the commercial sources indicated. A selective tryptase inhibitor, 52335, was a gift from Morphochem AG (Munich, Germany). Mice—NDST-2–/– (C57BL/6 background; back-crossed 10 generations) and mMCP-4–/– mice (mixed genetic background, C57BL/6–129SVJ) were generated by gene targeting (7Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Google Scholar, 12Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Google Scholar). For experiments on the NDST-2–/– strain, C57BL/6 mice were used as wild type (wt) controls. For the experiments on the mMCP-4–/– strain, mMCP-4+/+ or mMCP-4+/– littermates were used as the wt control. No differences in Ang I processing were observed between mMCP-4+/+ and mMCP-4+/– cells. Cells—Peritoneal cells were collected by lavages with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were centrifuged (300 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), resuspended, and cultured in serum-free medium (Ham's/F12 supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine and 100 IU/ml penicillin-streptomycin). The cells were distributed in 24-well plates (Nunc; ∼2 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml of medium/well) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. To study the processing of Ang I, exogenous Ang I (100 ng for ELISA; 20 μg for HPLC; in 10–20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) was added, followed by either calcium ionophore (1 μl of a 2 mm solution of A23187), anti-IgE (4 μl of a 0.5 μg/μl solution) or an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (control). Medium samples (50 or 100 μl) were taken after 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h and were stored at –20 °C until analysis. In the inhibition studies, cells were first treated with calcium ionophore, followed by the addition of inhibitor after 10 min and the addition of Ang I 15 min later. HPLC—Samples of conditioned medium (50 μl) were applied to a Source-5RPC ST 4.6/150 column equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient extending from 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 80% acetonitrile. The eluate was monitored at 214 nm, and the quantities of peaks were assessed by integrating peak areas. For normalization, each peak area was compared with an unrelated reference peak present as a component of the cell culture medium (Fig. 3). To identify peaks, their elution positions were compared with those of standard Ang I, Ang II, Ang-(1–7), Ang-(1–9), Ang-(5–10), and Ang(5–8). Peritoneal cell cultures from wt mice typically contained ∼2–3% MCs, with the remainder being lymphocytes and macrophages in approximately equal proportions (Fig. 1A). In the NDST-2–/– cells, the densely stained MCs were replaced by cells containing empty appearing vacuoles, in agreement with the MC morphology reported previously in the NDST-2 knockout (Fig. 1B) (7Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Google Scholar). In the mMCP-4–/– cell populations, MCs had normal morphology (Fig. 1C). Cells other than MCs had indistinguishable morphology in all three genotypes (Fig. 1, A–C). Addition of a calcium ionophore resulted in MC degranulation but no observable changes in the morphology of the other peritoneal cell types (Fig. 1D). Angiotensin conversion in the peritoneal cell ex vivo system was first studied by ELISA. Ang I was added, and the level of Ang II in conditioned medium was measured at different time points. Addition of Ang I to wt cells resulted in the generation of immunoreactive Ang II, and it is clear from Fig. 2 that the level of Ang II was maximal at ∼1 h, after which leveling off was observed. After activation of MCs, either with calcium ionophore (Fig. 2) or anti-IgE antibody (not shown), Ang II generation was much more rapid, with peak Ang II levels reached at ∼10–30 min. Furthermore, after maximal Ang II levels had been reached, the Ang II peak decreased rapidly and was essentially undetectable after 3 h (Fig. 2). When similar experiments were performed on peritoneal cells recovered from NDST-2–/– animals, the levels of Ang II that were generated, either in the absence or presence of MC activation agent, were markedly lower than in wt cells. However, the kinetics for Ang II formation and subsequent decrease were similar as in wt cell cultures (Fig. 2). To identify Ang I processing products other than Ang II, we used HPLC analysis. Addition of Ang I to wt cells resulted in formation of a peak corresponding to Ang II, in agreement with the ELISA analysis (Fig. 3), and the Ang II peak was markedly increased after activation of MCs (Fig. 3B). Addition of Ang I to activated wt cells also resulted in the formation of Ang-(1–9), Ang-(5–10), and Ang-(1–7), respectively (Fig. 3B). The levels of all of these peptides were markedly lower in non-activated peritoneal cell cultures (Fig. 3A) and were considerably lower in conditioned medium from NDST-2–/– cells than in medium from wt cells (Fig. 3C). To follow the kinetics of Ang I processing, the levels of each of the Ang I processing products were assessed at various time points (Fig. 4). From Fig. 4A it is apparent that the level of Ang I decreased continuously after addition to peritoneal cells. The rate for this decrease was considerably higher in wt than in NDST-2–/– cells and was markedly increased by calcium ionophore (Fig. 4A). In agreement with the ELISA data, both the Ang II formation and its subsequent decrease were markedly increased upon MC activation, and these processes were defective in NDST-2–/– cell cultures (Fig. 4B). The generation and subsequent decrease in Ang-(1–9) showed similar kinetics as was observed for Ang II, indicating that Ang II generation and Ang-(1–9) generation are closely associated events (Fig. 4C). Also the kinetics of Ang-(5–10) formation and subsequent decrease showed similarities to the kinetics for Ang II. However, Ang-(5–10) did not accumulate to the same extent in medium from non-activated cells as was seen for Ang II and Ang-(1–9). In contrast to the generation of Ang II, Ang-(1–9), and Ang-(5–10), the generation of Ang-(1–7) was relatively slow, being first detectable ∼60 min after addition of Ang I. Furthermore, the generation of Ang-(1–7) was not defective in the NDST-2–/– cultures. Instead, the level of this peptide was higher in NDST-2–/– cells than in wt (Fig. 4E). The results above clearly indicate that MCs are involved in Ang I processing in the peritoneal cell ex vivo system and that their stored proteases participate in the process. Next, we investigated which of the MC proteases are responsible for each of the different Ang I processing steps. For this purpose we used a mouse strain with a targeted inactivation of mMCP-4, the murine chymase that may be the closest functional homologue to the human chymase (12Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Google Scholar). To address the relative contribution of other MC proteases, various protease inhibitors were employed. The rate of Ang I decrease, after its addition to activated or non-activated peritoneal cell cultures, was similar in wt and mMCP-4–/– cultures (Fig. 5A), indicating that overall Ang I hydrolysis is not critically dependent on mMCP-4. Addition of a CPA inhibitor (CPI) resulted in a markedly slower rate of Ang I decrease in activated wt cell cultures, and the addition of CPI to activated mMCP-4-null cultures gave an even more pronounced reduction in Ang I hydrolysis (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, Ang II was readily formed in mMCP-4–/– cell cultures, indicating that mMCP-4 is not essential for Ang II generation. The kinetics for Ang II formation and its subsequent decrease were highly similar in wt and mMCP-4–/– cell cultures except that higher levels of Ang II were accumulated in non-activated cell cultures from mMCP-4–/– mice than in wt counterparts. When CPI was added to wt cell cultures, no reduction in Ang II generation was observed. In fact, addition of CPI resulted in higher levels of accumulated Ang II in the conditioned medium. In contrast, when CPI was added to mMCP-4–/– cultures, an essentially complete blockade of Ang II formation was observed (Fig. 5B). Thus, both CPA and mMCP-4 generate Ang II, but neither of them is individually essential for Ang II formation. Substantially higher levels of Ang-(1–9) were accumulated in medium from mMCP-4–/– cells than in wt cell cultures, indicating that mMCP-4 may catalyze further processing of this peptide. Otherwise, the kinetics for the generation and subsequent decrease of Ang-(1–9) were not affected to any major extent in the mMCP-4–/– cell cultures. However, the addition of CPA inhibitor resulted in essentially complete inhibition of the formation of Ang-(1–9), indicating that CPA is solely responsible for the generation of this processing product (Fig. 5C). The generation of Ang-(5–10) was virtually undetectable in mMCP-4–/– cell cultures, indicating that the formation of this peptide is critically dependent on mMCP-4. Addition of CPA inhibitor to wt cells resulted in a large increase in the accumulation of Ang-(5–10), probably explained by an involvement of CPA in downstream processing of generated Ang-(5–10). Similar to Ang-(1–9), the generation of Ang-(1–7) was completely inhibited by the CPA inhibitor, indicating that CPA is essential for its generation (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, Ang-(1–7) was accumulated at markedly higher levels in conditioned medium from mMCP-4–/– mice than in wt counterparts, a finding possibly explained by the fact that mMCP-4 participates in further processing of this peptide after its generation. Addition of the chymase inhibitors chymostatin or α1-antichymotrypsin to wt cells resulted in effects on the Ang processing patterns that were similar to the effects seen in the mMCP-4-null cell cultures (not shown). Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, did not affect any of the studied processing events, including Ang II formation, indicating that ACE is not operative in this biological system (not shown). Furthermore, we did not see any effect of a selective inhibitor of MC tryptase on any of the parameters studied (not shown). The present study strongly supports a major contribution of MCs in the extravascular generation of Ang II. Moreover, MCs appear to play a major role not only in the generation of Ang II but also in its subsequent degradation. The subsequent degradation of Ang II may indeed be an important process that serves to limit the effects of the generated Ang II in time. Among the various MC proteases it is clear that the chymase mMCP-4 plays a major role in Ang II formation. However, we also provide evidence that MC CPA, an enzyme to which few biological functions have been ascribed previously, can convert Ang I to Ang II, a finding that is also supported by a previous study performed in a purified system (13Goldstein S.M. Kaempfer C.E. Kealey J.T. Wintroub B.U. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 1630-1636Google Scholar). Importantly, neither of these enzymes is itself essential for Ang II formation, but when both of them are inactivated, negligible amounts of Ang II are generated. We can thereby propose a model in which these two MC proteases act in concert during the formation of Ang II and in which the inhibition of either chymase or CPA may be compensated by the other protease. Indeed, it has been proposed previously that MC chymase and CPA, which are both bound to heparin proteoglycan (14Serafin W.E. Katz H.R. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15017-15021Google Scholar), cooperate in the degradation of low density lipoprotein (15Kokkonen J.O. Vartiainen M. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16067-16072Google Scholar). Based on the data obtained in this work we can propose a scheme for extravascular Ang I processing (Fig. 6). CPA hydrolyzes Ang I stepwise from the C terminus, generating Ang-(1–9) followed by Ang II and Ang-(1–7). Ang-(1–9) and Ang II are both rapidly formed, even when mMCP-4 is inactive, indicating that CPA readily hydrolyzes the His9–Leu10 and Phe8–His9 bonds. In contrast, the subsequent formation of Ang-(1–7) is markedly delayed, indicating that the Pro7–Phe8 bond is not an optimal, although feasible, CPA substrate. Clearly, an alternative pathway for Ang II formation is the direct cleavage of the Phe8–His10 bond in Ang I by mMCP-4. Evidence for this pathway was obtained by the finding that Ang II was generated even when CPA was inhibited, but not when both CPA and mMCP-4 are inactivated. Interestingly, the CPA- and mMCP-4-catalyzed pathways appear to generate Ang II by similar kinetics because Ang II is formed at an equal rate when either CPA or mMCP-4 is inhibited. Our data thus show that mMCP-4 indeed cleaves the Phe8–His9 bond of Ang I, leading to the generation of Ang II. It is also apparent that the inactivating Tyr4–Ile5 cleavage occurs in the system, leading to the formation of Ang-(5–10). In contrast to the formation of Ang II, the generation of Ang-(5–10) is exclusively dependent on mMCP-4. These findings are thus in agreement with a recent report in which it was shown by using purified components that mMCP-4 can hydrolyze both the Tyr4–Ile5 and Phe8–His9 bonds (10Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Google Scholar), and thus these results rule out the previous concept that β-chymases such as mMCP-4 exclusively hydrolyze the Tyr4–Ile5 bond. An important issue that was addressed by the present study is the relative contribution of mMCP-4 and other chymotrypsin-like murine proteases in the generation of Ang II. Because MCs express a number of different chymases and, possibly, cathepsin G, it is clear that any of these proteases may have the potential to contribute to net Ang II production. However, our data indicate that mMCP-4 is by far the dominating Ang I converter in the peritoneal cell ex vivo system. On the other hand, we cannot rule out that other MC chymases, such as mMCP-1 (11Saito K. Muto T. Tomimori Y. Imajo S. Maruoka H. Tanaka T. Yamashiro K. Fukuda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 773-777Google Scholar), may be quantitatively important for Ang II formation in other tissue locations. It is important to note that Ang I processing, although entirely dependent on MC proteases, is observed not only when MCs have been activated but also in cultures containing nonactivated MCs. This indicates that mMCP-4 and/or CPA activity is present on the surface of non-activated cells and implicates MCs in the continuous regulation of Ang II levels in extravascular tissues even in the absence of MC-degranulating agents. In fact, we have shown previously that chymase activity is present on the surface of non-activated MCs but that surface-associated chymase activity is markedly increased upon MC activation (16Tchougounova E. Pejler G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2763-2765Google Scholar), findings that are well in agreement with the present observations. Our data thus indicate a key role for MC CPA in the extravascular formation of Ang-(1–9) and Ang-(1–7). Importantly, these peptides are not inert degradation products. On the contrary, they are both highly biologically active with a variety of effects where their antagonistic effects on Ang II formation and function, respectively, are most well known (17Santos R.A. Campagnole-Santos M.J. Andrade S.P. Regul. Pept. 2000; 91: 45-62Google Scholar, 18Snyder R.A. Wintroub B.U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 1-5Google Scholar). MC CPA-catalyzed formation of Ang-(1–9) has been documented previously in a purified system (19Cole K.R. Kumar S. Trong H.L. Woodbury R.G. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 648-655Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that MC CPA produces Ang-(1–7). The generation of these peptides along with Ang II raises important questions regarding the net Ang II effect. Because Ang-(1–9) and Ang-(1–7) both have been reported to antagonize Ang II, the net Ang II response may be determined by the balance between Ang II and its antagonizing peptides, Ang-(1–9) and Ang-(1–7). Clearly, the present study supports an important role for MCs in regulating the balance between these biologically active peptides. In summary, this study provides support for a key role of MCs in the extravascular generation of Ang II and various other Ang I processing products, as well as a major role for MCs in the degradation of the respective peptides. Hence, our data are in agreement with the concept that MC chymase primarily acts in the extravascular formation of Ang II, whereas ACE mainly generates Ang II in the vasculature. Based on the present study we may propose that inhibition of MC chymase could be an important way to limit the actions of Ang II, in addition to the employment of ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, we may propose that additional inhibition of MC CPA could cause an even more effective prevention of Ang II effects."

To identify new protein partners regulating VEGF mRNA stability, we screened a cDNA expression library with an RNA probe corresponding to the entire VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR. We identified the “poly(A)-binding protein-interacting protein 2” (PAIP2) as a new VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR interacting protein. By RNA electromobility shift assays, we showed that PAIP2 binds to two distinct regions of a domain encompassing base 1 to 1280 of the VEGF 3′-UTR. Such in vitro interaction was confirmed using cell extracts in which PAIP2 expression is induced by tetracycline (Tet-on cells). Moreover, we demonstrated by RNA affinity purification as well as by ribonucleoprotein complexes immunoprecipitation, that PAIP2 interacts with VEGF mRNA in vivo. Using an in vitro RNA degradation assay, the half-life of VEGF 3′-UTR was found to be increased by overexpressing PAIP2. PAIP2 stabilizes endogenous VEGF mRNA in Tet-on cells, leading to increased VEGF secretion. Moreover, RNAi-mediated knock-down of PAIP2 significantly reduces the steady-state levels of endogenous VEGF mRNA. We also showed, by in vitro protein-protein interactions and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, that PAIP2 interacts with HuR, an already known VEGF mRNA-binding protein, suggesting cooperation of both proteins for VEGF mRNA stabilization. Hence, PAIP2 appears to be a crucial regulator of VEGF mRNA and as a consequence, any variation in its expression could modulate angiogenesis.

In the absence of sufficient oxygen delivery, organs induce production of angiogenic factors that function to recruit new blood vessels to hypoxic tissues (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol.

Vascular endothelial growth factor is one of the most important regulators of angiogenesis as inactivation of only one allele of its gene leads to embryonic lethality in mice (3Ferrara N.

At the transcriptional level, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is recruited under hypoxia to the VEGF promoter (4Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.-H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell.

Oncogenic transformation also induces activation of VEGF transcription by recruiting AP-2 and Sp1 transcription factors to the proximal region of the promoter (5Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J.

Even if several proteins were shown to interact with the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR, only two proteins have been identified: HuR, a member of the ELAV family (8Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and the ribonucleoprotein hnRNPL (12Shih S.C. Claffey K.P. J. Biol.

Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying VEGF mRNA stability, which is modified under physiological and pathological situations, remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to identify VEGF mRNA protein partners that are essential for the modulation of VEGF mRNA stability. Our screening experiments identified 15 independent clones that interact with the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR. The most strongly interacting clone was the poly(A)-binding protein-interacting protein 2 (PAIP2). At the same time, PAIP2 was identified as a translational repressor by using bicistronic vectors (13Khaleghpour K. Svitkin Y.V. Craig A.W. DeMaria C.T. Deo R.C. Burley S.K. Sonenberg N. Mol.

Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5200-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our study consisted in further analyzing the role of PAIP2 as a modulator of VEGF mRNA expression. Materials—Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs or Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Synthetic oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec. [α-32P]UTP, [α-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dCTP were from Amersham Biosciences. The monoclonal antimyc antibody (9E10) was from Roche and the polyclonal anti-myc antibody was from MBL. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The A431, C6, HeLa, LoVo, PROb, and RasVal-12 cells (15Bonino F. Milanini J. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (1258–1260): 1254-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and containing penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml). S19-R443 cells are a derivative of CCL39 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, which stably express a tetracycline repressor. They were stably transfected with an expression vector encoding a tetracycline inducible myc-tagged PAIP2 (cloned into the pCDNA4/TO/myc-His A vector, Invitrogen) and cultured as described (16Milanini-Mongiat J. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20631-20639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Induction of myc-tagged PAIP2 was obtained by stimulating cells with tetracycline (1 μg/ml). cDNA Library Screening—We screened a mouse testis cDNA library constructed in the λ ZAP Express vector (Stratagene). Nitrocellulose filters soaked in 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were applied to the surface of plates previously inoculated with bacteriophages. Plates were then incubated overnight at 42 °C. Filters were then peeled off the plates and immersed in a large volume of RNA binding buffer containing a final concentration of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml tRNA. After two washes in this binding buffer, radiolabeled RNA transcript (107 cpm) corresponding to the entire human VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR (NCB accession number AF024710), and heparin (5 mg/ml) were added to the filters. After incubation for 1 h with the probe at 30 °C, RNase T1 was added to a final concentration of 1000 units/ml. The filters were then washed five times in RNA binding buffer and autoradiographed. The process of screening and plating was repeated until a homogenous population of positive recombinant bacteriophage was obtained. By using the ExAssist helper phage, a pBK-CMV phagemid vector containing the cDNA of interest was excised from the ZAP Express vector according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cloning of Full-length PAIP2 cDNA—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of human colon carcinoma cell HT29 poly(A)+ RNA, using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase with an oligo(dT) primer. This material was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction amplification. The following oligonucleotides derived from the human PAIP2 (NCB accession number NM_016480) were synthesized and used as primers for the polymerase chain reaction: oligonucleotide 1, 5′-GTGGATCCAAAGATCCAAGTCGCAGCAGTACTAGCCC-3′; and oligonucleotide 2, 5′-TAGTCGACTCAAATATTTCCGTACTTCACCCCAGG-3′. An aliquot of cDNA was amplified in a 50-μl reaction volume with 200 ng of each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Ampli-Taq (Roche Applied Science) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.001% gelatin. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (Biometra) using the following parameters: 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles, followed by an extra cycle with a 10-min extension step at 72 °C. An expected fragment of 381 bp was analyzed by restriction enzymes and sequenced. Plasmid Constructs—The 381-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the full-length PAIP2 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-6P1 and pCMV-Tag3B vectors (Amersham Biosciences and Stratagene, respectively) within BamHI and SalI restriction sites. Both restriction sites were artificially added to the cDNA extremities during the PCR (BamHI site 5′ and SalI site 3′). A DNA fragment of 454 bp was excised from the pCMV-Tag/PAIP2 vector with NotI and ApaI and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pCDNA4/TO/myc-His A vector (Invitrogen). The full-length human HuR cDNA (NCB accession number BC003376) was introduced into the pCMV-Tag3B vector within EcoRI/XhoI sites. The plasmids containing the VEGF 3′-UTR used in RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSA) and RNA degradation assays contain the rat VEGF 3′-UTR (NCB accession number U22372) (6Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The full-length, NsiI, and StuI constructs have been previously described (6Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 11Pagès G. Berra E. Milanini J. Levy A.P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26484-26491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To generate the ΔNsiI construct (nucleotides 1276–2211 of the VEGF 3′-UTR), the full-length construct (in pSP64 poly(A) vector, Promega) was digested with NsiI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, then digested with HindIII (site of the vector), blunted with Klenow and ligated. To generate the ΔStuI construct (nucleotides 864–1276 of the VEGF 3′-UTR), the NsiI construct was digested with HindIII and StuI, blunted with Klenow, and ligated. Preparation of RNA—Cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent buffer (Invitrogen). RNAs were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mouse tissue RNAs were from Clontech. 20 μg of RNA was used for Northern blot analysis and hybridized with the PAIP2 probe (381 bp) or the VEGF probe (640 bp) corresponding to the coding region of mouse VEGF (NCB accession number NM 009505). The 36B4 probe corresponds to the region comprised between bases 683 and 842 of the cDNA coding for the human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (NCB accession number M17885) (17Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cytosolic Extracts, REMSA, and in Vitro RNA Degradation Assay—S19-R443/PAIP2 cells were stimulated or not with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for 4 h. Then, the S100 fraction of cytosolic proteins was prepared as described previously (6Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were synthesized from linearized pSP64 poly(A) 3′-UTR templates (Promega) (6Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) using the SP6 bacteriophage RNA polymerase. For REMSA experiments, radiolabeled RNA transcripts (100,000 cpm/reaction) were combined with GST fusion proteins or GST alone, or S100 extracts (5 μg of cytosolic proteins) from cells stimulated or not with tetracycline, in a previously described binding buffer (6Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and treated for 15 min at room temperature with 100 units of ribonuclease T1 (Roche). When specific or nonspecific competitors were used, they were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with the proteins in binding buffer before the addition of the radiolabeled transcripts. The reaction mixtures were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. For in vitro RNA degradation assays, polyadenylated and radiolabeled RNA transcripts (100,000 cpm/reaction) were incubated with 1 μg of S100 extract from cells stimulated or not with tetracycline. At each time point, an aliquot of the reaction was taken and treated as previously described (11Pagès G. Berra E. Milanini J. Levy A.P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26484-26491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). RNA Affinity Purification—2 μg of in vitro transcribed polyadenylated RNA, corresponding to the NsiI probe or to the full-length Chinese hamster ERK1 mRNA 3′-UTR (18Meloche S. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were incubated with polystyrenelatex beads with dC10T30 oligonucleotides covalently linked to the surface (Oligotex, Qiagen), in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS). After 2 washes in a wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), the RNA-coated beads were incubated with 100 μg of S100 extracts from cells stimulated or not with tetracycline, in the RNA binding buffer used for REMSA experiments, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the beads were extensively washed with RNA binding buffer. Laemmli sample buffer was then added to the beads. Proteins bound to the RNA probe were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using the monoclonal anti-myc antibody described below. Anti-PAIP2 and Anti-HuR Antibodies—Antibodies were generated by Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium), by injecting four times two rabbits with 100 μg of a GST-PAIP2 fusion protein or a GST-HuR fusion protein. Sera were affinity purified using an EAH-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) to which GST-PAIP2 or GST-HuR was coupled. Specific IgG were then eluted with 10 mm glycine, pH 2.8, and neutralized with 20 mm Tris, pH 11. Immunofluorescence—S19-R443/PAIP2 cells expressing inducible myc-tagged PAIP2 were plated on glass coverslips. After tetracycline induction for 12 h, cells were fixed with 3.3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were washed with PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, incubated for 2 h with the first antibody diluted in PBS, 10% fetal calf serum (monoclonal anti-myc, 1/1000), then washed with PBS and incubated with the second antibody (Alexa 594-coupled anti-mouse antibody, Molecular Probes, 1/250). 4′,6-Diamidine dihydrochloride (Roche) was added at the same time to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Coverslips were washed with PBS and distilled water and analyzed with a DMR Leica microscope. Western Blotting—For cell extracts, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and immediately lysed in Laemmli sample buffer. For the extracts derived from mice, tissues were frozen and homogenized with a Polytron in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Protein extracts were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Membranes were incubated with a polyclonal anti-PAIP2 antibody (1/2000) or a monoclonal or polyclonal anti-myc antibody (both 1/1000) and then with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Bound antibody was revealed using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation of Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) Complexes and Analysis by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNP complexes were immunoprecipitated from whole HeLa cells extracts as described below in “Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments.” Briefly, pre-cleared lysates were incubated 2hat4 °C with the anti-PAIP2, an irrelevant antibody, or their respective preimmune sera, prior to incubation with protein A-Sepharose saturated first with tRNA (final concentration of 100 μg/ml). The IgG-protein A-Sepharose beads were spun out and the supernatant was collected. After extensive washes, total RNA was purified from equivalent amounts of the supernatants and input, as well as from all the immunoprecipitated material using guanidinium thiocyanate, phenol, and chloroform, followed by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Each RNA, resuspended in the same volume of RNase-free water, was reverse transcribed with the OmniScript RT kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A PCR amplification of the transcripts was then carried out using the TaqPCR Master mixture kit (Qiagen) and the following primers (5′ to 3′): VEGF, ATGGCAGAAGGAGGGCAGCAT and TTGGTGAGGTTTGATCCGCATCAT; β-actin, GCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGACCCAG and CTCGAAGTCCAGGGCGACGTAGC. Reaction conditions were as follows: 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. For VEGF, 35 cycles were used, for β-actin, 25 cycles. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Measurement of VEGF mRNA Half-life—S19-R443/PAIP2 cells expressing inducible myc-tagged PAIP2 were stimulated or not with tetracycline for 4 h prior to the addition of DRB (25 μg/ml). Total RNAs were prepared at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after the addition of DRB. Determination of Protein Synthesis—S19-R443/PAIP2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates, supplemented with [3H]leucine (l-[2,3,4 5-3H]leucine; 2 mCi/ml, 0.8 mm final concentration), and incubated with or without tetracycline for 4 h, in the absence or presence of cycloheximide (5 μg/ml). Cells were then fixed and washed twice with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%). The precipitated material was solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. ELISA of Secreted VEGF—S19-R443 control cells or S19-R443/PAIP2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated with or without tetracycline for 48 h. 2 h before the end of the tetracycline stimulation, cells were treated with heparin (50 μg/ml). Cell culture supernatants were then collected and the cells were counted. Determination of the VEGF concentration of all supernatants was carried out using an ELISA kit Quantikine Mouse VEGF Immunoassay (R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's guidelines. We tested that this assay recognizes both mouse VEGF and hamster VEGF, without cross-reactivity to various cytokines or growth factors. RNA Interference Experiments—The following 21-mer oligoribonucleotides and their reverse sequence were synthesized by Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium). Two independent small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were designed in homologous regions of hamster/human/mouse PAIP2 cDNA. The first one is 5′-GGCUCUUCUCUGGAAGAUCTT-3′ and corresponds to the coding region 295–313 relative to the first nucleotide of the human PAIP2 complete cDNA (NCB accession number NM_016480). The second one is 5′-GAUCUUGUGGUCAAGAGCATT-3′ and corresponds to the coding region 310–328 of the human PAIP2 complete cDNA. The siRNA sequence targeting the coding region 477–495 relative to the first nucleotide of the EGFP complete cDNA and used as an irrelevant siRNA is the following: 5′-GAACGGCAUCAAGGUGAACTT-3′. The two RNA strands were mixed in equimolar ratios and annealed by heating to 95 °C for 1 min and then to 37 °C for 1 h. A431, HeLa, and S19-R443 cells were transiently transfected twice at a 24-h interval, with 50 nm siRNA against PAIP2, using the calcium phosphate method. 48 h following the second transfection, cells were lysed and analyzed either by Western blotting for PAIP2 expression or by Northern blotting for VEGF mRNA expression. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interactions—1 μg of pCMV-Tag3B/HuR was used for in vitro T3-driven transcription and translation performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega) with [35S]methionine as the radioactive tracer amino acid in a final volume of 50 μl. For binding experiments, 20 μl of the reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of immobilized GST or GST-PAIP2 fusion protein in the presence of 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the unbound fraction was removed and the beads were washed five times with a buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA. The bound proteins were then eluted by boiling in gel sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. 2 μlofthe in vitro translated reaction were loaded on the gel to evaluate the proportion of the radiolabeled protein that was “pull downed” with GST-PAIP2. The gel was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and immediately lysed in a buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. 2 mg of protein extract per condition were pre-cleared with preimmune sera, specific for each antibody used, prior to incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-PAIP2 antibody, anti-HuR antibody, or an irrelevant antibody. For cell extracts treated with RNase A, they were incubated with RNase A (0.1 μg/mg of protein extracts) for 1 h at 4 °C, after the pre-clearing step and prior to incubation with the different antibodies. Protein A-Sepharose beads saturated first in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin were added to the reaction mixture for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes with lysis buffer, Laemmli buffer was added to the beads, and protein complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A GST-PAIP2 Fusion Protein Interacts with the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR in Vitro—To identify proteins interacting with the VEGF 3′-UTR, we screened an expression mouse testis cDNA library with a [32P]UTP-radiolabeled RNA probe corresponding to the full-length VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR. We obtained several clones, the hybridization of which resisted RNase T1 treatment. The relative affinity of the different clones was evaluated by the intensity of hybridization of the VEGF probe to the λ phage plaques. Moreover, total protein extracts from bacteria obtained with the rescued phagemid vectors (see “Experimental Procedures”), stimulated or not with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, were used in REMSA. The intensity of complexes obtained with identical amounts of protein extracted from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-stimulated bacteria, also allowed us to measure the relative affinity for the VEGF RNA probe of the different proteins obtained during the screening. Thus, we selected the clone interacting with the strongest affinity with the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR. This corresponded to a partial cDNA encoding PAIP2. paip2, located on chromosome 5, is organized into 4 exons, 3 of which include coding sequences. To confirm the PAIP2/VEGF mRNA interaction in vitro, the full-length PAIP2 cDNA was cloned into the pGEX-6P1 vector to obtain a GST-PAIP2 fusion protein. GST-PAIP2 was incubated with the radiolabeled transcript corresponding to the entire rat VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR and the PAIP2-RNA complex formation was visualized by REMSA. Fig. 1B shows that GST-PAIP2 but not GST alone interacts with the entire VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR (full-length probe). HuR, a member of the ELAV protein family, previously shown to interact with the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR (8Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control (the HuR binding site on VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR is shown in Fig. 1A). It is noteworthy that, for the same amount of fusion protein used, protein-RNA complexes obtained with GST-PAIP2 and GST-HuR display equivalent intensities. The same results were obtained using an unpolyadenylated probe corresponding to the full-length VEGF 3′-UTR (data not shown). By deletion analysis (Fig. 1A), we have restricted the interacting region to a domain comprised between bases 1 and 1280 of the VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR (NsiI probe) (figure 1B). The complementary region of the 3′-UTR (bases 1276 to 2211, ΔNsiI probe) does not bind PAIP2 (data not shown). We then focused on the NsiI domain and divided it into two complementary regions: StuI and ΔStuI. Fig. 1B shows that GST-PAIP2 interacts with both regions, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, this interaction can be completely inhibited by competition with a ×100 molar excess of unlabeled specific probe (Fig. 1B). The same molar excess of unlabeled nonspecific probe does not inhibit the PAIP2 interaction (data not shown), demonstrating the specificity of the binding. Expression of PAIP2 in Different Tissues and Tumor Cell Lines—PAIP2 transcript expression was examined by Northern blotting of mouse and human tissues as well as of different tumor cell lines (Fig. 2A). In human tissues, PAIP2 mRNA is mainly expressed in brain and lung, whereas in mouse tissues, the most abundant expression of the PAIP2 transcript is detected in testis and heart. These striking differences in PAIP2 mRNA levels between human and mouse, and particularly in the brain, might illustrate a differential transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation of PAIP2 expression between both species. Among the different tumor cell lines examined, HeLa cells contain the highest level o"
https://openalex.org/W2159929445,"Human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a ubiquitously expressed type II transmembrane serine protease. It cleaves the penultimate positioned prolyl bonds at the N terminus of physiologically important peptides such as the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. In this study, we have characterized different active site mutants. The Y547F mutant as well as the catalytic triad mutants S630A, D708A, and H740L showed less than 1% wild type activity.

CD26, EC 3.4.14.5) is a human serine protease belonging to the S9b protein family, which was first identified by Hopsu-Havu and Glenner (1Hopsu-Havu V.K. Glenner G.G. Histochemie. 1966; 7: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) as glycylproline β-naphthylamidase. It is characterized by an unusual ability to cleave prolyl peptide bonds at penultimate positions at the N terminus and exists both as a type II integral transmembrane lipid raft-associated glycoprotein and as a soluble 210–290-kDa homodimeric form (2Abbott C.A.

Many peptides have been identified as DPP-IV substrates in vitro and in vivo, including chemokines, neuropeptides, and incretin hormones, and DPP-IV has therefore been proposed as an important regulator of different physiological and pathophysiological conditions (5Mentlein R. Regul. Pept. 1999; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). There is a considerable pharmaceutical interest in DPP-IV, because the enzyme has been shown to inactivate the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide in vivo (6Holst J.J. Deacon C.F. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 7Holst J.J. Orskov C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 2001; 234: 75-85Google Scholar). This makes DPP-IV an important regulator of glucose homeostasis, as glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide have glucose-dependent insulinotropic as well as neogenetic effects on the pancreatic β-cells. The use of DPP-IV inhibitors in diabetes is being explored, and the first short term treatments of diabetes mellitus type 2 patients with DPP-IV inhibitors have demonstrated clinical proof of the concept (8Ahren B. Simonsson E. Larsson H. Landin-Olsson M. Torgeirsson H. Jansson P.A. Sandqvist M. Bavenholm P. Efendic S. Eriksson J.W. Dickinson S. Holmes D.

Metab. 2004; 89: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The published crystal structure of human recombinant DPP-IV in complex with the substrate analog valine pyrrolidide (ValPyr) (Fig. 1) has revealed many important details regarding the inhibitor binding in the active site cavity, which by analogy illustrate substrate binding (10Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The active site is positioned in a large cavity, formed at the interface of an α/β hydrolase domain and an eight-bladed β-propeller domain. The catalytic triad has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis in mouse DPP-IV, which by homology corresponds to Ser630, Asp708, and His740 in human DPP-IV (11Marguet D. Bernard A.M. Vivier I. Darmoul D. Naquet P. Pierres M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2200-2208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic triad is arranged in a topological fold and sequential order, which defines the α/β hydrolase domain. Furthermore, the catalytically essential Ser630 is located in a so-called “nucleophile elbow” consisting of the sequence Gly628–Trp629–Ser630–Tyr631-Gly632, a consensus sequence characteristic for all serine peptidases in the SC clan, i.e. GX1SX2G (12Bernard A.M. Mattei M.G. Pierres M. Marguet D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15204-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Abbott C.A. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. McCaughan G.W. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure determinations have suggested detailed information of the catalytic mechanism of DPP-IV. For example, we now understand the essential function of the residues Glu205 and Glu206 for coordination of the N-terminal amine of the substrate, which had been demonstrated by use of site-directed mutagenesis (14Abbott C.A. McCaughan G.W. Gorrell M.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, the residues Arg125 and Asn710 appear essential for coordination of the carbonyl of the N-terminal amino acid residue of the substrate and, together with the two glutamates, align the substrate optimally for the nucleophilic attack by Ser630. A negatively charged tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate is generated in the transition state and is stabilized by a so-called oxyanion hole. This is a recognized mechanism among serine proteases. Based on analysis of the structure and sequence alignment to the homolog S9 protein family member prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), this oxyanion hole has been suggested to be formed via hydrogen bonding to Tyr547-OH and the backbone NH of Tyr631 (10Rasmussen H.B.

Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the oxyanion stabilization of DPP-IV catalysis by removing the hydroxyl group of Tyr547 by means of site-specific mutagenesis to the phenylalanine equivalent. The kinetic data of the Y547F mutant show that Tyr547 is essential for DPP-IV catalysis. Determination and comparison of the crystal structures of (i) the mutant Y547F, (ii) a complex between DPP-IV and the covalent inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), and (iii) the apo forms of DPP-IV (in-house as well as previously published) confirm the oxyanion stabilizing role of the hydroxyl group of Tyr547 in the catalytic mechanism of DPP-IV. In addition, these results suggest that the inhibitory mechanism of the pharmacologically important class of DPP-IV inhibitors, the 2-cyanopyrrolidines, is conducted via proton acceptance from Tyr547 resulting in stable covalent complexes. Bioinformatics—Analyses of the structure of recombinant human DPP-IV were performed using the Quanta software (Accelrys Inc.). The Vector NTI Suite 6.0 (InforMax Inc.) was used for sequence analysis, gene alignments, and primer design. Chemicals and Reagents—QIAprep Miniprep System and Qiaex Gel Extraction II kits were purchased from Qiagen (San Diego). The baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 was from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody clones MA2600 and MA261 were from Endogen (Rockford, IL) and Bender MedSystems (Vienna, Austria), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG was from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) and High5 insect cells were grown in Grace Insect medium supplemented with fetal calf serum ranging from 0 to 10%, yeastolate, 20 mm l-glutamine, and 0.25 μg/ml gentamycin in either tissue culture flasks or glass spinner bottles at 28 °C. Chromatographic columns and materials (CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B matrix, MonoQ ion-exchange column, and Q-Sepharose high performance resin) were from Amersham Biosciences. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) protein was from Roche Applied Science. DFP was from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis of DPP-IV—Introduction of point mutations in the recombinant human DPP-IV baculovirus transfer vector CD5/DPP-IV-pBlueBac4.5 (see Ref. 10Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) was performed using the Quick-Change™ Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The following primers were used for introduction of mutations (forward primers are shown): Y547F, 5′-GAA ATA TCC TCT ACT ATT AGA TGT GTTTGC AGG CCC ATG TAG TC; S630A, 5′-TTT GGG GCT GGG CAT ATG GAG GGT A; D708A, 5′-TTC ATG GAA CAG CAGCTG ATA ACG TTC; H740L, 5′-GGT ATA CTG ATG AAG ACCTTG GAA TAG C with underlined sequences indicating the point of mutation. DNA Sequencing—DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 310 DNA Analyzer using ABI PRISM® BigDYE™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction from Applied Biosystems. Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus—Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed using the derived Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus Bac-N-Blue™ DNA and the transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 from Invitrogen. Purified transfer vectors with recombinant inserts were mixed with Bac-N-Blue™ DNA and transfected into Sf9 cells using either Lipofectin® (Invitrogen) or Cellfectin® (Invitrogen). Virus isolates were plaque-purified according to the manufacturer's instructions and amplified in Sf9 cells for production of 100% recombinant baculovirus high titer stocks. Quantification of DPP-IV Protein—DPP-IV quantifications and interactions with ADA were analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Maxisorp 96-well plates (Merck) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of ADA per well in PBS, washed twice in PBS, blocked for 1–2 h in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 (blocking buffer), and washed twice in PBS. The coated plates were then incubated with increasing amounts of DPP-IV containing insect cell supernatants for 1–2 h followed by two successive washes with PBS. Bound DPP-IV was detected by incubation for 1–2 h with a primary mouse anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody (either MA2600 or MA261 at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in blocking buffer). After three washes with PBS, bound antibody was detected by incubation for 1–2 h with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugate, diluted in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The wells were washed six times with PBS and developed using ortho-phenylenediamine and hydrogen peroxide according to the manufacturer's instructions (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Optical densities were read at 450 nm. Purified DPP-IV was used as a standard and displayed reproducible linearity in the range of 0–2 μg/ml (R2 > 0.9). Purification of Recombinant Human DPP-IV—Recombinant human DPP-IV protein secreted into High5 insect cell supernatants was purified using ADA affinity chromatography as described previously (19de Meester I. Vanhoof G. Lambeir A.M. Scharpe S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 189: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified ADA was chemically coupled to a CNBr-activated Sepharose matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The ADA affinity column and a Q-Sepharose High Performance column were interconnected on an Äkta Purifier flow pressure chromatographic system. High5 cell supernatant with expressed protein was applied for direct elution from the ADA affinity column onto the Q-Sepharose High Performance column. Before applying to columns, supernatants were centrifuged (15–20,000 × g) and filtered (0.45 μm), and pH and conductivity were adjusted to pH 8 and 17–20 mS cm-1. A final purification was performed using a MonoQ ion-exchange column. Pooled fractions were concentrated on Centriprep YM10 and Centricon YM10 from Millipore Corp. Protein contents were determined by UV280 nm spectroscopy and instantly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or in a dry ice ethanol bath. Enzymatic Activity Assays—Enzymatic activity was determined kinetically at room temperature in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer using different p-nitroanilide (pNA) substrates, including Ala-Ala-Pro-pNa, succinyl-Ala-pNa, Arg-Pro-pNa, Asp-Pro-pNa, Ala-Pro-pNa, Val-Pro-pNa, Gly-Pro-pNa, Gly-Gly-pNa, Ala-Phe-pNa, and Ala-Ala-pNA (Sigma or Bachem, Bubendorf, Germany). Released pNA was determined at 450 or 405 nm, and incubations were performed for 60 min with absorbance measurements every 5 min. To determine steady-state Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters, different concentrations of putative substrates were used. Enzyme rates (mOD/min) were used for determination of Km and Vmax values by direct fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation: V′ = ([S] × Vmax)/([S] + Km). At least triplicate measurements were used for all kinetic determinations. Crystallization Conditions—DPP-IV crystals were grown essentially as described previously (10Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Purified recombinant human DPP-IV in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl was mixed with equal amounts of a reservoir containing 0.4 m sodium acetate, 16–19% w/v PEG4000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.6. Prior to data collection, crystals were soaked in 0.4 m sodium acetate, 35% w/v PEG4000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.6, and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream. Prior to crystallization of the DFP complex, DPP-IV was mixed with DFP in a molar ratio of 1:10. Crystallographic Data Collection and Handling—Crystallographic data collection was performed at the synchrotron beamlines MaxLab 711 (Lund, Sweden), ESRF ID 14-4 (Grenoble, France) and on an in-house rotating anode Rigaku RU300. Data reductions were performed with the HKL2000 software package (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38251) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using wild type DPP-IV as a search model (Protein Data Bank code 1N1M). Model building was performed using Quanta software (Accelrys Inc.) and iterative refinement (initially performed as a rigid body refinement) using CNX (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). Structure validation and handling were performed with Procheck (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and Moleman. 2G. J. Kleywegt, unpublished information. Structural and Sequence Analysis of the Active Site of DPP-IV—The hydroxyl group of the side chain of Tyr547 is coordinated via a water molecule to the hydroxyl group of Ser630 (Fig. 1) and has, together with the main chain NH of Tyr631, been suggested as a stabilizer of the oxyanion intermediate during catalysis (10Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To test the catalytic effect of the hydroxyl group, the Y547F mutant variant lacking the para-positioned hydroxyl group was constructed. The catalytic triad residues have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis in mouse DPP-IV (11Marguet D. Bernard A.M. Vivier I. Darmoul D. Naquet P. Pierres M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2200-2208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bernard A.M. Mattei M.G. Pierres M. Marguet D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15204-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by homology to Ser630, Asp708, and His740 in human DPP-IV. The mutant variants S630A, D708A, and H740L were included in this study as controls. Expression and Characterization of DPP-IV Mutants—The DPP-IV mutants were generated using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method directly in CD5/DPP-IV-pBlueBac. This construct encodes a soluble recombinant human form of DPP-IV lacking the cytosolic and transmembrane domains. The open reading frame of this construct is fused to the leader secretion signal of CD5. Thus, expressed protein is secreted to the cell supernatants after post-translational modifications. All DPP-IV mutated constructs were verified for PCR-introduced sequence errors by complete DNA sequencing. High titer baculovirus stocks produced in Sf9 insect cells were used for expression studies in High5 insect cells (multiplicity of infection >1). Expression levels were analyzed for intracellular levels by use of SDS-PAGE-Coomassie (Fig. 2A) and for secreted protein to cell supernatant by use of an ADA-sandwich ELISA. From SDS-PAGE analysis of total cell lysates, protein bands with an electrophoretic mobility equal to purified DPP-IV were observed and interpreted as DPP-IV expressed protein. No protein bands with similar electrophoretic mobility could be observed with insect cell expression controls. Intracellular DPP-IV protein accounted for ∼10–30% of total cellular protein (∼20–60 μg/106 cells). The level of secreted protein in the cell supernatants was significantly lower compared with intracellular DPP-IV (i.e. 0.5–5 μg per ml ∼1–10% of intracellular amounts assuming ∼106 cells/ml supernatant). Sandwich ELISA titration of the cell supernatants indicated that the secreted mutant DPP-IV proteins bound to ADA and anti-human CD26 monoclonal antibodies. Altogether, these data verified that structurally intact DPP-IV mutants had been expressed. Only cell-secreted DPP-IV was used for further studies. All DPP-IV mutants were normalized directly in the cell supernatants to three different protein concentrations (i.e. 0.11, 0.16, and 0.54 μm) by using ELISA, and enzymatic activity levels were characterized at these concentrations by using substrate analogs (Table I). The three catalytic triad mutants S630A, D708A, and H740L exhibited less than 1% specific activity compared with wild type DPP-IV. Surprisingly, the Y547F mutant showed equally low specific activity as the catalytic triad mutants.Table IKinetic data on DPP-IV mutants measured on cell supernatants using GlyPro-pNAMutationVmaxKmSpecific activityΔmOD/minmm% wild typeWild type4.1 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.4100D708ANDaND, not determinedND<1bSignificantly lower when compared with wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)H740LNDND<1bSignificantly lower when compared with wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)S630ANDND<1bSignificantly lower when compared with wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)Y547FNDND<1bSignificantly lower when compared with wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)a ND, not determinedb Significantly lower when compared with wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005) Open table in a new tab Purification and Characterization of Wild Type and Y547F DPP-IV—Wild type DPP-IV and the Y547F variant were expressed in large scale (>2 liters of insect cell supernatants) and purified by a three-step procedure using interlinked ADA-coupled Sepharose affinity- and Q-Sepharose HP chromatography followed by MonoQ ion-exchange chromatography. The purified products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, showing more than 99% purity (Fig. 2B). Kinetically, kcat dropped for the Y547F mutant by ∼50-fold by using the putative substrate Gly-Pro-pNA, whereas Km values increased ∼30-fold compared with wild type, resulting in an overall drop of more than 1,500-fold for the second-order rate constant kcat/Km (Fig. 3 and Table II). Similar results were obtained with other substrate analogs, showing no differences in substrate specificity as a result of the mutation.Table IIKinetic data on purified Y547F and wild type obtained for GlyPro-pNAVmaxKmkcatkcat/KmΔμmol min-1 mg-1mms-1m-1 s-1WT198 ± 211.43 ± 0.23279,000 ± 29,500∼195,000,000Y547F3.9 ± 0.1aSignificantly different when compared with purified wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)44.08 ± 0.01aSignificantly different when compared with purified wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)5,560 ± 110aSignificantly different when compared with purified wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)∼128,000aSignificantly different when compared with purified wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005)a Significantly different when compared with purified wild type DPP-IV values as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.005) Open table in a new tab X-ray Crystallography Structure Determination—The x-ray crystal structures of the apoDPP-IV, the complex DFP·DPP-IV, and the DPP-IV mutant Y547F were determined.

Superimposition of C α trace of the dimer structure of wild type DPP-IV and the Y547F mutant showed a root mean square of 0.86 Å2 (1530 C α atoms). Thus, the decreased enzyme activity of the Y547F mutant was not a result of an active site collapse and/or conformational changes within the active site or the whole protein as such. Inspection of the electron density of the mutated residue revealed a strongly defined phenylalanine, positioned exactly as the phenyl moiety of the tyrosine residue (Fig. 4, A and B). Most interesting, coordination of a water molecule (Wat123, see Fig. 4A) by the tyrosine was observed in different apo structures (previously published human DPP-IV (Protein Data Bank code 1PFQ (24Oefner C.

In one of the previously published human apo structures (Protein Data Bank code 1NU6 (27Thoma R. Loffler B. Stihle M. Huber W. Ruf A. Hennig M.

Besides Tyr547-OH, this water molecule coordinates Ser630-OH, main chain NH of Tyr631, and a neighboring water molecule, making it part of a network of water molecules within the active site cavity. The DPP-IV·ValPyr complex (Protein Data Bank code1N1M (10Rasmussen H.B. Branner S. Wiberg F.C. Wagtmann N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar)) also has a water molecule at the same position. The structure of the complex between DPP-IV and DFP showed that the irreversible organophosphorous inhibitor was covalently bound to the active serine. The C α trace as well as the active site residues of the DFP-DPP-IV structure aligned completely to the comparable structural elements of the apo and Y547F structures. The complex forms a tetrahedral arrangement that mimics the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate formed during substrate catalysis (Fig. 4C). The oxygen of the P=O moiety forms hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group of Tyr547 and to the main chain NH of Tyr631, thus positioning it spatially between the side chains of Tyr547 and Ser630 close to the position of the water molecule Wat123 in the apo structure. In this study, we have shown that the residue Tyr547 of DPP-IV is essential for catalysis. The analysis of the mutant structure as well as the apo and DFP complex of DPP-IV supports the suggestion that the role of Tyr547 is to stabilize the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate. Exchanging Tyr547 with phenylalanine resulted in a vast drop in activity of the same magnitude as alanine/leucine muta"
https://openalex.org/W2103148292,"Abstract The outer membrane adhesins of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 that mediate attach and efface intestinal lesions are classified as intimin α, β, and γ, respectively. Each of these intimin types binds to its cognate, bacterially encoded receptor (called Tir for translocated intimin receptor) to promote tight adherence of the organism to the host-cell plasma membrane. We previously reported that γ intimin of EHEC O157:H7 also bound to a eucaryotic receptor that we determined was nucleolin. The objective of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo the interactions of intimins α, β, and γ with nucleolin in the presence of Tir from EHEC O157:H7. Protein binding experiments demonstrated that intimin of types α, β, and γ bound nucleolin with similar affinity. Moreover, all three intimin types co-localized with regions of nucleolin expressed on the surface of HEp-2 cells. When intimin α, β, or γ bound to Tir in vitro, the intimin interaction with nucleolin was blocked. Both Tir and nucleolin accumulated beneath intimin-presenting bacteria that had attached to the surface of HEp-2 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that nucleolin is involved in bacterial adherence promoted by all intimin types and that Tir and nucleolin compete for intimin during adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2120975383,"Sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids (gangliosides) have been implicated in the regulation of various biological phenomena such as atherosclerosis. Recent report suggests that exogenously supplied disialoganglioside (GD3) serves a dual role in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) proliferation and apoptosis. However, the role of the GD3 synthase gene in VSMC responses has not yet been elucidated. To determine whether a ganglioside is able to modulate VSMC growth, the effect of overexpression of the GD3 synthase gene on DNA synthesis was examined. The results show that the overexpression of this gene has a potent inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis and ERK phosphorylation in cultured VSMC in the presence of PDGF. The suppression of the GD3 synthase gene was correlated with the down-regulation of cyclinE/CDK2, the up-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p21 and blocking of the p27 inhibition, whereas up-regulation of p53 as the result of GD3 synthase gene expression was not observed. Consistently, blockade of GD3 function with anti-GD3 antibody reversed VSMC proliferation and cell cycle proteins. The expression of the GD3 synthase gene also led to the inhibition of TNF-α-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in VSMC as determined by zymography and immunoblot. Furthermore, GD3 synthase gene expression strongly decreased MMP-9 promoter activity in response to TNF-α. This inhibition was characterized by the down-regulation of MMP-9, which was transcriptionally regulated at NF-κB and activation protein-1 (AP-1) sites in the MMP-9 promoter. Finally, the overexpression of MMP-9 in GD3 synthase transfectant cells rescued VSMC proliferation. However, MMP-2 overexpression was not affected by cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the GD3 synthase gene represents a physiological modulator of VSMC responses that may contribute to plaque instability in atherosclerosis.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9929) Google Scholar). It is widely believed that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (2Ahn H.Y. Hadizadeh K.R. Seul C. Yun Y.P. Vetter H. Sachinidis A. Mol.

PDGF induces the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), a key transducer of extracellular signals that promotes cell growth and movement, which are critical for the initiation and progression of vascular lesions (4Ross R.

Reidy M.A. Benditt E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4600-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). After injury to the vessel, SMC migrates into the intimal layer of the arterial wall, where they leave their quiescent state and reenter the cell cycle (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9929) Google Scholar). In many cells, transit through G1 of the cell cycle and entry into the S phase requires the binding and activation of cyclin-CDK complexes, a process in which cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 play major roles (7Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar, 8Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4943) Google Scholar). The kinase activities of the cyclin-CDK complexes are negatively regulated by CDK inhibitors, such as p21 and p27 (9Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D.

Polyclonal antibody to cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4, p21, p53, and p27 were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal MMP-9 antibody was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody was from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan).Cell Cultures—Mouse aortic smooth muscle cells were obtained from young (4-month-old) male rat aortas by enzymatic digestion, as previously described in detail (38Moon S.K. Thompson L.J. Madamanchi N. Ballinger S. Papaconstantinou J. Horaist C. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For most experiments, cells at 80-90% confluence were made quiescent by incubation for 72 h in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum.Plasmid Construction and Cell Transfection—To obtain the full-length cDNA of GD3 synthase, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the SuperScript™ preamplification kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 5 μg of total RNA from human adult brains (Clontech, PaloAlto, CA). The full-length cDNA was obtained by PCR with first-strand cDNA as a template using a 5′-primer containing a HindIII site, 5′-CTAAGCTTATGGCTGTACTG GCGTGGAAGTTCCCGCGG-3′ and a 3′-primer containing a XhoI site, 5′-ATCTCGAGTCCTAGGAAGTGGGCTGGAGTGAGGTATCTTC-3′. PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 60 s, 35 cycle of 94 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product (1.1 kb) was cloned into pT7Blue(R) T-vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison) and determined by DNA sequencing. The inserted fragment (1.1 kb) was cut by digestion with HindIII and XhoI, and then inserted into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which was designated pcDNA3-GD3.VSMC were transfected with pcDNA3-GD3 or pcDNA3 (no insert) in 100-mm dishes using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were split at a 1:5 dilution and exposed for 2-3 weeks in G418 (Roche Applied Science)-containing medium (800 μg/ml), and the resulting colonies were selected based on their resistance to G418. The expression of GD3 synthase was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against GD3 (Sigma).Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Cells from culture experiments were scraped and lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated by chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Two micrograms of total RNA from each sample were treated with DNase I (Promega), reverse-transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Promega), and PCR-amplified quantitatively for GD3 synthase gene expression with a Taqman sequence detection assay (PE Biosystems). In this assay, we used primers (5′-GAGCATGTGGTATGACGGGGA-3′ and 5′-CCTCAAAGATGGCTCTGTTCCTGT-3′) to detect the specific GD3 synthase gene PCR product as it accumulates during PCR at the 60 °C annealing temperature. Similarly, the same RNA samples were PCR-amplified for β-actin, and the GD3 synthase gene expression was normalized to the β-actin.[3H]Thymidine Incorporation—For [3H]thymidine uptake experiments, SMC were grown to near confluence in 24-well tissue culture plates and then made quiescent and treated with 10% FBS, as indicated. Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h and labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 1 μCi/ml during the last 24 h of this time period. After labeling, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and then washed with 95% ethanol. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was extracted in 0.2 m NaOH and measured by liquid scintillation counter as previously described (20Moon S.K. Cho G.O. Jung S.Y. Gal S.W. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.C. Madamanchi N.R.

Patterson C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ.

Thompson L.J. Madamanchi N. Ballinger S. Papaconstantinou J. Horaist C. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The method is based on the quantification of the enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasm by means of a Cell Death Detection ELISA kit. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells in 100 μl of DMEM were incubated as indicated. The cells were lysed and centrifuged. The supernatant containing cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments was transferred to a microplate coated with streptavidin and then reacted with a mixture of anti-histone antibodies labeled with biotin and anti-DNA antibodies coupled to peroxidase. The peroxidase substrate was then added, and color development was read photometrically at 405 nm against 490 nm as the background. The specific enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm was expressed as an enrichment factor compared with the control.Cell Cycle Analysis (FACS)—Cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at -20 °C. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with RNase and DNA intercalating dye propidium iodide, and cell cycle phase analysis was performed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACStar flow cytometer and Becton Dickinson cell fit software.Immunoblotting—Growth-arrested VSMCs were treated with 10% FBS for the specified time periods at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Moon S.K. Cho G.O. Jung S.Y. Gal S.W. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.C. Madamanchi N.R. Kim C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 38Moon S.K. Thompson L.J. Madamanchi N. Ballinger S. Papaconstantinou J. Horaist C. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Immune Complex Kinase Assays—Cell lysates were prepared with ice-cold lysis buffer (containing, in mm/l, HEPES [pH 7.5] 50, NaCl 150, EDTA 1, EGTA 2.5, DTT 1, β-glycerophosphate 10, NaF 1, Na3VO4 0.1, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1, and 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween-20, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin) and sonicated at 4 °C (Micro ultrasonic cell disrupter (from KONTES), 30% power, two times for 10 s each time). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were precipitated by treatment with protein A-Sepharose beads precoated with saturating amounts of the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h. When monoclonal antibodies were used, protein A-Sepharose was pretreated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The immunoprecipitated proteins on the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with a kinase buffer (containing, in mm/liter, HEPES 50, MgCl2 10, DTT 1, β-glycerophosphate 10, NaF 1, and sodium orthovanadate 0.1). The final pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing either 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pRb C-terminal (pRb amino acids 769-921) fusion protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μg of histone H1 (Invitrogen), 20 μm/liter ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (4500 μCi/mmol; ICN) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with occasional mixing. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 2× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The migration of histone H1 or GST-pRb was determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphorylated pRb and histone H1 were visualized.Zymography—Conditioned medium and cell lysates were electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. The gel was then washed at room temperature for 2 h with 2.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently in a buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 37 °C overnight. The gel was stained with 0.2% Coomassie Blue and photographed with a light box. Proteolysis was detected as a white zone in a dark blue field.MMP-9 Promoter Activity—A 0.7-kb segment at the 5′-flanking region of the human MMP-9 gene was amplified by PCR using specific primers from the human MMP-9 gene (GenBank™ accession no. D10051): 5′-ACATTTGCCCGAGCTCCTGAAG(forward/SacI) and 5′-AGGGGCTGCCAGAAGCTTATGGT (reverse/HindIII). The pGL2-Basic vector containing a polyadenylation signal upstream from the luciferase gene was used to construct expression vectors by subcloning PCR-amplified DNA of the MMP-9 promoter into the SacI/HindIII site of the pGL2-Basic vector. The PCR products were confirmed by their size as determined by electrophoresis and by DNA sequencing. The MMP-9 promoter plasmid was transfected VSMC using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess the MMP-9 promoter luciferase, cells were collected and disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatants were tested for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activities were standardized for β-galactosidase activity.Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (20Moon S.K. Cho G.O. Jung S.Y. Gal S.W. Kwon T.K. Lee Y.C. Madamanchi N.R. Kim C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Moon S.K. Cha B.Y. Kim C.H. J. Cell Physiol. 2004; 198: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and suspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 15 min on ice, the cells were vortexed in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was then collected by centrifugation and extracted in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extract (2 μg) was preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min with a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide spanning the -79 MMP-9 cis-element of interest. The sequences were as follows: AP-1, CTGACCCCTGAGTCAGCACTT; NF-κB, CAGTGGAATTCCCCAGCC. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min in a buffer (25 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.05 m NaCl, and 2.5% glycerol) with 2 μg of poly(dI/dC) and 5 fmol (2 × 104 cpm) of a Klenow end-labeled ([32P]ATP) 30-mer oligonucleotide, which spans the DNA binding site in the MMP-9 promoter. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed at 4 °C in a 6% polyacrylamide gel using a TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) running buffer. The gel was rinsed with water, dried, and exposed to x-ray film overnight.RESULTSGD3 Synthase Gene Overexpression Inhibits DNA Synthesis in VSMC—To examine the role of GD3 in PDGF-mediated VSMC, VSMC were transfected with a cDNA (GD3) encoding GD3 synthase gene or an identical empty vector lacking a cDNA insert as a control (EV). Stable cell clones were selected by adding G418, at a concentration of 400 μg/ml to the culture medium. As an additional control, parental cells (Un) were evaluated in an identical manner. Expression of GD3 synthase gene was verified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblot (Fig. 1, A and B). We evaluated the effects of GD3 synthase gene overexpression on VSMC proliferation in response to PDGF. PDGF-mediated DNA synthesis was measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation. PDGF induced significant increases in DNA synthesis in both parental and EV-transfected VSMC (Fig. 1C). However, GD3-synthase transfectants almost blocked the PDGF-induced increase in DNA synthesis.GD3 Synthase Gene Induces G1Cell Cycle Arrest—Cell DNA content was measured by FACS to determine the cell cycle distribution under various culture conditions. To synchronize the cell cycle, cells were initially deprived of FBS for 24 h and subsequently incubated with PDGF for 24 h. GD3 synthase transfectant cells showed no change in cell cycle distribution compared with the EV transfectant cells in the absence of 10% FBS (Fig. 2B, panels a and c). When stimulated by PDGF, the GD3 synthase transfectants exhibited a significantly increased the cells arrested in G0/G1 stages, whereas EV transfectants had reached the S and G2/M stages respectively (Fig. 2B, panels b and d). To clarify the induction of apoptosis during the growth suppression of GD3 synthase transfectant cells, a cell death ELISA quantitative assay was performed. No differences were found in the rates of cytoplasmic DNA-histone complex formation in the GD3 synthase and EV transfectant cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that thymidine uptake represent differences in proliferation rather than cell death.Fig. 2GD3 synthase gene induces G1 cell cycle arrest in VSMC.A, after serum starvation at 24 h, parental cells (Un), vector control cells (EV), and cells stably expressing GD3 synthase gene (GD3) were treated in the absence or presence of PDGF (10 ng/ml), and lysates were used to assay histone-associated DNA fragmentation as a measure of apoptosis. The specific enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm was expressed as enrichment factor compared with the control. The results are presented as the means of three triplicate experiments. B, effect of GD3 synthase gene on cell cycle distribution. Representative results of FACS measurements to determine cell cycle stages of VSMC. After FBS starvation at 24 h, EV transfectant (panels a and b) and GD3 synthase transfectant cells (panels c and d) cultured in the absence or presence of PDGF (10 ng/ml) for 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GD3 Synthase Transfectant Cells Block ERK1/2 Phosphorylation and Modulate G1Cell Cycle-associated Proteins—To analyze whether the GD3 synthase gene is able to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, we next examined the MAP kinase signaling pathway ERK1/2 after PDGF stimulation in GD3 synthase transfectant, EV transfectant, and parental cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the overexpression of the GD3 synthase gene inhibited PDGF-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that GD3 overexpression could have an effect on VSMC proliferation by inhibiting ERK1/2 activation. To determine if GD3 synthase gene overexpression in VSMC proliferation is associated with the decreased activation of cell cycle machinery, we examined the expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules using immunoblot and kinase assay. The expression of G1-associated factors, cyclin E and CDK2, were down-regulated in GD3 transfectant cells after PDGF treatment as compa"

It is a 46-kDa protein containing a GTP binding domain that was shown to be essential for the induction of cell death. DAP3 functions downstream of the receptor signaling complex, and its death-promoting effects depend on caspase activity. Recent reports have suggested that DAP3 is localized to the mitochondria, but no functional significance of this localization has been reported so far. Here, we study the sub-cellular localization and cellular function of human DAP3 (hDAP3). We found that hDAP3 is localized to the mitochondria and, in contrast to cytochrome c, is not released to the cytoplasm following several cell death signals. Overexpression of hDAP3 induced dramatic changes in the mitochondrial structure involving increased fragmentation of the mitochondria. Both the mitochondrial localization of hDAP3 and its GTP-binding activity were essential for the fragmentation. The punctiform mitochondrial morphology was similar to that observed upon treatment of HeLa cells with staurosporine. In fact, reduction of endogenous hDAP3 protein by RNA interference partially attenuated staurosporine-induced mitochondrial fission. Thus, hDAP3 is a necessary component in the molecular pathway that culminates in fragmented mitochondria, probably reflecting its involvement in the fission process. These results, for the first time, provide a specific functional role for hDAP3 in mitochondrial maintenance.

During apoptosis, several apoptosis-inducing factors, such as cytochrome c, AIF, Smac/DIABLO, and Endo G are released from the mitochondria and drive several fundamental apoptotic processes, including caspase activation and DNA fragmentation/condensation. The mitochondria also undergo multiple physiologic changes during programmed cell death, including opening of the permeability transition pore, which results in dissipation of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), production of reactive oxygen species, and reduction in ATP synthesis (1Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 2Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent work has focused on the dramatic alterations in mitochondrial morphology that take place during the early stages of apoptosis involving fragmentation of the normal tubular network followed by perinuclear clustering of fragmented mitochondria. Within a cell, mitochondria are in a state of dynamic equilibrium between fusion of individual mitochondria to form a large, single mitochondrion, and fission of mitochondria to smaller organelles. The genes controlling these processes were mostly studied in yeast (for review, see Refs. 5Jensen R.E. Hobbs A.E. Cerveny K.L. Sesaki H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and 6Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 178-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recently it has become apparent that, during apoptosis, there is a disruption in the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial networks are fragmented into small, vesicular, punctiform mitochondria, which may result from the inhibition of fusion, the acceleration of fission, or both (7Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Some of the mammalian orthologues of the yeast genes that control the fission/fusion processes have been implicated in apoptosis. These include Drp1 (dynamin-related protein), which regulates outer membrane scission, and Mfn2 (mitofusin2), a large GTPase that controls fusion of the outer membrane (8Frank S. Gaume B.

Moreover, it has been recently reported that the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Bak affect the mitochondrial ultrastructure and co-localize with Drp1 and Mfn2 to mitochondrial tips and constriction sites where fission events subsequently occur (7Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 9Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J.

Here, we analyzed the possible link of another apoptotic gene, death-associated protein 3 (DAP3), 1The abbreviations used are: DAP3, death-associated protein 3; hDAP3, human DAP3; yDAP3, yeast DAP3; CHO, Chinese embryonic kidney; Δmito, absence of mitochondrial localization signal; GFT, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Luc, luciferase; mHSP70, mitochondrial heat shock protein 70; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; PMS, post-mitochondrial supernatant; STS, staurosporine; siRNA, small interfering RNA. to possible changes in mitochondrial morphology. DAP3, a ubiquitously expressed 46-kDa protein, was originally isolated in our laboratory as a positive mediator of interferon-γ-induced cell death in HeLa cells (10Kissil J.L. Deiss L.P. Bayewitch M. Raveh T. Khaspekov G. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27932-27936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It was also shown to play a more general role in cell death, having an impact on tumor necrosis factor-α and Fas-mediated cell death as well (11Kissil J.L. Cohen O. Raveh T. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DAP3 contains three potential motifs for GTP binding (12Cavdar Koc E. Ranasinghe A. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Koc H. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), including the phosphate binding P-loop motif (GXXXXGK(S/T). In fact, DAP3 binds GTP but not ATP (13Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the P-loop is essential for DAP3-induced cell death (11Kissil J.L. Cohen O. Raveh T. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that GTP binding is necessary for DAP3 function. DAP3 also contains a putative mitochondrial localization signal within the first 17 amino acids, (14Morgan C.J. Jacques C. Savagner F. Tourmen Y. Mirebeau D.P. Malthiery Y. Reynier P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and, consistent with these structural predictions, the mouse orthologue of DAP3 was found to be localized to the mitochondrial matrix (15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DAP3 was independently isolated as part of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome in yeast and bovine (i.e. mammalian system) (12Cavdar Koc E. Ranasinghe A. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Koc H. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T. Ueda T. Wada A. Watanabe K.

As a cell death-associated protein that has been localized to mitochondria, DAP3 may specifically mediate apoptotic changes of these organelles. In this study, we show that hDAP3 exerts its pro-apoptotic effects from within the mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of hDAP3 results in mitochondrial fragmentation. Prevention of the mitochondrial localization of hDAP3 or mutation of the P-loop motif that affects the GTP binding activity both abolished the effects of hDAP3 on mitochondrial morphology. This is evidence for a mammalian matrix protein that is involved in the fission/fusion processes, and hDAP3 is among the first few apoptotic proteins to be functionally linked to cell death-associated changes in mitochondrial morphology. Plasmid Constructions and Transfections—HeLa and HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method, and CHO cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen). pcDNA3 expressing luciferase (pcDNA3-Luc), hDAP3-FLAG, and hDAP3K134A-FLAG (P-loop mutant) have been described previously (11Kissil J.L. Cohen O. Raveh T. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A construct of FLAG-tagged hDAP3 that lacks the mitochondrial localization signal (Δmito) was generated by deletion of the first 51 coding nucleotides. MitopDsRed1-N1 (DsRed, a red fluorescent protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix) and pEGFP expression vectors were obtained from Clontech. The DAP3 siRNA construct was based on the pSUPER vector and was designed as described previously (18Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3967) Google Scholar); the 19 nucleotide base pairs start at position 474 (the first ATG) of DAP3, and a loop of seven nucleotides was inserted between the sense and antisense sequences. Immunostaining—HeLa, NIH3T3, and REF52 rodent fibroblasts, A549 human lung carcinoma, primary human foreskin fibroblasts, or CHO cells were grown on 13-mm glass coverslips at a density of 0.8–1.0 × 105 cells per 35-mm tissue culture plate. When indicated, 0.1 μm of STS (Sigma) or Me2SO alone was added for 24 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with cold 100% methanol for 5 min followed by 2 min of 100% acetone drying, and permeabilized/blocked with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% normal goat serum (Biological Industries) for 30 min. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (1:400, M2; Sigma-Aldrich) or mouse monoclonal anti-DAP3 antibodies (1:150; Transduction Laboratories) were applied for 1 h, followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1: 400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. All coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) embedding media. Cells were visualized by either confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad Radiance 2100, mounted on Nikon TE300) or fluorescent microscopy with 60× or 100× oil immersion objectives (Olympus BX41). Digital imaging was performed with a DP50 CCD camera using Viewfinder Lite and Studio Lite software (Olympus). Final composites were prepared in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Analysis of Mitochondrial Morphology—CHO and HeLa cells were transfected for 24 h as described above with 2 or 6.6 μg, respectively, of hDAP3 or control luciferase (Luc) per 35-mm plate. To mark Luctransfectants, cells were co-transfected with GFP at a 10:1 ratio, whereas hDAP3 transfectants were visualized by further immunostaining with the anti-FLAG antibody as described above. To stain mitochondria, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.1 μm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) before fixation. Alternatively, HeLa cells grown on 35-mm plates were transfected with 3.3 μg of Luc, hDAP3, Δmito, or P-loop and stained with MitoTracker Red and the anti-FLAG antibody 24 h later. In each transfection experiment 100 cells were counted in each of three separate fields, and means ± S.D. between different fields were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tailed Student's t test. Cell Fractionation—HEK 293T cells were homogenized in hypotonic buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm K+-EDTA) by passing through a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 300 × g. The resulting supernatant was spun at 12,500 × g, generating a post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) and a mitochondrial pellet that was resuspended in Ficoll buffer (3% Ficoll, 240 mm mannitol, 30 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm K+-EDTA). This pellet was then passed through a 2× Ficoll buffer column and recentrifuged at 12,500 × g. The pellet was suspended in hypotonic buffer and used as a crude mitochondrial fraction. Equal amounts of total protein from each fraction were boiled in loading buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Co-immunoprecipitation and Proteomic Analysis—For co-immunoprecipitation using extraction buffer (100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol), 30 mg of extracts from HEK 293T cells expressing DAP3-FLAG or ΔmitoDAP3-FLAG were incubated for 2 h with FLAG beads at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed three times with extraction buffer and twice with high salt buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, and 0.5% Triton-X100) and then incubated for 5 min with 100 μl of elution buffer containing FLAG peptide (20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EGTA). The eluted samples consisting of hDAP3 and associated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with GelCode (Pierce). Protein bands of interest were excised from the gel, subjected to trypsin digestion, and analyzed in the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Weizmann Institute of Science. It consists of a Bruker Reflex III™ MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker; Bremen, Germany) equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, a reflector, and a 337-nm nitrogen laser and API Q-STAR Pulsari electrospray-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer with a collision cell (MDS Sciex/Applied Biosystems, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). Western Blot Analysis—Detection of proteins was performed by standard Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-DAP3 monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories), anti-mitochondrial HSP70/GRP75 polyclonal antibodies (H-155; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IκB-α polyclonal antibodies (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-ATP synthase β-subunit polyclonal antibodies (a generous gift from Eiki Kominami, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan). Human DAP3 Protein Is Localized to the Mitochondria—To follow the intracellular localization of the hDAP3 protein, HeLa cells were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies directed to hDAP3. Confocal laser microscopy showed that the endogenous hDAP3 exhibited a punctate pattern of staining (Fig. 1A, left panel) reminiscent of the tubular mitochondrial network. To verify this finding, the cells were co-stained with the specific mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Fig. 1A, center panel). Superimposition of the two images revealed a considerable degree of overlap between endogenous hDAP3 staining and the mitochondrial staining (Fig. 1A, right panel). The same pattern of localization was observed in various cell lines of different origins, including human A549 lung carcinoma, human primary fibroblasts, and rodent NIH3T3 and REF52 fibroblasts (Fig 1B), indicating that the mitochondrial localization is not cell-type specific. The mitochondrial localization was further confirmed by expressing in HeLa cells a mutant of hDAP3 that lacks the putative mitochondrial signal (amino acids 1–17, Δmito). This mutant showed a diffusible cytosolic staining with no overlap with the MitoTracker staining (Fig. 1C). The intracellular localization of DAP3 was also studied by biochemical cell fractionation in HEK 293T cells. The cellular extracts were separated into crude mitochondria and PMS fractions. As can be seen in Fig. 1D, the hDAP3 protein was exclusively detected in the mitochondrial fraction, similarly to the mitochondrial protein ATP synthase β-subunit. Neither of these proteins was detected in the PMS fraction, whereas a typical cytosolic protein, IκB-α, was detected only in the PMS fraction and not in the mitochondrial fraction. An additional, independent confirmation of the mitochondrial localization of hDAP3 was obtained from an unbiased analysis of hDAP3 interacting partners. Proteins that co-immunoprecipitated from HEK 293T cells with DAP3 or Δmito (both constructs were FLAG tagged) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, excised from the gel, and identified by mass spectrometry. The pattern of proteins co-immunoprecipitating with wild type hDAP3 was compared with the one obtained by immunoprecipitating the Δmito, shown to be excluded from the mitochondria. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 1E, although a few bands were common to both forms of hDAP3, one protein of 75 kDa specifically co-immunoprecipitated with the wild type hDAP3 but was absent in complexes of hDAP3, which lack the mitochondrial localization signal (marked by an asterisk). This band was identified upon mass spectrometric analysis as the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mHSP70), also named GRP75 (19Schulke N. Sepuri N.B. Gordon D.M. Saxena S. Dancis A. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22847-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further verification of this interaction was done by Western blotting immunoprecipitates of hDAP3 or Δmito with an antibody specific to mHSP70/GRP75 (Fig. 1E, right). As can be seen, mHSP70/GRP75 was exclusively pulled down by wild type hDAP3 but not by the cytoplasmic form of hDAP3. As mHSP70/GRP75 is directly involved in transporting nuclear encoded protein to the mitochondrial matrix, its interaction with wild type hDAP3, but not cytoplasmic hDAP3, is indicative of the specific import of hDAP3 to the mitochondrial matrix. hDAP3 Is Not Released from Mitochondria in Response to Bax—Previously identified pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c and AIF exert their apoptotic effects upon release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. To determine whether hDAP3 also changes its localization under such circumstances, HeLa cells were transfected with Bax to induce mitochondrial damage and, 24 h later, were stained for hDAP3. Bax-transfected cells were marked by GFP expression (Fig. 2, right panels, green); the fate of hDAP3 in these transfectants was followed by immunostaining with anti-DAP3 antibodies (Fig. 2, top left panel, red). As a positive control, the localization changes of cytochrome c were examined in these Bax transfectants using the anti-cytochrome c antibody (Fig. 2, bottom left panel, red). The diffuse pattern of cytochrome c staining clearly indicated that, as expected, overexpression of Bax leads to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. In contrast, however, hDAP3 exhibited the same punctate staining in both transfected and non-transfected cells, suggesting that it remains inside the mitochondria. Similarly, no release of hDAP3 to the cytosol was detected upon treatment of cells with cis-platinum (data not shown). The results are consistent with the mouse DAP3 orthologue, previously reported by T. Berger and colleagues (15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to remain inside the mitochondria upon Fas triggering. Overexpression of hDAP3 Causes Fragmentation of Mitochondria—The fact that hDAP3 remains in the mitochondria during cell death suggests that its pro-apoptotic function takes place within the mitochondria. Because overexpression is sufficient in itself to result in cell death (11Kissil J.L. Cohen O. Raveh T. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was interesting to check whether ectopic expression affects any morphological properties of the mitochondria. To this end, hDAP3 or luciferase and GFP were overexpressed in HeLa and CHO cells. hDAP3-transfected cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody, Luc-transfected cells were marked by GFP (Fig. 3A, green), and the mitochondrial morphology was examined MitoTracker staining (Fig. 3A, red). The normal elongated tubular organization of mitochondria, shown in the luciferase-transfected cells (upper panel), was disrupted in most of the cells that overexpressed hDAP3. Instead, the transfected cells displayed punctiform, fragmented mitochondria, which accumulated in the perinuclear area (Fig 3A, white arrowheads). Some of the fragmented mitochondria additionally displayed a loss of membrane potential, as reflected by the reduction in MitoTracker staining (Fig 3A, open arrowheads). Quantitative evaluation of this phenomenon showed that overexpression of hDAP3 led to mitochondrial fragmentation in 70% and 90% of transfected HeLa and CHO cells, respectively (Fig. 3B). Loss of membrane potential was detected in 30% of the cells that exhibited mitochondrial fragmentation in both cell lines (dashed line within the bar of fragmented mitochondria in Fig. 3B). The effect could be detected as early as 24 h post-transfection, was dose-dependent, and was attenuated by reducing the hDAP3 plasmid concentrations in the transfection process (not shown). The Correct Intracellular Localization and the GTP Binding Activity of hDAP3 Are Both Essential for the Mitochondrial Fragmentation Induced by hDAP3—To further assess the importance of the mitochondrial localization of hDAP3 for this abnormal mitochondrial morphology, ΔmitoDAP3-FLAG was overexpressed in HeLa cells. Immunostaining of these cells with an anti-FLAG antibody indicated diffuse cytoplasmic staining as shown above, and no changes in mitochondrial morphology were evident. Quantitative assessments showed that the Δmito did not lead to significant mitochondrial fragmentation over the basal values detected in cells transfected with a control vector (Fig. 4A). In contrast, similar levels of wild type hDAP3 (see Fig. 4C) resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation within 65% of the cells (Fig. 4A). Thus, the mitochondrial localization of hDAP3 is essential for its involvement in mitochondrial fragmentation. Next, we tested whether the GTP binding activity of hDAP3 is essential for the hDAP3-induced disruption of mitochondrial morphology. To this end, we overexpressed P-loop mutant hDAP3 (Fig. 4B, P-loop) and examined the mitochondrial morphology. The P-loop mutant retained its mitochondrial localization but did not exert any significant effect on mitochondrial morphology (Fig 4B). Western blot analysis confirmed that all of the ectopically expressed proteins (DAP3, Δmito, and the P-loop mutant) accumulated to the same expression levels (Fig. 4C). Knockdown of Endogenous hDAP3 Protein Protects against Mitochondrial Fragmentation during Apoptosis—The kinase inhibitor STS, a potent inducer of cell death, triggers mitochondrial fragmentation as a result of increased fission (8Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the mitochondrial morphology was similar to the one that is induced by overexpression of hDAP3. To check whether hDAP3 has a critical role during this process, we generated siRNA targeted to hDAP3. An ∼80% reduction in hDAP3 protein levels was achieved by transfection of HeLa cells for 4 days with pSUPER DAP3 siRNA (Fig. 5A). These cells were then treated for 24 h with STS, and mitochondrial morphology in the transfected cells was assessed by co-transfecting the pSUPER-based vector with the DsRED plasmid. Notably, cells in which hDAP3 protein was reduced were less sensitive to STS, and a greater proportion exhibited normal mitochondria morphology (Fig. 5B). DAP3 is an ancient death-promoting gene whose role in programmed cell death has been conserved from yeast to human. Overexpression of either hDAP3, mouse DAP3, or the Caenorhabditis elegans DAP3 orthologue is sufficient to cause cell death (11Kissil J.L. Cohen O. Raveh T. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, disruption of yDAP3 prevents induction of cell death triggered by a combination of yeast caspase-1 and hydrogen peroxidase (20Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike many apoptotic genes that are not present in the yeast system, DAP3 plays a highly conserved role in programmed cell death. Despite the extensive work on DAP3, very little information exists concerning the molecular mode of action of this protein. Here, we report for the first time that hDAP3 controls the dynamics of mitochondria morphology and that its overexpression results in extensive mitochondrial fragmentation, followed by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. This mitochondrial function of hDAP3 is dependent on its intact GTP binding activity, which is consistent with previous reports showing the dependence of the pro-apoptotic effects of hDAP3 on the functionality of this P-loop motif (11Kissil J.L. Cohen O. Raveh T. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hDAP3-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation also depends on its correct localization to this organelle, because removal of the N-terminal mitochondrial signal abolished the effects of hDAP3 on mitochondrial morphology. In addition, we show that hDAP3 is retained inside the mitochondria even after transfection with Bax, which causes severe mitochondrial membrane damage, suggesting that hDAP3 acts within the mitochondrion itself. This fits well with the previous localization of DAP3 to the mitochondrial matrix (15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, more specifically, to the small subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes (12Cavdar Koc E. Ranasinghe A. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Koc H. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T. Ueda T. Wada A. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33181-33195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Saveanu C. Fromont-Racine M. Harington A. Ricard F. Namane A. Jacquier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15861-15867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our finding that wild type hDAP3, but not its N-terminal truncated form, interacts with mHSP70/GRP75 probably reflects the mechanism through which the nuclear encoded hDAP3 is transported to the mitochondrial matrix. Finally, we show here that STS-induced mitochondrial fission, which is causal to cell death, can be reduced by knocking down endogenous hDAP3 with siRNA, suggesting that hDAP3 is part of the machinery that leads to increased mitochondrial fragmentation during cell death. Because DAP3 siRNA alone does not reduce mitochondrial fragmentation under normal conditions, our data suggest that DAP3 does not regulate mitochondrial fragmentation under homeostatic conditions but rather following cellular stress, upon which it must undergo specific activation. Most likely, this activation state is mimicked by overexpression of DAP3, which is sufficient to lead to fragmentation. Thus, the current study establishes a link between the pro-apoptotic function of DAP3 and its ability to induce mitochondrial fragmentation, providing one of a few existing examples where a death-promoting gene operates in this manner. Excessive fragmentation of mitochondria can lead to reduction of membrane potential, a phenomenon detected in 30% of the DAP3-mediated fragmented mitochondria. It may also lead to opening of the permeability transition pore and the release of mitochondrial components to the cytoplasm, which is consistent with previous studies that showed cytochrome c release in response to murine DAP3 overexpression (15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, functional studies in yeast further support a mitochondrial function for DAP3. Mutant yDAP3 (Ygl129c) is incapable of growing on glycerol as its sole carbon source, a phenotype typical of disruption of the mitochondria (21Tizon B. Rodriguez-Torres A.M. Cerdan M.E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). yDAP3 is not directly required for respiration, but in its absence yeast cells tend to lose mitochondrial DNA, suggesting a role in mitochondrial biogenesis (15Berger T. Brigl M. Herrmann J.M. Vielhauer V. Luckow B. Schlondorff D. Kretzler M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that specific extra-mitochondrial functions have also been attributed to DAP3, including a role in death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) assembly by Trail and Fas receptors via binding to the Fas-associated death domain (FADD), as well as interactions with the glucocorticoid nuclear receptor (13Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Hulkko S.M. Wakui H. Zilliacus J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Hulkko S.M. Zilliacus J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, there is still no evidence that endogenous DAP3 localizes to other cellular compartments, which would enable these interactions to occur, and, therefore, the relevance of these observations to the death-promoting effects of DAP3 requires further confirmation. How can a matrix protein, which is found to be associated with mitochondrial ribosomes, cause mitochondrial fragmentation during cell death? One possibility is that the ribosomal localization reflects a specific function of DAP3 in translational processes within these organelles, which is somehow necessary for the fission/fusion processes. Significantly, high throughput proteomic dissection of ribosomal proteins indicates that DAP3 is the only GTP-binding protein in the ribosome complex (12Cavdar Koc E. Ranasinghe A. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Koc H. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and, therefore, could represent the missing GTP binding subunit necessary for translation initiation in the mitochondria. Yet, we were not able to show any functional connection between DAP3 and mitochondrial protein translation (data not shown). The reduction of hDAP3 by siRNA did not alter the overall pattern of protein translation within the mitochondria. Moreover, the effect of hDAP3 on mitochondrial fragmentation was still detected in the presence of chloramphenicol, which specifically inhibits protein translation in mitochondria (data not shown). Other mechanisms that are translation-independent should be investigated in the future. These could include a direct involvement in the fission or fusion processes affecting the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is in the proximity of mitochondrial ribosomes. To date, only one yeast protein, Mdm33, was reported to be involved in the fission of the inner membrane of mitochondria (24Messerschmitt M. Jakobs S. Vogel F. Fritz S. Dimmer K.S. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and it will be of interest to test possible interaction between Mdm33 and yDAP3 as well as between the mammalian orthologues. Obviously, a more complete understanding of DAP3 and its function in mitochondria may lead to the elucidation of the fission/fusion process, not only as a cell death phenomenon but also as an essential component of mitochondrial biogenesis and maintenance.

Unlike the Escherichia coli enzyme, human GALE (hGALE) also efficiently interconverts a larger pair of substrates: UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The basis of this differential substrate specificity has remained obscure. Recently, however, x-ray crystallographic data have both predicted essential active site residues and suggested that differential active site cleft volume may be a key factor in determining GALE substrate selectivity. We report here a direct test of this hypothesis. In brief, we have created four substituted alleles: S132A, Y157F, S132A/Y157F, and C307Y-hGALE. While the first three substitutions were predicted to disrupt catalytic activity, the fourth was predicted to reduce active site cleft volume, thereby limiting entry or rotation of the larger but not the smaller substrate. All four alleles were expressed in a null-background strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized in terms of activity with regard to both UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. The S132A/Y157F and C307Y-hGALE proteins were also overexpressed in Pichia pastoris and purified for analysis. In all forms tested, the Y157F, S132A, and Y157F/S132A-hGALE proteins each demonstrated a complete loss of activity with respect to both substrates. In contrast, the C307Y-hGALE demonstrated normal activity with respect to UDP-galactose but complete loss of activity with respect to UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. Together, these results serve to validate the wild-type hGALE crystal structure and fully support the hypothesis that residue 307 acts as a gatekeeper mediating substrate access to the hGALE active site.

Clinical phenotypes range from ostensibly benign to severe, although conclusions about outcome and prevalence are confounded by issues of limited ascertainment and a lack of long term patient follow-up in most cases. The biochemical bases of pathophysiology and clinical variability in epimerase deficiency remain unclear, although allelic heterogeneity at the hGALE locus may represent one contributing factor (2Holton J.B.

Furthermore, while some mutations (e.g. G90E) impact interconversion of UDP-Gal/UDP-Glc and UDP-GalNAc/UDP-GlcNAc equally, others do not. For example, as compared with the wild-type enzyme, V94M-hGALE, associated with severe epimerase-deficiency galactosemia, retains only 5% activity with regard to UDP-Gal/UDP-Glc but 25% activity with regard to UDP-GalNAc/UDP-GlcNAc (13Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 462-470Google Scholar, 14Wohlers T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Google Scholar). The role of impaired activity with regard to each substrate in defining patient outcome remains unknown.Within the last 8 years, crystal structures for both the human and E. coli GALE enzymes have been solved at high resolution (8Thoden J.B.

Parasitol. 2003; 132: 47-53Google Scholar), offering not only insight into mechanism but also a powerful tool for predicting structure/function relationships in these enzymes. In brief, these structures, combined with biochemical analyses (22Liu Y. Thoden J. Kim J. Berger E. Gulick A. Ruzicka F. Holden H. Frey P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10675-10684Google Scholar), suggest that catalysis begins with abstraction of the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen of the sugar substrate by a conserved tyrosine base (Tyr149 eGALE/Tyr157 hGALE) and transfer of a hydride from C4 of the sugar to C4 of the NAD+ cofactor (Fig. 2A). The result is formation of a 4′-ketopyranose intermediate and NADH. The 4′-ketopyranose then rotates within the active site by ∼180°, enabling subsequent return of the hydride from NADH back to the opposite face of the sugar, with return of the proton from the tyrosine to the 4′-hydroxyl oxygen, generating epimerized product (1Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Google Scholar).Fig. 2Predicted impact of the amino acid substitutions, S132A and Y157F, on the hGALE active site.A, hydrogen bonds involving residues Tyr157 and Ser132 in hGALE.

As illustrated, each substitution (S132A and Y157F) results in the loss of key hydrogen bonds predicted to be essential for catalysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In addition to the conserved tyrosine, a second residue in the active site, Ser124 eGALE/Ser132 hGALE, appears to form a low barrier hydrogen bond with the sugar substrate (Fig. 2A), facilitating both removal of the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen by the tyrosine and transfer of the hydride from the sugar to the NAD+ ring. While mutations testing the roles of these residues in eGALE have been reported previously (18Thoden J.B. Gulick A.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10685-10695Google Scholar, 22Liu Y. Thoden J. Kim J. Berger E. Gulick A. Ruzicka F. Holden H. Frey P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10675-10684Google Scholar), the human and E. coli GALE sequences differ by at least 48% at the amino acid level, leaving open the question of just how conserved the roles of these specific residues might be. We report here the first test and confirmation of both the individual and combined roles of Ser132 and Tyr157 in human GALE.One of the most intriguing questions with regard to GALE, however, addresses the issue of substrate specificity; in particular, why both the E. coli and human enzymes interconvert UDP-Gal/UDP-Glc with equal efficiency, but only the human enzyme is also able to interconvert UDP-GalNAc/UDP-GlcNAc. Inspection of the two crystal structures (8Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15131-15136Google Scholar, 17Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2149-2161Google Scholar, 18Thoden J.B. Gulick A.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10685-10695Google Scholar, 20Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Google Scholar) revealed a potential explanation, namely that the active site cleft in the human enzyme is about 15% larger than is that of the E. coli enzyme. Further inspection revealed that a single amino acid difference of Tyr299 in eGALE, corresponding to position Cys307 in hGALE (Fig. 3), accounts for much of the volume difference. This observation led to the hypothesis that although the smaller substrate, UDP-Gal, can fit easily within either cleft, the larger substrate, UDP-GalNAc, might be sterically hindered from entry, or from rotation, within the smaller cleft (23Thoden J. Henderson J. Fridovich-Keil J. Holden H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Google Scholar).Fig. 3Predicted impact of the amino acid substitution C307Y on hGALE active site structure. As illustrated, substitution of a bulky tyrosine in place of the smaller cysteine is predicted to reduce the volume of the hGALE active site cleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our first test of this hypothesis involved site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli sequence, resulting in a substituted allele in which cysteine replaced the natural tyrosine at position 299 (23Thoden J. Henderson J. Fridovich-Keil J. Holden H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Google Scholar). High resolution structural analysis of the Y299C eGALE protein demonstrated a 20% increase in active site volume, and kinetic analyses demonstrated a >230-fold increase in specific activity with regard to the interconversion of UDP-GalNAc/UDP-GlcNAc (23Thoden J. Henderson J. Fridovich-Keil J. Holden H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Google Scholar). This gain of specific activity came at a cost, however. The Y299C eGALE enzyme also demonstrated an almost 5-fold loss of activity with regard to interconversion of UDP-Gal/UDP-Glc, presumably because the enlarged active site cleft enabled the smaller substrate and bound intermediate increased opportunity to assume unproductive conformations. While the >230-fold gain of specific activity with regard to the larger substrate clearly supported the “cleft size” hypothesis, the 5-fold loss of specific activity with regard to the smaller substrate left open the question of whether the same rationale could govern substrate selectivity in the human enzyme, which despite its naturally large cleft is nonetheless efficient at interconverting both sets of substrates.A second test of the cleft size hypothesis was reported recently by Berghuis and colleagues (24Ishiyama N. Creuzenet C. Lam J. Berghuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22635-22642Google Scholar), who performed both mutational and structural analyses of WbpP, a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-4′-epimerase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that bears many sequence and structural similarities to the GALE enzymes. Wild-type WbpP has a naturally large active site cleft and, reminiscent of Y299C eGALE, demonstrates >7-fold higher specific activity with regard to UDP-GalNAc than with regard to UDP-Gal (24Ishiyama N. Creuzenet C. Lam J. Berghuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22635-22642Google Scholar). To test the relationship between cleft size and substrate specificity for this enzyme, Berghuis and colleagues (24Ishiyama N. Creuzenet C. Lam J. Berghuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22635-22642Google Scholar) substituted a bulky residue, tyrosine, in place of the natural serine at position 306, corresponding to position Tyr299 in eGALE/Cys307 in hGALE. Contrary to prediction, however, rather than showing altered substrate specificity, the resultant S306Y WbpP protein was completely inactive with regard to all substrates tested (24Ishiyama N. Creuzenet C. Lam J. Berghuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22635-22642Google Scholar). These data clearly leave open the question of whether constricting the naturally large active site cleft of an epimerase will skew substrate selection toward smaller substrates. These data further raise concern that each naturally occurring residue at this position in WbpP and hGALE may play some previously unappreciated but key role in catalysis rather than simply acting as a gatekeeper limiting access to the active site.We report here a third and definitive test of the GALE cleft size hypothesis, namely a direct demonstration of the role of residue Cys307 as a determinant of substrate specificity in hGALE. Although the C307Y substituted human GALE protein proved insufficiently stable for an x-ray crystallographic analysis, kinetic studies demonstrated fully wild-type activity with regard to the smaller substrate (UDP-Gal) but an almost 42-fold loss of activity with regard to the larger substrate (UDP-GalNAc). This result clearly supports the cleft size hypothesis of substrate specificity in GALE. What is more, unlike previous studies, it also underscores the point that while a small cleft size may preclude access to large substrates, a large cleft size does not necessitate inefficiency with regard to smaller substrates. Contrary to the WbpP report (24Ishiyama N. Creuzenet C. Lam J. Berghuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22635-22642Google Scholar), the data presented here further demonstrate that the cysteine at position 307 in hGALE is not essential for catalytic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Expression Plasmids—All hGALE mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis of the otherwise wild-type sequence using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Primers used to generate alleles were the following: C307Y, forward (hEPIMFC307Y: 5′-GGTGATGTGGCAGCCTATTACGCCAACCCC-3′), reverse (hEPIMRC307Y: 5′-GCTGGGGTTGGCGTAATAGGCTGCCACATCACC-3′); S132A, forward (S132AEPIMF: 5′-CTGGTGTTCAGCAGCGCAGCCACTGTGTAC-3′), reverse (S132AEPIMR: 5′-GTACACAGTGGCTGCGCTGCTGAACACCAG-3′); Y157F, forward (Y157FEPIMF: 5′-GGTTGTACCAACCCTTTCGGCAAGTCCAAG-3′), reverse (Y157FEPIMR: 5′-CTTGGACTTGCCGAAAGGGTTGGTACAACC-3′). To create the S132A/Y157F double mutation, an existing hGALE Y157F sequence was mutagenized a second time with primers S132AEPIMF and S132AEPIMR. All alleles were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.Expression of hGALE Alleles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Each hGALE allele was expressed in S. cerevisiae from the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter on a low copy number (centromeric) plasmid, pMM33, derived from the yeast-bacterial shuttle vector YCPlac33 (25Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Google Scholar) and the expression plasmid pYEPGAP.BX (kind gift of Dr. Warren Kruger, Fox Chase Cancer Center). All yeast manipulations were carried out according to standard techniques as described previously (26Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (281-302): 3-21Google Scholar).Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmid numberNameHuman GALE alleleJF2812pMM33 (no hGALE)NoneJF2900pMM33.hGALEWild-typeJF3744pMM33.S132A-hGALES132A-hGALEJF3735pMM33.Y157F-hGALEY157F-hGALEJF3941pMM33.S132A/Y157F-hGALES132A/Y157F-hGALEJF4023pMM33.C307Y-hGALEC307Y-hGALE Open table in a new tab All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table II. Strain JFy3682 was generated from the haploid parent W303 (MATa, ade 2-1 his 3-11,15 leu 2-3,112 ura 3-1 trp1-1 can 1-100 RAD 5+, the kind gift of Dr. Rodney Rothstein, Columbia University, New York) and expresses no endogenous GALE due to a genomic deletion of gal10, as described previously (27Christacos N.C. Marson M. Riehman K. Wells L. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 272-280Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains expressing hGALE were grown at 30 °C to A600 ∼1.0 in synthetic medium deficient in uracil. Cells were harvested from 5-ml cultures and soluble cell lysates prepared essentially as described previously (28Fridovich-Keil J. Markell P. Gudas J. Pardee A. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 679-687Google Scholar, 29Quimby B.B. Wells L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26835-26842Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml) containing protease inhibitors (0.3 mm aprotinin, 0.63 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm antipain, 1 mm phosphoramidon, 0.2 μg/ml chymostatin, 8 mm E64, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.50 μg/ml leupeptin) and disrupted by vigorous agitation for 15 min at 4 °C in the presence of acid-washed 0.5-mm glass beads. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Both crude and purified samples were assessed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer, using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Table IIYeast strains used in these studiesStrain numbersCommentsHuman GALE expressedJFy3682gal10-null, no plasmidsNoneJFy3763-3765JFy3682 carrying plasmid JF2812NoneJFy4604-4606JFy3682 carrying plasmid JF2900Wild-type hGALEJFy3769-3771JFy3682 carrying plasmid JF3744S132A-hGALEJFy3766-3768JFy3682 carrying plasmid JF3735Y157F-hGALEJFy4038-4040JFy3682 carrying plasmid JF3941S132A/Y157F-hGALEJFy4607-4609JFy3682 carrying plasmid JF4023C307Y-hGALE Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses for protein expression were performed essentially as described previously (13Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 462-470Google Scholar, 30Fridovich-Keil J.L. Langley S.D. Mazur L.A. Lennon J.C. Dembure P.P. Elsas L.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 640-646Google Scholar). Briefly, hGALE was detected by incubation with a 1:80,000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (EU69) raised against purified hexahistidine-tagged human epimerase. A second rabbit polyclonal antiserum, generated against endogenous yeast cyclophilin A (31Zydowsky L.D. Ho S.I. Baker C.H. McIntyre K. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 961-969Google Scholar), was included at a 1:120,000 dilution to control for loading of lanes. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit Ig (Chemicon), used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immediately before use, 1.5 μl of 30% (w/w) H2O2 were added to 10 ml of a working solution (1.25 mm luminol, 0.2 mmp-coumaric acid, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). The resultant solution was added to the nitrocellulose blot and incubated for 2 min before exposure to film.Expression of hGALE Alleles in Pichia pastoris—For overexpression in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris, hGALE alleles were subcloned into the high copy number Pichia expression plasmid pPIC3.5K (Invitrogen). Cloning was facilitated by a gap-repair procedure (32Bubeck P. Winkler M. Bautsch W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3601-3602Google Scholar) utilizing EcoRI/SalI fragments of the hGALE sequence that contained the desired mutations cotransformed with gapped pPIC3.5K backbone that already contained the wild-type hGALE sequence (linearized AflII). The resultant plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and dideoxy sequencing of relevant regions.Each of the mutated hGALE plasmids was then linearized using SalI and integrated into the genome of P. pastoris strain GS115 in multiple copy using a spheroplasting protocol, as recommended by Invitrogen. Desired transformants were selected as described previously (20Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Google Scholar) and expanded in a New Brunswick Scientific Bioflo 3000 fermenter. Cultures were harvested and pellets resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol). Cells were lysed either by agitation with glass beads using a Beadbeater (Biospec) or by at least three passages at 7-10 p.s.i. through a French pressure cell (Thermo Spectronic). Lysates were clarified by repeated centrifugation (two times) at 12,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall GS-3 rotor at 4 °C. Human GALE protein was then purified from extracts as described previously (20Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Google Scholar).In Vitro Analysis of UDP-Gal/UDP-Glc Interconversion—Aliquots of each purified enzyme were stored in 50% glycerol with 4 mm NAD+ in liquid nitrogen, while crude extracts were stored in lysis buffer at -85 °C until use. All crude extracts were passed through Micro Biospin 30 columns (Bio-Rad) to remove small metabolites before further analysis. Assays to determine the level of GALE activity with respect to UDP-Gal were performed essentially as described previously (23Thoden J. Henderson J. Fridovich-Keil J. Holden H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27528-27534Google Scholar). Enzymatic conversion from substrate to product was detected either by radioactive assay, as described previously (13Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 462-470Google Scholar), or by nonradioactive assay, with substrates and products separated and quantitated by HPLC. The results from both forms of analysis were indistinguishable (data not shown). For radioactive assays, conversion of UDP-Gal to UDP-Glc was measured in an 12.5-μl total reaction volume containing 2.5 μl of premix (0.05 μCi of UDP-[14C]Gal (Amersham Biosciences), 2 mm cold UDP-Gal, 0.2 m glycine buffer, pH 8.7), 2.5 μl of 20 mm NAD+, and 7.5 μl of protein diluted in lysis buffer. The amount of protein used per reaction was adjusted to stay within the linear range of the assay. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 15 min, 10 μl of each sample were spotted onto a prewashed polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate (Baker). After thorough drying, the plate was developed for 16-24 h in a solvent containing 1.5 mm Na2B4O7, 5 mm H3BO3, and 25% ethylene glycol. Finally, plates were air-dried before overnight exposure to phosphor screens (Amersham Biosciences). Images were visualized using a Typhoon 9200 variable mode imager and quantified using ImageQuant software (both from Amersham Biosciences).For nonradioactive analysis of GALE activity, the same assay protocol described above was used, with minor modifications. In particular, UDP-[14C]galactose was removed from the premix and the volume replaced by water. The assay proceeded through the 30-min incubation described above and was then stopped by addition of 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% methanol. After brief vortex agitation, samples were spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and dried under vacuum with low heat. Resultant pellets were then resuspended in 250 μl of double distilled H20 and filtered by centrifugation for 5 min at 4,000 × g through a 0.2-μm nylon micro-spin filter tube (Alltech). Finally, a 15-μl aliquot of each sample was applied to a Dionex HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) for separation and quantitation of UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc, as described below.In Vitro Analysis of UDP-GalNAc/UDP-GlcNAc Interconversion—The radioactive method for detecting conversion of UDP-GalNAc to UDP-GlcNAc was performed essentially as described above for UDP-Gal, with the following assay components per 25-μl reaction: 8.75 μl of premix (0.04 μCi of UDP-[14C]GalNAc (ICN), 1.89 mm cold UDP-Gal-NAc, 28.6 mm pyruvate, 286 mm glycine, pH 8.7), 5 μl of 20 mm NAD+ and 11.25 μl of protein diluted in 100 mm glycine buffer containing protease inhibitors. Assays were performed as for UDP-Gal, with a TLC run time of 10 h, and quantified as described for UDP-Gal.For nonradioactive analysis, protein samples were diluted to a final volume of 7.5 μl. For each reaction, 2.5 μl of 20 mm NAD+ and 2.5 μl of premix (3.3 mm UDP-GalNAc, 0.5 m glycine, pH 8.7) were added, for a final reaction volume of 12.5 μl. Assay mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before stopping by addition of 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% methanol. Samples were mixed by vortex agitation, spun, dried, resuspended, and filtered as described above for the corresponding UDP-Gal assays, except that these samples were resuspended in 750 μl of double distilled H20. Finally, an aliquot of 20 μl was applied to a Dionex HPLC for separation and quantitation of UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc.Analysis of Small Metabolites—Identification and quantitation of small carbohydrate metabolites was carried out on a DX600 HPLC system (Dionex) consisting of a Dionex AS50 autosampler, a Dionex GP50 gradient pump, and a Dionex ED50 electrochemical detector, essentially as described previously (33de Koning W. van Dam K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 118-123Google Scholar, 34Smits H.P. Cohen A. Buttler T. Nielsen J. Olsson L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 36-42Google Scholar). Carbohydrates were separated on a CarboPac PA10 column, 250 × 4 mm, with a CarboPac PA10 guard column, 50 × 4 mm, placed before the analysis column and a borate trap placed after. Because exclusion of the borate trap resulted in greater separation of the UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc, the trap was removed for analysis of the substrates and products from UDP-GalNAc epimerase assays.The following mobile phase buffers were used for HPLC analysis: buffer A, 15 mm NaOH, and buffer B, 50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaAC. UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc were separated using a high salt isocr"

Additional proteins are required to account for the speed, spatial restriction, and tight control of exocytosis and a key role is played by members of the Sec1/Munc18 family of proteins that have been implicated either in vesicle docking or fusion itself through their interactions with the corresponding syntaxin. Using amperometry to assay the kinetics of single vesicle fusion/release events in adrenal chromaffin cells, the effect of expression of syntaxin 1A mutants was examined. Overexpression of wild-type syntaxin or its cytoplasmic domain had no effect on the kinetics of release during single exocytotic events although the cytoplasmic domain reduced the frequency of exocytosis. In contrast, expression of either an open syntaxin 1A or the I233A mutant resulted in increased quantal size and a slowing of the kinetics of release. The wild-type and mutant syntaxins were overexpressed to a similar extent and the only common defect shown by the syntaxin 1A mutants was reduced binding to Munc18-1. These results are consistent with a role for Munc18-1 in controlling the late stages of exocytosis by binding to and limiting the availability of syntaxin in its open conformation.

Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Google Scholar, 3Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R. Rothman J. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar, 4Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the formation of a stable complex between these three proteins not only allows vesicle docking on its target membrane but also drives membrane fusion (5Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Google Scholar). The in vitro fusion mediated by these minimal components is, however, several orders of magnitudes slower than fusion during regulated exocytosis, suggesting the involvement of additional proteins or other factors. Regulated exocytosis is also Ca2+-dependent and tightly regulated both temporally and spatially (6Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Google Scholar, 7Gundelfinger E.D. Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 127-139Google Scholar). An additional family of proteins that act as SNARE regulators, the Sec1/Munc18 proteins (8Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Google Scholar), are conserved and essential components of the fusion machinery. Genetic manipulations have demonstrated that Sec1 is essential for constitutive exocytosis in yeast (9Novick P. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1858-1862Google Scholar) and Munc18-1 (10Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Google Scholar) (otherwise known as n-sec1 (11Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Google Scholar)) is essential for neurotransmitter release (12Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Google Scholar). Munc18-1 null mutant mice also show a severe impairment of dense-core granule exocytosis in their adrenal chromaffin cells (13Voets T. Toonen R. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Google Scholar) and neurotransmission is substantially reduced in null mutants of the Munc18-1 orthologues UNC-18 (14Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Google Scholar, 15Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12593-12598Google Scholar) and Rop (16Harrison S.D. Broadie K. van de Goor J. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 555-566Google Scholar) in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, respectively. Munc18-1 binds with high affinity and in a stoichiometric manner to syntaxin 1A in vitro precluding the binding of SNAP-25 and VAMP to syntaxin 1A (17Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Google Scholar). Despite the requirement for Munc18-1 this has been taken as suggesting a possible inhibitory role for Munc18-1. In fact, in some (18Wu M.N. Fergestad T. Lloyd T.E. He Y. Broadie K. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 1999; 23: 593-605Google Scholar, 19Schulze K.L. Littleton J.T. Salzberg A. Halachmi N. Stern M. Lev Z. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1099-1108Google Scholar) but not all systems (20Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Google Scholar) overexpression of Munc18-1 orthologues is inhibitory. In the syntaxin 1A-Munc18-1 complex, syntaxin is in the so called closed conformation (21Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Google Scholar, 22Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Google Scholar, 23Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Google Scholar) in which its N-terminal helices are folded back onto the C-terminal SNARE motif (24Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Google Scholar). Release of syntaxin into an open conformation is believed to be required to allow syntaxin to associate into the SNARE complex (21Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Google Scholar, 25Munson M. Hughson F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9375-9381Google Scholar). It is not clear how this dissociation of Munc18 is triggered nor is it known whether the controlled transition between closed and open conformations is an essential aspect of Munc18/syntaxin function. Syntaxin with mutations that create a constitutively open form of the protein (21Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Google Scholar) has been shown to support neurotransmission in C. elegans and can bypass a requirement for UNC-13 (26Richmond J.E. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 338-341Google Scholar) or RIM (27Koushika S.P. Richmond J.E. Hadwiger G. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nonet M.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 997-1005Google Scholar) but surprisingly not the requirement for UNC-18 (28Weimer R.M. Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Hadwinger G. Nonet M.L. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1023-1030Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the role of Munc18 is not simply to assist in the provision of syntaxin in an open conformation and is consistent with the existence of syntaxin-independent functions of UNC-18. Much still remains to be learned, therefore, about the functions of the Sec1/Munc18 proteins in the steps leading to membrane fusion. It is currently hotly debated whether the major function of Munc18-1 is in vesicle docking at the plasma membrane or at the level of membrane fusion (8Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Google Scholar). Expression of Munc18-1 mutants in chromaffin cells modifies the kinetics of individual release events consistent with the latter function (29Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Fisher R.J. Ciufo L.F. Evans G.J.O. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10538-10545Google Scholar, 30Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Google Scholar). Analysis of null mutants has shown defects in vesicle docking in mouse chromaffin cells (13Voets T. Toonen R. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Google Scholar) and C. elegans synapses (28Weimer R.M. Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Hadwinger G. Nonet M.L. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1023-1030Google Scholar) but not in synapses in the mouse brain (12Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for these different findings is that Munc18 has multiple roles in both docking and membrane fusion either through its interactions with syntaxin or independently with other proteins. It has also been suggested that Sec1/Munc18 proteins have indirect roles in allowing traffic of syntaxins to the target membrane (31Rowe J. Calegari F. Taverna E. Longhi R. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3323-3332Google Scholar) or in preventing degradation of the cognate syntaxin (32Bryant N.J. James D.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3380-3388Google Scholar). The changes in vesicle release kinetics and reduction in quantal size (29Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Fisher R.J. Ciufo L.F. Evans G.J.O. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10538-10545Google Scholar, 30Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Google Scholar) seen in chromaffin cells expressing Munc18-1 mutants with reduced binding affinity for syntaxin could be a consequence of more efficient release of syntaxin from the syntaxin-Munc18-1 complex. Alternatively, the effect might be because of syntaxin-independent effects of the released Munc18-1. To test these possibilities we aimed to express syntaxin 1A mutants with impaired binding to Munc18-1 to see if these had similar direct effects on exocytosis. We have analyzed the effect on regulated exocytosis in chromaffin cells of the expression of syntaxin 1A mutants in either the constitutively open or closed conformations that are impaired in Munc18-1 binding. These mutant syntaxins can both still support exocytosis and resulted in similar changes in vesicle release kinetics with an increase in quantal size. We suggest that the syntaxin/Munc18-1 interaction has a crucial role in regulating the kinetics of late events during membrane fusion. Mammalian Expression Plasmids—A plasmid encoding amino acids 4-285 of syntaxin 1A was a gift from Dr. R. Scheller (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University). Site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange system was used to make the following syntaxin mutants: the constitutively open syntaxin L165A/E-166A (sense primer, 5′-CCACGACCAGTGAGGAAGCGGCAGACATGCTGGAGAGTGG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCACTCTCCAGCATGTCTGCCGCTTCCTCACTGGTCGTGG-3′) and syntaxin I233A (sense primer 5′-GGGGAGATGATTGACAGGGCCGAGTACAATGTGGAACACG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CGTGTTCCACATTGTACTCGGCCCTGTCAATCATCTCCCC-3′). The ΔTM plasmid encoding the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin was a gift from Dr. Mary Bittner (University of Michigan). Recombinant Proteins—A plasmid encoding amino acids 4-266 of syntaxin 1A fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was a gift from Dr. R. Scheller (University of Stanford). This construct was used to generate GST-open syntaxin and GST-I233A syntaxin plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers described above. GST-syntaxin recombinant proteins were made as described previously (33Haynes L.P. Barnard R.J. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 1-5Google Scholar). Recombinant His6-tagged cysteine string protein (Csp) 1 (34Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Google Scholar), Munc18-1 (20Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Google Scholar), and α-SNAP (35Barnard R.J.O. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 875-883Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Chromaffin Cell Culture, Transfection, and Amperometric Recordings—Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were isolated (36Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods, Intracellular Messengers. 20. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar) and plated onto non-tissue culture 10-cm Petri dishes overnight at 37 °C. Unattached cells were resuspended in growth media at a density of 1 × 107/ml, and transfected with 20 μg of pEGFP and 20 μg of syntaxin plasmid per 1 ml of cells as described previously (37Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Google Scholar). Amperometric recordings were made 3-5 days after transfection as previously described (37Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recording conditions were as described previously. Briefly, cells were incubated in bath buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5) and a 5-μm diameter carbon fiber electrode was positioned in contact with a cell. For stimulation, a cell permeabilization/stimulation buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μm digitonin, and 10 μm free Ca2+, pH 6.5) was pressure-ejected from a glass pipette on the opposite side of the cell and amperometric responses were monitored with a VA-10 amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany). To rule out any variability between cell batches and carbon fibers, transfected cells and untransfected cells as controls were recorded alternately in the same dishes and with the same carbon fibers that were cut between cells. Data from transfected cells was always compared with the respective control cells. For all treatments, cells were derived from multiple cell preparations. The data were subsequently analyzed using Origin (37Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Google Scholar). All of the data are shown as mean ± S.E., and statistical differences were assessed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Amperometric spikes were analyzed for feet in Origin. Foot onset was measured as the point in time when the recorded amperometric current signal twice exceeded the noise level. Foot termination was measured as the beginning of the amperometric currents at the point of temporal intersection; the onset of the amperometric spike proper was isolated by differentiating the trace and using the start time of the differentiated amperometric spike. Feet were measured for maximum current, duration, total charge, and frequency of occurrence. Immunofluorescence—Chromaffin cells were transfected as described above except using a density of 2.5 × 106 cells per ml, per transfection, and plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm diameter Petri dishes at 2.3 × 106 per dish. 3 days later cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Immunofluorescence was performed using a 1/50 dilution of anti-syntaxin monoclonal antibody, HPC-1 clone (Sigma), for 1 h or 1/50 dilution of Munc18 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Labs) overnight followed by a 1/100 dilution of biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h, then a 1/50 dilution of streptavadin/Texas Red (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Staining was visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy with a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a 22-μm pinhole and a ×63 water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. Texas Red was imaged using excitation at 543 nm and light collection at 600-650 nm and EGFP by excitation at 488 nm and light collection at 500-550 nm. For quantification of fluorescence, the cell area was defined and the Texas Red signal was quantified using the Leica confocal software for transfected and non-transfected cells in the same microscope field. At least 10 cells were imaged and quantified for each condition. Expression of Syntaxin Constructs in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were trypsinized, plated at a density of 1 × 107 cells per 35-mm culture dish, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum overnight. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of syntaxin construct in mammalian expression plasmid, using 3 μl of FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics). After 72 h of incubation, cells were washed in PBS, lysed in 250 μl of SDS-PAGE dissociation buffer, separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose paper for immunoblotting. Blots were probed with a 1/1000 dilution of mouse monoclonal syntaxin antibody (HPC-1 clone, Sigma) for 1 h, followed by a 1/400 dilution of anti-mouse IgG peroxidase (Sigma) for 1 h, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Binding of Recombinant Proteins to GST-syntaxins Using a Microtiter Plate ELISA—GST-syntaxins diluted to 50 nm in PBS were added to a glutathione-coated microtiter plate (BD Biosciences) at 100 μl/well, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow binding to the plate (38Craig T.J. Ciufo L.F. Morgan A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods,. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). GST proteins were discarded and wells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS + 0.02% Triton X-100 (PBST). Dilutions of His-Munc18 or His-Csp were prepared in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton-X-100, pH 7.4), added to the plate at 100 μl/well, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatants were discarded and wells were washed three times with PBST. To detect binding of His-tagged proteins to the plate, the following reagents were added for 1 h at room temperature and the plate was washed three times with PBST in between each step. First, a 1/10,000 dilution in PBST of an anti-His6 antibody (Qiagen), then a 1/5000 dilution in PBST of biotinylated anti-mouse 1gG (Amersham Biosciences), followed by a 1/250 dilution in PBST of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) was added at 100 μl/well and incubated for >5 min until a blue color developed. The chromogenic reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl/well of 2 m HCl and the resulting yellow color was read at 450 nm in a microplate reader. The absorbance data were plotted as a hyperbolic best-fit curve. Binding to GST controls was also analyzed and found to be <5% of that to GST-tagged syntaxins. These background values were subtracted from the data shown. Binding affinities determined from this assay were closely similar to those determined from conventional GST pull-down assays (29Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Fisher R.J. Ciufo L.F. Evans G.J.O. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10538-10545Google Scholar). Trypsin Digestion of Recombinant Syntaxins—GST-syntaxins at 5 μm concentration were incubated in PBS with 60 nm trypsin (type 1X-S) (Sigma) in a final volume of 50 μl, for 15 min at room temperature (39Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of SDS-PAGE dissociation buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose paper for immunoblotting using anti-syntaxin antibody, HPC-1 clone (Sigma), at 1/3500 dilution. Binding of Rat Brain Membrane Proteins to Immobilized GST-syntaxin—Rat brain membranes were prepared as described previously (4Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed three times with binding buffer (150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20). Beads were incubated with 140 μg of Escherichia coli protein extract per ml of a 50% slurry of beads in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, then washed three times with binding buffer. GST-syntaxins were added to the beads at a final concentration of 2 μm in binding buffer, and a final volume of 200 μl, and allowing to bind by incubation for 45 min at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed using CytoSignal spin filters (CytoSignal, Irvine, CA) initially with two washes of binding buffer plus 1 mg/ml gelatin, then with three washes of binding buffer with 5% glycerol. Proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 100 μl of SDS-dissociation buffer for 15 min. Samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and silver stained or transferred to nitrocellulose paper for immunoblotting with; 1/1000 Munc18 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Labs); 1/1000 SNAP-25 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Labs); 1/500 VAMP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Synaptic Systems); 1/200 α-SNAP rabbit polyclonal (Santa Cruz); 1/1000 synaptotagmin mouse monoclonal antibody (Synaptic Systems); and 1/1000 complexin rabbit polyclonal (Synaptic Systems). Characterization of Syntaxin 1A Mutants Impaired in Binding to Munc18-1—Mutations within the loop between the N-terminal helices and the SNARE motif of syntaxin 1A such as L165A,E166A (henceforth referred to here as open syntaxin) create a constitutively open form of syntaxin 1 that is unable to effectively bind Munc18-1 (21Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Google Scholar). To be able to compare the effects of the disruption of Munc18-1 binding independently of the conversion to the open conformation we examined another previously described mutation that changes a residue in the SNARE motif (Fig. 1A) and is thus in a different structural domain. The mutation I223A or its equivalent in the Drosophila orthologue Rop either substantially reduces binding to Munc18-1 or has a partial effect in different studies based on analysis of binding of single concentrations of the syntaxin (18Wu M.N. Fergestad T. Lloyd T.E. He Y. Broadie K. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 1999; 23: 593-605Google Scholar, 40Wu M.N. Schulze K.L. Lloyd T.E. Bellen H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 196-199Google Scholar, 41Matos M.F. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 377-382Google Scholar, 42Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Google Scholar). We therefore, compared the binding of Munc18-1 to wild-type, open, and I233A GST-syntaxin 1 cytoplasmic domains in a sensitive, quantitative ELISA over a wide range of concentrations of Munc18-1. Wild type GST-syntaxin bound with high affinity (KD of 13 nm) comparable with that found in conventional pull-down assays (Fig. 1B). Binding of the open mutant was detectable but considerably reduced with the effect being because of a reduction in maximum binding rather than affinity. A weak interaction between the open syntaxin and Munc18-1 has been detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay (50Grote E. Carr C.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 439-451Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of syntaxin 1A (I233A) was essentially undetectable. On the other hand, the open and I233A mutations had no or relatively little effect on the binding of GST-syntaxin to another binding partner, Csp (Fig. 1C). Binding of α-SNAP was reduced to the I233A but not the open syntaxin mutant (Fig. 1D). The Ile233 residue is found on the outside of the SNARE motif in close contact with Munc18-1 (Fig. 1A) in the crystal structure of the complex (24Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Google Scholar) explaining the dramatic effect of this mutation on binding. It can be predicted that this mutation would be unlikely to affect the transition to the open conformation or binding to other SNARE proteins. To check the effect of this mutation on syntaxin 1 conformation, limited proteolysis with trypsin was carried out (39Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Google Scholar). Under these conditions wild-type GST-syntaxin 1A was cleaved to produce 29- and 10-kDa fragments. Whereas the open conformation mutant showed an increased susceptibility to trypsin with complete cleavage to the 10-kDa fragment (Fig. 2A), the I233A mutant was not reproducibly different than the wild-type protein. After trypsin digestion, the amount of protein remaining in the open syntaxin sample was only 23% of that for the wild-type syntaxin but in the case of the I233A mutant was 93% of wild-type syntaxin. This finding is consistent with a switch of the open but not the I233A mutant to a constitutively open conformation. Analysis of the effects of the mutations on the binding of the syntaxins to SNAREs or other interacting proteins was carried out using a pull-down assay in which a rat brain membrane extract was passed over the immobilized GST-syntaxins. Particular attention was paid to whether the Munc18-1 binding mutations would give similar or different changes in the interaction with other binding partners. Little or no nonspecific binding to control GST-loaded beads was detected (Fig. 2B). A similar amount of each of the bound GST-syntaxins was detected in silver-stained gels and close to the stoichiometric binding of Munc18-1 seen in the wild-type protein. Low levels of binding of Munc18-1 were observed with the open mutant but none to the I233A mutant confirming the data from the ELISA. The open mutant did not recruit any more SNARE proteins (SNAP-25 and VAMP) than the wild-type protein (Fig. 2C). The I233A mutation did not impair binding of other SNAREs and indeed more bound VAMP was detected. As observed in the ELISA, binding to α-SNAP of I233A syntaxin 1A but not the open mutant was reduced. No major differences were seen between the wild-type and the two mutants in the binding of synaptotagmin or complexins. As complexins only bind to the assembled SNARE complex (43McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Google Scholar, 44Pabst S. Hazzard J.W. Antonin W. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Rizo J. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19808-19818Google Scholar) this was presumably because of the presence of similar amounts of trimeric SNARE complexes becoming assembled on the beads. The only common difference in interactions between both the mutants and the wild-type syntaxin 1A was the loss of Munc18-1 binding. Expression of Syntaxin Mutants—The aim of these experiments was to express wild-type or mutant syntaxin 1A in chromaffin cells and examine their effects on exocytosis. We initially aimed to estimate the relative level of endogenous Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1A in chromaffin cells by Western blotting of samples containing a known number of chromaffin cells compared with recombinant proteins (Fig. 3A). From these data we estimated that the endogenous level of Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1A are ∼1 × 106 and 5 × 106 molecules/cells, respectively.

Calegari F. Taverna E. Longhi R. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3323-3332Google Scholar), and interaction with Sec1/Munc18 homologues in yeast has been shown to be required to prevent degradation of syntaxins (32Bryant N.J. James D.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3380-3388Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency with adrenal chromaffin cells (1-2%) is too low to allow quantification of protein expression above endogenous levels by Western blotting. We, therefore, examined expression in transfected HeLa cells. In these cells all of the syntaxin constructs were expressed to similar levels as single polypeptides with no evidence of proteolytic fragments (Fig. 3B). In chromaffin cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding EGFP and syntaxins, essentially all EGFP-positive cells showed a higher intensity of fluorescence because of anti-syntaxin 1A staining than EGFP-negative cells when using a low antibody concentration in immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4A).

It is also well known that ERKs phosphorylate a wide array of substrates distributed throughout distinct cellular locations such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell periphery, but the relative contribution of these compartmentalized signal components to the overall survival signal generated by activation of ERKs has yet to be established. To this end, we have utilized constitutively activated forms of ERK2, whose expression is restricted to the nucleus or to the cytoplasm, to investigate the consequences of compartmentalized activation of ERK in the survival of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells subjected to distinct apoptogenic stimuli. We show that cytoplasmic ERK2 activity protected against apoptosis caused by prolonged serum starvation, whereas ERK2 activation restricted to the nucleus antagonized apoptosis induced by the Bcr-Abl inhibitor STI571. On the other hand, neither cytoplasmic nor nuclear ERK2 activities were effective in counteracting apoptosis induced by UV light. These results demonstrate that the protective effects of ERK2 against defined apoptogenic stimuli are strictly dependent on the cellular localization where ERK activation takes place. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that the complex IκB-NFκB participates on ERK2-mediated survival mechanisms, in a fashion dependent on the cellular location where ERK2 is active and on the causative apoptogenic stimulus."

Since the Fas/FasL signaling pathway requires transcriptional induction of the FasL gene, elucidation of the precise mechanisms underlying regulation of FasL gene expression may provide useful molecular insights on tumor progression. We and others (Shin, E. C., Shin, J. S., Park, J. H., Kim, H., and Kim, S. J. (1999) Int. J. Cancer 82, 587–591; Lee, M. O., Kang, H. J., Cho, H., Shin, E. C., Park, J. H., and Kim, S. J.

Commun. 288, 1162–1168) have previously reported that hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays a role in the induction of FasL expression in hepatitis B virus-associated hepatoma. In the present study, we analyzed the potential cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate FasL promoter. We found that HBx induced activity of the reporter containing FasL promoter through binding site for Egr but not through NFAT or SP-1, which are known as strong activators of the FasL promoter in T-cells. Transient expression of antisense Egr-2 and antisense Egr-3 abolished expression of FasL, which further confirmed the role of Egr in the HBx-mediated FasL expression. Also we observed that HBx increased the transcriptional activity of Egr-2 and Egr-3 by enhancing expression as well as the transactivation function of these proteins. HBx interacted with Egr-2 and Egr-3 in vivo and enhanced binding of Egr to the co-activator, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein, which may explain the molecular mechanism by which HBx induced the transactivation function of Egr. Finally, we found that the carboxyl terminus of HBx was necessary and sufficient for FasL induction as well as activation of Egr. Taken together, our results show a novel mechanism by which HBx induces FasL gene expression that is mediated by enhancing transcriptional activity of Egr-2 and Egr-3.

The HBV genome consists of four overlapping open reading frames encoding DNA polymerase, HBV surface antigen, HBV core protein, and a regulatory X protein (HBx). Among these, HBx is considered one of the most important determinants in HBV-caused pathogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Diao J. Garces R. Richardson C.D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Murakami S. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 36: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 3Arbuthnot P. Capovilla A. Kew M. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 15: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HBx is distributed in cytoplasm but to some extent in nucleus, suggesting a dual function of the protein in modulating wide range of intracellular events of host cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Diao J. Garces R. Richardson C.D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Murakami S. J.

One function is related to its cytoplasmic localization that activates signal transduction cascades, including the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase, Src-dependent, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Diao J. Garces R. Richardson C.D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Murakami S. J.

Another function is related to the nucleus that modulates activity of the transcription apparatus including transcription factors such as activating protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), tumor suppressor p53, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (3Arbuthnot P.

Such pleiotropic effects of HBx may induce cell survival, proliferation, invasion/metastasis, and angiogenesis that contribute to the HBx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. The Fas receptor (Fas, Apo-1/CD95) and its ligand (FasL, CD95L) are transmembrane proteins of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors and ligands. Engagement of Fas by FasL triggers a cascade of subcellular events that result in apoptosis, which has a fundamental role in normal biology as well as pathophysiology in human (6Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). FasL was initially thought to be expressed only in cells of the lymphoid/myeloid series including T-cells and natural killer cells. Recently, it has been shown that FasL is expressed by non-lymphoid cells, where it contributes to immune privilege by inducing apoptosis in infiltrating lymphocytes (7Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). FasL is also expressed in human cancer cells such as colorectal cancer, melanomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas (8O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp.

The functional activity of tumor-derived FasL has been shown by the ability of various cancer cell lines to induce apoptosis in Fas-sensitive lymphoid cells in vitro, and there is substantial evidence that tumor-derived FasL has a similar role in vivo (8O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 9Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schroter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P.

FasL was strongly expressed in hepatic metastatistic tumors of colonic adenocarcinoma, which may facilitate the establishment of tumor metastases as well as colonization in the liver, where the indigenous Fas-expressing normal cells are sensitive to FasL (12Shiraki K. Tsuji N. Shioda T. Isselbacher K.J. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6420-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Expression of FasL is controlled primarily by transcription factors that bind and transactivate FasL gene promoter (13Kavurma M.M. Khachigian L.M. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of precise mechanisms underlying FasL gene expression may provide useful molecular insights on the human diseases associated with the Fas/FasL pathway. We and others (14Shin E.C. Shin J.S. Park J.H. Kim H. Kim S.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Lee M.O. Kang H.J. Cho H. Shin E.C. Park J.H. Kim S.J.

Transcriptional activation of an orphan nuclear receptor, Nur77, which is an important regulator of T-cell apoptosis is involved in the course of FasL expression by HBx (15Lee M.O. Kang H.J. Cho H. Shin E.C. Park J.H. Kim S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HBx induces interleukin-18 gene expression, which enhances FasL expression by increasing interferon-γ in HBx-expressing hepatoma cells (16Lee M.O. Choi Y.H. Shin E.C. Kang H.J. Kim Y.M.

However, the molecular details involved in the HBx-induced FasL expression have not been clearly illustrated. In the present investigation, therefore, we analyzed cis- and trans-acting factors that transactivate FasL promoter in response to HBx and demonstrated that Egr-2 and Egr-3 play a critical role in the up-regulation of FasL expression in liver cells. These results provide an important mechanism for the ability of HBx to escape from immune surveillance in development of the HBV-associated HCC.

A human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 (ATCC HB 8065), a human embryonal kidney cell line, 293 (ATCC CRL-1573), and a mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH-3T3 (ATCC CRL-1658), were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

The truncated constructs of HBx, HBxNT (aa 1–57) and HBxCT (aa 57–154) were constructed by inserting the corresponding PCR-amplified fragments into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pCMV-Myc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The VP16-fused HBx construct was constructed by inserting PCR-amplified full-length HBx into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pVP16 (Clontech). The eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding each Egr-1, Egr-2, or Egr-3 were described previously (20Sevetson B.R. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol.

The antisense (AS)-Egr-1, AS-Egr-2, and AS-Egr-3 were constructed by inserting the restriction fragments in reverse orientation into the pcDNA3.0(+) or pcDNA3.1(–)/Myc-His(A) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. The yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain linked to the full-length coding region of Egr-1, Egr-2, and Egr-3 was constructed by inserting PCR-amplified full-length fragments into the pM (Clontech). The green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged full-length Egr-2 and Egr-3 were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified full-length fragments into the pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). The FLAG-tagged full-length Egr-1 and Egr-3 were constructed by inserting corresponding PCR-amplified fragments into the p3XFLAG™7.1 (Sigma). All of the new construction was confirmed by sequencing. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—For transient transfection, Chang and Chang X-34 cells (8 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plate or 2 × 106 cells/60-cm2 dish), NIH-3T3 cells (4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plate or 8 × 105 cells/60-cm2 dish), or 293 cells (1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plate or 3 × 106 cells/100-cm2 dish) were seeded and incubated overnight. The cells were transfected with 2–4 μg of plasmid DNA using Polyfect® (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice, and whole cell lysates were obtained by subsequent centrifugation. 50 μg of protein from whole cell lysates was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Blocking was performed in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with specific antibodies against FasL, Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, cAMP-response element (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), hemagglutinin (HA), Myc, GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), FLAG (Sigma), or α-tubulin (Oncogene, Boston, MA). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratory, South San Fransisco, CA) were used, and immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Super Signal (Pierce). The protein concentration was quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of whole cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-GFP, anti-FLAG, or anti-Myc antibody. The resulting immunecomplex was precipitated by adding 40 μl of protein A-agarose slurry. The resulting immunecomplex was washed five times with lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with either anti-Myc, anti-CBP, or anti-GFP antibody. Reporter Gene Analysis—HepG2 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well culture plates and transfected with reporter plasmid (0.3 or 0.6 μg) and β-galactosidase expression vector (0.2 μg) in the presence or absence of HBx expression vectors using LipofectAMINEPlus® (Invitrogen) as described previously (4Yoo Y.G.

After 24 h of transfection, cells were lysed in the cell culture lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was determined using an analytical luminescence luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.). PCR reaction was performed with specific primers for Egr-1 (forward, 5′-GATGATGCTGCTGAGCAACG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCGGGTACTGGAGCGCTGT-3′), Egr-2 (forward, 5′-CCTTCACTTACATGGGCAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACGGATTGTAGAGAGTGGAG-3′), Egr-3 (forward, 5′-CGACTCGGTAGTCCATTAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCGTGGAAAGACACGGGCT-3′), HBx (forward, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGCTGCTAGGCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTAGGCAGAGGTG-3′), and β-actin (forward, 5′-CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGGCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′) as described previously (4Yoo Y.G.

HBx Induces Expression of the FasL Gene—Since the role of HBx is implicated in gene expression of FasL in HBV-associated HCC, we examined the expression level of FasL protein in the Chang X-34 cell line, in which expression of the HBx gene is under the control of an inducible doxycycline promoter (4Yoo Y.G.

Consistent with previous observations, the expression of HBx as well as FasL protein was significantly induced when Chang X-34 cells were treated with doxycycline (Fig. 1A) (15Lee M.O. Kang H.J.

Treatment with doxycycline alone did not induce expression of FasL in the parental Chang cells (data not shown). Since the induction of FasL was demonstrated to be achieved at the transcription level, we further characterized the FasL gene promoter, which controls FasL gene expression by distinct protein-DNA interactions (13Kavurma M.M. Khachigian L.M. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When a reporter gene containing a 2.3-kb fragment upstream of the FasL gene promoter was co-transfected with 10 ng of HBx expression vector into HepG2 cells, the FasL promoter reporter was activated about 3-fold, which was similar to that obtained by a treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, known activators of the FasL promoter (Fig. 1B) (21Holtz-Heppelmann C.J.

These results clearly showed that HBx induced FasL expression at the transcription level in liver cells. Delineation of HBx-responsive cis-Acting Elements in the FasL Promoter—The FasL promoter is transactivated by several cis-acting regulatory elements, such as binding sites for nuclear factors of activated T-cells (NFAT), SP-1, interferon response factor (IRF), and Egr as shown in Fig. 2A (19Mittelstadt P.R.

To delineate the HBx-responsive cis-acting element in the FasL gene promoter, we employed reporters containing serially deleted FasL promoter (Fig. 2A) (18Lee M.O. Kang H.J. Kim Y.M. Oum J.H. Park J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All of the reporters except one containing the fragment of nt –205 to –2 were activated by HBx as strongly as reporter containing full-length promoter (Fig. 2B). The results suggested that the putative HBx-responsive element located within the nt –271 to –205 region of the FasL promoter, which contained binding sites for NFAT, IRF, and Egr (19Mittelstadt P.R.

The binding of Egr-2 and Egr-3 to the Egr binding site in this region was shown previously to be important for FasL gene expression in T-cell receptor triggering by anti-CD3 antibody (19Mittelstadt P.R.

Therefore, we employed a reporter-containing mutation on this site to examine involvement of Egr in the FasL promoter activation (Fig. 3A) (19Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The reporter containing the fragment of nt –511 to –2 of FasL promoter, the 511mer-Luc, was activated by HBx, while the reporter containing the mutation on the Egr binding site, m511mer-Luc, completely lost the activity. To further confirm the involvement of Egr, we tested the HBx responsiveness of the reporter containing only 16 nt of the Egr binding site (nt –220 to –205) in the FasL promoter, the 16mer-Luc (Fig. 3C) (19Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The 16mer-Luc was activated by HBx with the same degree of the full-length FasL promoter, whereas the reporter-containing mutation on this Egr binding site, m16mer-Luc, was not (Fig. 3D). These results clearly showed that the Egr binding site located between nt –220 and –205 in the FasL promoter responded to HBx.Fig. 3HBx enhances transcriptional activity of the FasL promoter through binding site for Egr.

As shown in Fig. 4A, FasL protein expression was largely increased when Egr-3 was overexpressed. However, Egr-1 did not affect the FasL expression (Fig. 4A). Consistently, we observed that the 16mer-Luc was activated when Egr-2 or Egr-3, but not Egr-1, was transfected (Fig. 4B).

Here, we identify a role of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs) in regulation of murine SP-D gene (Sftpd) transcription. An NFAT-dependent enhancer modulated by NFATs or calcineurin and sensitive to cyclosporin was identified in the Sftpd promoter. Ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate further increased the activity of this enhancer, whereas VIVIT, a potent NFAT inhibitor peptide, selectively interfered with the calcineurin-NFAT interaction and abolished enhancer function. Gel supershift and DNase I protection assays identified DNA elements that bind NFAT in the Sftpd promoter. Calcineurin and NFATc3 proteins were detected in the embryonic and adult mouse lung epithelium, and the mRNA expression profiles of the NFATs were similar in immortalized mouse lung epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial type II cells. NFATc3 and TTF-1 activated the Sftpd promoter, synergized transcription, co-immunoprecipitated from mouse lung epithelial cells, and physically interacted in vitro. Components of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway were identified in respiratory epithelial cells of the lung that potentially augment rapid assembly of a multiprotein transcription complex on Sftpd promoter inducing SP-D expression.

In the lung, SP-D is synthesized and secreted primarily by type II and other nonciliated bronchiolar respiratory epithelial cells (2Madsen J. Kliem A. Tornoe I. Skjodt K. Koch C. Holmskov U. J.

In addition, SP-D influences surfactant homeostasis, reduces alveolar macrophage apoptosis, stimulates a variety of immune cells, and enhances oxygen radical production (13Yoshida M. Korfhagen T.R.

SP-D binds alveolar macrophages and circulating leukocytes (17Crouch E.C. Persson A. Griffin G.L. Chang D. Senior R.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

SP-D stimulates immune cell activity following exposure to pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition. Increased expression in the lungs of transgenic mice enhanced host defense function and decreased inflammatory responses following exposure to pulmonary pathogens (7Gardai S.J. Xiao Y.Q. Dickinson M.

Thus, SP-D plays a role as a surveillance molecule that facilitates killing and clearance of pathogens, serving to control inflammatory responses.Despite the important protective roles of SP-D in pulmonary homeostasis, transcriptional regulation of SP-D is poorly understood. Recently, a role for SP-1-like transcription factors has been implicated in regulation of the human SP-D gene (SFTPD) promoter, but the identity of these factors is unknown (24He Y. Crouch E.C.

Mutation of DNA binding sites for forkhead transcription factors FoxA1 and FoxA2 decreased transcription of SFTPD. In contrast, TTF-1 did not activate its expression in H441 cells in vitro (24He Y.

In mouse and rat lung, SP-D mRNA is first detected at midgestation and increases abruptly before birth and during the immediate postnatal period (25Ogasawara Y. Kuroki Y. Tsuzuki A. Ueda S. Misaki H.

Glu-cocorticoid treatment in utero precociously increased SP-D mRNA and accelerated lung maturation.

These observations and other data support the concept that SP-D is rapidly induced following lung injury, perhaps serving a protective role by modulating inflammation and enhancing host defense. Strikingly, Sftpd proximal promoter revealed cis-elements for C/EBPs, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), AP-1, and the signal transducers and activators of transcription family of transcription factors that are known to rapidly activate transcription of a large number of genes during an effective immune response in several organs (39Poli V.

In addition, several TTF-1 sites were identified that may play critical roles in SP-D transcription following lung injury (42Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Since, SP-D expression is induced following lung injury and exposure to IL-4 and IL-13, we speculated that the calcineurin pathway, known to regulate T cell activation (43Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar) mediated by dephosphorylation of NFATs, may be operative in the regulation of SP-D expression. Calcineurin is a heterodimeric Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase activated by calcium ionophores such as ionomycin and inhibited by cyclosporin and tacrolimus (FK-506). It consists of one catalytic (CnA) and one regulatory (CnB) subunit (44Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Changes in expression of cytokines and other immunomodulatory molecules activate T-cell receptors, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, activating calcineurin. Once activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT and translocates them into the nucleus. NFATs bind cooperatively with other nucleoproteins to promoters of target genes to induce transcription (41Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A.

Using TRANSFEC (Biobase; Biologische Datenbanken GmbH, Wolfenbüttel, Germany), a promoter sequence analysis and data base program, the Sftpd promoter was identified from a 5.7-kb Sftpd genomic clone (a kind gift from Dr. T. Korfhagen, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH) that contained a 3-kb sequence upstream of the first exon that included a consensus TATA box. A 679-bp BtgI fragment (+79 to –600 bp) was Klenow end-filled and cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-basic, the correct orientation was determined, and it was used to generate a series of promoter deletion mutants by PCR cloning bp +79 to –557, –357, –246, –167, and –82 into NheI and XhoI sites of pGL3-basic (see Table I for primers used). Rat TTF-1 expression plasmid pRC-CMV-TTF-1 was provided by Dr. R. DiLauro (Naples, Italy). Full-length human NFATc3 (the original clone from Nakoi Aroi), NFATc4 with a 3.1-kb cDNA containing the ORF cloned in the KpnI and NotI site in expression vector pREp4, constitutively active (CA) CA-NFATc3 and CA-NFATc4 in pAC-CMV pLpA-5+ expression vector, and constitutively active calcineurin (pECE-FLAG-ΔCnA) were provided by Dr. J. Molkentin (Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VIVIT expression plasmid containing an in-frame ORF for peptide sequence MAGPHPVIVITGPHEE fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein in pEGFP.N1 (Clontech), was a kind gift from Dr. A. Rao (Harvard University, Boston, MA). pcDNA3.1 with CMV promoter (Invitrogen) and pCMV β-galactosidase (Clontech) vectors were used to normalize DNA and transfection efficiency, respectively.

A series of Sftpd promoter-luciferase constructs were used in transient transfection assays using Fugene 6 at a DNA/Fugene ratio of 1:2 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 6-well plates at 30–50% confluence were transfected with a fixed amount of Sftpd promoter-luciferase plasmid and various amounts of CMV-based cDNA expressing transactivator plasmids. For co-transfection experiments, the promoter-reporter plasmid was kept at 15 ng/well unless stated otherwise. Total DNA was normalized with corresponding CMV-empty vectors, and transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity using 100 ng/well of pCMV β-galactosidase. Two days after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using 20 μl of the supernatant according to a previous protocol (47Liu C. Glasser S.W. Wan H. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4519-4525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The light units were assayed by luminometry (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Data obtained represent the average of three transfection experiments, each carried out in duplicate (n = 6) and depicted as means ± S.D. unless stated otherwise.Isolation of RNA and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—MLE-15 cells grown in a T75 flask to 80% confluence were washed and suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 2.5 ml of cells were pelleted at 3,000 rpm and lysed in 0.5 ml of 1× RNA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) by 2 min of vigorous vortexing. Total RNA was extracted in 100 μl of 5 m ammonium acetate (Ambion), 2 μl of glycogen and 600 μl of acid phenol/chloroform (5:1) solution, pH 4.5 (Ambion), precipitated in 2 volumes of ethanol, washed in 70% ethanol, dried, and suspended in 60 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. 10 μl of RNA suspension was reverse transcribed for first strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II-RT, with procedures provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA from purified mouse alveolar epithelial type II cells (AE II) was kindly provided by Dr. John Shannon (Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). AE II cells were prepared from 6-week-old female C57B/6 mice as described previously (48Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). RT products were produced by PCR using primers described in Table I. Primers and reaction conditions were optimized using cDNA made from reverse transcribed total RNA of adult mouse lung. In studies of mouse alveolar type II cells (AE II cells), PCR was performed on RT product using Amplitaq Gold DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min for the denaturation cycle and 35 cycles at 95 °C (30 s), 58 °C (30 s) annealing, and 72 °C for extension, with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. β-Actin was used as a positive control. Reactions containing RNA that was not reverse transcribed were used as a control to detect genomic DNA contamination.Immunohistochemistry of Embryonic and Adult Lungs—Embryos were obtained at different gestational stages, processed according to previous methods (49Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and embedded in paraffin. For adult lung tissues, lungs were inflation fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 25-cm water pressure and processed for paraffin embedding. Serial 5-μm sections were prepared for adult lung. For fetal lung, whole embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned at 5-μm intervals. To detect the regulatory subunit calcineurin B1 (CnB1), anti-mouse CnB1 rabbit polyclonal antitibody (PA3-025; Affinity Bioreagents, Goldon, CO) at a 1:500 dilution as primary antibody and anti-rabbit IgG made in goat as secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) were used, respectively, for immunohistochemistry as described previously (50Mucenski M.L. Wert S.E. Nation J.M. Loudy D.E. Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40231-40238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Biotinylated secondary antibodies and a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system (Vector Laboratories) were used to localize the antibody-antigen complexes in the tissues, as previously described (51Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). A mouse-on-mouse blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) was used with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies for NFATc3, (F-1, SC-8405X) at 1:100 dilution. Antigen detection was enhanced with nickel-diaminobenzidine and Tris-cobalt, followed by counterstaining with Nuclear Fast Red.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Nuclear extract from MLE-15 cells were prepared as previously described (52Baker D.L. Dave V. Reed T. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except that nuclear extracts were stored before dialyses. 32P-Labeled double-stranded DNA probes were made by a Klenow end-filling reaction using [α-32P]dCTP. EMSAs were performed by incubating 10 nm double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the –130 (NFAT-I) and –170 (NFAT-II) sites (see Table I for oligonucleotide sequences) with 3.5 μl (∼15 μg) of nuclear extract for 40 min at 4 °C in 30 μl of binding buffer (15 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.9) with 1 μg of poly(dI)·poly(dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and reactions were electrophoresed on a 4%, 0.5× TBE native polyacrylamide gel at room temperature for 2–3 h at 150 V. Unlabeled competitor double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, NFAT-I and NFAT-II from the Sftpd promoter, TTF-1 (Oligo-C), with a strong TTF-1 binding site from the rat thyroglobulin gene (rTg) promoter spanning –82 to –56 bp (53Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and a strong NFAT site-containing oligonucleotide from the IL-2 promoter (54Molkentin J.D.

Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar) were added at a 100-fold molar excess. Antibody supershift assays were carried out in the same buffer by the further addition of 2 and 4 μl of either anti-NFATc3 antibodies (SC-1152X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or albumin as mock, and the reaction continued at 4 °C for 1 h. Gels were autoradiographed to detect specific DNA-protein complex formation.DNase I Footprinting—DNA fragment spanning the –246 to +79 bp region of the Sftpd promoter was subjected to DNase I reaction (see Fig. 4B) using MLE-15 nuclear extracts. The (TG)n region in the –246/+79 Sftpd promoter had four nucleotides (ACAC) less than the original promoter (GenBank™ accession number AF047742) as confirmed by sequencing. The Sftpd promoter (–246/+79) cloned in pGL3 was digested with NheI and labeled at the 3′-end using [α-32P]dCTP (6,000 Ci/mmol) in a Klenow reaction, DNA-purified, and released with XhoI. The DNase I footprinting assay contained 10 fmol (∼5,000 cpm) of the end-labeled fragment in 200 μlof1× binding buffer (52Baker D.L. Dave V. Reed T. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) containing 150- and 300-μg nuclear extracts, and a protein binding reaction was carried out for 30 min at 4 °C. DNase I reaction conditions and purification of digested DNA were as described previously (52Baker D.L. Dave V. Reed T. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Samples were heat-denatured and loaded on to an 8% sequencing gel. DNA ladders for G and A + G were made by Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing.Glutathione S-Transferase GST Pull-down Assays—Full-length GST-TTF-1 fusion protein was made in two steps. TTF-1 cDNA was first PCR-amplified with a stop codon from pRC-CMV-TTF-1, digested, and subcloned into EcoRI and HindIII sites (see Table I for primer details) within the multiple cloning sites of pCMV-Tag 2A vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). TTF-1 cDNA was then excised from pCMV-Tag 2A with EcoRI and SalI and ligated in frame between the same enzyme sites in pGEX-4T-3, a bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences), and sequenced. The GST-TTF-1 deletion constructs were made from a series of pVP16-TTF-1 plasmids (47Liu C. Glasser S.W. Wan H. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4519-4525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing TTF-1 deletion derivatives were digested with XbaI and Klenow end-filled before cutting with BamHI. The DNA fragments were then subcloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites in pGEX-5X-2, a bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids were transformed into BL21-DE3 bacterial strains for protein expression. GST fusion protein expression, cell lysis, and immobilization of proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads were performed as described previously"

Subunit NuoA (ND3, Nqo7) is one of the seven membrane domain subunits that are considered to be involved in H+(Na+) translocation. We demonstrated that in the Paracoccus denitrificans NDH-1 subunit, Nqo7 (ND3) directly interacts with peripheral subunits Nqo6 (PSST) and Nqo4 (49 kDa) by using cross-linkers (Di Bernardo, S., and Yagi, T.

To investigate the structural and functional roles of conserved charged amino acid residues, a nuoA knock-out mutant and site-specific mutants K46A, E51A, D79N, D79A, E81Q, E81A, and D79N/E81Q were constructed by utilizing chromosomal DNA manipulation. In terms of immunochemical and NADH dehydrogenase activity-staining analyses, all site-specific mutants are similar to the wild type, suggesting that those NuoA site-specific mutations do not significantly affect the assembly of peripheral subunits in situ. In addition, site-specific mutants showed similar deamino-NADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity to the wild type. The K46A mutation scarcely inhibited deamino-NADH-Q reductase activity. In contrast, E51A, D79A, D79N, E81A, and E81Q mutation partially suppressed deamino-NADH-Q reductase activity to 30, 90, 40, 40, and 50%, respectively. The double mutant D79N/E81Q almost completely lost the energy-transducing NDH-1 activities but did not display any loss of deamino-NADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity. The possible functional roles of residues Asp-79 and Glu-81 were discussed.

Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Google Scholar). This enzyme represents the first step of the respiratory chain and links the electron transfer from NADH to quinone with the translocation of protons from the cytoplasmic phase to the periplasmic phase (1Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of H+/2e– is considered to be 4 (2Galkin A.S. Grivennikova V.G. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 157-161Google Scholar). The resulting membrane potential is utilized to drive energy required for processes like ATP synthesis or solute transport (3Anraku Y. Gennis R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 262-266Google Scholar). Although mammalian mitochondrial complex I is composed of 46 unlike subunits (4Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Google Scholar), bacterial counterparts contain 14 different subunits (designated Nqo1–14 for Paracoccus denitrificans and Thermus thermophilus and NuoA-N for Escherichia coli) 2For simplicity, the E. coli terminology was mainly used throughout this paper. Bovine naming was also used as needed for clarity. (5Friedrich T. Abelmann A. Brors B. Guénebaut V. Kintscher L. Leonard K. Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Schlitt A. Schulte U. Weiss H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 215-219Google Scholar, 6Yagi T. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Google Scholar). The bacterial NDH-1 contains cofactors (one FMN and 8–9 iron-sulfur clusters) akin to complex I (7Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Google Scholar, 8Yano T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28606-28611Google Scholar). Topological studies suggest that the NDH-1 can be divided into two sectors, the peripheral segment and the membrane segment (9Di Bernardo S. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 385-388Google Scholar). The peripheral segment is composed of 7 subunits (NuoB, -C, -D, -E, -F, -G, and -I). In the case of the E. coli NDH-1, subunits NuoC (30 kDa) and -D (49 kDa) are fused and form NuoCD. Among these peripheral subunits, the NuoB (PSST) and NuoI (TYKY) subunits are recognized to act as connector subunits between the peripheral and membrane segments (9Di Bernardo S. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 385-388Google Scholar, 10Yano T. Magnitsky S. Sled′ V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28598-28605Google Scholar). The membrane segment also consists of seven subunits (NuoA, -H, and -J–N) (11Di Bernardo S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9411-9418Google Scholar, 12Kao M.-C. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4377-4384Google Scholar, 13Kao M.-C. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4534-4543Google Scholar), which are homologues of mtDNA-encoded subunits (ND1-6 and 4L) (14Chomyn A. Mariottini P. Cleeter M.W. Ragan C.I. Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Doolittle R.F. Attardi G. Nature. 1985; 314: 591-597Google Scholar, 15Chomyn A. Cleeter M.W. Ragan C.I. Riley M. Doolittle R.F. Attardi G. Science. 1986; 234: 614-618Google Scholar). The peripheral segment protrudes into the cytoplasmic phase and is believed to house all the known cofactors (1Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Google Scholar). In contrast, the membrane domain is most likely involved in H+ (or Na+) translocation and inhibitor and quinone binding (16Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Sakamoto K. Matsuno-Yagi A. Miyoshi H. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 746-754Google Scholar, 17Gong X. Xie T. Yu L. Hesterberg M. Scheide D. Friedrich T. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25731-25737Google Scholar, 18Steuber J. J. Biol.

In recent years, complex I, in particular the mitochondrially encoded subunits, received much attention because of their involvement in many mitochondrial diseases (including sporadic Parkinson's disease) (20Robinson B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 271-286Google Scholar, 21Greenamyre J.T. Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Panov A.V. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 135-141Google Scholar). It is known that point mutations of the ND1/nuoH, ND4/nuoM and ND6/nuoJ genes are associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and suppress the respiratory chain activity of complex I (22Majander A. Finel M. Savontaus M.L. Nikoskelainen E. Wikström M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 201-207Google Scholar, 23Carelli V. Ghelli A. Bucchi L. Montagna P. De Negri A. Leuzzi V. Carducci C. Lenaz G. Lugaresi E. Degli Esposti M. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 320-328Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that the defects of the ND5/NuoL subunit are involved in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome and other encephalomyelopathies (24Crimi M. Galbiati S. Moroni I. Bordoni A. Perini M.P. Lamantea E. Sciacco M. Zeviani M. Biunno I. Moggio M. Scarlato G. Comi G.P. Neurology. 2003; 60: 1857-1861Google Scholar). A single point mutation (T10191C, this mutation substitutes Pro for Ser-45, human numbering) of the ND3/NuoA subunit has been reported to substantially reduce the activity of complex I and to be associated with a progressive clinical picture of epilepsy, strokes, optic atrophy, and cognitive decline (25Taylor R.W. Singh-Kler R. Hayes C.M. Smith P.E. Turnbull D.M. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 104-107Google Scholar). Recently, another point mutation (T10158C, this mutation replaces Ser-34 with Pro) of the ND3 subunit has been reported for infantile mitochondrial encephalopathy (26McFarland R. Kirby D.M. Fowler K.J. Ohtake A. Ryan M.T. Amor D.J. Fletcher J.M. Dixon J.W. Collins F.A. Turnbull D.M. Taylor R.W. Thorburn D.R. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 58-64Google Scholar). Although these studies provided evidence for the important role of these hydrophobic subunits, it is clear that a more systematic investigation is required to identify the key residues in the mechanism of action of complex I/NDH-1. In a previous paper (11Di Bernardo S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9411-9418Google Scholar), we determined the topology of the Paracoccus NuoA subunit. The Paracoccus NuoA subunit is composed of three transmembrane segments (designated TM1–3 from the N to the C terminus), and its N- and C-terminal regions are directed toward the cytoplasmic and periplasmic phases of the membrane, respectively (11Di Bernardo S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9411-9418Google Scholar). The predicted topology places two highly conserved carboxyl residues (Asp-79 and Glu-81, E. coli numbering) in the middle of the TM2 (11Di Bernardo S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9411-9418Google Scholar). More recently, our cross-linking study revealed direct interactions between subunits NuoA and NuoB and between subunits NuoA and NuoD (9Di Bernardo S. Yagi T.

The NuoB subunit is considered to bear the center N2, which shows the highest midpoint redox potential values of all known cofactors in the NDH-1 (1Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Google Scholar, 6Yagi T. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to clarify structural and functional roles of these conserved and protonated residues in the NuoA subunit. For this purpose, we have constructed mutants of the residues of interest by using a gene manipulation technique of the E. coli chromosomal NDH-1 operon and characterized these mutants. Mutants E51A, D79A, D79N, E81A, and E81Q showed a partial decrease in the activities of deamino-NADH oxidase and deamino-NADH-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB) reductase but retained the deamino-NADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity comparable with the wild type. In addition, whereas the D79N/E81Q mutant is similar to the wild type in terms of both NADH dehydrogenase activity staining and immunochemical analyses of native gels, the energy-transducing NDH-1 activities of this double mutant were almost completely inactivated. Materials—The pCRScript Cloning kit was from Stratagene. The gene replacement vector, pKO3 was a generous gift from Dr. George M. Church (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Materials for PCR product purification, gel extraction, and plasmid preparation were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Site-specific mutants were constructed using the GeneEditor mutagenesis kit from Promega (Madison, WI). The BCA protein assay kit and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate were from Pierce. NADH, deamino-NADH, DB, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin (Spc) were from Sigma. p-Nitroblue tetrazolium was from CalBiochem. Capsaicin 40 (cap-40) and pET(EcoNuoE) bearing the E. coli nuoE gene were kind gifts from Dr. Hideto Miyoshi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) and Dr. Judy Hirst (MRC, Cambridge, United Kingdom), respectively. Cloning and Mutagenesis of the E. coli nuoA Gene—The gene encoding the NuoA subunit together with a 1-kb DNA segment upstream and a 1-kb DNA segment downstream were cloned by PCR technology from E. coli DH5α. To generate the restriction sites SmaI/NotI and NotI/SalI the sense/antisense primers 5′-GGTACGCCCGGGAAATCCTGCGTTTTAATGATGAGG-3′ with 5′-ACCTCGCGCGGCCGCGACCGCCTAAAAACCGCC-3′ and 5′-TATCTGGCGGCCGCGTTCTTCGTTATCTTCGACGTTG-3′ with 5′-GTGTGCGTCGACGTTCGTCCATGCCGTGTAAGTC-3′, respectively, were used, where the underlined bases were altered from E. coli DNA, and the italicized bases represented the restriction site sequence. The spectinomycin-encoding gene from transposon Tn554 of Staphylococcus aureus (28Murphy E. Huwyler L. Freire Bastos M.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3357-3365Google Scholar) was cloned by the PCR technology using the sense primer 5′-CGGGGGCGGCCGCTCAGTGGAACGAAAACTCACG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AAGGAGCGGCCGCTTTCTATTTTCAATAGTTAC-3′ both containing a NotI restriction site represented by italicized bases. The DNA fragments and the Spc cassette were cloned in pCRScript and finally assembled in pKO3. In the same way the sense primer 5′-GCATTCAAGATCTTGGTTACGCCAGGAAAATCC-3′, which contains a BglII restriction site (italicized), was used together with the NotI-generating antisense primer to produce a DNA fragment that was cloned in pCRScript. Then the sense primer 5′-CCATGAATCGATGTGGCGTCC-3′, which contains a ClaI restriction site (italicized) was used together with the SalI-generating antisense primer to produce a DNA fragment used for the generation of nuoA point mutants. The DNA inserted in the pCRscript cloning plasmid was mutagenized with the mutagenesis primers shown in Table I. These fragments were also assembled in pCRScript and then cloned into pKO3.Table IPrimers for introduction of a site-specific mutation into E. coli NuoA subunitMutationMutagenic primer sequenceaUnderline indicates mutation.NuoA(K46A)5′-CACGCGCGAGGTCGGCAAACGTGCCGTTTG-3′NuoA(E51A)5′-GTGCCGTTTGCATCCGGTATC-3′NuoA(D79A)5′-GTTATCTTCGCCGTTGAAGCG-3′NuoA(D79N)5′-CGTTATCTTCAACGTTGAAGC-3′NuoA(E81A)5′-GTTATCTTCGACGTTGCCGCGCTGTATCTGTTCG-3′NuoA(E81Q)5′-CTTCGACGTTCAAGCGCTGTA-3′NuoA(D79N + E81Q)5′-CGTTATCTTCAACGTTCAAGC-3′a Underline indicates mutation. Open table in a new tab The first step of site-specific mutation of the nuoA gene of the E. coli NDH-1 operon was to construct a nuoA gene knock-out mutant. For this purpose, we employed the pKO3 system developed by Church and co-workers (29Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Google Scholar). In brief, the pKO3 vector contains a repA(Ts) (temperature-sensitive replication origin), a chloramphenicol-resistant gene (cat), and a Bacillus subtilis sacB gene encoding levansucrase. The pKO3 carrying nuoA-knock-out DNA was prepared as follows (see Fig. 1, a and b). DNA fragments, SmaI/NotI (1467 bp) and NotI/SalI (1269 bp), were amplified from E. coli chromosomal DNA by PCR and individually inserted in cloning vector pCRScript at the SrfI site as a blunt end fragment. A PCR-amplified spc cassette carrying NotI sites (1200 bp) was also inserted at the SrfI site of pCRScript. The two DNA fragments and the spc cassette were assembled in pKO3. The resulting plasmid, pKO3(nuoA::spc), lacks 90 bp of the nuoA gene, which have been replaced by the spc cassette. The pKO3 vectors carrying mutated nuoA genes were prepared as shown in Fig. 1, c–e. The R and L fragments were cloned as blunt end fragments at the SrfI site in pCRScript. First, the R fragments of 1544 bp in which a SalI site was introduced at the 3′-end by the PCR amplification were cloned in pCRScript (designated pCRScript-R) (see Fig. 1, c). The pCRScript-R was used to generate the nuoA mutants. Then the L fragment of 1015 bp containing BglII and NotI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was also cloned in pCRScript generating plasmid PCRScript-L (see Fig. 1, d). This plasmid was digested with HindIII/XhoI, blunted, and religated to remove a ClaI site in the multiple cloning site. The R fragments containing the mutations were isolated by ClaI and NotI (the latter is present in the multiple cloning site) and purified. The ClaI/NotI fragments were inserted into ClaI/NotI-cleaved pCRScript-L. The resulting plasmids were designated pCRScript-nuoA(mutants). Each DNA fragment containing nuoA mutations were then isolated by BglII/SalI digestion from the pCRScript constructs and transferred to integration plasmid pKO3 at the BamHI/SalI sites. The resulting plasmids are referred to as pKO3-nuoA (mutants) (see Fig. 1, e). Preparation of Knock-out and Mutant Cells—E. coli strain MC4100 (F–, araD139, Δ(arg F-lac)U169, ptsF25, relA1, flb5301, rpsL 150.λ–) was transformed with pKO3 (nuoA::Spc) plasmid, and recombination was carried out as described in Link et al. (29Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Google Scholar). In brief, several well isolated colonies from LB agar plates containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml Spc, grown overnight at 30 °C, were transferred into 100 μl of LB and serially diluted. The dilutions corresponding to 104–106 were then plated on LB agar plates containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml Spc, prewarmed at 43 °C and grown overnight. The next day again several colonies (typically 5) were transferred from the 43 °C plates into 100 μl of LB, serially diluted, and plated on LB agar plates containing 5% sucrose at 30 °C overnight. The surviving colonies were then replica-plated on LB agar plates containing 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol and on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml Spc and grown at 30 °C overnight. Colonies sensitive to chloramphenicol but resistant to Spc were used for the PCR amplification of the nuoA region using the 5′-oligonucleotide CTGAACATGGCATTCAAC (chro5′) and the 3′-oligonucleotide AAGGAGCGGCGGCTTTCTATTTTCAATAGTTAC (spc3′). The chro5′ oligonucleotide was designed to amplify DNA from within the E. coli chromosome and the spc3′ oligonucleotide from within the Spc cassette. In this way the presence of the Spc cassette and its location in the genomic DNA was confirmed. The knocked-out MC4100 cells where then stored as glycerol stocks at –80 °C. Knocked-out MC4100 competent cells were then employed to introduce nuoA mutated DNA in the E. coli genome using a similar procedure except that the identification of recombinants was carried out by screening for spectinomycin sensitivity in addition to chloramphenicol sensitivity. To confirm the presence of the mutations, the sense oligonucleotide chro5′ and the antisense oligonucleotide CATACGCTCGCGGCGTG (nuoA3′), which is located inside the nuoA gene, were used as primers for PCR amplification of the nuoA DNA fragments. The nuoA DNA fragments produced were subjected to direct sequencing. Antibody Production—Antibodies directed against a 12-amino-acid oligopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of the E. coli NuoA subunit was produced as follows. An oligopeptide H-CNPETNSIAN-RQR-OH was synthesized (designated NuoAc) and conjugated to maleimide-activated bovine serum albumin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. It should be noted that, for the purpose of conjugation with bovine serum albumin, a cysteine residue was added to the N terminus. For raising antibodies specific to subunits NuoB, NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, and NuoI inclusion bodies of the overexpressed subunits were used as described previously (7Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Google Scholar). The antibodies were affinity-purified according to Han et al. (30Han A.-L. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 166-173Google Scholar). Cell Growth and Membrane Preparation—For the preparation of membranes suitable for enzymatic assays wild type, knock-out, and point mutants were grown in 250 ml of Terrific Broth medium until A600 was ∼2. The cells were then harvested in a GSA rotor at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended at 10% (w/v) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 15% (w/v) glycerol. The cell suspension was then passed once in a French press at 25,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged again in the GSA rotor at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell debris was discarded, and the supernatant was then ultracentrifuged in a 70Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and was used immediately for enzymatic activity measurements. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—To confirm the expression of the NDH-1 subunits Western blot experiments were carried out. Antibodies against the NuoAc and the peripheral subunits NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, and NuoI reacted with a 16-, a 20-, a 50-, a 91-, and a 21-kDa band of the E. coli membranes, respectively. Membranes were subjected to blue-native PAGE according to Schagger (31Schagger H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 190-202Google Scholar). Briefly, the cholate-treated E. coli membranes (800 μg of protein) were prepared as described previously (7Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Google Scholar) and resuspended in 40 μl of 750 mm aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bistris-HCl (pH 7.0). Then, 8 μl of 10% dodecylmaltoside and 50 μg/ml DNase were added, and the preparation was left on ice for 1 h. After the incubation on ice the samples were centrifuged at 149,000 × g in a Beckman Airfuge for 5 min. The supernatant was recovered (∼40 μl), and 16 μl of 5% Coomassie Blue in 500 mm aminocaproic acid was added to the samples. The samples were then loaded on a 7% gel and run in the cold room at 75 V until the dye entered the separating gel. Subsequently the voltage was raised to 200 V, and the gel was run for another 3 h. After completion of the electrophoresis the gel was incubated in 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 μm NADH and 2.5 mg/ml p-nitroblue tetrazolium at 37 °C for 2 h in a shaking incubator. The reaction was stopped with 7% acetic acid. Enzymatic Assay—It is recognized that deamino-NADH can be catalyzed by NDH-1/complex I but not NDH-2 (32Matsushita K. Ohnishi T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, deamino-NADH was used as a substrate. Deamino-NADH oxidase activity was spectrophotometrically assayed at 340 nm in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.15 mm deamino-NADH at 37 °C as described (33Yagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 302-311Google Scholar), using the E. coli membranes (80 μg of protein/ml). 10 μm cap-40 (34Satoh T. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 21-30Google Scholar) was used to inhibit the reaction. For the deamino-NADH-DB activity measurements, 10 mm KCN, 0.15 mm deamino-NADH, and 100 μm DB were routinely added to the assay mixture. Deamino-NADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity was assayed at 420 nm in the same buffer containing 10 mm KCN, 0.15 mm deamino-NADH, and 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6. The non-enzymatic activity of deamino-NADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase was subtracted from all measurements. The extinction coefficients used for activity calculations were ϵ340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1 for deamino-NADH and ϵ420 = 1.00 mm–1 cm–1 for K3Fe(CN)6. Other Analytical Procedures—Protein concentrations were estimated by the BCA protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard according to the manufacture's instruction. Any variations from the procedures and details are described in the figure legends. Strategy for Constructions of NuoA Mutants—The E. coli NDH-1 operon is predicted to be ∼15-kb long (35Yagi T. Di Bernardo S. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Kao M.-C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Zannoni D. Respiration in Archaea and Bacteria. Kluwer Publishings, Dordrecht2004: 15-40Google Scholar, 36Wackwitz B. Bongaerts J. Goodman S.D. Unden G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 876-883Google Scholar). Because this length does not allow incorporation of the whole operon into expression vectors, a site-specific mutation is traditionally carried out by complementation of a cassette-inserted gene with a mutated gene in the expression plasmid (designated in trans complementation) (37Kurki S. Zickermann V. Kervinen M. Hassinen I. Finel M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13496-13502Google Scholar, 38Amarneh B. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4800-4808Google Scholar, 39Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3055-3062Google Scholar, 40Chevallet M. Dupuis A. Lunardi J. Van Belzen R. Albracht S.P.J. Issartel J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 451-458Google Scholar, 41Lunardi J. Darrouzet E. Dupuis A. Issartel J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1407: 114-124Google Scholar, 42Flemming D. Schlitt A. Spehr V. Bischof T. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47602-47609Google Scholar, 43Kervinen M. Patsi J. Finel M. Hassinen I.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 773-781Google Scholar). However, the in trans complementation procedure presents some problems when applied to a gene cluster. For example, the cassette inserted in chromosomal DNA might interrupt the expression of the downstream genes (44Falk-Krzesinski H. Wolfe A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1174-1184Google Scholar). The only case that does not suffer this polar effect is when the mutated gene is at the last position in the operon (38Amarneh B. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4800-4808Google Scholar). Another problem is that the mutated gene is under the control of a promoter in the expression plasmid, which often leads to overexpression of the mutated subunit. In mutation studies of the NDH-1 using the in trans complementation, it has been reported that the enzyme activities were significantly low (∼20% of the wild type cells) even when the unmutated gene was used (42Flemming D. Schlitt A. Spehr V. Bischof T. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47602-47609Google Scholar, 43Kervinen M. Patsi J. Finel M. Hassinen I.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 773-781Google Scholar, 45Garofano A. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Okun P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42435-42440Google Scholar). An alternative method of site-directed mutation is to introduce mutations directly in chromosomal DNA as detailed in this work (designated chromosomal DNA mutation, see Fig. 1) (29Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Google Scholar, 42Flemming D. Schlitt A. Spehr V. Bischof T. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47602-47609Google Scholar). In this procedure, expression of all genes of the operon are regulated by the authentic promoter. Although chromosomal DNA mutation is laborious and time-consuming, we adopted this technique to produce NuoA mutants to minimize any complications derived from disruption of the operon. As anticipated, the NDH1 was apparently expressed at the same level in all mutants as in the wild type (see below). Sequence Analysis of the NuoA Subunit—Fig. 2A is an amino acid sequence comparison between the E. coli NuoA subunit and its counterparts of various organisms. In terms of hydropathy plots, the E. coli NuoA subunit is akin to its counterpart of P. denitrificans. Fig. 2B is a hypothetical topology of the E. coli NuoA subunit deduced from topological studies of the P. denitrificans NuoA subunit (11Di Bernardo S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9411-9418Google Scholar). The E. coli NuoA subunit is predicted to contain the three transmembrane segments (designated TM1–3 from N to C terminus). The N- and C-terminal regions are also predicted to be directed toward the cytoplasmic and periplasmic phases of the membrane, respectively. In addition, a long loop (L1) between TM1 and TM2 is exposed to the periplasmic side. As far as our data base search is concerned (more than 250 organisms), Asp-79 (E. coli numbering) is conserved except for its homologues of Cyanidium caldarium mitochondria (Asp-79 → C, CAA88774) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Asp-79 → G, D83410). On the other hand, Glu-81 is perfectly conserved. Asp-79 and Glu-81 (E. coli numbering) seem to be located in the middle of the TM2. Carboxyl residues are rarely located in the middle of TM of the hydrophobic polypeptides. Therefore, it has been generally recognized that carboxyl residues present in the TM may play important roles in cation translocation of the membrane-associated enzyme complexes (46Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Google Scholar, 47Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Google Scholar). One well known example is a perfectly conserved carboxyl residue in the center of a transmembrane helix of the N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-binding protein (also called subunit c or proteolipid subunit) of the ATP synthase (48Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5473-5479Google Sc"
https://openalex.org/W2027007190,"Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Neisseria meningitidis is the major inflammatory mediator that contributes to meningococcal pathogenesis. Variable attachments to the HepII residue of the LOS inner core together with the α-chain heterogeneity result in immunologically distinct LOS structures, which may be selected for during human infection. Lpt-3, a phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transferase, and LgtG, a glucosyltransferase, mediate the substitution of PEA or glucose at the O-3 position of HepII in L3 or L2 LOS immunotypes, respectively. Inactivation of a two-component response regulator, encoded by NMB0595, in N. meningitidis strain NMB resulted in the loss of all PEA decorations on the LOS inner core expressed by the NMB0595 mutant. When compared with the parental strain NMB that predominantly expresses L2 immunotype LOS and other minor LOS structures, the NMB0595 mutant expresses a pure population of a novel LOS structure completely substituted at the HepII O-3 position with glucose, but lacking other PEA decorations on the inner core. Quantitative real time PCR experiments showed increased transcription of lgtG in the NMB0595 mutant, and no significant change in lpt-3 transcription. Inactivation of lgtG resulted in LOS inner cores without glucose, but these structures, even though the lpt-3 transcription was unaffected, also lacked the O-3-linked PEA. Consistently, a double mutation of lgtG and misR in strain NMB yielded a LOS structure without PEA or Glc substitution of HepII.

The morbidity and mortality of meningococcal disease are equated with the levels of circulating endotoxin or lipooligosaccharide (LOS), 1The abbreviations used are: LOS, lipooligosaccharide; PEA, phosphoethanolamine; Glc, glucose; LPS, lipopolyssaccharide; OS, oligosaccharide; Hep, heptose; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcriptase; HF, hydrogen fluoride. which is released from the meningococcal cell surface as blebs (2Brandtzaeg P.

Not only does the LOS structure mediate the host proinflammatory response, LOS also influences colonization and resistance to killing by serum bactericidal activity (3Dunn K.L. Virji M. Moxon E.R.

Whereas a given meningococcal strain may express a dominant LOS immunotype, structures of other immunotypes are present in minor amounts. How variability in meningococcal LOS structure is produced is of considerable biological importance. The HepII residue of the meningococcal LOS inner core can be substituted with PEA at either the O-3 (L1, L3, L7, and L8 immunotypes) or O-6 position (L2, L4, and L6 immunotypes), whereas glucose (Glc) is found at the O-3 of HepII in two LOS immunotypes (L2 and L5 immunotypes) of N. meningitidis (Fig. 1).

Saunders N.J. Heidelberg J. Jeffries A.C. Nelson K.E. Eisen J.A. Ketchum K.A. Hood D.W. Peden J.F. Dodson R.J. Nelson W.C. Gwinn M.L. DeBoy R. Peterson J.D. Hickey E.K. Haft D.H. Salzberg S.L.

Both LptA and Dca share 27% identity and 42% similarity to Lpt-3 at the amino acid level. Located within the division cell wall gene cluster, dca has been implicated in transformation efficiency of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is phase variable (12Snyder L.A. Saunders N.J. Shafer W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). LptA has recently been identified as the PEA transferase specific for the lipid A head groups (13Cox A.D. Wright J.C. Li J. Hood D.W. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the O-6 PEA transferase, tentatively termed Lpt-6, has not been identified. LgtG is phase variable in meningococci and gonococci through a slipped-strand mispairing mechanism because of the presence of a poly(C) tract within the coding region (10Banerjee A. Wang R.

Two-component regulatory systems prevalent in prokaryotes (16Egger L.A. Park H. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) may coordinate expression of virulence determinants in bacterial pathogens. These signal transduction systems generally consist of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator protein (17Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Upon sensing specific signals, the histidine kinase autophosphorylates the conserved kinase domain, and the phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the cognate response regulator. The phosphorylation of the regulatory domain may modify the activity of the DNA-binding domain and the corresponding biological responses. Such systems have been shown to control various structural modifications of endotoxins. In Salmonella enterica var. Typhimurium, PhoP/Q regulates the aminoarabinose addition of the lipid A head groups of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the oxidation of a myristyl residue on lipid A (18Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, aminoarabinose modification and C16:0 acylation of lipid A has been shown to be controlled by a PhoP/Q homolog (19Ernst R.K. Yi E.C. Guo L. Lim K.B. Burns J.L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1999; 286: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One two-component regulatory system in Yersinia pestis reportedly controls the terminal modification of the lipooligosaccharide outer core by galactose or heptose (20Hitchen P.G. Prior J.L. Oyston P.C. Panico M. Wren B.W. Titball R.W. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1637-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Modulation of the endotoxin structure is correlated with changes in cytotoxicity and may be important in our understanding of the interaction of endotoxin with the innate immune system (21Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In comparison to other Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, N. meningitidis has a limited number of two-component regulatory systems. Genome sequence analysis revealed four pairs of two-component regulatory systems. One such system, NMB0595 (response regulator)/NMB0594 (histidine kinase), was originally designated phoP/phoQ by Johnson et al. (15Johnson C.R. Newcombe J. Thorne S. Borde H.A. Eales-Reynolds L.J. Gorringe A.R. Funnell S.G. McFadden J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that inactivation of the response regulator encoded by NMB0595 resulted in increased sensitivity to the cationic antimicrobial peptide, polymyxin B, which correlates with the loss of all PEA decorations from the LOS inner core HepII residue. We propose that this response regulator be renamed MisR (meningococcal inner core structure), and the corresponding histidine kinase (NMB0594) to be MisS because NMB0595 is not a phoP functional homologue. This is the first demonstration in N. meningitidis of a variation in the LOS structure modulated by an environmental sensing two-component regulatory system. Meningococcal strains were grown with 3.5% CO2 at 37 °C unless specified otherwise. GC base agar (Difco), supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 0.68 mm Fe(NO3)3, or GC broth with same the supplements and 0.043% NaHCO3 was used. BHI medium (37 g/liter brain heart infusion) with 1.25% fetal bovine serum was used when kanamycin selection was required. Antibiotic concentrations (μg/ml) used for E. coli strains were ampicillin, 100; kanamycin, 50; spectinomycin, 100; and erythromycin, 300; and for N. meningitidis were kanamycin, 80; erythromycin, 3; spectinomycin, 60; and tetracycline, 5. E. coli strain DH5α cultured on Luria Bertani (LB) medium was used for cloning and propagation of plasmids. Meningococci were transformed by the procedure of Janik et al. (22Janik A. Juni E. Heym G.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1976; 4: 71-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains were transformed by electroporation with GenePulser (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. misR—A unique HincII site was incorporated into misR by splice-overlap PCR. Two internal fragments of misR were amplified using the primer pairs 14323 (5′-CGAACTCGTTGACCGCATCAATGC-3′)/14322 (5′-GGTTTTCGGCAAGGGTGTTCTGC-3′) and 19143 (5′)-CCGCGTATTACTCGTAGA-3′)/14324 (5′-GCATTGATGCGGTCAACGAGTTCG-3′). Equal molar amounts of these products were mixed together and used as a template for PCR amplification using 14325 (5′-GTAGATGACGATGCCCTGCTGACC-3′) and 14320 (5′-GACAAACAGGTAGCCCAAGC-3′) primers. The internal fragment of misR containing the unique HincII site was cloned into the HincII site of pHSG576 to form pJKD2537. The ermC′ marker was liberated from pAErmC′G (23Zhou D. Apicella M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 133-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by BamHI and NotI. The fragment was subsequently polished using T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolab) and ligated into the HincII site of pJKD2537 to form pJKD2538. The tetM cassette from Tn916 was amplified with primers 11209 (5′-GCGATATCCAAGCACTTTACAGC-3′) and tetM2 (5′-GAAAAGGATATCTCACGCTTTGC-3′), which contain EcoRV sites. The PCR product was purified, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into the HincII site of pUC18 to form pUC18tetM. This plasmid was digested with EcoRV and ligated to HincII-digested pJKD2537. Chloramphenicol- and tetracycline-resistant colonies were examined and the resultant construct, pJKD2539, containing misR::tetM was isolated. The plasmid was purified and used to transform N. meningitidis strain NMB using the plate transformation method (Kahler et al., Ref. 6Kahler C.M. Stephens D.S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 24: 281-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for resistance to erythromycin or tetracycline and correct transformants, named NMBmisR and NMBmisRT, were saved and further characterized. The inactivation of misR was confirmed by colony PCR using primers 14325 (5′-GTAGATGACGATGCCCTGCTGACC-3′) and 14659 (5′-TTGACAAACAGGTAGCCCAAGC-3′) and Southern blots. lgtG—An internal fragment of lgtG was amplified using lgtG1 (5′-GCAACCAACAACTTCAAACACG-3′) and lgtG2 (5′-CGTTCATGACCTCTGTACATGC-3′) primers. The PCR product was polished using T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into the unique HincII site of pHSG298 to create pCK48. The aphA-3 cassette was liberated from pUC18K (24Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) using EcoRI and BamHI followed by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase. The polished aphA-3 cassette was ligated into the unique BssHII site of the cloned lgtG fragment to produce pCK49. The purified plasmid was used to transform strain NMB and the transformants were selected by resistance to kanamycin. lptA—A PCR product was generated using primer pair NMB1638-1 (5′-AATGTCCATCAGCCCCAATA-3′)/NMB1638-2 (5′-TGTGCCGTCTAATTTCATCG-3′) and cloned into the pCR2.1 vector yielding pKA304. The spectinomycin cassette, digested from pHP45Ω (25Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) with SmaI, was cloned into the HincII site of pKA304 to generate pKA314. To generate the lptA mutant, pKA314 was linearlized with ScaI and the digestion mixture was used to transform strain NMB. Colonies were selected on GC agar plates with spectinomycin. Mutants were confirmed using colony PCR. Amplification with primers NMB1638-1/NMB1638-2 resulted in a 1.0-kb fragment from the parent and a 3.0-kb fragment in the mutants. Meningococcal chromosomal DNA was prepared according to the method of Nath (26Nath K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6462Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Genius 2 DNA labeling and detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to perform DNA hybridization. The digoxigenin-labeled probe for detecting misR was generated by the random primed labeling reaction with an internal coding sequence of misR as template, obtained with PCR amplification using primers YT45 (5′-CGTAGATGACGATGCCCTGCTAACCG-3′) and YT46 (5′-GGCGGATGCTGGAGA TGTGTACGTCG-3′). Chromosomal DNA was digested with HincII or EcoRV and resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane using a Turboblotter apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization and development of the Southern blots were performed following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Resistance to polymyxin B was ascertained by growth on a series of GC agar plates containing doubling amounts of polymyxin B (8 to 1,025 μg/ml). Three single colonies from mutant and wild type strains were patched onto the plates from the highest to the lowest concentration. The plates were incubated for 18 h and then scored for growth of each patch. This assay was repeated three separate times for consistency. In addition, broth cultures of mid-late exponential phase were diluted to equal cell density, and aliquots of 2 μl of cell suspension were spotted onto polymyxin B containing GC agar plates. Similar results were obtained by both methods. The LOSs were prepared using a modified version of the phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether extraction procedure and further purified as previously described (27Kahler C.M. Carlson R.W. Rahman M.M. Martin L.E. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tzeng Y.L. Datta A. Strole C. Kolli V.S. Birck M.R. Taylor W.P. Carlson R.W. Woodard R.W. Stephens D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24103-24113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The LOS samples were hydrolyzed in aqueous 1% acetic acid (10 ml) for 2 h at 100 °C. The hydrolysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was washed once with 5 ml of water and centrifuged again. The water wash was added to the supernatant, and any remaining lipid A was extracted with diethyl ether (three times, 5-ml volumes each time). The aqueous phase, containing the oligosaccharides (OSs) was lyophilized. The lyophilized OSs were dissolved in 0.5 ml of water, filtered with microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.45-μm pore size Nylon-66 membrane filters, applied to a Bio-Gel P-4 column (70 × 1.6 cm), and eluted with water containing 1% 1-butanol. Fractions were assayed for carbohydrate using the phenol-sulfuric acid assay. Preparation of LOS-hydrogen fluoride (HF), glycosyl composition analyses, and glycosyl linkage analyses were performed according to previously described procedures (27Kahler C.M. Carlson R.W. Rahman M.M. Martin L.E. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and mass spectrometry of LOS were described in Tzeng et al. (28Tzeng Y.L. Datta A. Strole C. Kolli V.S. Birck M.R. Taylor W.P. Carlson R.W. Woodard R.W. Stephens D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24103-24113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Lipid A was isolated from the LOS preparation by mild acid hydrolysis (29Caroff M. Tacken A. Szabo L. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 175: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Each sample, 1–2 mg, was prepared for NMR analysis by a 2-fold lyophilization from D2O, dissolved in D2O, and analyzed. NMR spectra were recorded on Varian 300 MHz spectrometers at 27 °C. The data were referenced to external 85% phosphoric acid (0.0 ppm). Bacterial strains grown in GC broth to mid-exponential phase was collected and the total RNA extracted using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA samples were further treated with DNase for 1 h at 37 °C to remove contaminating chromosomal DNA. The final preparation was tested with standard PCR amplification of a lipA internal fragment using primers CAS24 (5′-AAACGCATTGTGAAAAACGCC-3′) and CAS25 (5′-AAAGTGGTCAGCGGTTTGCC-3′) and RNAs as templates to ensure no DNA contamination was presented. Reverse transcriptions were carried out according to the procedure suggested by the manufactures (Gene Amp kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and reactions without the reverse transcriptase were used as the negative control. The double-strand DNA binding dye SYBR Green detection method was employed to quantify the amount of mRNA from the RT reactions (1 μg of total RNA) described above. Specific primer pairs were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Primers used were lgtG-5 (5′-CGCGCAAAGGTCTGGAACT-3′) and lgtG-3 (5′-GCAGGCTGGTATGTTCGAAAA-3′) for lgtG, NMB1638-F (5′-AACTTGAAAACCGCGACAT-3′) and NMB1638-R (5′-GGTCGGAAACATAATGCACCA-3′) for lptA, NMB0415-F (5′-ACCTGATGGGTTCGCACAGT-3′) and NMB0415-R (5′-GCGCATCCTTATCCAAACGT-3′) for dca, and NMB2010-F (5′-CCTGATTCACACGTTGGGCT-3′) and NMB2010-R (5′-CCTTCGCGACAACCTGAAAC-3′) for lpt-3. SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used in a 25-μl reaction volume with 0.2 μm each of 5′ and 3′ primers, and 2-fold diluted RT reaction mixtures as templates. Forty cycles of amplification (94 °C denaturation for 30 s, 55 °C annealing for 30 s, and 72 °C elongation for 30 s) were carried out, after an initial 3-min denaturation step at 95 °C for iTaq enzyme activation, in sealed 96-well microtiter plates using the iCycler (Bio-Rad). The calibration curve was generated by 10-fold serial dilutions of a linearlized plasmid solution (109 copies per μl) containing a cloned fragment encoding meningococcal ribosomal protein RpsE. The expression of rpsE was tested in multiple RNA samples isolated from mid-log phase cultures and shown to be highly expressed at a constant level, and thus it was used as an internal control in each experiment for normalization. RT negative control reactions were also analyzed to measure whether there was contaminating chromosomal DNA. Melting curve analyses were performed following each RT-PCR experiment to ensure that each reaction contained only a single specific product. The relative change in transcription level between the mutant strain and the wild type strain was calculated as the ratio between the copy number of the gene of interest in the RNA isolated from the mutant strain divided by the copy number obtained from the RNA preparation of the parent strain. The -fold of changes for each gene of interest was subsequently normalized to that obtained for rpsE expression, which varied less than 2-fold. Each gene was examined in four replicates and was repeated with at least two independent preparations of RNA. Student's t test with a two-tailed hypothesis was used to determine the significant difference (p < 0.01) between two variables in these studies. In those experiments that used lpxA as a normalizer, real time RT-PCR was carried out using an ABI PRISM model 7700 sequence detection system. Known concentrations of NMB genomic DNA was used to construct a gene-specific standard curve so that the concentration of template in each reaction could be determined. Melting curve analysis confirmed that all RT-PCRs amplified a single product. Primers used were DAP99 (5′-ACCCCATCTTGTCGATCAACA-3′) and DAP100 (5′-GAGCGAGCCGACTTGAAAAG-3′) for lgtG, DAP137 (5′-GGACTGCTGATGGCGTACATC-3 ′) and DAP138 (5′-CCATGCCGTTGCCTAAGATT-3′) for NMB0594, DAP232 (5′-GCCCAAACCCTCGAACATG-3′) and DAP233 (5′-GGGTTTTTGTGTTTCAGGTATGC-3′) for NMB0593, and DAP135 (5′-CGTTTTGGGCGGCTACAC-3′) and DAP136 (5′-GGCGGTCATGGCGTAGTC-3′) for lpxA. The transcription level of each gene of interest in each strain was first normalized against the lpxA expression level. An averaged copy number for each gene was taken from 2 biological replicates. Generation and Characterization of NMB0595 Mutant—The genome of strain MC58 was compared with the receiver domain sequence of the two-component regulatory systems and one open reading frame, NMB0595, was identified to encode a homologue of the response regulator family. NMB0595 was predicted to encode a 225-amino acid protein with a C-terminal winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain homologous to the OmpR subfamily of response regulators (30Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2475) Google Scholar). The critical amino acid residues forming the active site of the response regulator are present at the respective conserved location in NMB0595 (Asp-9, Asp-10, Asp-52, Thr-79, and Lys-101). Immediately downstream of the response regulator was a homologue of the histidine kinase, NMB0594 (Fig. 2A). Sequence analysis of NMB0594 predicted that it contains two N-terminal transmembrane domains and a large periplasmic loop. Two large proteins flank this two-component regulatory system: NMB0596, a putative integral membrane protein and NMB0593, an 808-amino acid protein with a putative acetyltransferase domain (PF00583, Pfam data base) at the C terminus. Various two-component regulatory systems in several bacteria mediate LPS structural changes and result in enhancement of resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides when activated (18Guo L.

To examine whether this phenotype correlated with a change in the structure of lipooligosaccharide in meningococci, the response regulator gene was mutated in our laboratory isolate, strain NMB, in which the LOS biosynthesis pathway has been comprehensively examined in conjunction with detailed structural analyses of LOS structures produced by mutations within this pathway (5Kahler C.M. Martin L.E. Shih G.C. Rahman M.M. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5939-5947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kahler C.M. Carlson R.W. Rahman M.M. Martin L.E. Stephens D.S. J.

Two mutations in NMB0595 were constructed with either an erythromycin or tetracycline antibiotic resistance cassette inserted into misR. The plasmid constructs containing these cassettes were transformed into strain NMB and the correct transformants, named NMBmisR and NMBmisRT, in which the cassettes had recombined into the genome were confirmed by colony PCR and Southern blots (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown) and further characterized. The polarity of these cassettes on the expression of genes downstream of misR, misS (NMB0594) and NMB0593, was determined by quantitative real time PCR. The transcription of these two genes was first normalized to that of lpxA, encoding the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase involved in lipid A biosynthesis (39Crowell D.N. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the -fold of changes in relative expression values for the mutant strains were determined by comparison to the expression value obtained for the wild type parent strain NMB. Based upon two biological replicates for NMBmisR, NMBmisRT and NMB, we determined that the expression of NMB0594 decreased by less than 2-fold"
https://openalex.org/W2086312214,"We present an NMR investigation of the nucleotide-dependent conformational properties of a 44-kDa nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of an Hsp70 protein. Conformational changes driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis in the N-terminal NBD are believed to allosterically regulate substrate affinity in the C-terminal substrate binding domain. Several crystal structures of Hsc70 NBDs in different nucleotide states have, however, not shown significant structural differences. We have previously reported the NMR assignments of the backbone resonances of the NBD of the bacterial Hsp70 homologue Thermus thermophilus DnaK in the ADP-bound state. In this study we show, by assigning the NBD with the ATP/transition state analogue, ADP.AlFx, bound, that it closely mimics the ATP-bound state. Chemical shift difference mapping of the two nucleotide states identified differences in a cluster of residues at the interface between subdomains 1A and 1B. Further analysis of the spectra revealed that the ATP state exhibited a single conformation, whereas the ADP state was in slow conformational exchange between a form similar to the ATP state and another state unique to the ADP-bound form. A model is proposed of the allosteric mechanism based on the nucleotide state altering the balance of a dynamic equilibrium between the open and closed states. The observed chemical shift perturbations were concentrated in an area close to a previously described J-domain binding channel, confirming the importance of that region in the allosteric mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2161167753,"WW domains mediate protein recognition, usually though binding to proline-rich sequences. In many proteins, WW domains occur in tandem arrays. Whether or how individual domains within such arrays cooperate to recognize biological partners is, as yet, poorly characterized. An important question is whether functional diversity of different WW domain proteins is reflected in the structural organization and ligand interaction mechanisms of their multiple domains. We have determined the solution structure and dynamics of a pair of WW domains (WW3–4) from a Drosophila Nedd4 family protein called Suppressor of deltex (Su(dx)), a regulator of Notch receptor signaling. We find that the binding of a type 1 PPPY ligand to WW3 stabilizes the structure with effects propagating to the WW4 domain, a domain that is not active for ligand binding. Both WW domains adopt the characteristic triple-stranded β-sheet structure, and significantly, this is the first example of a WW domain structure to include a domain (WW4) lacking the second conserved Trp (replaced by Phe). The domains are connected by a flexible linker, which allows a hinge-like motion of domains that may be important for the recognition of functionally relevant targets. Our results contrast markedly with those of the only previously determined three-dimensional structure of tandem WW domains, that of the rigidly oriented WW domain pair from the RNA-splicing factor Prp40. Our data illustrate that arrays of WW domains can exhibit a variety of higher order structures and ligand interaction mechanisms.

The domains are connected by a flexible linker, which allows a hinge-like motion of domains that may be important for the recognition of functionally relevant targets. Our results contrast markedly with those of the only previously determined three-dimensional structure of tandem WW domains, that of the rigidly oriented WW domain pair from the RNA-splicing factor Prp40. Our data illustrate that arrays of WW domains can exhibit a variety of higher order structures and ligand interaction mechanisms. WW domains are small protein interaction modules found in a wide range of eukaryotic signaling and structural proteins (1Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The domain is a small three-stranded β-sheet stabilized by the stacking of several conserved aromatic and proline residues (2Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Differences in residue identity at the binding surface result in a variation in ligand specificity that is used as the basis to divide WW domains into groups. For example, in group I WW domains that bind PPXY sequences (3Otte L. Wiedeman U. Schlegel B. Pires J.R. Beyermann M. Schmieder P. Krause G. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the Tyr is a key specificity residue and is accommodated by a largely hydrophobic pocket on the concave binding surface consisting of conserved Ile (or Val/Leu), His, and Gln (or Arg/Lys) residues. The Pro residues of the ligand contribute to the binding by stacking against the Trp and Tyr residues that form a second interaction site (4Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is evident that, since a number of proteins are likely to contain WW domain recognition sites, further factors most probably contribute to increasing affinity and specificity of a WW domain for a target. For example, the Pro-rich sequence in β-dystroglycan targeted by the dystrophin WW domain requires a composite binding surface provided by the WW domain and an adjacent EF hand (4Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The binding of murine Nedd4 to the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel requires direct involvement of two of its three WW domains (5Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Jolliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Indeed, WW domains often exist in multiple numbers within a protein. Multiple modules may act in concert to achieve greater specificity for a target as observed for the SH2 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; Su(dx), Suppressor of deltex; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; r.m.s.d(s), root mean square deviation(s). 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; Su(dx), Suppressor of deltex; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; r.m.s.d(s), root mean square deviation(s). domains in SHP-2 phosphatase (6Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Alternatively, their presence may indicate a functional diversity borne out by an ability to bind more than one target. The number and spatial arrangement of WW domains are sometimes modified by alternative splicing (8Itani O.A. Campbell J.R. Herrero J. Snyder P.M. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285Google Scholar), highly suggestive of a purpose to their tandem arrangement as discussed above. Therefore, it is likely that the length and structure of the interdomain linkers are of crucial significance. Little is currently known about the functional importance of the linker region in proteins with multiple WW domains. The notable exceptions are as follows. First, the phosphorylation at sites in the linker regions diminishes the human Nedd4-2-epithelial sodium channel interaction (9Debonneville C. Flore S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.-D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). This effect is biologically very important, enabling the regulation of the human body Na+ ion balance and blood pressure. Secondly, the recent solution structure of the WW domain pair of the yeast-splicing factor Prp40 (10Weisner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reveals a single rigid structure with the linker assuming an α-helical conformation. This linker conformation results in a defined relative orientation of the WW domain binding surfaces in keeping with a bridging function for Prp40 early in the splicing process. In contrast, incomplete structural studies on the second and third tandem WW domains from the rat Nedd4 protein (11Kanelis V. Farrow N.A. Kay L.E. Rotin D. Forman-Key J.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggest a disordered interdomain linker. Therefore, differences in the structure and dynamics of tandem WW domains are probable and possibly affect their protein recognition function. Suppressor of deltex (Su(dx)) is a Drosophila member of the Nedd4 family of type 3 ubiquitin ligases (12Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 15: 1972-1984Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar) defined by a common modular architecture; an N-terminal lipid-interacting C2 domain, between two and four WW domains (Su(dx) has four arranged in pairs) and a C-terminal E3 ubiquitin ligase HECT domain. Su(dx) was identified in Drosophila as a negative regulator of Notch receptor signaling (13Busseau I. Diederich R.J. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Genetics. 1994; 136: 585-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Matsuno K. Eastman D. Mitsiades T. Quinn A.M. Carcanciu M.L. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Fostier M. Evans D. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Baron M. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1477-1485PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cornell M. Evans D. Mann R. Fostier M. Flasza M. Monthatong M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Baron M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 567-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Notch signal transduction cascade is of fundamental importance for pattern formation and correct execution of multiple cell-fate decisions (17Baron M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Bray S. Cell. 1998; 93: 499-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Fleming R.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Direct binding partners for Su(dx) that mediate its effect on Notch signaling are yet to be identified but most probably interact via the Su(dx) WW domains. The four WW domains (all group I) are organized in a pairwise fashion with domains one (WW1) and two (WW2) and, likewise, domains three (WW3) and four (WW4) separated by short linkers: 8 residues between WW1 and WW2 and 14 residues between WW3 and WW4. The linker between the two module pairs, WW1–2 and WW3–4, is much longer (40 amino acids). To obtain further insight into the operation of the multiple WW domains of Su(dx), we undertook NMR studies of the tandem pair WW3–4. The latter was of particular interest, because it lacks the second conserved Trp (replaced by Phe) that gives the WW domain its name (Fig. 1). The conservation of this mutation in WW4 from nematode worms to humans (Fig. 1) indicates a unique role for this particular domain, a role that remains unknown. No structure of this WW module class has previously been determined. Sample Preparation—The region encoding WW domains 3 and 4 (amino acids 474–545 of Su(dx)) was amplified by PCR from Su(dx) cDNA using primers (MWG Biotech) that generate flanking EcoR1 and XhoI sites for insertion into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase. Expression in Escherichia coli BL21 cells was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline by lysozyme and a freeze-thaw cycle. Protein was purified by affinity binding to glutathione beads in phosphate-buffered saline followed by thrombin cleavage to release the WW domains from the glutathione S-transferase tag and a final gel filtration step (Sephacryl S-100, Amersham Biosciences) to remove higher molecular weight contaminants and to exchange the protein into the buffer used in NMR experiments. After cleavage, the WW3–4 construct retains an N-terminal leader sequence of GSPEFHM arising from vector sequences that link the cloned gene to that for glutathione S-transferase. To prepare the 15N-labeled sample, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl as a sole source of nitrogen. The yield of purified protein was relatively low in all of the conditions tested and required up to 10 liters of medium/NMR sample, making 13C labeling fiscally unviable. The individual WW3 and WW4 domains were prepared similarly. Purified GPPPPPGYPG-peptide (Pept1) was purchased from Pepceuticals Ltd. (Leicester, United Kingdom). The buffer used for all of the experiments contained 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, and 1 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.1). WW3–4 tends to aggregate at concentrations above 0.5 mm; therefore, a 45 mm mixture of Arg and Glu amino acids was added upon advice (20Golovanov A.P. Hautbergue G.M. Wilson S.A. Lian L.-Y. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8933-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) in order to enhance protein solubility and obtain solutions of higher concentration for NMR experiments. Fluorescence Equilibrium Binding Studies—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Su(dx) WW domains (individual and paired), used to derive equilibrium dissociation constants for Pept1 binding, was measured in a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter spectrometer at 20 °C. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 297 and 343 nm, respectively. Dissociation constants were determined by fitting the data to a single-site binding model (equation is given in Fig. 2) using WinCurveFit. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out at 15 °C on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with pulse-field gradients and triple resonance probes. The data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar) and NMRView (22Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar) software. For the assignment and structure calculations, two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY, E-COSY, and TOCSY and three-dimensional heteronuclear 15N-edited NOESY and TOCSY experiments were collected (23Kessler H. Gehrke M. Griesinger C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 1988; 27: 490-536Crossref Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 24Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). The mixing time in NOESY experiments was 150 ms. The WW3–4 peptide binding studies were performed by monitoring chemical shift changes in 1H-15N HSQC spectra (25Kim S. Cutlis D.N. Feig L.A. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; : 6776-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The combined chemical shift changes were calculated using Equation 1. δ1H+15N=δ1H2+(0.17δ15N)2 eq.1 Peptide binding curves were obtained by recording 1H-15N HSQC spectra after the addition of concentrated peptide stock solution to give peptide/protein ratios of 1:4, 1:2, 3:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. After correcting protein (P0) and peptide (L0) concentrations for dilution, observed chemical shift changes were fitted to Equation 2 (25Kim S. Cutlis D.N. Feig L.A. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; : 6776-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using WinCurveFit (Kevin Raner Software). δ=δm2P0(L0+P0+Kd)−(L0+P0+Kd)2−4L0P0 eq.2 1DNH residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured in the 5% solution of 8-alkyl-poly(ethylene glycol/octanol) (26Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar) using the IPAP (in-phase/anti-phase) method of spectra recording (27Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The RDC values were obtained by subtracting the reference value in isotropic solution. Alignment tensors were calculated from RDC values using the PALES program (28Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear 1H-15N NOEs and longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) 15N relaxation rates were measured using the standard two-dimensional methods (29Farrow N.A. Muhandrian R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar, 30Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 536-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The relaxation delays were set to 10 (run twice), 20, 50, 100, 200, 352, and 500 ms, 1.512 and 2.520 s for R1 measurements, and 18 (run twice), 36, 55, 110, 147, 202, 294, 496, and 993 ms for R2 measurements. Correlation times were calculated for the WW domains from these experimental measurements (31Carper W.R. Keller C.E. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1997; 101: 3246-3250Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 1H-15N NOE experiments were run twice in an interleaved fashion with and without (reference experiment) proton saturation during the recovery delay. Errors in the peak intensities were estimated from the average base-line noise. Structure Calculation—Structure calculation was performed using the ARIA program (32Nilges M. O'Donoghue S.I. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Intraresidue, sequential, and backbone NOEs across β-sheets were assigned manually. The remaining NOESY cross-peaks were assigned automatically during ARIA cycles and then visually inspected for the assignment of peaks near the water signal. All of the fully assigned peaks in NOESY spectra were integrated using NMRView. A floating chirality approach was used for methylene and isopropyl groups and Phe and Tyr aromatic protons (33Folmer R.H. Hilbers C.W. Konings R.N. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds between β-sheets were applied as indicated by HN, Hα, and N chemical shifts and characteristic interstrand NOEs. The bounds for hydrogen bond restraints were 1.8–2.3 Å for HN-O distances and 2.8–3.2 Å for N-O distances. Restraints for the backbone angles were derived from 3JHNHA coupling constant and HN and N chemical shifts (34Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The structures were calculated using a simulated annealing protocol that employs torsion angle dynamics during the first six iterations and Cartesian dynamics during the final two iterations (32Nilges M. O'Donoghue S.I. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). RDCs were used in the final annealing stages. The final structures were analyzed using the PROCHECK-NMR program (35Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacAthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar). Insight II (Molecular Simulations Inc.) was used for visualization and figure preparation. Fluorescence Analysis of Ligand Binding to the WW3–4 Tandem Pair—The direct interaction of the second Trp residue within WW domains with ligand allows the monitoring of ligand binding by Trp fluorescence. To determine whether the recombinant WW3–4 pair was active in ligand binding, we monitored fluorescence changes upon the addition of a synthetic peptide. A peptide sequence, GPPPPPYPG (Pept1), was selected based on its previously identified high affinity binding to the group I WW domains (36Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Titration of the WW3–4 pair with increasing concentrations of Pept1 gave a Kd of 15.3 μm. A similar Kd of 17.1 μm was obtained for the individual WW3 domain (Fig. 2). Such similar values would indicate that binding is occurring to WW3 and that there is a negligible effect of the second domain on its binding affinity. Furthermore, the dissociation constant obtained upon the titration of an equimolar mixture of the individual domains with Pept1 (15.8 μm, data not shown) is within experimental error of the apparent dissociation constants for the binding of this peptide to WW3 alone and to WW3–4. The binding of Pept1 to WW3 only is consistent with previous studies showing that group I WW domains with a Trp→ Phe/Tyr mutation do not bind to peptides with the PPPY motif (10Weisner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Kasanov J. Pirozzi G. Uveges A.J. Kay B.K. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, as WW4 lacks the Trp residue used to monitor fluorescence changes, we cannot exclude the possibility of some Pept1 binding to WW4 by this method, particularly if it does so with a near identical affinity. Resonance Assignments and Structure Determination of the WW3–4 Pair—Direct assignment of the unligated WW3–4 pair was not possible as the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of free WW3–4 displayed a paucity of amide 1H-15N peaks (Fig. 3A) and a very narrow dispersion of resonances. The addition of Pept1 resulted in significantly improved spectra (Fig. 3B), allowing sequence-specific 1H and 15N NMR resonance assignments based on three-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC-TOCSY, three-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC-NOESY, and homonuclear NOESY, TOCSY, and E-COSY. All of the backbone and most side-chain resonances with the exception of the first four residues have been assigned. The assignment of methylene protons was non-stereospecific. The refinement procedure for the liganded WW3–4 utilized NOE distance constraints, hydrogen bonds, torsional angles, and RDC (see Table I). Structure calculations were performed for 20 structures. The statistics are given in Table I for an ensemble of the 10 lowest energy structures of the 20 calculated (Protein Data Bank code 1TK7). None of the converged structures has any distance constraint violation greater than 0.4 Å or any violation of the dihedral angle constraints. The inclusion of RDC constraints in the calculations does not result in a specific orientation of the two domains, and their mobility remains high. The inclusion of RDC also has a minimal effect on calculations of root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the mean structure for the 10 converged structures. Taking each domain individually, the r.m.s.d. values close to 1.0 Å are calculated for backbone heavy atoms (see Table I and see Fig. 4A for superposition), representing a good definition of domain structure. Due to interdomain dynamics resulting from a flexible linker structure (see below), the calculation of an overall r.m.s.d. is effectively meaningless because structures cannot be superimposed over the entire molecule.Table IStructural statisticsNumbercNumber of restraints usedr.m.s.d. of the 〈SA〉d〈SA〉 is the ensemble of 10 lowest energy structures of 20r.m.s.d.

Even at the highest peptide concentration (4:1 peptide/protein ratio), the resonances of a number of WW3 residues, specifically Lys20, Val30, Tyr28, and Arg35, remain very broad. These residues are located on the ligand-binding side of the β-sheet, and according to solved structures of WW domain/ligand complexes, they are implicated in the interaction with ligand. Thus, this line broadening probably reflects ligand binding and an exchange rate in an intermediate time regime, even at the large peptide excess. Although Pept1 is binding in the usual site for group I WW domains, the weak NOEs from these residues and our inability to assign the resonances of sequential prolines in the GPPPPPYPG-peptide in the absence of isotopic labeling precludes the structure determination of the whole complex and we restricted the study to the structure of WW3–4 only in a liganded state. The solution structures (Fig. 4) of the individual WW3 and WW4 domains within the tandem WW3–4 pair show the typical folding topology, a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a hydrophobic core comprising highly conserved residues Trp17-Trp61, Tyr29-Phe73, and Pro42-Pro86. The β-strand elements comprise residues 17–21, 27–31, and 36–39 for WW3 and 61–65, 71–75, and 80–83 for WW4. All of the pairwise r.m.s.d. of the individual WW3 and WW4 domains to the solved structures of WW domains from dystrophin (4Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), Prp40 (10Weisner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), YAP65 (38Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and Nedd4 (39Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) are within 1.2 Å. The structure of the interdomain linker (residues 44–56) is poorly defined by the experimental data suggesting that it may be highly flexible (see below). No interdomain NOEs have been identified, further suggesting that there is no single preferred relative orientation of the two domains. However, it is apparent that the linker region is not totally unstructured because a number of medium-range dNN(i,i+2), dαN(i,i+2), and dαN(i,i+3) NOEs were assigned through this segment (data not shown). Protein Dynamics of the WW3–4 Structure—The WW3–4 structure, as complexed with a peptide ligand (Fig. 4), implies considerable flexibility of the possible orientations of WW3 with respect to WW4, in contrast to the only previous solved structure of a WW domain pair (10Weisner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether this reflected true conformational flexibility or simply an experimental consequence of a lack of observed NOEs, we further investigated the dynamics of this lack of fixed orientation using 15N relaxation measurements (29Farrow N.A. Muhandrian R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar, 30Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 536-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we recorded R1, R2, and 1H-15N NOE heteronuclear relaxation measurements for the WW3–4/Pept1 complex. Generally, 1H-15N NOE values above 0.7 qualitatively reflect restricted internal motion, whereas smaller values indicate substantial internal motion and negative values are indicative of fully disordered regions. Both WW3 and WW4 domains have 1H-15N NOE values consistent with the rigid domain structure (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the interdomain linker has smaller values indicating restricted internal motion and the lack of a well ordered structure. The same conclusion can be drawn from the R2/R1 ratios, which follow the same trend (Fig. 5B). Further information regarding interdomain orientation and motion is obtained by the measurement of RDCs (40Braddock D.T. Cai M. Baber J.L. Huang Y. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8634-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Tolman J.R. Al-Hashimi H.M. Kay L.E. Prestegard J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1416-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). RDCs proved to be a valuable tool in identifying the relative orientation of WW domains in Prp40 (10Weisner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The measured 1H-15N RDCs are markedly different for domains WW3 and WW4 (Fig. 6). The RDCs are mostly negative for the residues in the β-strands of WW4 but positive for the corresponding residues in WW3. The opposite sign of RDCs immediately points to non-colinearity of the two domains. At the same time, the axial components ( DaNH) and the rhombicity (η) of the alignment tensors are practically identical if calculated using RDCs from WW3 only ( DaNH=8.1 Hz, η = 0.44), WW4 only ( DaNH=8.4 Hz, η = 0.42), or the whole molecule ( DaNH=8.2 Hz, η = 0.44). These values would suggest some restriction to interdomain motion, because independent or semi-independent orientation usually results in markedly different parameters (40Braddock D.T. Cai M. Baber J.L. Huang Y. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8634-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that, although linker flexibility probably leads to some orientation independence between domains 3 and 4, there remains to be limitations to this flexibility and that the two domains, on average, tumble as a unit. Consistent with this conclusion is the presence of the aforementioned medium-range NOEs"
https://openalex.org/W2067269071,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an essential protein folding assistant of the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes both the formation of disulfides during protein folding (oxidase activity) and the isomerization of disulfides that may form incorrectly (isomerase activity). Catalysis of thiol-disulfide exchange by PDI is required for cell viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but there has been some uncertainty as to whether the essential role of PDI in the cell is oxidase or isomerase. We have studied the ability of PDI constructs with high oxidase activity and very low isomerase activity to complement the chromosomal deletion of PDI1 in S. cerevisiae. A single catalytic domain of yeast PDI (PDIa′) has 50% of the oxidase activity but only 5% of the isomerase activity of wild-type PDI in vitro. Titrating the expression of PDI using the inducible/repressible GAL1–10 promoter shows that the amount of wild-type PDI protein needed to sustain a normal growth rate is 60% or more of the amount normally expressed from the PDI1 chromosomal location. A single catalytic domain (PDIa′) is needed in molar amounts that are approximately twice as high as those required for wild-type PDI, which contains two catalytic domains. This comparison suggests that high (>60%) PDI oxidase activity is critical to yeast growth and viability, whereas less than 6% of its isomerase activity is needed.

This comparison suggests that high (>60%) PDI oxidase activity is critical to yeast growth and viability, whereas less than 6% of its isomerase activity is needed. Fast and efficient protein folding is essential for cell viability. Although spontaneous folding is adequate for some proteins, many disulfide-containing proteins require help from specific folding assistants to form the correct disulfide bonds and to prevent the formation of non-native disulfides that might stabilize misfolded structures (1Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; SC, synthetic complete. 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; SC, synthetic complete. is an essential ER folding assistant present in all eukaryotes that facilitates the folding of disulfide-containing proteins (2Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). PDI catalysis of oxidative protein folding consists of two types of reactions, oxidation of free sulfhydryls into disulfides (oxidase activity) and rearrangement of incorrectly formed disulfides (isomerase activity) (1Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These two activities are performed by each of the two active sites of PDI. Each active site contains two cysteines that cycle between oxidized (disulfide) and reduced (sulfhydryl) forms during the PDI enzymatic cycle. The catalytic sites (CGHC) are found in two independent thioredoxin homology domains located near the N (a domain) and C termini (a′ domain) of the molecule.In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of the PDI1 gene is lethal (2Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A mutant PDI in which all the active site cysteines have been replaced with serines (NSGHS–CSGHS) is still an active chaperone and has other, secondary activities of PDI in vitro, but it is incapable of complementing the PDI1 deletion. Catalysis of thiol-disulfide exchange is the required function of PDI in yeast (3LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although catalysis of thiol-disulfide exchange is essential, there has been some uncertainty about which part of this catalytic activity represents the essential in vivo function of PDI. PDI mutants with defects in the oxidase activity can complement the PDI1 deletion (3LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), but surprisingly, expression of a single PDI catalytic domain (a or a′), which is defective in catalyzing isomerization, can also rescue the PDI1 deletion (5Xiao R. Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Holmgren A. Lundstrom-Ljung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).There are two problems in deciding which one of the PDI catalytic activities represents the essential function. The first problem is the extent to which the two activities can be separated in a specific PDI construct. Oxidase-deficient PDI mutants have active sites with only one of the two cysteines. The NCGHS–CCGHS mutant has 16% of the oxidase activity of wild-type PDI and approximately 40% of the isomerase activity when assayed in vitro using scrambled RNase as the substrate (6Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this mutant, the ratio of oxidase/isomerase activity is 1:2.5. A single catalytic domain of PDI (a or a′) has approximately 50% of the oxidase activity of wild-type PDI in vitro but only 3–5% of the isomerase activity (5Xiao R. Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Holmgren A. Lundstrom-Ljung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, the ratio of oxidase to isomerase activity is greater than 10:1, which is a much more effective separation of activities than has previously been available. The second problem is the absence of expression level measurements and the use of different PDI proteins (yeast and mammalian) during the complementation experiments (3LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).We have used the large separation of activities afforded by a catalytic domain (a′) of yeast PDI in combination with the inducible/repressible GAL1–10 promoter (7Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to titrate the levels of oxidase and isomerase activities that are required to maintain growth, viability, and in vivo isomerase activity. The experiments show that S. cerevisiae growth rate and viability require levels near those of wild-type oxidase activity, but less than 6% of the isomerase activity is sufficient to maintain wild-type growth rates. Measurements of the in vivo isomerase activity show that significant defects in isomerization catalysis are tolerated well by the yeast ER.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—5-Fluoroorotic acid was obtained from RPI International. Cell culture media such as agar, yeast extract, and LB were from Invitrogen. Amino acids, dithiothreitol, and other reagents were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and PCR reagents were from Invitrogen and Promega. Anti-His6 tag monoclonal antibodies and 5% casein blocking solution were purchased from Novagen. Anti-rat PDI polyclonal antiserum was produced in our laboratory, and anti-yeast PDI antiserum was kindly provided by Jakob Winther (Carlsberg Laboratories). Nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and West Pico Supersignal ECL development reagents were from Pierce. Anti-carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) polyclonal antiserum was a gift from Jakob Winther (Carlsberg Laboratories).Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The yeast strain carrying the PDI1 gene deletion (YPH274, Δpdi1) was obtained from Ronald Raines (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). All yeast strains were haploids with the appropriate genes disrupted (as described in Refs. 2Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 4Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain used for DNA manipulations was XL1Blue from Stratagene. Plasmids used for complementation were constructed on the basis of the vectors pRS414 and pRS424 (8Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pRS414 is a centromere-based yeast E. coli shuttle vector with a TRP1 selectable marker; pRS424 is identical to pRS414, except that it has a multicopy 2μ yeast origin. The plasmid pRS414 was digested with KpnI and SalI, and a 780-bp restriction fragment containing GAL1–10 promoter was inserted. This was followed by digestion with BclI and NotI and the insertion of a 129-bp fragment containing the yeast PDI ER-targeting sequence, a sequence that encodes an N-terminal His6 tag, a multicloning site with BamHI, SalI, SmaI, and BglII restriction sites, and an HDEL ER retention sequence followed by a stop codon. To provide a low copy expression vector driven by the PDI1 promoter, pRS414 was digested with KpnI and EcoRI, and an 885-bp fragment encoding PDI1 promoter was inserted. This was followed by digestion with EcoRI and NotI and insertion of the 129-bp expression cassette fragment encoding the same signal or targeting sequences described above. The domain boundaries of the rat protein were described previously (5Xiao R. Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Holmgren A. Lundstrom-Ljung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The catalytic domains of the yeast protein were identified by modeling the sequence of the yeast a and a′ domains into thioredoxin family structures with 3D-PSSM software (9Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The protein or domain coding sequences were inserted into the BamHI-BglII-digested plasmid. Construct fragments were generated by PCR to include a 5′ BglII site and a BamHI 3′ site (for yeast PDI BamHI site at both 5′ and 3′ ends) using the following primers synthesized by Sigma Genosys: for yeast PDI, GAG GGA TCC CCT GAA GAC TCC GCT GTC GTT AAG and CTC GGA TCC AAT GGC ATC TTC TTC GTC AGC CAA; for yeast PDIa′ domain, GAG AGA TCT GGG TCC CAG ATC TGA TTC CTC TGT CTT CCA ATT GGT and CTC GGA TCC AGA TTT AGG ATC CGA CGT CGA AGT GAC CGT TTT CCT TG; for rat PDI, GAG AGA TCT GAC GCT CTG GAG GAG GAG GAC AAC and CTC GGA TCC CAC GGC TTT CTG ATC GTC GTC TTC; for rat PDIa domain, GAG AGA TCT GAG GAG GAC AAC GTC CTG GTG CTG and CTC GGA TCC GCG TTT CTT CAG CCA GTT CAC AAT G; and for rat PDIa′ domain, GAG AGA TCT GTG AAA GTG CTA GTT GGG AAA AAC and CTC GGA TCC CCC CGC TCC ATC CTG GCC ACC GCT C. The sequences of the entire insert were verified by DNA sequencing.Complementation and Yeast Cell Cultures—Routine yeast complementation and culture conditions were basically as described by Guthrie and Fink (1991) (14Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). Complementation experiments were performed using a plasmid-shuffling technique essentially as described in Laboissiere et al. (4Laboissiere M.C. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Δpdi1 (YPH274) strain contains a deletion of the entire coding sequence of PDI1 by the insertion of a HIS marker. The strain is maintained as viable with a plasmid (URA3) expressing yeast PDI. After transformation, cells are plated on His-Ura-Trp agar plates to select transformants missing the chromosomal PDI1 gene. After several days, colonies are replated on His-Ura-Trp plates with galactose to induce the expression of constructs under the control of GAL1–10 promoter. Resulting colonies are replated on agar plates that contain 5-fluoroorotic acid to force a loss of the URA3 plasmid expressing yeast PDI. Aliquots of cells for storage were preserved by freezing them in 15% glycerol at –80 °C.Growth Rate, Viability, and Protein Level Measurements—Growth rates were measured in synthetic complete (SC) liquid medium with various concentrations of glucose and galactose. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C on a rotating wheel, and an optical density of A600 nm was measured at fixed intervals of time. Cell cultures at an optical density higher than 1.0 were diluted to ensure the linear relationship between optical density and cell numbers/ml.Suppression of Expression—The expression of PDI variants was controlled by induction or suppression of the GAL1–10 promoter. Yeast complemented with specific PDI constructs were grown in SC medium to an A600 nm of 1–1.5. Cells were centrifuged, washed with SC medium, and resuspended in fresh SC medium containing glucose. The optical density was measured, and samples of cells were taken at various times. Cells were centrifuged, disrupted with glass beads in 20% trichloroacetic acid, and washed with acetone, and the insoluble material was solubilized in buffer containing SDS. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The PDI bands were detected with a monoclonal anti-His tag antibody followed by a second antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed with ECL. Autoradiograms were analyzed using Scion Image software. Exposure times and band intensities were chosen to achieve a linear correlation between band intensity and protein concentration. At the same time points, aliquots containing 1000 cells were spread on SC medium agarose plates containing galactose to evaluate the viability of yeast. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 36–48 h, and the number of colonies/plate was counted.Carboxypeptidase Y Pulse-Chase Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (10Anonymous Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-863PubMed Google Scholar). After overnight culturing in SC medium, cells were isolated, resuspended in synthetic medium without methionine, cysteine, and sulfate at A600 nm = 0.4, and grown for 8 h. Cells (20 OD units) were resuspended in fresh medium containing [35S]cysteine and methionine (40 μCi/OD units). After a 15-min labeling period, 107 cells were chased with 100× cysteine, methionine, and sulfate. Cells were mixed with NaN3 and NaF to final concentrations of 5 mm each and placed on ice to stop the labeling process. Cells were pelleted and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads in 20% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, pH 7.4), vortexed, and boiled for 5 min to resolubilize the precipitated proteins. Pansorbin was added, and the tubes were incubated with rotation for 20 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted (5-fold) with IP dilution buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 1.25% Triton X-100, pH = 7.4), and the CPY was immunoprecipitated with anti-CPY antibody. The immunoprecipitated protein was separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The labeled proteins were detected using a phosphor screen from Amersham Biosciences (24–36 h exposure). Screens were scanned using a StormScan scanner.RESULTSThe coding regions for the various domains of rat and yeast PDI were individually inserted into either a high copy (2μ) plasmid under the control of the inducible/repressible GAL1–10 promoter or into a low copy plasmid (cen) under the control of the normal yeast PDI1 promoter. The expression vector, containing a TRP1 selectable marker, also added the yeast signal sequence, an N-terminal His6 tag, and a C-terminal ER retention signal (HDEL). The plasmids were introduced using a plasmid-shuffling protocol into a yeast strain, YPH274, containing a full deletion of the PDI1 gene (Fig. 1). In the presence of galactose to induce expression and on a high copy plasmid, yeast PDI and its a and a′ domains, like the a and a′ domains of the rat protein (5Xiao R. Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Holmgren A. Lundstrom-Ljung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27975-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), support growth (Table I); however, strains transformed with vectors containing the non-catalytic domains (b or b′) or a control vector with no insert are not viable. When expression of the wild-type PDI and catalytic domains of yeast or rat PDI is driven by the normal PDI1 promoter from a low copy (cen) plasmid, only wild-type rat PDI, wild-type yeast PDI, and the yeast a′ domain will complement the pdi1Δ mutation.Table IRescue of the lethal phenotype of pdi1Δ strains by expression of various PDI constructsProteinDomainOverexpressionaExpression was driven by the GAL1-10 promoter on a multicopy plasmid (2-μm) in the presence of galactose to fully induce the promoter. +, the strain was viable when plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid in the presence of galactose. -, strains were not viable when plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid in the presence of galactose.Normal expressionbExpression was driven by the PDI1 promoter from a low copy (cen) plasmid. +, the strain was viable when plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid.YeastwtPDI++a′ domain++a domain+-RatwtPDI++b′ domain--b domain--a′ domain+-a domain+-a Expression was driven by the GAL1-10 promoter on a multicopy plasmid (2-μm) in the presence of galactose to fully induce the promoter. +, the strain was viable when plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid in the presence of galactose. -, strains were not viable when plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid in the presence of galactose.b Expression was driven by the PDI1 promoter from a low copy (cen) plasmid. +, the strain was viable when plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid. Open table in a new tab Because only the wild-type yeast and rat proteins and the yeast PDIa′ domain support growth under the control of the PDI1 promoter, these proteins were examined further for the effects of variable expression levels on the growth and viability of yeast and their ability to support in vivo isomerization activity. The GAL1–10 promoter is inducible by galactose but repressible by glucose, which provides the opportunity to titrate the expression of PDI or its individual catalytic domains. Quantitative Western blots using an anti-yeast PDI antibody were used to compare the expression levels of wild-type yeast PDI from its chromosomal location to the expression levels of yeast PDI from a fully induced GAL1–10 promoter (Fig. 2). This comparison using the yeast antibody provides a direct measure of the expression levels provided by the strong GAL1–10 promoter relative to that of the PDI promoter. The expression driven by the fully induced GAL1–10 promoter on a low copy (cen) plasmid produces PDI at a level that is 7.8 times higher than the normal expression level of PDI in wild-type yeast (Fig. 2). To compare the expression levels of the various PDI constructs, the expression levels of yeast PDI and PDIa′ were also compared using Western blots with an antibody to the common His6 tag. The expression levels of all the species are comparable when each is driven by the GAL1–10 promoter (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Expression levels of yeast PDI under the control of GAL1–10 promoter compared with yeast PDI expression from its chromosomal location and normal promoter. CRY1 is a wild-type yeast strain. The YPH274 strain is complemented with yeast PDI expressed from a low copy plasmid under the control of the GAL1–10 promoter. Extracts from an identical number of cells grown on galactose were diluted as indicated before separation on SDS-PAGE (4–20%). After transfer, the Western blot was developed with a polyclonal anti-yeast PDI antibody and visualized by ECL using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Suppression of expression from the GAL1–10 promoter by glucose. YPH274 yeast strains complemented with wild-type yeast PDI1, the yeast PDIa′ domain, or the rat PDI were grown in synthetic complete media containing galactose until mid-log phase and then transferred to glucose media to suppress the expression from the GAL1–10 promoter. Cells were harvested at fixed periods of time after the transfer from galactose to glucose. After SDS-PAGE (4–20%), Western blots were developed with and anti-His6 tag monoclonal antibody.

Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the PDI concentrations decrease because of protein degradation and dilution through cell division. As the protein levels fall (Fig. 3), the cells expressing yeast wild-type PDI continue to grow, although the growth rate becomes quite slow. Cells expressing the yeast PDIa′ domain or wild-type rat PDI, however, grow progressively more slowly after transfer to glucose and finally stop doubling after undergoing a few divisions (Table II).Table IIProperties of pdi1Δ strains complemented with various PDI constructsConstructDoubling time in galactoseaAverages of at least triplicate measurements.Number of doublings in glucose mediaaAverages of at least triplicate measurements.Protein level after suppressionbExpressed protein levels are given relative to the amount of wild-type yeast Pdi1p expressed from its chromosomal location as determined from Western blotting.

When fully induced, the GAL1-10 promoter produces 7.8 times the amount of Pdi1p as the endogenous PDI1 promoter (Fig. 2). Open table in a new tab The doubling time, relative level of PDI protein, and viability were all measured at various times after suppressing PDI expression. Protein levels were estimated by quantitative Western blotting using an anti-His6 antibody (Fig. 3). The response of the antibody to an equal molar amount of each protein (based on sequence molecular weight) is comparable. When fully suppressed, the concentration of wild-type yeast PDI drops from 7.8 times the normal level of yeast PDI to ∼60% of the normal level (Fig. 4A). At this level of Pdi1p, the cells continue to divide, albeit at a slow rate. By contrast, significant overexpression of yeast PDIa′ from the fully induced GAL1–10 promoter causes a slow growth phenotype (Fig. 4B) that is eliminated at lower expression levels. For PDIa′ after suppression with glucose, the growth rate initially increases then decreases as the amount of protein falls. Ultimately the cells stop doubling and lose viability as the concentration of PDIa′ falls to levels that are comparable with the levels of Pdi1p normally expressed in wild-type strains. Strains supported by rat PDI also stop growing after glucose suppression (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Effects of suppression of PDI expression on growth rate and viability. During the time course of glucose suppression of PDI expression from the GAL1–10 promoter, the growth rate, viability, and amount of PDI protein were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The growth rate and viability are expressed relative to the maximum growth rate and maximum viability. The protein concentration (right axes) is expressed as relative to the amount of wild-type yeast PDI expressed in a wild-type yeast strain (CRY1). ○, protein level relative to the amount of wild-type yeast PDI expressed from its endogenous promoter in a wild-type yeast strain; ▴, viability relative to the maximum observed; •, growth rate (reciprocal doubling time) relative to the maximum observed. All experiments are the average of at least three independent measurements. A, wild-type yeast PDI; B, yeast PDIa′; C, wild-type rat PDI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether the sudden switch from galactose to glucose medium affects the requirement for PDI activity, yeast cells were grown continuously in liquid media that contained a range of glucose to galactose ratios from 100 to 0% of total carbohydrate represented by galactose. This approach allowed us to achieve a variable steady-state level of the PDI proteins so that the decreasing concentrations of protein during the assay of viability and changes in the growth rate were less problematic to the measurement of doubling time and viability. Because of the slow growth phenotype and higher levels needed for the heterologous rat PDI, experiments are shown for only yeast PDI and yeast PDIa′. By varying the carbohydrate source, we were able to vary the protein levels over a wide range, from 7.8-fold higher than the normal expression level of PDI to ∼60% of that value. As with suppression over time, these experiments show that dropping the steady-state level of wild-type yeast PDI results in a slow growth rate when the protein level falls below ∼60% of the normal amount of yeast PDI expressed from its chromosomal location. The fully suppressed GAL1–10 promoter, however, still produces enough yeast PDI to maintain viability, although the growth rate is significantly slower (Fig. 5). For the single catalytic domain PDIa′ the cells grow slowly and lose viability when the expression level falls below the amount of yeast PDI normally expressed from its chromosomal location (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Relationships among growth rate, viability, and the expression levels of PDI constructs. Protein expression levels are represented as a percentage of the normal PDI expression level in a wild-type yeast strain (CRY1). Protein expression was manipulated using the inducible/repressible GAL1–10 promoter. Results are shown for strains complemented with wild-type yeast PDI (•) and yeast PDIa′ (○).

Error bars represent the standard deviation of at least triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To more directly assess how replacing wild-type yeast PDI with a single catalytic domain or the heterologous rat protein affects protein folding in vivo, pulse-chase experiments were performed to follow the maturation of endogenous yeast CPY and evaluate the isomerization of a disulfide-containing protein in vivo. CPY is a non-essential yeast vacuolar protease that contains five disulfide bonds. Its folding relies heavily on the ER thiol-disulfide folding machinery. It is initially synthesized as a pro-protein that is oxidized and glycosylated in the ER to a precursor form, p1 (Fig. 6). After additional carbohydrate processing in the Golgi, a second precursor, p2 (Fig. 6), is finally cleaved to mature (m) CPY in the vacuole (11Jung G. Ueno H. Hayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 126: 1-6Google Scholar). The exit of correctly folded precursors from the ER requires correct disulfide formation. Consequently, CPY maturation from the precursor (p1) to mature (m) form"
https://openalex.org/W1972624061,"The protein kinase Cds1 is an effector of the replication checkpoint in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Cds1 is required to stabilize stalled replication forks, and it helps to prevent the onset of mitosis until the genome is fully replicated. Mrc1 (mediator of the replication checkpoint-1) and Rad3-Rad26 kinase are required for Cds1 activation, but exactly how Mrc1 mediates Cds1 activation is unknown. Here we show that Mrc1 is required for the initial threonine 11 phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3-Rad26. Mrc1 specifically interacts with the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of Cds1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Mutations in the FHA domain that abolish this interaction also eliminate Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1. Weak Thr-11 phosphorylation of a “kinase-dead” mutant of Cds1 is rescued by co-expression of wild type Cds1. The requirement for Mrc1 in the replication checkpoint can be partially eliminated by expression of a Rad26-Cds1 fusion protein. These findings suggest that recognition of Mrc1 by the FHA domain of Cds1 serves to recruit Cds1 to Rad3-Rad26. This interaction mediates the initial Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3-Rad26 with subsequent intermolecular phosphorylation events leading to full activation of Cds1.

Here we show that Mrc1 is required for the initial threonine 11 phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3-Rad26. Mrc1 specifically interacts with the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of Cds1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Mutations in the FHA domain that abolish this interaction also eliminate Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1. Weak Thr-11 phosphorylation of a “kinase-dead” mutant of Cds1 is rescued by co-expression of wild type Cds1. The requirement for Mrc1 in the replication checkpoint can be partially eliminated by expression of a Rad26-Cds1 fusion protein. These findings suggest that recognition of Mrc1 by the FHA domain of Cds1 serves to recruit Cds1 to Rad3-Rad26. This interaction mediates the initial Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3-Rad26 with subsequent intermolecular phosphorylation events leading to full activation of Cds1. Accurate DNA replication of a eukaryotic genome, a remarkable accomplishment in the best of circumstances, is often complicated by DNA adducts or protein complexes that obstruct replisomes and thereby cause fork arrest (1Boddy M.N. Russell P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R953-R956Google Scholar, 2Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Zou L. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 509-516Google Scholar). Replication forks may also stall as a result of dNTP starvation. Stalled forks are thought to be inherently unstable structures prone to regression, rearrangement, or collapse (3McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Google Scholar). These events threaten genome stability. In these situations, a sensor response system known as the DNA replication checkpoint steps into delay mitosis, stabilizes the fork, and facilitates resumption of fork progression in a manner that preserves genetic information (1Boddy M.N. Russell P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R953-R956Google Scholar, 2Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Zou L. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 509-516Google Scholar). Studies of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have uncovered networks of checkpoint sensor, transducer, and effector proteins that are also conserved in mammals. Central to these networks are large phosphoinositide 3′-kinase-like kinases (PIKKs), 1The abbreviations used are: PIKK, phosphoinositide 3′-kinase-like kinase; FHA, forkhead-associated; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia telangiectasia-related; ATRIP, ataxia telangiectasia-related interacting protein; TAP, tandem affinity purification; TEV, tobacco etch virus; HU, hydroxyurea; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DTT, dithiothreitol; pThr, phosphothreonine. Rad3 and Tel1 in fission yeast, Mec1 and Tel1 in budding yeast, and ATR and ATM in humans (4Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Google Scholar). The Rad3/Mec1/ATM subfamily of PIKKs act together with regulatory subunits (ATRIP for ATR, Rad26 for Rad3, and Lcd1/Ddc2/Pie1 for Mec1) to phosphorylate downstream targets. These targets include the effector kinases of the checkpoints, Cds1 and Chk1 in fission yeast, Rad53 and Chk1 in budding yeast, and Chk2 (Cds1) and Chk1 in humans (5Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Google Scholar). In fission yeast, Cds1 enforces the replication checkpoint (6Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Google Scholar, 7Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Google Scholar, 8Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science. 1998; 280: 909-912Google Scholar), whereas Chk1 enforces the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint (9Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Google Scholar). The critical role of Chk1 in the DNA damage checkpoint in fission yeast is straightforward; it delays the onset of mitosis by inhibiting activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 (10Rhind N. Furnari B. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 504-511Google Scholar). Cds1 has a more complicated set of functions, being required to stabilize stalled forks (11Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Google Scholar), as well as working with Chk1 to prevent the onset of mitosis (7Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Google Scholar, 8Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science. 1998; 280: 909-912Google Scholar). Exactly how Cds1 stabilizes arrested forks is unknown, but it appears to regulate several DNA repair proteins that may be involved in maintenance of stalled forks (12Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar, 13Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Google Scholar). Rad3 controls both Cds1 and Chk1 (1Boddy M.N. Russell P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R953-R956Google Scholar). Insight into how Rad3 specifically activates Cds1 in S phase was provided by the discovery of Mrc1 (14Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Google Scholar, 15Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Google Scholar). Mrc1, so named because it is a mediator of the replication checkpoint, is required for activation of Cds1 but not Chk1. Mrc1 is expressed only during S phase in fission yeast (15Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Google Scholar), a finding that explains why Cds1 activation is restricted to S phase. Mrc1 was proposed to recruit Cds1 to stalled replication forks to mediate phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3-Rad26 kinase. In support of this model, Cds1 was found to interact with Mrc1 in yeast two-hybrid assays (16Tanaka K. Boddy M.N. Chen X.B. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3398-3404Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Mrc1 by Rad3-Rad26 is required for Cds1 activation in fission yeast (17Zhao H. Tanaka K. Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8395-8403Google Scholar). A similar relationship exists between Rad53, Mrc1, and Mec1-Ddc2 in budding yeast (18Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Google Scholar). In budding yeast, Mrc1 moves with replication forks during S phase, and it appears to be a component of the replisome complex (18Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Google Scholar, 19Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Google Scholar). Mrc1 proteins are highly divergent, and it is not yet clear whether they have true functional homologs in multicellular organisms. Claspin, a protein first identified in Xenopus through its physical association with Chk1 (20Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Google Scholar), has weak sequence similarity to yeast Mrc1 proteins and may be the functional homolog of Mrc1 (14Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Google Scholar). Claspin is required for Chk1 activation during replication arrest in Xenopus egg extracts (20Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Google Scholar, 21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Google Scholar, 22Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Google Scholar), and recent studies have provided evidence that Claspin is required for the replication checkpoint in human cells (23Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Google Scholar). Activation of Cds1 homologs is a multistep process that can involve both trans-phosphorylation by PIKKs as well as intermolecular autophosphorylation between Cds1 molecules. In the case of human Chk2, phosphorylation of Thr-68 by ATM or ATR is crucial for Chk2 activation (24Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar, 25Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar, 26Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Google Scholar, 27Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Google Scholar). Thr-68 is part of a TQ motif that is a preferred substrate sequence phosphorylated by PIKKs (28Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene. Expr. 1992; 2: 283-314Google Scholar, 29Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Google Scholar). An equivalent position in fission yeast Cds1, Thr-11, is phosphorylated by Rad3 in vitro and is required for Cds1 activation in vivo (16Tanaka K. Boddy M.N. Chen X.B. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3398-3404Google Scholar). Similarly, efficient activation of budding yeast Rad53 requires one or more N-terminal TQ motifs that are potential substrate phosphorylation sites of Mec1 (30Lee S.J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Google Scholar). Studies of Chk2 and Rad53 (and the related kinase Dun1 in budding yeast) have shown that intermolecular autophosphorylation is vital for activation of Cds1 homologs (30Lee S.J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Google Scholar, 31Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar, 32Bashkirov V.I. Bashkirova E.V. Haghnazari E. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1441-1452Google Scholar, 33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar, 34Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). Intermolecular autophosphorylation appears to occur on the aforementioned N-terminal TQ motifs as well as threonine residues within the activation loop of the catalytic domain (34Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). These reactions require a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain that is located between the N-terminal TQ motifs and the C-terminal catalytic domain. The FHA domain is a phosphoprotein recognition domain that mediates specific phosphorylation-dependent interactions between proteins (35Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Google Scholar). A functional FHA domain is essential for activation of Cds1 and its homologs (12Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar, 31Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar, 33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar, 34Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). In the case of human Chk2, it appears that a phosphorylated Thr-68 site on one Chk2 molecule interacts with the FHA domain of another Chk2 molecule. This interaction leads to the formation of Chk2 oligomers and efficient intermolecular autophosphorylation (31Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar, 33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar, 34Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Google Scholar). Chk2 oligomerization may further regulate hChk2 activation, because Chk2 can also phosphorylate its FHA domain in vitro, and these phosphorylations lead to dissociation of hChk2 oligomers in vitro (31Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar, 33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays have indicated that most nonfunctional FHA mutations of Chk2 do not impair Thr-68 phosphorylation, suggesting that the FHA domain is not essential for the initial Thr-68 phosphorylation but may instead be required for Chk2 dimerization (33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar). In the case of budding yeast Rad53, a C-terminal FHA domain mediates binding to Rad9. This binding is abolished by mutating multiple TQ/SQ motifs in Rad9, suggesting that phosphorylation of Rad9 by Mec1 leads to recruitment of Rad53 and activation of Rad53 by intermolecular autophosphorylation (36Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Google Scholar, 37Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Sun Z. Morrow J.S. Pradhan D. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1055-1065Google Scholar). Another possibility that is not mutually exclusive is that phosphorylated Rad9 serves as an adaptor that delivers Rad53 to Mec1 (38Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar). Neither human Chk2 or fission yeast Cds1 have a C-terminal FHA domain, and the Rad9-related protein Crb2 in fission yeast is not involved in Cds1 activation (11Noguchi E. Noguchi C. Du L.L. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7861-7874Google Scholar), thus the Rad9-mediated mechanism of Rad53 activation may be unique to budding yeast. Exactly how Mrc1 mediates Cds1 activation in fission yeast or Rad53 activation in budding yeast is unknown. One possibility is that Mrc1 recruits Cds1/Rad53 to upstream PIKK-like kinases. In this model, Mrc1 should be required for the initial Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3-Rad26 in fission yeast. In this study we provide evidence that the association of Mrc1 to the Cds1 FHA domain mediates the initial Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1. Furthermore, we show that expression of a Cds1-Rad26 fusion protein substantially bypasses the requirement for Mrc1 in the replication checkpoint. These findings support the model that the major function of Mrc1 is to recruit Cds1 and present it as a substrate for Rad3-Rad26. These studies provide new insights into the mechanism of signal transduction in the replication checkpoint in fission yeast and may help to understand how Chk2 is regulated in humans.

All strains are leu1–32 ura4-D18. A modified version of a tandem affinity purification tag (TAP) (39Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar) composed of an S tag (40Kim J.S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Google Scholar) in place of the calmodulin binding peptide, a TEV protease cleavage site, and a ZZ tag (minimal protein A binding domain) was amplified from pKW804 (a gift from K. Weis, University of California) and used for C-terminal tagging of endogenous Cds1 protein. Growth media, general biochemical and genetic methods for fission yeast, and staining with DAPI have been described previously (41Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown at 32 °C in YES medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, supplements) unless indicated otherwise. HU (Sigma) was used at the concentration described. The following plasmids were used in this study: pAL vector, pAL-cds1 (16Tanaka K. Boddy M.N. Chen X.B. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3398-3404Google Scholar), pJK148-cds1-rad26. The Cds1-Rad26 fusion plasmid was constructed as follows (Fig. 5A). After removing the termination codon of cds1+, a genomic fragment of cds1+ was fused at its C terminus into the initiation site of genomic rad26+ fragment on pBluescript by PCR (pBS-cds1-rad26). The cds1-rad26 fragment was transferred into pJK148 (42Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Google Scholar) to make pJK148-cds1-rad26. NheI-digested pJK148-cds1-rad26 plasmid was integrated into the cds1+ locus to make the cds1-rad26 fusion strain (Fig. 5A). To mutate amino acids in the Cds1 FHA domain, a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene) was used to mutate the indicated site(s) in pAL-cds1 and pBTM116-cds1-(1–155) (15Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Google Scholar) plasmids. Site-directed mutagenized cds1 genes flanked by endogenous chromosomal promoter and terminator sequences were isolated by digestion of plasmids pAL-cds1-R64A, pAL-cds1-S78A, pAL-cds1-H81A, pAL-cds1-I84A, and pAL-cds1-N107A with PstI and SpeI. The PstI-SpeI fragments containing mutated cds1 genes were transformed into the cds1:: ura4+ strain (KT2751). Stable integrants of mutagenized cds1 were identified by 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) selection and further confirmed by colony PCR. For yeast two-hybrid assays, the cDNA of cds1-(1–155) containing the FHA domain was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain of pBTM116, and the open reading frame of mrc1 was fused to the Gal4 activation domain of the pGAD424 (pGAD424-mrc1) (15Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Google Scholar). Plasmids pGAD424 and pBTM116 were co-transformed into the L40 strain. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies, the following antibodies were used: anti-HA (12CA5), anti-Cig2 (43Mondesert O. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1527-1533Google Scholar), anti-Cds1 (a gift from T. Wang, University of Stanford), anti-tubulin (TAT-1). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (MBL, Japan) specific to phospho-Thr-11 of Cds1 were raised against a peptide containing EEATQAT(-PO4)QEAPLHVC and purified using antigen peptide conjugated to Sepharose. Antibodies were further purified by passage through Thr-11 peptide (EEATQATQEAPLHVC)-Sepharose to deplete contaminating antibodies that are reactive with Cds1, which is not phosphorylated at Thr-11. Immunoblot analysis was performed as follows: Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gel and wet-transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (NitroBind, Osmonics). Blots were probed with primary antibodies and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega) and Luminol reagents (Pierce). Cds1 Kinase Assay—Cds1 kinase assays with immunoprecipitated Cds1 were carried out as described previously (7Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J. Edwards R.J. Christensen P.U. Murray J.M. Osman F. Walworth N. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 382-395Google Scholar, 16Tanaka K. Boddy M.N. Chen X.B. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3398-3404Google Scholar) with the following modification. Cells were disrupted with glass beads in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mmpara-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin-aprotinin-pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cds1 antibodies were incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. 1 mg of total extract in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer was incubated with protein A-Sepharose-bound Cds1 antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose was washed three times with lysis buffer followed by three times with kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). 20 μl (50% slurry) of protein A-Sepharose pellet was incubated with 10 μl of 2× kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μl of 2 mm ATP, 5 μl of myelin basic protein (1 mg/ml stock) at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% gel. Mrc1 Is Essential for Thr-11 Phosphorylation of Cds1—Activation of Cds1 and its homologs is thought to be a multistep process that involves PIKK-dependent phosphorylation of one or more N-terminal TQ motifs followed by intermolecular autophosphorylation. In fission yeast, Rad3 phosphorylates Thr-11 in vitro, and this site is required for Cds1 activation in vivo (16Tanaka K. Boddy M.N. Chen X.B. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3398-3404Google Scholar). In principle, Mrc1 might act by facilitating initial Thr-11 phosphorylation by Rad3-Rad26, or it could act after this event to promote intermolecular autophosphorylation, or it could act in an unknown way to promote Cds1 activation. To determine how Mrc1 functions in the Cds1 activation mechanism, we investigated if Mrc1 is required for the initial Thr-11 phosphorylation catalyzed by Rad3. Analysis of Thr-11 phosphorylation required the production of antibodies that specifically recognized the Thr-11 phosphorylated form of Cds1. These phosphospecific antibodies were affinity purified with the Thr-11 phosphopeptide and depleted with unphosphorylated Thr-11 peptide (see “Materials and Methods”). The specificity of these antibodies was demonstrated by their ability to recognize Cds1, but not Cds1-T11A (Thr-11 mutated to Ala), after HU treatment (Fig. 1A). These antibodies were used to examine Thr-11 phosphorylation in several mutant strains. Analysis of rad3Δ cells confirmed that HU-induced Thr-11 phosphorylation required Rad3 (Fig. 1B). These results strengthened evidence that Rad3 phosphorylates Thr-11 in response to HU (16Tanaka K. Boddy M.N. Chen X.B. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3398-3404Google Scholar). A similar analysis was carried out with mrc1Δ cells. We observed that Thr-11 phosphorylation was abolished in mrc1Δ cells (Fig. 1B). These findings indicate that Mrc1 is essential for the initial Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1 that is catalyzed by Rad3-Rad26. FHA Domain Is Required for Thr-11 Phosphorylation of Cds1—FHA domains are protein-protein interaction modules that bind phosphothreonine (pThr) residues in target ligands (44Durocher D. Jackson S.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 58-66Google Scholar). They are domains of ∼100–180 amino acids that form an 11-stranded β-sandwich. An intact FHA domain is required for activation and function of Cds1 (12Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar). These findings imply that Cds1 activation requires an FHA domain interaction with a phosphorylated protein. However, transient transfection assays have shown that many mutations in the FHA domain of hChk2 that are predicted to impair binding to phosphopeptide ligands do not abolish Thr-68 phosphorylation (33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar). These findings indicated that a functional FHA domain is not necessary for the initial Thr-68 phosphorylation of Chk2 that is catalyzed by PIKKs (33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar). However, one shared limitation of this and similar investigations was that they overexpressed mutant forms of Chk2. Protein overexpression can sometimes obscure regulatory relationships. In the case of the Chk2/Cds1, this concern is reasonable because Cds1 overexpression suppresses the HU-sensitive phenotype of mrc1Δ cells in fission yeast (15Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate whether a functional FHA domain is required for Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1 in mutant strains that expressed all proteins at endogenous levels. We first examined a previously described FHA mutation of Cds1 (Cds1-S78AH81A; noted as cds1-FHA*) (12Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar), in which the conserved amino acids Ser-78 and His-81 in the FHA domain were both mutated to alanine. The cds1-FHA* strain is very sensitive to HU, and the mutant Cds1 protein is not activated in response to HU treatment (12Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with Cds1 antisera showed that Cds1-FHA* protein was expressed at the same level as wild type Cds1, although Cds1-FHA* had an altered electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting with phospho-Thr-11 antibodies showed that Thr-11 was not phosphorylated in cds1-FHA* cells (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that the initial Thr-11 phosphorylation of Cds1 by Rad3 requires an intact FHA domain. These results prompted a more detailed analysis of the FHA domain. Structural information based on NMR spectroscopic and x-ray crystallographic analyses was used to produce a modified sequence alignment of FHA domains from fission yeast Cds1, budding yeast Rad53, and Chk2 proteins from human, mouse, and Xenopus (Fig. 2A) (33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar, 35Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol.

Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1045-1054Google Scholar). Based on this information, we created mutations at conserved residues that are located within the β strands (H81A and I84A) or within loops connecting β strands that are expected to make contact with a phosphopeptide ligand (R64A, S78A, and N107A) (44Durocher D. Jackson S.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 58-66Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Crystallographic analyses indicated that a conserved Arg residue (Arg-70 in Rad53 and Arg-64 in Cds1) is pivotal for direct FHA domain interactions with the phosphate group of pThr-containing peptide ligands (35Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Google Scholar, 46Liao H. Byeon I.J. Tsai M.D. J. Mol.

These mutations were introduced into the genomic locus of cds1+. All mutant forms of Cds1 except for Cds1-I84A were expressed at wild-type levels (Fig. 2C). The Cds1-I84A mutation probably affected protein stability, because mutations of residues that form the β-sandwich structure of the FHA domain also destabilized hChk2 protein (33Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of wild type and cds1 mutant cells were spotted on media containing increasing concentrations of HU (Fig. 2B). The cds1-R64A, cds1-S78A, cds1-H81A, and cds1-N107A cells were extremely sensitive to HU, displaying a phenotype that was comparable to cds1Δ cells. The cds1-I84A cells were moderately sensitive to HU, being able to grow on 5 mm HU but not 10 mm HU plates. Immunoblotting with the phospho-Thr-11-specific antibodies was carried out with the mutant strains. All of the FHA mutants were severely defective in Thr-11 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). The data with the cds1-I84A mutant were uncertain, however, because the low abundance of Cds1-I84A protein may have precluded detection of Thr-11 phosphorylation. In addition to Cds1-I84A, Cds1-H81A may also be below the detection limit (Fig. 2D). We also observed that only wild type Cds1 protein displayed reduced electrophoretic mobility in response to HU treatment (Fig. 2C). Reduced electrophoretic mobility is a consequence of activating phosphorylation (7L"

R., and Trimble, R. B. (1998) Glycobiology 8, 1087–1095). PvGal biosynthesis was investigated by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis of S. pombe, followed by the isolation of cells devoid of negatively charged N-glycans by Q-Sepharose exclusion and failure to bind human serum amyloid P component, which acts as a lectin for terminal PvGal residues. Mutant glycans were characterized by lectin binding, saccharide composition, exoglycosidase sensitivity, and NMR spectroscopy. Restoration of the cell surface negative charge by complementation with an S. pombe genomic library led to the identification of five genes involved in PvGal biosynthesis, which we designated pvg1–pvg5. Pvg1p may be a pyruvyltransferase, since NMR of pvg1– mutant N-glycans revealed the absence of only the pyruvyl moiety. Pvg2p–Pvg5p are crucial for attachment of the Galβ1,3-residue that becomes pyruvylated. Pvg3p is predicted to be a member of the β1,3-galactosyltransferase family, and Pvg3p-green fluorescent protein labeling was consistent with Golgi localization. Predicted Pvg1p and Pvg3p functions imply that Galβ1,3-is added to the galactomannans and is then pyruvylated in situ, rather than by an en bloc addition of PvGalβ1,3-caps to the outer chain.

Whereas a functional role for the PvGal epitope in S. pombe remains unclear, it is nonessential for either cell growth or mating under laboratory conditions. Nearly all of the proteins found on the cell surfaces of almost all organisms are glycosylated. In most cases, the glycan moieties associated with these glycoproteins provide the surface with a net negative charge, which plays a significant role in the regulation of the cell influx/efflux processes and in cell-cell interactions such as cell aggregation and pathogenic adhesion. Whereas a wide range of acidic saccharides and saccharide modifications (e.g. muramic acid, hexuronic acids, sialic acids, succinate, lactate, and pyruvate) are found in bacterial polysaccharides (1Becker A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), among other species, it was of interest to determine whether S. pombe has a genome-encoded functional analog of these proteins. However, initial data base searches could not identify any sequence homology between known bacterial pyruvyltransferases and any putative S. pombe proteins. Therefore, S. pombe strains devoid of negatively charged N-glycans were isolated following mutagenesis, and genetic complementation with an S. pombe genomic library was utilized to identify genes involved in the PvGal biosynthetic pathway. Here we demonstrate that at least five different genes are required to synthesize the PvGal epitope. Although the inter-relationships between the encoded proteins remain to be completely established through future biochemical analyses, the results obtained suggest that PvGalβ1,3-synthesis is carried out by a coordinated enzymatic system in which the Galβ1,3-residues are added to the S. pombe galactomannans and are then subsequently pyruvylated. General—Mallinckrodt Baker (Paris, KY) supplied 37% formaldehyde solution, 2-propanol, and anhydrous methanol. Pharmco (Brookfield, CT) provided anhydrous ethanol. Unless otherwise noted below, all other simple reagents were obtained from Sigma. Solvents, buffer components, and chemicals were ACS reagent grade or better. Sigma also supplied the antibiotics G418, kanamycin, and ampicillin. New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) was the source for DNA restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase. All solutions were made using minimum 18-megaohm resistivity DDW produced by a Milli-QUF Plus Ultrapure water purification system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) from distilled feedwater. DDW, buffers, and media solutions were sterilized by auto-claving. Standard molecular biology methods for bacteria and budding yeast were utilized (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W.

Additional methods for fission yeast were also consulted (26Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (2985) Google Scholar, 27Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J.

Cell Lines and Cell Growth—Fission yeast “wild-type” S. pombe strains (h–ura4–294) (ATCC 38436) and (h+ura4+leu1–32 ade6–704) (ATCC 96081) and S. cerevisiae strain (MATα ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9 leu2–3,112) (SEY6210) (a kind gift from Dr. Scott Emr via Dr. Neta Dean) were used in this study. Cell growth media and growth conditions are described in the Supplemental Material. Mutagenesis and Isolation of Mutants—“Wild-type” S. pombe (h–ura4–294) was mutagenized using ethyl methanesulfonate (Sigma). Following mutagenesis, cells were grown in YEDS liquid medium for 48 h (10–15 cell divisions) to allow phenotypic expression of the mutations. Mutant enrichment was achieved by repeated Q-Sepharose exclusion in DDW. Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) beads were prepared as described (12Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25945-25949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and sterilized by suspension in 95% ethanol. Ethanol was removed by five repeated washes with DDW. Cells were collected by centrifugation in a 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube, washed three times with DDW, and resuspended in 10 ml of DDW. Approximately 1 ml of sterile Q-Sepharose beads (i.e. 2 ml of a 50% slurry) was added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was allowed to settle at room temperature for 5 min. The negatively charged cells bound to the beads and formed a fluffy precipitate that quickly settled to the bottom of the tube (Fig. 1A, wt). The supernatant containing unprecipitated cells was removed, and the procedure was repeated several times, until the cells remaining in the supernatant failed to bind and appeared to be uncharged (Fig. 1A, pvg–). The final cell suspension was grown overnight in YEDS. After dilution to ∼100 cells/ml, 200-μl aliquots were spread on YEDS plates. SAP Staining of Fixed Cells—Biotinylation of SAP (Sigma) and purification of the product were performed as described (28Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, the commercial SAP solution (containing 1 mg of SAP) was added to a pre-equilibrated Centricon YM-10 Mr 10,000 cut-off centrifugal filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA), washed twice by centrifugation with 1-ml additions of TBSC (10 mm Tris-Cl, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) to remove EDTA and concentrated to ∼500 μl. Next, a fresh 11-mm solution of the BASHSE (Sigma) biotinylation reagent was produced by dissolving 0.3 mg of BASHSE in 50 μl of TBSC. A 0.1-volume aliquot of the BASHSE solution was added to the SAP solution in a microcentrifuge tube, yielding a ∼550-μl reaction mixture (∼1 mm BASHSE, ∼2 mg/ml SAP). The biotinylation reaction was incubated for 18 h at room temperature. The mixture was washed twice by centrifugation in the filter with 1-ml additions of TBSC (with 0.1% NaN3 as a preservative). The biotinylated SAP product, concentrated to ∼200 μl (∼5.0 mg/ml) and stored at 4 °C, was used without further characterization. Colonies chosen for screening were grown overnight in 1-ml YEDS aliquots. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with TBS (10 mm Tris-Cl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and fixed with 400 μl of 10% formalin (i.e. 1:10 dilution of commercial formaldehyde solution in TBS) for 60 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed twice with TBSC. For each assay, a 0.2-μl aliquot of the 5 mg/ml biotinylated-SAP solution was diluted with 49.8 μl of TBSC. The cells were resuspended in 50 μl of this solution (containing 1 μg of biotinylated SAP) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with TBSC. For each assay, a 0.5-μl aliquot of 100 units/ml alkaline phosphatase-avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was diluted with 49.5 μl of TBSC. The cells were resuspended in 50 μl of this solution (containing 50 milliunits of alkaline phosphatase-avidin D) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with TBSC, and aliquots of each preparation containing approximately equal numbers of cells were transferred (spotted) onto Whatman 3MM chromatography paper (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK) and air-dried. Color development after the addition of Western Blue alkaline phosphatase substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) indicated SAP binding (Fig. 1B). Lectin Blotting—Cells were grown overnight in 1-ml YEDS aliquots, collected by centrifugation, washed with DDW, and resuspended in 400 μl of lectin blotting buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, pH 5.5). Suspensions were heated in a 100 °C water bath for 5 min and pelleted by centrifugation. Soluble glycoproteins were precipitated from the decanted supernatant by the addition of ice-cold acetone to 80% (29Verostek M.F. Lubowski C. Trimble R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins were resuspended in 200 μl of lectin blotting buffer/mg of protein, denatured by boiling for an additional 5 min, and loaded at 600 ng/lane onto 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Sample preparation; SDS-PAGE; electroblotting to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore); and lectin blotting with concanavalin A (for α-linked Man), GSL/BSL I-B4 (for α-linked Gal), and PNA (for β-linked Gal) were performed according to standard protocols from the suppliers. Bio-Rad was the source for PAGE supplies. Vector Laboratories supplied biotinylated concanavalin A lectin and biotinylated GSL/BSL I-B4 isolectin. Biotinylated PNA lectin was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Compositional Analysis—Acid hydrolysis of the N-linked polysaccharides was performed as described (12Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25945-25949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B.

Monosaccharides were separated by HPAEC on a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) CarboPac PA1 4 × 250-mm analytical column isocratically with 16 mm NaOH and were monitored by PAD using a Dionex ED50 Electrochemical Detector. Depyruvylation and Exoglycosidase Digestions—Wild-type galactomannans were depyruvylated by mild acid hydrolysis as described (12Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25945-25949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Earlier work showed that Galβ1,3-in the wild-type S. pombe N-linked galactomannans represented about 10% of the total Gal (28Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of unsubstituted Galβ1,3-residues in the pvg1– mutant, we incubated ∼3-μmol Man equivalents (∼50 nmol of total oligosaccharide) of wild-type and mutant N-linked glycans overnight with 20 milliunits of green coffee bean α-galactosidase (Sigma) in 40 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 6.0) or with 300 milliunits of Xanthomonas manihotis β-galactosidase (expressed in Escherichia coli) (New England Biolabs) in 40 μl of digestion buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5). Following precipitation with ice-cold 60% methanol (29Verostek M.F. Lubowski C. Trimble R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), supernatants were evaporated under vacuum, and Gal release was measured by HPAEC-PAD. To ensure that Gal released by β-galactosidase would be observable by HPAEC-PAD, we optimized the amounts of total injected N-glycans so that release of only 10% of Gal by α-galactosidase (∼100 nmol) yielded a prominent peak. Oligosaccharide Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy—S. pombe cells were grown to early stationary phase in YEDS. Following disruption by vortexing with 0.5-mm acid-washed glass beads, cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Nonglycosylated proteins were precipitated by 60% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the glycoprotein-containing supernatant fraction was equilibrated by dialysis with deglycosylation buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5), and oligosaccharides were released from the glycoproteins with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (30Trimble R.B.

The released N-glycans were sized on an extra fine mesh Bio-Gel P-4 (Bio-Rad) column, and the large galactomannans eluting at the void volume were examined further. Samples were prepared, and one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded, processed, assigned, and analyzed as described (28Gemmill T.R. Trimble R.B.

The expression plasmids pUR-(1–5) GFPc and pSP-(1–5) GFPc were transformed into the respective pvg1––pvg5– mutants and tested for complementation of mutation and restoration of wild-type phenotype as described above. The cellular location of the expressed Pvg(1–5) p-GFP fusion proteins was determined by fluorescence microscopy. A G418-resistant h+ strain was designed by random integration of an EcoRI–AscI kanMX6-GFP cassette into the S. pombe (h+ura4+leu1–32 ade6–704) strain. Briefly, the pFA6a-kanMX6-P3nmt1-GFP plasmid (38Bähler J. Wu J.-Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R.

The cassette was transformed into the (h+ura4+leu1–32 ade6–704) strain and replica-plated on YEDS/G418 plates. G418-resistant, GFP-expressing h+ colonies were used for mutagenesis and subsequent mating analysis. Transcription Analysis by End Point RT-PCR—End point RT-PCR was performed to determine whether transcription of pvg1–pvg5 was significantly affected in any of the mutants and whether Pvg4p, a putative transcription factor (see “Results”), was involved in regulation of one or more of pvg1–pvg3 and pvg5. Briefly, nucleic acids were isolated from wild-type and pvg– mutant cells grown to early stationary phase in YEDS. Following DNase I (Invitrogen) digestion to remove genomic DNA, cDNA was synthesized from mRNA transcripts using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), utilizing SuperScript II RT and oligo(dT)12–18 primer. PCR was performed with Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Carlsbad, CA) and appropriate gene-specific primers for pvg1–pvg5 and actin (act1) control (Table I). Difficult amplification of pvg3 due to secondary structure effects necessitated the use of the forward primer pvg3-TMD, which did not incorporate the transmembrane domain coding sequence. Both positive controls (no DNase I) containing genomic DNA and negative controls (no SuperScript II RT) were utilized.Table IOligonucleotide primers for RT-PCRGene nameSizeaIncludes leading SacI and trailing SphI restriction sequences and 5′ clamps.Forward primerReverse primerTemplatebppvg112195′-GGGAGCTCATGTTCGCAAACATTAAT-3′5′-GGGCATGCAAAGTAGCCGGCCTCATT-3′S. pombe genomic DNA or cDNApvg211835′-CCGAGCTCATGACTAAACTCTGGGTA-3′5′-CCGCATGCAGCAGTTATCAAGTCGAA-3′S. pombe genomic DNA or cDNApvg3bDue to difficult amplification of pvg3 because of secondary structure effects at the beginning of the open reading frame, the forward primer for pvg3-TMD was used instead of pvg3.11525′-CTCTGAGCTCATGTTTTCAAATTC-3′5′-GAGCATGCAACGTCCAAAGAAGG-3′S. pombe genomic DNA or cDNApvg3-TMDbDue to difficult amplification of pvg3 because of secondary structure effects at the beginning of the open reading frame, the forward primer for pvg3-TMD was used instead of pvg3.1066cIncludes inserted START codon.5′-GAGAGCTCATGCGTCTACAGGCC-3′5′-GAGCATGCAACGTCCAAAGAAGG-3′S. pombe genomic DNA or cDNApvg411325′-GAGAGCTCATGGGGCGCAAAAAAATC-3′5′-CCGCATGCGTATTTGACATCACTGAG-3′S. pombe genomic DNA or cDNApvg511325′-GAGAGCTCATGGGCCTTCCATTACGG-3′5′-GGGCATGCAAGTTGCTTCCATTGTTC-3′S. pombe genomic DNA or cDNAact111415′-GAGAGCTCATGGAAGAAGAAATCGCA-3′5′-GAGCATGCGAAGCACTTACGGTAAAC-3′S. pombe genomic DNA or cDNAa Includes leading SacI and trailing SphI restriction sequences and 5′ clamps.b Due to difficult amplification of pvg3 because of secondary structure effects at the beginning of the open reading frame, the forward primer for pvg3-TMD was used instead of pvg3.c Includes inserted START codon.

Inversely, several pvg– mutant strains were derived from the G418-resistant (h+ura4+leu1–32 ade6–704) strain as described above for (h–ura4–294) and were crossed with the wild-type (h–ura4–294) strain. Following 3 days of incubation at room temperature, plates were inspected by light microscopy for the formation of crescent-shaped zygotic asci. Cell mixtures from each cross were then replated on CSM-Leu/G418 medium. Plates were examined for growth after 2 days of incubation at 33 °C. Wild-type (pvg+) cells of both mating types were used as controls.

Structures of soluble forms have not revealed how they interact with membranes. We have used electron crystallography to determine the structure in ice of a helical array of the photoreceptor G protein, transducin, bound to the surface of a tubular lipid bilayer. The protein binds to the membrane with a very small area of contact, restricted to two points, between the surface of the protein and the surface of the lipids. Fitting the x-ray structure into the membrane-bound structure reveals one membrane contact near the lipidated Gγ C terminus and Gα N terminus, and another near the Gα C terminus. The narrowness of the tethers to the lipid bilayer provides flexibility for the protein to adopt multiple orientations on the membrane, and leaves most of the G protein surface area available for protein-protein interactions.

The narrowness of the tethers to the lipid bilayer provides flexibility for the protein to adopt multiple orientations on the membrane, and leaves most of the G protein surface area available for protein-protein interactions. G proteins mediate signal transduction pathways on the membranes of virtually all eukaryotic cells. In the inactive, GDP-bound, heterotrimeric state most G proteins are themselves tightly membrane associated. Activation takes place when GTP is exchanged for GDP in a complex with an integral membrane G protein-coupled receptor, which produces separated and active Gα-GTP and Gβγ proteins. These active subunits are then free to move along the membrane and regulate their downstream effectors that may be either peripherally membrane associated (e.g. cGMP phosphodiesterase, phospholipase C) or integral membrane proteins (e.g. adenylyl cyclase and ion channels). There have been numerous studies of G protein-membrane interactions using biochemical, functional, and mutagenic approaches. These have made it clear that membrane association and localization play a critical role in G protein function and have also revealed biochemical features of Gα and Gγ that are important for membrane binding. All Gα subunits have one or more fatty acids added at or near their N termini, and both the fatty acids and the amino acids in the N-terminal region are important for membrane binding (1Brand S.H.

The attachment site is either an N-terminal glycine, which is linked to fatty acid, usually myristic acid, in an amide linkage, or a cysteine at position 2, which is linked to palmitic acid in a thioester link-age. The Gγ subunits are proteolytically processed to leave a C-terminal methyl-esterified cysteine residue linked via a thioether to either a 15- or 20-carbon isoprenyl chain (4Fukada Y.

The only G protein structure in which a lipid modification is present and visible is the complex of Gβγt with phosducin, in which the farnesyl group is tucked into the β-propeller blades of Gβt (17Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and which has greatly diminished affinity for membranes. Another region thought to be near the membrane is the C terminus of the α subunit, because of its critical role in binding to receptors (18Garcia P.D. Onrust R. Bell S.M. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4460-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Hamm H.E. Rarick H. Mazzoni M. Malinski J. Suh K.H. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1990; 56: 35-44PubMed Google Scholar). A proposed membrane-binding surface for the heterotrimer was identified by adding to these constraints a criterion of electrostatic matching between positively charged or neutral regions of the protein surface and the negatively charged phospholipid (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). However, this model remains in question because studies with the retinal G protein transducin have suggested that there is no electrostatic attraction to the membrane. In fact, low ionic strength is routinely used to remove this protein from membranes, suggesting that the net electrostatic forces are actually weakly repulsive in nature (20Kuhn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 21Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Fung B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Seitz H.R. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Alt T. Pellaud J. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7950-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In general it is not clear that there is a strong driving force for the dehydration of the polar surfaces of both the protein and the lipid head groups required to bring about close contact between them. Thus a fundamental question about a peripheral membrane protein binding to a lipid bilayer is whether their facing surfaces interact primarily with water or with one another. Because of the intrinsic difficulty of incorporating a membrane-protein interface into three-dimensional crystals suitable for x-ray crystallography, we have used the approach of electron crystallography to determine the structure of the G protein-membrane complex. In this approach the protein is allowed to assemble into an ordered lattice on the surface of a lipid bilayer, and electron microscopy of samples preserved in vitreous ice is used to obtain images for structural analysis. Although in most cases only low resolution structural maps are obtained from this technique, it is possible to fit high resolution structures into these maps computationally (23Jiang W. Baker M.L. Ludtke S.J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Wu X. Milne J.L. Borgnia M.J. Rostapshov A.V. Subramaniam S. Brooks B.R. J. Struct.

Wriggers W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and thus obtain information about the interactions of specific parts of the protein with the membrane. We reported previously that ordered lattices could be obtained for the photoreceptor G protein transducin either on planar monolayers (27Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or tubular bilayers (28Melia T.J. Sowa M.E. Schutze L. Wensel T.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and that the tubular structures were occasionally obtained using endogenous lipids co-purifying with the protein, although a specific mixture of synthetic lipids formed them most efficiently. Only the tubular structures, which have helical symmetry, proved to be suitable for structural analysis. We report here the results of reconstructing the protein-lipid complex and fitting of the x-ray crystal structure of the heterotrimeric G protein (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), which allow us to identify the mechanisms by which the G protein interacts with the membrane surface. In addition to revealing the G protein orientation on the membrane surface, these results suggest that electron crystallography using helical protein lattices assembled on lipid tubules may be a generally applicable approach for determining membrane orientations for peripheral proteins. Reagents and Materials—Buffer A was 5 mm Tris, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer B was 20 mm MOPS, 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CTF, contrast transfer function. 2 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA. Buffer C was 10 mm MOPS, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Tube buffer was Buffer B supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μmN,N,N′,N″-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN, Aldrich), and 10 mm CaCl2. All buffers were filtered through 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filters immediately before use. Buffers used in purification also contained a small amount of solid protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science). Gt was purified essentially as described (28Melia T.J. Sowa M.E. Schutze L. Wensel T.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude Gt was prepared by stripping Gt from bleached, washed bovine rod outer segment membranes (ROS) with GTP and buffer A. Crude Gt was then exchanged into buffer C and purified over an high performance liquid chromatography anion exchange column (Waters DEAE-5PW), by elution with increasing NaCl. Purified protein was exchanged into buffer B and stored in 50% glycerol at -20°C. Dioleoyltrimethylammonium propane and diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Avanti in CHCl3 and stored at -80°C under argon, unless otherwise noted. Two-dimensional Crystallization—Conditions for helical crystallization were similar to those described previously (28Melia T.J. Sowa M.E. Schutze L. Wensel T.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Gt (0.1–0.2 mg/ml) in tube buffer with 5% (v/v) glycerol (glycerol concentration is critical for reproducible tube formation) was pipetted into clean 10-μl Teflon wells and ∼1 μl of a 0.5–1 mg/ml lipid mixture (20:80 mol/mol dioleoyltrimethylammonium propane:diphytanoyl-PC) in 1:1 (v/v) chloroform: hexane was floated over the solution to form a lipid monolayer. The samples were kept in a humid environment by placing the Teflon plates on damp filter paper in glass Petri dishes at 4°C. Tubes formed in under 2 h. Grid Preparation—Tubes were transferred by pipetting 5 μl from either the surface or the subphase onto 400-mesh copper electron microscope grids (Gilder, Ted Pella) to which a carbon-coated holey film had been applied (29Fukami A. Adachi K. J. Electron Microsc. 1965; 14: 112-118PubMed Google Scholar, 30Toyoshima C. Ultramicroscopy. 1989; 30: 439-444Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) so that the sample was suspended in a thin aqueous layer across the holes. For cryo-preservation of the helical tubes, excess sample was wicked off with Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and then the grid was immediately plunged into liquid ethane. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen. Electron Microscopy and Image Digitization—The specimen was examined on a JEOL 1200EX cryo-microscope operating at 100 kV and outfitted with a Gatan cryo-stage maintained at <-162°C (31Avila-Sakar A.J. Chiu W. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 57-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The images were taken at ×40,000 magnification with an electron dose of ∼12 electrons/Å2 and recorded on Kodak So-163 film. The film was developed in Kodak Developer D19 for 12 min at 20°C and fixed for 10 min in Kodak fixer. Images were digitized on a Zeiss SCAI microdensitometer at a step size of 3.5 Å/pixel. Image Processing and Helical Reconstruction—Tubule images with the same diameters and long straight regions were selected visually, then the tubes were boxed and floated into a square area using the software routine Boxer in the EMAN suite (32Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Inspection and preliminary identification of layer lines in computed Fourier transforms were carried out in SPECTRA (33Schmid M.F. Dargahi R. Tam M.W. Ultramicroscopy. 1993; 48: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Images with strong symmetrical diffraction patterns and sharp layer lines were selected for further processing. Indexing was facilitated by programs that calculated a range of possible Bessel orders for each layer line, and cross-checked potential selection rules for self-consistency among all these possible Bessel orders. In addition, a test for odd versus even Bessel orders by examining the phases of the layer lines was performed to further narrow the choice of Bessel orders; all were found to be multiples of six. Layer line extraction and refinement as well as reconstruction by Fourier-Bessel inversion were performed with programs based on the original MRC helical reconstruction algorithms (34DeRosier D.J. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) updated to accommodate our image parameters and data formats. The final map was derived from both sides of 3 tubes of the same class at defocus values near 1.3 μm, with a total of 3800 heterotrimers. For each layer line, data from both sides of all three tubes were averaged after 2-fold symmetry was enforced, and data out to the first zeros of the CTF (22-23 A) were included. The amplitude-weighted phase residual for 2-fold symmetry was 24°, calculated from all Fourier terms (not including equatorial peak) with amplitudes higher than 2% of the highest peak in the off-equatorial data for both sides of three tubes (six sides total). Inter-particle phase residuals were 28.8°, 31.3°, and 30.1°, and intra-particle (near versus far side) phase residuals were 34.9°, 36.0°, and 39.2°. The radial density profile was calculated by back-transformation of the equatorial line in the Fourier transform. To test for Fresnel fringe effects in this profile, an approximate contrast transfer function (CTF) amplitude correction was performed on the transform after low-pass filtering, by using a predicted CTF for the experimental defocus value with an estimate of 10% amplitude contrast. The predicted CTF was used as an inverse filter for the equatorial data in Fourier space to produce the solid curve in Fig. 3D. Fitting of X-ray Structure into EM-derived Density Map—The reconstruction was visualized using IRIS Explorer (Numerical Algorithms Group, Ltd., Oxford, UK) with custom designed modules (35Dougherty M.T. Chiu W. Microsc. Microanal. 1998; 4: 452-453Crossref Google Scholar), and a single heterotrimer unit excised computationally. The coordinate file for the Gαβγt trimer structure determined by x-ray crystallography using Protein Data Bank code 1GOT (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (RCSB (36Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar)) and used to generate a density map at 30 Å resolution using the program PDB2MRC in the EMAN suite (32Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). It was fitted into the heterotrimer density of the reconstruction based on a local six-dimensional (rotation and translation) cross-correlation search using Foldhunter (23Jiang W. Baker M.L. Ludtke S.J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The solution was independent of the initial orientation and position selected. The assignment of the best fit was judged by the maximal correlation coefficient, and confirmed by visual inspection of matching of the fitted structures. Because the data are from projection images, an ambiguity exists with respect to the handedness of the EM map determined by the arbitrary selection of the signs of the Bessel orders of the layer lines in the computed diffraction pattern. Both choices were tested, and the one giving the best fit to the x-ray structure was used. Surface representations were generated and the electrostatic potential map was colored using GRASP (37Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy of GtTubules—The Gt helical crystals observed in images obtained by electron cryo-microscopy fall into multiple classes or families with a range of diameters from 430–750 Å. An image of a Gt tubule embedded in vitreous ice, from a commonly observed family with a diameter of 540 Å, is shown in Fig. 1A. The tubes formed using the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” are generally wider than those reported previously (28Melia T.J. Sowa M.E. Schutze L. Wensel T.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which were typically closer to 270 Å in diameter. The computed Fourier transform (Fig. 1B) of each tubule is composed of a series of sharp layer lines extending to an axial resolution of 31 Å (outlined by a rectangle, Fig. 1, B and C), which were indexed according to the notation (h, k; n), as labeled in Fig. 2, indicating lattice position (h, k) and helical start number, or Bessel order (n) as described (34DeRosier D.J. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In addition to the family used for reconstruction, an example of which is shown in Fig. 1, we also processed several additional tubes with diameters ranging from 430–680 Å (data not shown), and found that most have a similar pattern of layer lines in their Fourier transforms, but with different spacings. This similarity indicates that essentially the same surface lattice is used to form the different diameter tubes, likely using common points of protein-protein and protein-lipid contact. This observation of multiple tube diameters based on essentially identical surface lattices is a fairly common one for tubular crystals (38DeRosier D. Stokes D.L. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Toyoshima C. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2623-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 40Zhang P. Toyoshima C.

Nature. 1993; 362: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and the cytochrome bc1 complex (43Akiba T. Toyoshima C. Matsunaga T. Kawamoto M. Kubota T. Fukuyama K. Namba K. Matsubara H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), each tubule has 2-fold symmetry about an axis perpendicular to the long axis of the tube, so that the phases for the peaks in the transform are expected to be either 0° (360°)or180°. The phase plots (Fig. 2A) for off-equatorial layer lines ranging from the strongest (1, 1; -6) to one of the weakest (-3, 2; 48) show good matching for most peaks with phases at amplitude maxima close to either 0° (360°) or 180°, indicating good 2-fold rotational symmetry. To evaluate the symmetry, the amplitude-weighted phase residual for 2-fold symmetry was calculated for each tube (with near and far sides averaged) from all off-equatorial Fourier terms with amplitudes higher than 2% of the highest of such terms in each transform. The phase residuals for the three tubes were 22.1°, 26.1°, and 24.4°.Fig. 2Layer line indexing.A, amplitude and phase plots. The plots shown are averages from both sides of three tubes. Solid lines, radial amplitudes; circles, phases. The (h, k; n) indices are given above each plot. The phases at amplitude maxima are close to either 0 (360°) or 180° indicating good 2-fold symmetry. Arrows indicate the ranges of data used, with the one at high resolution corresponding to the isotropic 23 Å resolution limit for each layer line height. B, surface lattice and indexing scheme. The h, k lattice is drawn and peak positions are identified by lattice position and Bessel order, n, as (h, k; n) for layer lines arising from one side of the tube (green). Off-lattice peaks correspond to the lattice from the opposite side. Layer line numbers are indicated next to the circled peaks, and follow a selection rule of l = tn + um, where l is the layer line number, n is the Bessel order, t is the number of turns, -4, u is the number of units in t turns, 7, and m is an integer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Helical Reconstruction—The helical reconstruction shown in Fig. 3 was generated using merged data out to a maximum isotropic resolution of 23 Å and an axial resolution limit of 31 Å, from three tubes of the same family as the tube illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 with a total of ∼3800 heterotrimer units. In Fig. 3 and subsequent figures, for clarity, the map is presented with a density threshold selected to include 85% of the molecular volume of each heterotrimer. The main features of the tube are a relatively smooth continuous cylinder, consistent with a lipid bilayer, and an outer layer of globular densities of the size and shape of Gαβγt heterotrimers. The arrows in the cross-sectional view shown in Fig. 3A indicate peaks of density at radii of 176 and 204 Å, consistent with a bilayer width of 28 Å, and visible in the radial density profile (Fig. 3D). The strongest peak of protein density is found at a radius of 248 Å. There is a trough in the radial density profile between the peaks corresponding to protein and lipid, consistent with minimal contact between the protein and lipid (arrow in Fig. 3D). To determine whether this minimum is an artifact of Fresnel fringe effects we applied an approximate correction for the CTF to the equatorial data in the Fourier transform after low-pass filtering. After this procedure the minimum between the protein and lipid peaks was still clearly visible. The protein units making up the surface lattice can be seen in the cross-sectional view of the tube (Fig. 3A), with one marked in magenta; note the 6-fold symmetry of the crosssection, consistent with all layer lines having Bessel orders, n, that are integral multiples of six. A close-up view of the outer tube surface is shown in Fig. 3B. The protein repeating unit has 2-fold rotational symmetry, and has the size and shape of a dimer of heterotrimers, one of which is highlighted in magenta in Fig. 3. There are even more extensive contacts between adjacent heterotrimers in each helical strand, primarily made by the outermost parts of each molecule, across the diagonal lines drawn in Fig. 3C. Protein and Lipid Contacts—A computationally isolated heterotrimer unit is shown in Fig. 4. Its lipid contacts can be seen in the side view of Fig. 4A. It is clear that each heterotrimer makes two strong contacts (i.e. ones that are still present when the density threshold is increased to enclose only 40% of the molecular volume) with central lipid; they are labeled i and ii in Fig. 4. To reveal how the protein is oriented on the membrane surface, the lipid was cut off so that the protein side of the protein-lipid interface can be seen (Fig. 4B) as viewed from the lipid surface. The two protruding “feet” (marked i and ii) correspond to the membrane binding portions of the protein. The surface areas of these contact regions are 390 and 125 Å2. This total represents less than 2% of the 28,000 Å2 total surface area of the protein as probed with a sphere of 4 Å radius. Fitting the X-ray Structure of Gαβγtinto the EM Map—The single heterotrimer unit was computationally isolated by cutting with planes tangential to and perpendicular to the tube surface, as shown in Fig. 4, A and B. This unit was then used to obtain the best fit of the Gαβγt x-ray crystal structure (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) using the program Foldhunter (23Jiang W. Baker M.L. Ludtke S.J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); the crystal structure at a resolution of 30 Å is shown in Fig. 4, C and D. The rough position of the structures is largely determined by the region of highest density, which is in the core of the β-propeller of Gβt. Optimizing the cross-correlation between the two structures yielded the alignment shown in Fig. 4, E and F. The aligned position of the crystal structure is shown in greater detail in Fig. 5. On a relative scale for the cross-correlation score of -1 to 1, the value for the optimal position is 0.45. Fig. 4, E and F, shows side and bottom views of a portion of the EM map corresponding to a single heterotrimer, represented as a mesh surface, superimposed on a ribbon representation of the crystal structure in the best-fit orientation. The membrane surface lies on a horizontal plane just below the protein in Fig. 4E, and is parallel to and above the page in Fig. 4F. In this position the N-terminal helix of Gαt and its β2–β3 loop are close to the membrane surface, and none of the regions of Gβt and Gγt visible in the crystal structure are immediately adjacent to the membrane. The last visible residue on the C terminus of Gγt, Glu66 (the green terminus near the “i” in Fig. 4E), is positioned so that the missing residues 67–71, including the farnesyl moiety on Cys71, could easily extend to the membrane surface. It is likely that the missing portions of the C terminus of Gγt and the N terminus of Gαt, including their covalently attached lipids, make up most of the density connecting to the membrane at attachment site i shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 4E. The residues at attachment site ii, on the right-hand side of Fig. 4E, shown in closer detail in Fig. 5, A and B, appears to be those from the Gαt β2–β3 loop, especially Lys188 (yellow) and Asp189 (purple), as well as Arg28 (tan) from the C-terminal end of the N-terminal helix of Gαt (all color-coded residues are shown in ball and stick representation). The side chains of both Asp189 and Arg28 extend toward the membrane surface in this position, whereas that of Lys188 points away from the membrane toward aspartate residues 333 and 337. Restriction of Membrane Contacts to Two Narrow Surfaces—Perhaps the most surprising result from the reconstruction is that the area of contact between protein and lipid is quite small, involving only 2% of the protein surface. This conclusion follows from inspection of"

Lipid translocation has been investigated mostly by using short chain lipid analogs because assays for endogenous lipids are inherently complicated. In the present paper, we optimized two independent assays for the translocation of natural phosphatidylcholine (PC) to the cell surface based on the hydrolysis of outer leaflet phosphoglycerolipids by exogenous phospholipase A2 and the exchange of outer leaflet PC by a transfer protein. We report that PC reached the cell surface in the absence of vesicular traffic by a pathway that involved translocation across the plasma membrane. In erythrocytes, PC that was labeled at the inside of the plasma membrane was translocated to the cell surface with a half-time of 30 min. This translocation was probably mediated by an ATPase, because it required ATP and was vanadate-sensitive. The inhibition of PC translocation by glibenclamide, an inhibitor of various ATP binding cassette transporters, and its reduction in erythrocytes from both Abcb1a/1b and Abcb4 knockout mice, suggest the involvement of ATP binding cassette transporters in natural PC cell surface translocation. The relative importance of the outward translocation of PC as compared with the well characterized fast inward translocation of phosphatidylserine for the overall asymmetric phospholipid organization in plasma membranes remains to be established.

Comfurius P. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). PS and PE are continuously translocated from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes by proteins belonging to a subfamily of P-type ATPases (3Tang X. Halleck M.S.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Inward translocation of PS is essential to prevent PS cell surface signaling, which induces blood coagulation and serves as a signal for cell-cell recognition, e.g. the removal of apoptotic cells by macrophages. An additional function of lipid translocation has emerged recently. Evidence from mammalian and yeast cells suggests that ATP-dependent inward translocation of phospholipids by the aminophospholipid translocase affects membrane curvature and is a, or the, driving force for the formation of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane (4Pomorski T.

The fact that yeast expresses five P-type ATPase family members in different compartments of the exocytic and endocytic transport pathways suggests the possibility that all membrane budding from sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membranes depends on the mass translocation of membrane phospholipids.The bulk membrane phospholipid in mammalian cells is PC, which constitutes 25-50 mol % of the membrane lipids. However, it is unclear if cells possess mechanisms for the plasma membrane translocation of PC as for PS and PE. PC is a cylindrical lipid with a low tendency to flip across membranes, with a half-time of days in model membranes. Indeed, using natural PC (7van Meer G. Op den Kamp J.A. J. Cell.

J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), typical half-times for inward translocation have been reported of hours (as compared with minutes for PS) in the erythrocyte membrane as a model plasma membrane. Still, in some cells the short chain PCs displayed rapid inward translocation (12Sleight R.G. Abanto M.N. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar) in an ATP-dependent and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive manner (13Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Muller P. van Meer G. Burger K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as they do in yeast (4Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol.

Either some cells possess a specific inward PC translocator or some aminophospholipid translocases are not strictly specific for PS and PE. In erythrocytes, aminophospholipids also translocate in the opposite, outward direction but much slower than inward: short chain PS and PE displayed ATP-dependent inward and outward transport with half-times of 3 and 35 min, respectively, for the inward direction and 58 and 77 min for the outward direction (15Connor J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19412-19417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First hints for the identity of one PC outward translocator came from the finding that PC secretion into mouse bile depended on the presence of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter Abcb4 (17Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. Ottenhoff R. van der Lugt N.M. van Roon M.A. van der Valk M.A. Offerhaus G.J. Berns A.J. Borst P.

In studies on short chain lipids, human ABCB4 was found to be specific for PC, whereas, unexpectedly, the closely related multidrug transporter ABCB1 translocated a wide variety of short chain lipids (19van Helvoort A.

However, in erythrocytes the outward translocation of C6-NBD-PC and -PS was found to be mediated by an alternative ABC transporter, ABCC1 (23Dekkers D.W. Comfurius P. Schroit A.J. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14833-14837Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because the expression of ABCB4 is rather specific for liver and there is no convincing evidence that ABCB1 and ABCC1 translocate natural, long chain lipids, the question remains whether natural PC is actively translocated across the plasma membrane of non-hepatocytes.Outward translocation of natural PC has been reported in rat and human erythrocytes (24Renooij W. van Golde L.M.

The process appeared restricted to newly synthesized PC, sensitive to the arginine modifying reagent phenylglyoxal, and insensitive to vanadate (26Andrick C. Broring K. Deuticke B. Haest C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1064: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting protein-mediated but energy-independent PC translocation as it was also proposed for bile canalicular membranes (27Berr F.

In the present study we re-evaluated the translocation of natural PC from the inside to the outside of the plasma membrane. For this, we optimized two independent assays for measuring the fraction of intracellularly labeled PC that arrived at the cell surface, the hydrolysis of cell surface PC with phospholipase A2 (1Verkleij A.J.

We investigated PC cell surface translocation in erythrocytes and in fibroblasts and present evidence that PC is actively translocated across mammalian plasma membranes with characteristics that would be in accordance with an involvement of ABC transporters.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The radioactive fatty acids [1-14C]arachidonic acid (50 Ci/mol), ([1-14C]- and [U-14C]palmitic acid (50 Ci/mol and 500 Ci/mol, respectively), and [1-14C]oleic acid (50 Ci/mol) were from Amersham Biosciences; l-[palmitoyl-1-14C]carnitine chloride (50 Ci/mol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, [32P]H3PO4 in H2O was from ICN (Zoetermeer, The Netherlands), NBD-labeled lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

[32P]Phosphate-labeled lipids were separated before TLC on Accell Plus CM anion exchange SepPak columns (Waters, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). Briefly, columns were equilibrated with CHCl3:MeOH (2:1), the lipids were loaded in a few drops of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1), and the uncharged lipids were eluted with 4 ml of 1 mm ammonium acetate in CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (3:6:1). 1.2 ml of 4 mm HCl was added and a phase separation was performed. Anionic lipids were eluted with increasing ammonium acetate concentrations. TLC plates were exposed to a phosphorimager screen (BAS-MS or BAS-TR, Fuji Medical Systems, Stanford, CT) for 2 days and scanned with a Personal Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad). The fluorescence of C6-NBD-PC-labeled cells was measured with a STORM imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantifications were performed with Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Total phospholipids were quantified by phosphate determination after scraping the iodine-stained lipid spots from two-dimensional TLC plates (31Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A.

Human erythrocytes were obtained from healthy volunteers by venipuncture, from anesthetized mice by heart puncture or from the eye background with sodium heparin as anticoagulant. Animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Dutch government concerning animal care. Erythrocytes were collected by centrifugation and the buffy coat was removed by five washes with buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4).

Wohlhueter R.M. Kraupp M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) before a 2-h incubation in the presence of the label, [14C]palmitoylcarnitine (38Arduini A. Mancinelli G. Radatti G.L. Dottori S.

One volume of the erythrocyte pellet was diluted into 4 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (9 mm KCl, 4.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.22 mm EGTA, 1 mm Hepes, pH 7). After 15 min on ice 2 mm ATP or AMP-PNP were added and tonicity was restored by addition of 900 mm KCl, 450 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7, and cells were resealed for 1 h at 37 °C. Resealed ghosts were collected by centrifugation (10 min, 3,200 × g) and washed three times with buffer A.Metabolic Labeling—Fibroblasts in 6-well plates were preincubated for 20 min with 1 μg/ml brefeldin A to block vesicular traffic, with or without candidate translocation inhibitors. The cells were labeled for the indicated times with 20 μCi/well [32P]phosphate (about 9 × 105 cells), washed with PBS, and chased for different time periods before analysis with a cell surface PC assay. Erythrocytes were preincubated for 20 min with or without inhibitors, labeled with trace amounts of [14C]arachidonic, -oleic, or -palmitic acid (0.1-1 nmol/100 nmol of erythrocyte lipids) or with [14C]palmitoylcarnitine (1.5 nmol/100 nmol of erythrocyte lipids), washed with 2% BSA and twice with buffer A, and chased for the indicated time periods with or without inhibitors before analysis with a cell surface PC assay.PLA2Cell Surface Assay—Cells (150 nmol of phospholipid) were incubated in 500 μl of buffer A plus 10 mm CaCl2 and 50 IU bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) for 5 min at 37 °C. Hemolysis as the absorption of the cell supernatant at 540 nm in a spectrophotometer was below 4%. Lipids were quantified after two-dimensional TLC analysis. [14C]PC exposure at the erythrocyte surface was expressed as % decrease of [14C]PC in the PLA2-treated sample as compared with the identically treated control but without PLA2. If [14C]PC in the PLA2-treated sample was not decreased but slightly higher than in the control, this way of quantification generates negative values. Alternatively, [14C]PC exposure at the erythrocyte surface was expressed as % of 1-[14C]palmitoyl lyso-PC of the total 1-[14C]palmitoyl-PC in the control without PLA2. For the quantification of total 1-[14C]palmitoyl-PC in the control, lipids were extracted, dried under nitrogen, and dissolved in 10 μl of diethyl ether, added to 1 ml of buffer A plus 10 mm CaCl2, containing 1% BSA and 20 IU PLA2, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, after which 1-[14C]palmitoyl lyso-PC was quantified. In fibroblasts, [32P]PC at the cell surface was measured as % of [32P]lyso-PC in the PLA2-treated sample from total [32P]PC ([32P]lyso-PC + [32P]PC) in the control without PLA2.PC Transfer Protein (PCTP) Cell Surface Assay—PCTP (a kind gift from K. Wirtz (CBLE, Utrecht)) (39Kamp H.H. Wirtz K.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was stored in 50% glycerol, which was removed before the assay by using Centricon YM 10 filter units (Millipore, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). For investigating the outward translocation of [14C]PC, small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were generated by sonication on ice (18Smith A.J. Timmermans-Hereijgers J.L. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W. van Blitterswijk W.J. Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) of egg PC:cholesterol:egg PS (50: 50:1, mol/mol). The amount of SUVs in the cell pellet was below 2% as measured by [14C]cholesterol ester as a non-exchangeable SUV marker. Cells containing 100 nmol of phospholipid were labeled for 40 min with [14C]arachidonate, washed with buffer A, 2% BSA, and twice with buffer A and incubated at 37 °C in 500 μl of buffer A, 15 mm glucose, 3 nmol of PCTP, a 10-fold excess of SUV PC, and a 20-fold excess of cold arachidonate under slow rotation. After the incubation, the cells were washed three times in buffer A containing 1% glycerol. The supernatants were pooled and the lipids of cells and supernatants were analyzed. Cell surface [14C]PC was quantified as [14C]PC in the PCTP supernatant as % of total [14C]PC in supernatant plus cells. In [14C]PC inward translocation studies, SUVs were generated by sonication of (a) PC isolated from [14C]arachidonate-labeled erythrocytes:cholesterol: egg PS (50:50:1) or (b) [32P]PC isolated from mouse fibroblasts:cholesterol:egg PS (50:50:1). Erythrocytes containing 100 nmol of phospholipid were incubated at 37 or 4 °C in 500 μl of buffer A, 15 mm glucose, 3 nmol of PCTP and SUVs. The ratio of total erythrocyte PC to SUV PC was between 1:10 and 1:2. After the incubation, the erythrocytes were washed 3 times with buffer A, 1% glycerol before further incubation and a PLA2 assay.Outward Translocation of C6-NBD-PC—C6-NBD-PC cell surface translocation was measured essentially as described by Connor et al. (15Connor J. Pak C.H. Zwaal R.F. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19412-19417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 ml of packed human erythrocytes were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with 15-20 nmol of C6-NBD-PC in buffer A, 15 mm glucose, containing 1 m ethanol to reversibly accelerate phospholipid flip (40Schwichtenhovel C. Deuticke B. Haest C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because all samples were identically labeled with C6-NBD-PC in the presence of 1 m ethanol, differences in translocation rates are irrespective of the ethanol. C6-NBD-PC still at the cell surface was removed by two washes with 20 volumes of buffer A, 2% BSA, for 2 min at room temperature. Outward translocation of the lipid analog was measured by incubating the cells at 37 °C in buffer A, 15 mm glucose, with or without candidate inhibitors for various times. Cell surface C6-NBD-PC was depleted with BSA as described above. Lipids in the cells and BSA washes were extracted and separated by one-dimensional TLC in acidic solvent. C6-NBD-PC cell surface exposure was measured as % of C6-NBD-PC in the supernatant from total C6-NBD-PC in cells plus supernatant. % C6-NBD-FA was below 10% of total NBD fluorescence and increased during the chase by less than 5%, independent of the inhibitors.RESULTSTo investigate the outward translocation of natural PC across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, we first optimized two independent PC cell surface assays in erythrocytes. Here, the absence of intracellular membranes facilitates the analysis of transport processes at the plasma membrane and allows to optimally control cell surface assay conditions. If the assay induced disturbances at the plasma membrane, these would be detectable by changes in total lipid asymmetry, erythrocyte shape, and by increased hemolysis. The high percentage of PC at the erythrocyte surface is favorable for its quantification.Assays for the Translocation of Natural PCGeneration of Labeled PC at the Inside of the Plasma Membrane—The investigation of the outward translocation of natural PC depends on placing a labeled PC at the inside of the cell and an assay for its appearance on the outside. Mature erythrocytes are not able to synthesize lipids de novo but exogenous fatty acids are rapidly taken up and coupled to pre-existing lyso-PC via an ATP-dependent acyl-CoA synthetase and an acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase at the inside of the plasma membrane (24Renooij W. van Golde L.M. Zwaal R.F. van Deenen L.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Renooij W. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1991; 1064: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sidedness of PC labeling was demonstrated experimentally. Insertion of 5 mol % of lyso-PC into the outer leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane enhanced the incorporation of [14C]arachidonic acid into PC, but not into PE or PS. This effect was only seen after increasing chase periods and was after 5 min of chase 111%, after 15 min 140%, and after 25 min 203% of PC labeling in the control without exogenous lyso-PC. In contrast, when lyso-PC was offered to both sides of the plasma membrane during hypo-osmotic shock, PC labeling increased to 2300% after 15 min, supporting bulk PC labeling at the inside. The stimulatory effect of exogenous lyso-PC on PC labeling in intact erythrocytes is best explained by slow inward movement of lyso-PC.Detecting Labeled PC at the Cell Surface—Two methods have been used to measure the transbilayer distribution of PC across the erythrocyte membrane, hydrolysis of surface PC by PLA2 (1Verkleij A.J.

Acta. 1980; 620: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).First, we optimized the PLA2 assay to reduce incubation times and allow the immediate detection of newly synthesized PC at the cell surface. Incubation of a 50-μl erythrocyte pellet with 50 IU PLA2 in 500 μl of buffer A, 10 mm CaCl2 for 5 min at 37 °C resulted in almost complete degradation of cell surface PC, namely 92 ± 1.4% of [32P]PC that had been introduced into the outer bilayer leaflet by PCTP at 4 °C (Table I). The generated degradation pattern of total phospholipid was in agreement with the literature on erythrocyte lipid asymmetry. No breakdown of PS was detected, demonstrating restriction of PLA2 activity to the surface lipids, unless 1% BSA was present with PLA2, causing hemolysis by extracting free fatty acids and lysolipids. The PLA2 hydrolysis pattern of the [14C]fatty acid-labeled phosphoglycerolipids (Fig. 1) largely reflected that of total lipids, showing full equilibration of the labeled lipids after overnight chase. When analyzing the cell surface exposure of [14C]arachidonoyl-PC and [14C]oleoyl-PC after 30 min labeling, we already found 37 ± 4 and 28 ± 17% at the cell surface, which increased to 56 ± 7 and 53 ± 6% after an overnight chase, respectively, suggesting fast outward translocation of PC with a half-time below 30 min. Also [14C]PE rapidly appeared at the cell surface, however, the large standard deviations inherent to the determination of the minor fractions of"
https://openalex.org/W1976296623,"In a rotary motor F1F0-ATP synthase, F0 works as a proton motor; the oligomer ring of F0c-subunits (c-ring) rotates relative to the F0ab2 domain as protons pass through F0 down the gradient. F0ab2 must exert dual functions during rotation, that is, sliding the c-ring (motor drive) while keeping the association with the c-ring (anchor rail). Here we have isolated thermophilic F1F0(-a) which lacks F0a. F1F0(-a) has no proton transport activity, and F0(-a) does not work as a proton channel. Interestingly, ATPase activity of F1F0(-a) is greatly suppressed, even though its F1 sector is intact. Most likely, F0b2 associates with the c-ring as an anchor rail in the intact F1F0; without F0a, this association prevents rotation of the c-ring (and hence the γ-subunit), which disables ATP hydrolysis at F1. Functional F1F0 is easily reconstituted from purified F0a and F1F0(-a), and thus F0a can bind to its proper location on F1F0(-a) without a large rearrangement of other-subunits."

In the present investigation, we report that tamalin possesses a typical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which enables Syk kinase to be recruited and phosphorylated by the Src family kinases. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of rat brain membrane fractions showed that tamalin is present in a multimolecular protein assembly comprising not only mGluR1 but also c-Src, Fyn, and a protein phosphatase, SHP-2. The protein association of both tamalin and c-Src, as determined by truncation analysis of mGluR1 in COS-7 cells, occurred at the carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1. Mutation analysis of tyrosine with phenylalanine in COS-7 cells revealed that paired tyrosines at the ITAM sequence of tamalin are phosphorylated preferentially by c-Src and Fyn, and this phosphorylation can recruit Syk kinase and enables it to be phosphorylated by the Src family kinases. The phosphorylated tyrosines at the ITAM sequence of tamalin were highly susceptible to dephosphorylation by protein-tyrosine phosphatases in COS-7 cells.

The multimolecular protein assembly of neurotransmitter receptors is important as a fundamental mechanism for receptor localization, clustering, and signal transduction in neuronal cells (1Husi H.

Glutamate receptors are categorized into two classes: ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), 1The abbreviations used are: iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; anti-P-Tyr, anti-phosphotyrosine; bpV(phen), potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate(V); ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; P-Tyr, phosphotyrosine. which comprise glutamate-gated cation channels, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (7Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Google Scholar, 8Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Google Scholar). Recently, a number of scaffold proteins that interact with iGluRs or mGluRs have been identified, and their roles in the functional organization and intracellular trafficking of glutamate receptors have been studied extensively (1Husi H. Grant S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 259-266Google Scholar, 2Scannevin R.H. Huganir R.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 133-141Google Scholar, 3Kim J.H. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 248-254Google Scholar). Tamalin (also termed GRP1-associated scaffold protein) is a scaffold protein that comprises multiple protein-interacting domains (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar, 10Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Google Scholar). The PDZ domain and the leucine-zipper region of tamalin bind to the carboxyl-terminal tail of group 1/group 2 mGluRs and the coiled-coil region of guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesins, respectively (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar, 10Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Google Scholar). Tamalin promotes intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression of group 1 mGluRs in COS-7 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons through the interaction with cytohesins (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar). Tamalin also physically associates with several important scaffold proteins involved in postsynaptic organization and protein trafficking in neuronal cells (11Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14762-14768Google Scholar). However, its linkage to intracellular signaling cascades remained to be investigated. In immune cells, paired tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of antigen receptors and their accessory proteins is essential for activation of phosphotyrosine-based, intracellular signaling cascades of antigen receptors (12Latour S. Veillette A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 299-306Google Scholar, 13Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 394-401Google Scholar, 14Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar). The ITAM sequence is defined as two tyrosines spaced 9–11 residues apart with leucine or isoleucine positioned 3 residues carboxyl-terminal to each tyrosine [D/E]XXYXX[L/I]X6–8YXX[L/I]; one-letter code for amino acids with X representing any amino acid) (15Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Google Scholar). Antigen receptor signaling is initiated by paired phosphorylation of tyrosines within the ITAM sequence by a member of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) family. The doubly phosphorylated ITAM provides a specific docking site for Syk/ZAP-70 PTKs, and a set of specific protein substrates becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, resulting in activation of downstream signaling of antigen receptors (16Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Google Scholar, 17Kurosaki T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 354-363Google Scholar). In this investigation, the amino acid sequence analysis of tamalin revealed the presence of the ITAM sequence at the amino-terminal region of tamalin. Here, we report that tamalin is doubly phosphorylated at tyrosines of the ITAM sequence by the Src family kinases and serves as a scaffold protein that recruits and activates Syk kinase.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14762-14768Google Scholar). DNA Constructs—Tamalin was tagged with Myc epitope at its amino-terminal end by inserting tamalin cDNA into the pCMV-Tag3 mammalian expression vector (Stratagene). Tamalin mutants in which phenylalanine replaced tyrosine were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A mammalian expression vector for human Syk (pApurohSyk) was described previously (18Miah S.M. Sada K. Tuazon P.T. Ling J. Maeno K. Kyo S. Qu X. Tohyama Y. Traugh J.A. Yamamura H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 71-83Google Scholar), and those for human wild-type c-Src (pcDNA3-hSrc), constitutively active c-Src (pcDNA3-hSrcY530F), kinase-dead c-Src (pcDNA3-hSrcK298M), and wild-type Fyn (pME-B-Fyn) were kindly provided by T. Yamamoto (19Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Google Scholar). Kinase-dead Syk was generated by substituting arginine for lysine at position 402 by site-directed mutagenesis. mGluR1a was tagged with FLAG epitope at its amino-terminal end just following the signal sequence. Truncation mutants of FLAG-mGluR1a were generated by introducing stop codons into the carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1a by site-directed mutagenesis. Proper mutations were verified for all mutated DNAs by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °Cin5%CO2. DNA transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions; in control experiments, an equivalent amount of the vector DNA was transfected into COS-7 cells. Transfected cells were grown on 6- or 12-well plates in the culture medium for 36–48 h before analysis. In some experiments, 100 μm bpV(phen) or 1 mm Na3VO4 was added to the culture medium 20 min before cell lysis. P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Monolayer cells were cultured in collagen-coated dishes in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μm retinoic acid for 24 and 48 h. bpV(phen) (final concentration, 100 μm) was added 30 min before cell lysis with the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation of Myc-tamalin and Syk, transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in the TN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture Complete. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-mGluR1, cells were lysed with the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture Complete. Cell lysates were precleared with normal rabbit or normal mouse IgG-conjugated agarose beads for 60 min. Myc-tamalin and FLAG-mGluR1 were immunoprecipitated with agarose beads conjugated with rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal anti-Myc and anti-FLAG for 3 h at 4 °C. Syk was immunoprecipitated with anti-Syk and protein A/G PLUS-agarose. Brain lysates and P2 membrane fractions were prepared from whole rat brains and solubilized with the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar). Brain lysates and solubilized membrane fractions were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 60 min, incubated with antiserum or antibodies, and attached to protein A-Sepharose in the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer overnight. Immunoprecipitates were eluted with 2× lithium dodecyl sulfate or 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Cell lysates, solubilized membrane fractions, or immunoprecipitates were separated by 4–12% gradient (Invitrogen) or 8% (Bio-Rad) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell), followed by immunoblot analysis with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or unconjugated antibodies; unconjugated antibodies were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. In immunoblot analysis of anti-tamalin immunoprecipitates, antibody used for immunoprecipitation interfered with detection of both phosphorylated tamalin and Syk. To avoid this problem, anti-tamalin was cross-linked to protein A resin, using an ImmunoPure rProtein A IgG Plus Orientation kit (Pierce), and immunoprecipitates were blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies; horseradish peroxidase conjugation was performed using an EZ-Link Plus Activated Peroxidase kit (Pierce). Immunoreactive bands were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). A Protein Assembly of Tamalin with Protein-tyrosine Kinases and Protein-tyrosine Phosphatases—Tamalin possesses 12 tyrosine residues over its entire sequence (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence data analysis disclosed that 2 tyrosines at positions 55 and 67 and their surrounding sequences match the consensus ITAM sequence (Fig. 1A). In addition, tyrosines at positions 214 and 236 are followed by leucine with a 2-amino acid space, and these sequences resemble the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) involved in recruitment of SHIP and the SHP protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) (Fig. 1A) (20Veillette A. Latour S. Davidson D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 669-707Google Scholar, 21Tamir I. Dal Porto J.M. Cambier J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 307-315Google Scholar). We first addressed whether tamalin forms a protein complex in vivo with the Src family kinases, c-Src and Fyn, and SHP-2 and SHIP-2, all of which are known to be expressed in the brain (22Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Google Scholar, 23Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Google Scholar, 24Muraille E. Pesesse X. Kuntz C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 697-705Google Scholar). Solubilized rat brain P2 membrane fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-tamalin and immunoblotted with anti-c-Src, anti-Fyn, anti-SHP-2, and anti-SHIP-2. Anti-tamalin coimmunoprecipitated c-Src and SHP-2, but not Fyn or SHIP-2 (Fig. 1B). Our previous study showed that tamalin is enriched at the postsynaptic density fraction and interacts with a large splice variant of mGluR1 in the brain (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar). We examined whether mGluR1 has the ability to form a protein complex with PTKs and PTP in the brain. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting showed that mGluR1 was coimmunoprecipitated from solubilized rat brain P2 membrane fractions with anti-tamalin, anti-c-Src, anti-Fyn and anti-Syk, but not with anti-SHP-2 (Fig. 1C). The result indicates that mGluR1 associates with not only tamalin but also c-Src, Fyn, and Syk in the brain. When Myc-tamalin was expressed heterologously together with exogenously transfected c-Src or Fyn or with endogenous SHP-2 in COS-7 cells, none of these proteins was coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tamalin from cell lysates (data not shown), indicating that tamalin does not bind directly to c-Src, Fyn, or SHP-2. We then investigated an mGluR1-mediated complex formation with PTKs in COS-7 cells. FLAG-mGluR1 was cotransfected with c-Src, Fyn, and Syk in COS-7 cells, and the interaction of these PTKs with mGluR1 was examined by immunoprecipitation of cotransfected cell lysates with anti-FLAG followed by immunoblotting with the respective PTK antibodies. This analysis showed that c-Src, Fyn, and Syk were all coimmunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (Fig. 2B). SHP-2 was endogenously highly expressed in COS-7 cells, but FLAG-mGluR1 immunoprecipitation failed to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous SHP-2 (Fig. 2B), confirming the inability of SHP-2 to associate with mGluR1. To assign the interaction sites of mGluR1 with tamalin and c-Src, we constructed a series of truncated mutants at the carboxyl-terminal tail of FLAG-mGluR1 (Fig. 2A) and examined their ability to interact with Myc-tamalin or c-Src coexpressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). This analysis showed that the interaction of tamalin with mGluR1 was reduced greatly by deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 179 amino acids of mGluR1 (mGluR1Δ179) and completely lost in the mGluR1Δ234 mutant (Fig. 2C). The carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1 possesses multiple proline-rich sequences including the Src homology 3 binding motif (PXXP) of the Src family kinases (22Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Similar to the interaction between mGluR1 and tamalin, the association of c-Src with mGluR1 was reduced greatly by truncation of the last 179 amino acids of mGluR1 (mGluR1Δ179) and abolished completely by removal of multiple proline-rich domains present in the last 234-amino acid sequence of mGluR1 (mGluR1Δ234) (Fig. 2D). Because the binding sites of tamalin and c-Src are overlapping at the carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1, we addressed whether these two proteins can bind concomitantly to mGluR1 or mutually interfere with their binding to mGluR1 (Fig. 2E). FLAG-mGluR1 was cotransfected with either Myc-tamalin or c-Src, or both, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-c-Src. Levels of coimmunoprecipitation of both Myc-tamalin and c-Src were comparable between individual and combined expressions of these two proteins (Fig. 2E). The result indicates that tamalin and c-Src can be closely located with each other by simultaneous binding to the carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1. Collectively, these results indicate that tamalin is present in close proximity to c-Src, Fyn, and Syk in the brain. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the Tamalin ITAM—We examined whether tamalin is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A). Myc-tamalin and c-Src were coexpressed in COS-7 cells, and Myc-tamalin was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc followed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr (Fig. 3A). Comparable amounts of Myc-tamalin were immunoprecipitated regardless of cotransfection with and without c-Src. Myc-tamalin was phosphorylated considerably by c-Src (Fig. 3A). This phosphorylation was enhanced significantly by constitutively active c-Src and reduced greatly with kinase-dead c-Src or without the addition of exogenous c-Src (Fig. 3A). Because mGluR1 has the ability to recruit both tamalin and c-Src at its carboxyl-terminal tail, we examined the possibility that coexpression of mGluR1 facilitates phosphorylation of tamalin by c-Src (Fig. 3B). Myc-tamalin and c-Src were coexpressed with and without FLAG-mGluR1, and extents of tamalin phosphorylation were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc followed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. Coexpression of mGluR1 markedly increased phosphorylation of tamalin by c-Src (Fig. 3B), indicating that mGluR1-mediated recruitment of tamalin and c-Src is capable of facilitating c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of tamalin. We next tried to identify which tyrosine is phosphorylated by the Src family kinases in COS-7 cells. Tyrosines at positions 55, 61, and 67 within the putative ITAM sequence and those at 214 and 236 in the ITIM-related sequences were replaced with phenylalanine individually or combinatorially. These Myc-tamalin mutants were cotransfected with c-Src or Fyn, and their phosphorylation was analyzed by anti-Myc immunoprecipitation followed by anti-P-Tyr immunoblotting (Fig. 3, C and D). A single mutation at position 55 (Y55F) greatly reduced both c-Src-mediated and Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of tamalin. When tyrosines at positions 55 and 67 were doubly replaced with phenylalanine (Y55F/Y67F, Y55F/Y61F/Y67F, and Y55F/Y67F/Y214F/Y236F), these mutations almost completely abrogated tamalin phosphorylation with both c-Src and Fyn (Fig. 3, C and D). By contrast, single or combinatorial mutations at positions 61, 214, and 236 (Y61F, Y214F, Y236F, Y214F/Y236F, Y61F/Y214F/Y236F) showed appreciable extents of tamalin phosphorylation with both c-Src and Fyn (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that the two tyrosines located within the consensus ITAM sequence of tamalin serve as preferentially phosphorylated sites with both c-Src and Fyn. Association of Syk with the Phosphorylated ITAM of Tamalin—We examined whether tamalin has the ability to recruit Syk, depending on PTK-mediated phosphorylation at the ITAM sequence of tamalin. Myc-tamalin was cotransfected in different combinations with active and inactive forms of c-Src and Syk in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4A). Myc-tamalin was immunoprecipitated followed by anti-P-Tyr immunoblotting. Coexpression of Syk with c-Src significantly enhanced phosphorylation of tamalin, and this enhanced phosphorylation occurred even when kinase-dead Syk was coexpressed with c-Src (Fig. 4A). In contrast, tamalin was not phosphorylated by Syk alone (data not shown) nor by coexpression of kinase-dead c-Src with Syk (Fig. 4A). This finding indicates that the c-Src kinase activity is indispensable for tamalin phosphorylation. The Syk-enhanced tamalin phosphorylation may result from stabilization of the c-Src/tamalin/Syk interaction or resistance of phosphorylated tamalin to dephosphorylation with PTPs because of the physical association between phosphorylated tamalin and Syk (see below). The mechanism underlying this observation, however, remains elusive in this investigation. We then examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation in the ITAM sequence of tamalin is necessary for interaction between tamalin and Syk (Fig. 4B). Wild-type and a series of tyrosine-mutated forms of Myc-tamalin were cotransfected with c-Src and Syk in COS-7 cells. The extents of tamalin phosphorylation and the interaction of Syk with various forms of tamalin were analyzed by immunoprecipitation of Myc-tamalin followed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr and anti-Syk, respectively (Fig. 4B). In every case, phosphorylation signals of tamalin were increased prominently by coexpression of c-Src and Syk, but relative extents of c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of various forms of tamalin remained unchanged between the presence and absence of Syk (compare the data of Fig. 3C and 4B). Importantly, paired substitutions at positions 55 and 67 (Y55F/ Y67F, Y55F/Y61F/Y67F, Y55F/Y67F/Y214F/Y236F) almost completely abolished the interaction between tamalin and Syk (Fig. 4B). In contrast, single or combinatorial mutations at positions 61, 214, and 236 (Y61F, Y214F, Y236F, Y214F/Y236F, Y61F/Y214F/Y236F) had no appreciable effect on the interaction between tamalin and Syk (Fig. 4B). The importance of ITAM phosphorylation in the association between tamalin and Syk was analyzed further in Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of tamalin by coexpression of Fyn, Syk, and a series of tyrosine-mutated forms of tamalin in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4C). The association of tamalin with Syk was greatly and moderately reduced in Y55F and Y67F mutants, respectively, and almost completely abrogated by paired substitutions at both positions (Y55F/Y67F, Y55F/Y61F/Y67F). In contrast, Y61F and Y214F/Y236F mutations had no effect on the association between tamalin and Syk (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that paired tyrosine phosphorylation of the tamalin ITAM plays a critical role for binding of Syk to tamalin. The association of phosphorylated tamalin with ZAP-70 was also examined by cotransfection of c-Src, Myc-tamalin, and ZAP-70 in COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc followed by immunoblotting with anti-ZAP-70 failed to detect the association between phosphorylated tamalin and ZAP-70 in cotransfected cell lysates (data not shown). Enhanced Phosphorylation of Tamalin-associated Syk—We examined whether recruitment of Syk to phosphorylated tamalin influences Syk phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation of cotransfected cell lysates with anti-Syk followed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr (Fig. 5). c-Src phosphorylated Syk (lane 2), and this phosphorylation of Syk was enhanced considerably by coexpression with tamalin (lane 3). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was dependent on the Src kinase activity (lane 4), but appreciable Syk phosphorylation was observed with kinase-dead Syk (lane 5). The results indicate that the association of Syk with tamalin in an ITAM-based manner increases c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of Syk. The Src family kinases have been shown to phosphorylate Syk at multiple sites and induce autophosphorylation of Syk (25Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Google Scholar, 26Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C.C. Yankee T.M. Sarac R. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5276-5283Google Scholar). The resultant activation of Syk stimulates distinct downstream signalings, depending on different phosphorylation sites of Syk (27Sada K. Takano T. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 177-186Google Scholar). We analyzed tamalin-dependent phosphorylation sites of Syk, using antibodies specific for phosphorylated Tyr323, Tyr352, and Tyr525/Tyr526 of Syk. Antibodies against P-Tyr323 and P-Tyr525/Tyr526 failed to reveal immunoreactive signals of phosphorylated Syk in cell lysates cotransfected with c-Src, Syk, and tamalin (data not shown). Antibody against P-Tyr352, in contrast, yielded immunoreactive signals that were dependent on active c-Src (Fig. 5, lanes 1–4) and significantly enhanced by coexpression with tamalin (lane 3). This phosphorylation was slightly enhanced when tamalin was coexpressed with kinase-dead c-Src (compare lane 1 and lane 4), and this enhancement may be attributed to endogenous c-Src in COS-7 cells (lane 1). More importantly, the enhanced phosphorylation at position 352 of Syk was seen explicitly when kinase-dead Syk was expressed in conjunction with coexpression of c-Src and tamalin (lane 5). The results indicate that the interaction of phosphorylated tamalin with Syk specifies c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation at position 352 of Syk. Enhancement of Tamalin Phosphorylation and Syk Recruitment by Protein Phosphatase Inhibitors—To assess the susceptibility of phosphorylated tamalin to dephosphorylation with PTPs, we examined the effects of PTP inhibitors on tamalin phosphorylation in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were coexpressed with Myc-tamalin and c-Src and incubated with a tyrosine phosphatase-selective inhibitor, bpV(phen) (28Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Google Scholar), for 10 or 20 min before cell lysis. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and immunoblotted with anti-P-Tyr (Fig. 6A). The bpV(phen) treatment increased phosphorylation of not only wild-type tamalin but also all tamalin mutants by more than five times that of bpV(phen)-untreated cells. This increase in tamalin phosphorylation became saturated during a 10-min treatment of bpV(phen) (data not shown). Importantly, relative extents of c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of various forms of mutants were similar between the presence and absence of the bpV(phen) inhibitor, and c-Src-mediated-phosphorylation was reduced markedly by paired substitutions at positions 55 and 67 (lanes 5, 7, 11–13) (compare Fig. 3C and short exposure of Fig. 6A). The result indicates that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation occurs predominantly at the ITAM sequence regardless of the presence and absence of the PTP inhibitor and is highly susceptible to dephosphorylation with PTPs. Single and paired tyrosine mutations at the ITIM-related sequences had no effect on bpV(phen)-enhanced tamalin phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, lanes 8–10). In addition, phosphorylated tamalin immunoprecipitated from bpV(phen)-treated cell lysates showed no association with endogenous SHP-2 (data not shown). It is thus unlikely that the ITIM-related sequences of tamalin serve to recruit SHP-2 to tamalin. Enhanced tamalin phosphorylation and its predominant effect on paired tyrosines at the tamalin ITAM sequence were also observed after treatment with a broad spectrum of phosphatase inhibitor, Na3VO4, for 20 min (Fig. 6B). In this experiment, binding of Syk to phosphorylated tamalin was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Myc followed by immunoblotting with anti-Syk (Fig. 6B). Syk binding commonly increased in a variety of tamalin mutants, probably reflecting a weak interaction of Syk with phosphorylated tyrosines at multiple sites of tamalin. Importantly, this binding was apparently reduced by paired tyrosine mutations at the ITAM sequence of tamalin (Fig. 6B, lanes 5, 7, 11–13), confirming that the interaction of Syk with tamalin occurs in an ITAM-based manner. Tamalin Phosphorylation and Syk Recruitment in P19 Embryonal Carcinoma Cells—We next addressed whether tamalin is phosphorylated endogenously and can form a protein assembly with Syk in neural cells. This analysis was first conducted using whole rat brain lysates or solubilized P2 membrane fractions by anti-tamalin immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr and anti-Syk. Upon this analysis, neither phosphorylated tamalin nor tamalin-associated Syk was detected in either of the brain preparations (data not shown). This failure could result from possible technical problems such as a rapid turnover of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tamalin or insufficient PTK activation for tamalin phosphorylation in the normal brain. We thus analyzed P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, which are capable of differentiating into neuron-like cells in culture (10Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Google Scholar). In this cell line, tamalin has been shown to be highly induced by exposure to retinoic acid (10Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Google Scholar). Furthermore, Syk has been implicated in neuron-like differentiation of these cells (29Tsujimura T. Yanagi S. Inatome R. Takano T. Ishihara I. Mitsui N. Takahashi S. Yamamura H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 129-133Google Scholar). P19 cells in monolayer culture were treated with retinoic acid for 24 or 48 h, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-tamalin followed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr and anti-Syk (Fig. 7). This analysis showed not only a signal of tyrosine phosphorylation of tamalin but also coimmunoprecipitation of Syk with immunoprecipitated tamalin. The result demonstrates that tamalin is phosphorylated endogenously and can recruit Syk in P19 cells. Tamalin comprises multiple protein-interacting domains and serves as a key element that contributes to multimolecular protein assembly in neuronal cells (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar, 11Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14762-14768Google Scholar). It forms a protein complex with several postsynaptic receptors and scaffold proteins including group 1 mGluRs, PSD-95, S-SCAM, and SA-PAPs (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar, 11Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14762-14768Google Scholar). It also associates with protein-trafficking scaffold proteins such as cytohesins, Mint2, and CASK (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar, 11Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14762-14768Google Scholar). The present investigation has demonstrated an additional novel function of tamalin in that it mediates Syk signaling in an ITAM-dependent manner. Tamalin possesses a typical ITAM sequence comprising paired tyrosines and leucines in the consensus [D/E]XXYXX[L/I]X6–8YXX[L/I] motif and is doubly phosphorylated at the paired tyrosines by the Src family kinases. This phosphorylation is reduced greatly with kinase-dead c-Src and enhanced considerably with constitutively active c-Src, indicating the dependence of tamalin phosphorylation on c-Src kinase activity. Once the ITAM is phosphorylated, it can recruit Syk and enables it to be phosphorylated by the Src family kinases. Phosphorylated tamalin at the ITAM sequence is highly susceptible to dephosphorylation with PTPs. The functional tamalin is thus regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in an ITAM-based fashion. Importantly, tamalin is endogenously phosphorylated and associated with Syk in P19 cells. Tamalin is thus a novel signaling adaptor that serves not only as a PDZ scaffold protein but also as an ITAM-based signaling molecule. Recently, several cytoplasmic signaling molecules that possess the ITAM sequence have been identified and characterized (30Urzainqui A. Serrador J.M. Viedma F. Yáñez-Mó M. Rodríguez A. Corbí A.L. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. Luque A. Deckert M. Vázquez J. Sánchez-Madrid F. Immunity. 2002; 17: 401-412Google Scholar, 31Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Google Scholar). Proteins of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family contain the ITAM sequence at their amino-terminal regions and act as adaptor molecules that mediate Syk phosphorylation in leukocyte adhesion receptor signaling cascades (30Urzainqui A. Serrador J.M. Viedma F. Yáñez-Mó M. Rodríguez A. Corbí A.L. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. Luque A. Deckert M. Vázquez J. Sánchez-Madrid F. Immunity. 2002; 17: 401-412Google Scholar). STAM is another ITAM-containing adaptor molecule involved in signaling pathways of cytokine receptors, although STAM has been reported not to interact physically with Syk (31Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Google Scholar, 32Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Google Scholar). Tamalin is the first example of a signaling molecule that possesses not only the functional ITAM sequence but also the PDZ domain and PDZ binding motif. The antigen receptor complexes comprise multiple copies of the ITAM sequences (13Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 394-401Google Scholar, 33Love P.E. Shores E.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 591-597Google Scholar). Tamalin contains a single ITAM motif but has ability to form an oligomer via interaction between the PDZ domain and its own PDZ binding motif (11Kitano J.

The oligomeric tamalin, like the antigen receptor complexes, could contribute to amplifying intracellular signaling cascades. It has been reported that stimulation of group 1 mGluRs induces an activation of c-Src and Fyn in cultured cortical neurons in a protein kinase C-independent, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner (34Heidinger V. Manzerra P. Wang X.Q. Strasser U. Yu S.P. Choi D.W. Behrens M.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5452-5461Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of group 1 mGluRs has been shown to activate c-Src at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in a G protein-independent manner (35Heuss C. Scanziani M. Gähwiler B.H. Gerber U. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1070-1077Google Scholar). Tamalin is enriched at the postsynaptic density fraction and interacts with both mGluR1 and mGluR5 (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether glutamate stimulation of mGluR1 could enhance c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of tamalin in heterologously mGluR1-expressing COS-7 cells. However, these experiments failed to detect any change in tamalin phosphorylation by incubation with 100 μm glutamate for 1–15 min (data not shown). We also examined the possibility that mGluR1-associated tamalin is capable of enhancing recruitment of Syk to mGluR1 upon c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of tamalin. However, because appreciable amounts of Syk already bound to the carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1 in a tamalin-independent manner, it was difficult to quantify the influence of tamalin phosphorylation on recruitment of Syk to mGluR1 (data not shown). The role of tamalin phosphorylation in mGluR1 signaling transduction thus remains elusive in this investigation. Nonetheless, it has been revealed that both tamalin and c-Src were coimmunoprecipitated with mGluR1 from brain extracts, and both interacted with the carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR1 in COS-7 cells. Therefore, it is possible that the ITAM-based interaction of tamalin with Syk regulates intracellular signaling of mGluR1 by some extracellular signals that activate the Src family kinases. Because the tamalin/Syk signaling molecules are now revealed to form a protein assembly in P19 cells, the P19 cell line would provide a nice system to investigate the role of this signaling pathway in neuronal cell function and differentiation. The activation of Syk by phosphorylation leads to stimulation of several important signaling pathways that culminate in the activation of transcription factors in the nucleus (36Gerondakis S. Grumont R. Rourke I. Grossmann M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 353-359Google Scholar, 37Kuo C.T. Leiden J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 149-187Google Scholar). The activated Syk phosphorylates downstream adaptor proteins and PTKs, which in turn activate phospholipase C-γ (25Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Google Scholar). Phospholipase C-γ cleaves phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to yield diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (17Kurosaki T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 354-363Google Scholar). Inositol trisphosphate increases intracellular concentrations of Ca2+, which activates a phosphatase, calcineurin, and also protein kinase C with a conjunctive action of diacylglycerol (25Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Google Scholar). Because group 1 mGluRs activate phospholipase C-β through direct coupling to Gq/Go proteins (38Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Google Scholar, 39Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Google Scholar), Syk-mediated activation of phospholipase C-γ may not necessarily participate in group 1 mGluR signal transduction but may be involved in signaling cascades of other tamalin-associated receptors. Another important pathway of the Syk signaling cascade is generated by activation of small G proteins, which is achieved by coordinate actions of adaptor proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (40Olson M.F. Marais R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 63-73Google Scholar, 41van Leeuwen J.E. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Google Scholar). Interestingly, the leucine-zipper region of tamalin binds to the coiled-coil region of cytohesins which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the ADP-ribosylation factor family of small G proteins (9Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Google Scholar, 10Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Google Scholar). Molecular assembly of cytohesins and Syk may thus be built on the tamalin scaffold protein and may efficiently link Syk signaling to small G protein cascades.

When coexpressed with the m2 acetylcholine (ACh) receptor in Xenopus oocytes, agonist-activated GIRK1F137S- and GIRK2-mediated currents are inhibited by halothane, whereas in the absence of ACh, high concentrations of halothane induce GIRK1F137S-mediated currents. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of halothane action on GIRK currents of different subunit compositions, we constructed deletion mutants of GIRK1F137S (GIRK1Δ363*) and GIRK2 (GIRK2Δ356) lacking the C-terminal ends, as well as chimeric GIRK channels. Mutated GIRK channels showed normal currents when activated by ACh but exhibited different pharmacological properties toward halothane. GIRK2Δ356 showed no sensitivity against the inhibitory action of halothane but was activated by halothane in the absence of an agonist. GIRK1Δ363* was activated by halothane more efficiently. Currents mediated by chimeric channels were inhibited by anesthetic concentrations that were at least 30-fold lower than those necessary to decrease GIRK2 wild type currents. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments did not show displacement of bound Gβγ by halothane, indicating that halothane does not interfere with Gβγ binding. Single channel experiments revealed an influence of halothane on the gating of the channels: The agonist-induced currents of GIRK1 and GIRK2, carried mainly by brief openings, were inhibited, whereas higher concentrations of the anesthetic promoted long openings of GIRK1 channels. Because the C terminus is crucial for these effects, an interaction of halothane with the channel seems to be involved in the mechanism of current modulation.

Because the C terminus is crucial for these effects, an interaction of halothane with the channel seems to be involved in the mechanism of current modulation. The effects of anesthetics that induce general anesthesia are poorly understood. On the cellular level, the synaptic transmission of nerve impulses appears to be impaired by anesthetics (1Kress H.G. Weigl L. Adams A.P. Cashman J.N. Recent Advances in Anesthesia and Analgesia. 20. Churchill Livingstone, New York-Edinburgh-London1998: 1-20Google Scholar). The underlying molecular targets for this effect are still a matter of debate. Besides ion channels, which have been shown to be modulated by anesthetics (2Mihic S. Ye Q. Wick M. Koltchine V. Krasowski M. Finn S. Mascia M. Valenzuela C. Hanson K. Greenblatt E. Harris R. Harrison N. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), other elements of signal transduction such as receptors and G proteins may also be involved in general anesthesia.The family of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) 1The abbreviations used are: GIRK, G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel; ACh, acetylcholine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid; WT, wild type; HK, high K+ extracellular medium. 1The abbreviations used are: GIRK, G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel; ACh, acetylcholine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid; WT, wild type; HK, high K+ extracellular medium. channels is comprised of at least five isoforms, designated GIRK1-GIRK5 (Kir3.1–3.5) (3Dascal N. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that functional GIRK channels are homotetrameric or heterotetrameric complexes with the mammalian GIRK1-GIRK4 isoforms being differentially expressed primarily in the central nervous system and cardiac tissue (4Spauschus A. Lentes K.U. Wischmeyer E. Dissmann E. Karschin C. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 930-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5608-5715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, GIRK channels are activated by the binding of Gβγ subunits to the intracellular portions of the channel protein (7Logothetis D. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 8Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Nung Jan Y. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Gβγ is released from heterotrimeric, inactive Gαβγ subunit complexes that have been activated by the binding of an agonist to a G protein-coupled receptor. On the cellular level, the opening of GIRK channels stabilizes the membrane potential at EK+ and thus counteracts membrane excitability. As a result, the activation of GIRK channels leads to a decrease in heart rate after the release of acetylcholine from the vagus nerve, and in the central nervous system GIRK channels play an important role in the mediation of opioid- and ethanol-induced analgesia (9Ikeda K.

Anesthesiology. 2001; 95: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GIRK1F137S or GIRK1 containing heteromeric channels such as GIRK1/GIRK4, but not homomeric GIRK4 channels, are activated by high concentrations of halothane in the absence of an agonist (14Weigl L.G. Schreibmayer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, low concentrations of halothane are able to inhibit the agonist-induced currents through GIRK channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. GIRK2 channels are not activated by halothane at the basal level but are most sensitive to the inhibitory action of halothane when activated by an agonist. These effects are independent from the receptor coexpressed and specific for the GIRK channels (14Weigl L.G. Schreibmayer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this dualistic modulation of GIRK channels is not clear. The existence of at least two independent mechanisms of halothane modulation of GIRK channels had to be assumed. From our previous experiments (14Weigl L.G. Schreibmayer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) we concluded that halothane was able to activate the GIRK1 channel, probably by increasing its affinity to Gβγ, and that the inhibition of agonist-activated GIRK channels was because of the impairment of the G protein signaling cascade. This is consistent with the findings of various other laboratories that demonstrate the inhibition of signaling through Gαi by halothane (15Narayanan T. Confer R. Dennison R.J. Anthony B. Aronstam R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Pentyala S. Sung K. Chowdhury A. Rebecchi M. Eur. J.

This core region is flanked by N-and C-terminal regions, which constitute the “cytoplasmic pore” as judged from crystal structure analysis (19Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T.

These parts of the proteins show a high degree of homology between the different isoforms. The most divergent regions are the distal N and C termini of the protein. The long distal C terminus of GIRK1 is unique among the GIRK channels and shows virtually no homology to the C termini of other GIRK channels. The role of the distal C terminus is not clear, yet it is not thought to take part in constitution of the cytoplasmic pore. Rather, it protrudes into the cytoplasm where it may function as an interaction domain for other proteins or the channel itself.To elucidate the mechanism of halothane action on GIRK channels on the molecular level and to investigate the structural requirements for the modulation by halothane, we performed single channel experiments and used deletion mutants of GIRK1F137S (the substitution of a serine for a phenylalanine in GIRK1 is necessary to get conductive homooligomeric GIRK1 channels; Ref. 25Chan K. Sui J. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and GIRK2 as well as chimeric proteins between these two channels. In addition, we tested whether halothane interacts with the binding of Gβγ to GST fusion proteins, which comprise the putative Gβγ binding sites of the N- and C termini of GIRK1.MATERIALS AND METHODSOocyte Culture—Adult female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized by placing the frogs in 0.15% MS222 (pH 7.4). When narcosis was complete, the frogs were decapitated and ovaries were removed. Oocytes were prepared as described (26Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar), and 50 nl of cRNA solutions were injected (concentrations in ng/μl given in parenthesis): m2 receptor (30Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), GIRK1F137S (0.3), GIRK1Δ363* (0.3), GIRK2 WT (30), GIRK2Δ356 (3) and GIRK2/1356 (0.25-0.85), GIRK2/1/2 (250), GIRK2/1/2/1 (3). The expression of endogenous GIRK5 was suppressed by coinjection of 20 ng/μl antisense oligonucleotide (KHA2) together with the cRNAs (27Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Incubation of oocytes was performed at 18–20 °C for 5–9 days in NDE (containing in mm: NaCl (96), KCl (2), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (1.8), HEPES (5), pyruvate (2.5), and penicillin, 100 units/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml, adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.5).Preparation of cRNAs—Plasmids were isolated from bacteria and linearized using standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1.1.84-1Google Scholar). The following DNAs were used: m2 receptor (29Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), rat GIRK1F137S from atrium, and GIRK2 WT from mouse testis cloned into pBS-mxt. The truncated GIRK1Δ363* (aa 1–363) and GIRK2Δ356 (aa 1–356) channels were created by PCR via primers containing the appropriate restriction sites EcoRV/EcoRI and ClaI/SpeI, respectively, as well as a stop codon at the end of each coding region (LW5, 5′-CCCGATATCATGTCTGCACTCCGAAGG-3′; LW6, 5′-GCGGAATTCCTATTCTTCCTGCTCTTTCACAC-3′; LW1, 5′-CCCATCGATATGGACCAGGATGTGGAAAGCC-3′; LW2, 5′-GCGACTAGTCTACTCCGCTAGCTCTTTGGCAC-3′). The introduced restriction sites allowed the insertion of the amplified DNA into pBSmxt, which is a cloning vector designed to enable the synthesis of cRNA for injection into X. laevis oocytes. The PCR products were cleaned by EtOH precipitation prior to digestion with the respective enzymes. The DNA was further cleaned by gel extraction using the QUIAEX kit (Quiagen). The cleaned DNA was ligated and transformed into XL-1-BLUE cells. For the displacement of the C-terminal region of GIRK2 by the homologous area of GIRK1, the same truncated GIRK2 cDNA as described above was constructed except that there was no stop codon at the 3′-end (LW1; LW2_1, 5′-GCGACTAGTCTCCGCTAGCTCTTTGGCACT-3′). The additional PCR product created from the cytoplasmic loop of GIRK1 was cloned into the SpeI site of the GIRK2Δ356 pBS-mxt plasmid. For exchange of the transmembrane domains of GIRK2 and GIRK2/1356 by the homologous domain of GIRK1F137S (aa 88–202), restriction sites for AflII and EheI were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The corresponding sequence of GIRK1 was cloned into the restriction sites at base positions 201 and 549 of GIRK2 and GIRK2/1356, respectively. These chimeric channels were designated GIRK2/1/2 and GIRK2/1/2/1. The correctness of the DNA constructs was verified by automated sequencing. The DNAs were linearized with SalI, and cRNA was synthesized with the Ambion megascript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).Electrophysiology—For two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, the oocytes were placed in a chamber that allowed the superfusion of the cells at 19–21 °C. A virtual complete exchange of the bath solution could be reached within 4 s, as judged by the changes in offset potentials. For halothane-containing solutions a gas tight superfusion system was used that was made of glass syringes and Teflon tubes to prevent evaporation of the anesthetic. The halothane solutions were prepared from a saturated stock solution (17.8 mm) by dilution to the required working concentrations. The actual concentration of the applied halothane solutions was analyzed in mock experiments by gas chromatography using an HP 5890GC (Hewlett Packard) device. Concentrations were found to be 0.96 ± 0.03 mm for 1 mm halothane (n = 10), 312 ± 13 μm for 300 μm (n = 10), 97.2 ± 7.8 μm for 100 μm halothane (n = 12), and 29.1 ± 7.3 μm for 30 μm (n = 3). In figures and text these concentrations are referred to as 1 mm, 300 μm, 100 μm, and 30 μm halothane.Whole cell currents were recorded with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique using 3 m KCl filled glass electrodes (resistance of 0.8–1.5 mΩ) and an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The membrane potential was clamped constantly to –70 mV, and the currents were measured first in ND96 solution (containing in mm: NaCl (96), KCl (2), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (1), HEPES (5) adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.5) and then in high K+ extracellular medium (HK: NaCl (2), KCl (96), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (1), HEPES (5) adjusted with KOH to pH 7.5). The agonist-induced current (IACh) was evoked by superfusion with 10 μm ACh. The quantification of the effect of halothane was done 1 min after the start of rinsing with the halothane-containing solution. Control values for the halothane effect on IACh were obtained by determining the current value 1 min after the peak current was reached during rinsing with 10 μm ACh without halothane. Control values reflect the current desensitization. Current traces were digitized at 50 Hz using an Axolab 1200 interface and were recorded with Axotape (Axon Instruments) on an IBM-compatible computer. Analysis of current recordings was performed with the Fetchan 6.0 software (Axon Instruments).IC50 values were determined by least square fitting of the relative inhibition of ACh-induced currents to the following equation: %I = (100–y0)·([halo]h/([halo]h+IC50h))+y0 where %I is the percentage inhibition of IACh, [halo] the concentration of halothane, h the Hill coefficient, and y0 the control value.For patch clamp experiments the vitelline membrane of oocytes was removed with fine forceps after putting the cells in a hypertonic solution (PG200Ca, in mm: glutamate (180), KCl (37.5), CaCl2 (1), MgCl2 (1), Hepes (10Mitrovic I. Margeta-Mitrovic M. Bader S. Stoffel M. Jan L.Y. Basbaum A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), pH 7.5). Immediately after devitellinization the oocyte was transferred to the recording chamber filled with 500 μl of bath solution (BS, in mm: KCl (140), NaCl (6), EGTA (1), MgCl2 (4), ATP Na2 (1), HEPES (10), KOH to pH 7.5). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass 1B150 (WPI), sylgard coated, fire polished, and back filled with pipette solution (PS, in mm: KCl (144), NaCl (2), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (1), GdCl3 (1), HEPES (10), KOH to pH 7.5). The tip was filled with the same solution without GdCl3. Measurements were performed in the cell-attached mode at a holding potential of –80 mV with a HEKA EPC-9 amplifier and recorded with the Pulse program (HEKA, Germany) at a sampling rate of 15 kHz and a filter frequency of 5 kHz. The basal channel activity was monitored for at least 5 min. From a saturated halothane stock solution 28 μl were directly applied to the bath to obtain a concentration of 1 mm. The solution was mixed by gentle pipetting. In mock experiments the loss of halothane because of evaporation was determined to be 23% within 5 min.For analysis, the data were digitally filtered at 1.5 kHz. The number of channels in the patch was estimated from the overlaps of channel openings during the course of an experiment. Experiments with three or fewer channels were analyzed. Event detection was based on a 50% criterion, and event tables were generated using the TAC program (Bruxton). Mean open times, open time histograms, and single channel conductivity as well as open channel probability (Po) were calculated from these event tables. The relative open channel probability was achieved by dividing Po by the number of channels in the patch.GST Pulldown—GST fusion proteins that contained GST and the N terminus of GIRK1 (aa 1–84, CD1) or the C terminus of GIRK1 (aa 183–501, CD2) were created using PCR. DNA fragments that encoded the indicated amino acid residues from rat GIRK1 were cloned into the vector pGEX-cs using the restriction enzymes BamHI and NcoI or XhoI, respectively. All DNA constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. GST·GIRK fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified using glutathione affinity resin as described (30Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The protein was eluted from the resin with elution buffer (in mm: Hepes (20), EDTA (1), dithiothreitol (2), KCl (5), glutathione; Ref. 15Narayanan T. Confer R. Dennison R.J. Anthony B. Aronstam R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If necessary, the protein was concentrated and dialyzed overnight in elution buffer lacking glutathione. [35S]Gβ1γ2 was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and diluted 1:2. The fusion proteins (4–7 μg/ml) were mixed with 5 μl of the diluted lysate and incubated for 2 h under gentle shaking in 700 μl of binding buffer (Hepes/Na, pH 7.4, (25Chan K. Sui J. Vivaudou M.

The mixture was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min. The beads were recovered by filtering through 0.45-μm spin filters and washed three times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with glutathione buffer (in mm: glutathione (15Narayanan T. Confer R. Dennison R.J. Anthony B. Aronstam R. Biochem.

All steps of the procedure, except the gel electrophoresis, were performed in the presence of the respective concentrations of halothane. The halothane concentration in the solutions was achieved by diluting a saturated stock solution as described above. Halothane-containing wash solutions were prepared directly before use to minimize loss caused by evaporation.Data Presentation and Statistics—Experiments were repeated at least twice, and results are given as mean ± S.E. Tests for statistical significance were performed with the two-tailed Student's t test according to Ref. 32Kreyszig E. Statistische Methoden und ihre Anwendung.

In the figures, levels of significance are given by asterisks: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.RESULTSCurrent Characteristics of Mutated Channels—The expression of GIRK channels led to an increase in the background or basal currents when rinsed with HK solution (IHK) at a membrane potential of –70 mV for all types tested. The application of 10 μm acetylcholine evoked additional inward currents (IACh) when the m2 ACh receptor was coexpressed. All GIRK constructs that we used (Fig. 1A) showed normal activation and desensitization properties when compared with GIRK wild type channels. However, the current response to HK and ACh was higher through truncated channels when compared with the respective wild type channels (Fig. 1B). The average ACh-induced current in oocytes injected with 150 pg of GIRK2Δ356 cRNA was 2.8 ± 0.4 μA (n = 11), whereas GIRK2 wild type-injected oocytes (1500 pg) reacted to ACh with currents of only 0.7 ± 0.2 μA. Even with low amounts of injected cRNAs, both the deletion mutant GIRK2Δ356 and the chimera GIRK2/1356 showed, on the average, higher currents than GIRK2 wild type channels. An increased ratio of IACh/IHK from 3.3 to about 7.8 for the deletion mutant GIRK2Δ356 and 8.1 for the chimera GIRK2/1356 was observed. The difference in currents was less pronounced for GIRK1F137S and GIRK1Δ363* channels; the truncated channels showed an increase in the current amplitude by a factor of about 4.5 and no change in the current ratios (Fig. 1B) when the same amount of cRNA was injected. Injection of oocytes with even high amounts of chimeric GIRK2/1/2 RNA gave only small GIRK currents and reduced the survival rate of oocytes.Effect of Halothane on Currents through Homooligomeric Wild Type GIRK Channels—As exemplified in Fig. 2A, halothane was able to modulate the current through homooligomeric GIRK1F137S channels in Xenopus oocytes, corroborating our previous results (14Weigl L.G. Schreibmayer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Background currents were augmented by about 90% in the presence of 1 mm halothane, but the current induced by 10 μm acetylcholine (IACh) was inhibited by low concentrations of halothane with maximum attenuation of about 50% at a concentration of 100 μm halothane. When the halothane concentration was increased, the effect reversed, and rinsing the oocytes with 1 mm halothane led to an increase in IACh (14Weigl L.G. Schreibmayer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Halothane activates basal currents but inhibits IACh through GIRK1F137S channels.A, time course of a GIRK1F137S-mediated current expressed in a Xenopus oocyte measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The application of HK solution induced the background current (IHK), and 10 μm acetylcholine was used to evoke the agonist-induced current (IACh). Low concentrations of halothane (100 μm) led to the inhibition of IACh, whereas high concentrations of the anesthetic augmented the background current. B, pulldown experiments of in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled Gβγ with a fusion protein of GST and the C terminus of GIRK1 (CD2, aa 183–501 from GIRK1). The upper panel shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. The lower panel is a scan of the radioactive signals detected by phosphorimaging. C, quantitative analysis of the pulldown experiments did not show an influence of halothane on the binding of Gβγ to the fusion protein. The control value is the amount of Gβγ bound to CD2 in the absence of halothane. D, channel activity in a multichannel patch. Unstimulated channels showed low activity. Addition of halothane increased the number of open events and, as shown in panel F, the mean open time of channels. Control traces and traces after addition of halothane are from the same cell. E, the voltage ramp shows inward rectifying channels to be activated by halothane. H, single channel conductivity was not affected by halothane. G, the relative change in open probability of the channels due to the application of 1 mm halothane. In the absence of an agonist an increase was observed. The control values are normalized to 100%. Test for statistical significance was done against the respective control values with *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Results are mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test whether the inhibition of ACh-induced currents by halothane is because of the disturbance of the binding of Gβγ to the channel, we performed pulldown experiments with GST·GIRK1 fusion proteins. These fusion proteins contained the N terminus (aa 1–84, CD1) or the C-terminal part of the channel (aa 183–501), thus including the putative Gβγ binding sites that are believed to be responsible for the agonist-induced current activation (24Ivanina T. Rishal I. Varon D. Müllner C. Frohnwieser-Steinecker B. Schreibmayer W. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29174-29183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). With CD1 the amount of pulled down [35S]Gβγ was not sufficient to perform a quantitative analysis. With CD2 the amount of Gβγ that was pulled down was less than 10% of the total of labeled Gβγ in the extract. Halothane (100 μm, n = 7; 300 μm, n = 6; and 1 mm, n = 5) did not change the amount of bound Gβγ (Fig. 2, B and C), thus giving no evidence for inhibition of Gβγ binding to the channel by halothane.Patch clamp experiments showed low basal activity of the channels in the absence of an agonist with a relative open probability of 4.0·10–3± 1.2·10–3 (n = 5). However, the open time distribution of detected events showed the existence of at least two populations of channel openings with a long and a short dwell time (Table I). The greater part (93 ± 1.0%) of openings was short (τ1 = 0.66 ± 0.10 ms), whereas only 7% showed a time constant of 14.2 ± 0.57 ms (τ2). Halothane increased the open channel probability by propagation of channel openings with longer open times (τ2 = 22.5 ± 9.66 ms) from a fraction of 7% to 44 ± 15% without changing the time constants of the openings (n = 5). However, this shift led to an increase in the mean open time by a factor of 3.6 (Fig. 2F). In addition the number of openings increased (Fig. 2D), which led to an increase in open probability by 852 ± 368% (Fig. 2G). The single channel conductivity of 15.7 ± 0.5 picosiemens as well as the inward rectification properties of the channel remained unchanged by halothane (Fig. 2, E and H).Table IChanges in open time distribution caused by ha"

Although the affect of SOCS proteins on the Jak-STAT pathway has been well characterized, their role in the regulation of other signaling modules is not well understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that SOCS3 physically interacts with the SH2/SH3-containing adapter proteins Nck and Crk-L, which are known to couple activated receptors to multiple downstream signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton. Our data show that the SOCS3/Nck and SOCS3/Crk-L interactions depend on tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 Tyr221 within the conserved SOCS box motif and intact SH2 domains of Nck and Crk-L. Furthermore, SOCS3 Tyr221 forms a YXXP motif, which is a consensus binding site for the Nck and Crk-L SH2 domains. Expression of SOCS3 in NIH3T3 cells induces constitutive recruitment of a Nck-GFP fusion protein to the plasma membrane and constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Nck.

Most of these studies have focused on the role of SOCS3 as an inhibitor of the Jak-STAT pathway. However, the finding that SOCS1 and SOCS3 regulate the stability of other families of signaling proteins such as GEFs and IRS proteins suggest that they have a much broader spectrum of action. Our laboratory has identified a function for SOCS3 beyond its role as a STAT inhibitor. We have previously shown that SOCS3 is phosphorylated by activated Jaks, Src family kinases, and receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on Tyr204 and Tyr221 in the conserved SOCS box motif (35Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 221 of SOCS3 forms part of a YXXP motif (where X is any amino acid), which is a consensus binding site for the SH2 domains of the Ras inhibitor p120 RasGAP. Phosphorylated SOCS3 inactivates RasGAP and allows for sustained MAP kinase activation (35Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 is therefore important for its biological function. In the present study, we identify the Nck and Crk-L adapter proteins as SOCS3 binding partners. We demonstrate that phospho-SOCS3 recruits Nck to activated RTKs and modulates Nck tyrosine phosphorylation in fibroblasts, suggesting that SOCS3 regulates adapter protein signal transduction.

SOCS3 pY204/pY221 peptide spanning amino acids 200-225 (DSpYEKVTQLPGPIREFLDQpYDAPL) as well as pY204 and pY221 singly phosphorylated peptides and unphosphorylated controls were supplied by Research Genetics. Mammalian expression vector pEBB encoding wild-type (WT) Nckα and R308K SH2 mutant Nckα cDNAs, tagged with the Myc epitope, were a generous gift from Dr. Bruce Mayer, University of Connecticut Health Center. GST-Nck fusion plasmids were constructed by engineering a 5′-NdeI site (CATATG) at the start codon, and a ClaI site at the 3′-end of WT Nck coding sequence, then cloning this fragment into the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Transformation of DH5 competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen), isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed according to standard methods. The Nck coding sequence was also cloned into the green fluorescent protein fusion vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to make the Nck-GFP expression vector. The Nck-GFP fusion coding sequence was then cloned into the retroviral expression vector pMX-IRES-Puro for production of stable cell lines. The Nck-GFP fusion expression plasmid was constructed by inserting a Nck cDNA PCR fragment into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Primers were designed to amplify the entire Nck cDNA sequence flanked by an EcoRI site on the 5′-end and a BamHI site in frame 3 immediately preceding the stop codon. PCR was carried out with Pfu polymerase, and the resulting fragment encoding full-length, WT Nck was ligated by the EcoRI and BamHI sites into pEGFP-N1, which contains the GFP coding sequence in-frame. All PCR products were sequenced in their entirety. PCDNA-Crk-L expression vector was provided by Dr. Ronald Herbst, DNAX Research Inc., Palo Alto, CA. The Crk-L coding sequence was cloned by PCR amplification using a 5′-primer encoding a NdeI site at the start codon and a 3′-primer encoding a ClaI restriction site in place of the stop codon. The PCR product was cloned into our pME18S C-terminal FLAG tag mammalian expression vector, fusing the Crk-L cDNA sequence to the FLAG tag at its 3′-end (36Cacalano N.A. Migone T.S. Bazan F. Hanson E.P. Chen M. Candotti F. O'Shea J.J. Johnston J.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Crk-L R39A was generated using a fusion PCR approach with overlapping (sense and antisense) mutagenic oligonucleotide primers encoding the point mutation. The 5′-PCR primer spanned the 5′-coding sequence of Crk-L preceded by a NdeI site at the start codon. The 3′-primer spanned the unique NaeI site in the Crk-L cDNA. The mutant PCR product was swapped with the WT Crk-L NdeI-NaeI fragment from pME18S-Crk-L-FLAG vector. Transfections and Infections—293T and PlatE cells were transfected with Effectene lipid-based transfection reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For retroviral infections, 2 ml of supernatant from transfected PlatE cells was mixed with polybrene (8 mg/ml final concentration)(Sigma) and added to NIH3T3 cells in 2 ml of media at 48 and 72 h after PlatE transfections. After 48 h of infection, the cells were washed once and resuspended in fresh culture medium. Cells stably expressing the GFP fusion constructs were sorted by flow cytometry for green fluorescent protein expression. Immunoprecipitations, GST Pull-down Experiments, and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.875% Brij 97 (Sigma), 0.125% Nonidet P-40 (British Drug Houses, Poole, UK), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (ICN, Aurora, OH), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (ICN), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 1 mm Na3VO4 (Sigma). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies as described in the figure legends. Rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies and Sepharoseconjugated M2 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10, rabbit anti-hemagglutinin tag, and rabbit anti-Myc were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). For GST pull-down experiments, the cells were lysed as described above, and 2 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein were added to the lysates in combination with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The lysates were incubated with fusion proteins for 4 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electroblotted onto nylon membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bradford, MA). The membranes were probed with appropriate antibodies, as described in the figure legends, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were detected with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Confocal Visualization—GFP fusion protein expressing NIH3T3 cells were plated in glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) 24 h before visualization. Cells were serum-starved for 6 h in 0.1% serum and stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF BB. Microscopy was preformed on a Leica TCS SP MP Inverted Confocal Microscope with a 488 nm excitation line provided by an argon laser. Image analysis was preformed with Leica Confocal Software. In a previous study, we determined that SOCS3 Tyr221 is phosphorylated by Jak1, Jak2, EGF receptor, and PDGF receptor and interacts with p120 RasGAP in IL-2-stimulated T cells (35Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We have extended these findings to demonstrate that phosphorylated SOCS3 interacts with p120 RasGAP in PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts as well. As shown in Fig. 1, panels B and C, stimulation of murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts with 50 ng/ml PDGF BB resulted in robust SOCS3 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation at the 1- and 2-h time points. Furthermore, p120 RasGAP was found in SOCS3 immunoprecipitates from PDGF-treated cells (Fig. 1, panel A). We examined the sequences surrounding SOCS3 Tyr204 and Tyr221 and found that Tyr221 forms part of a YXXP motif, which is a consensus binding site for the RasGAP SH2 domains (Table I). The YXXP motif has also been shown to interact with the SH2 domains of the Nck and Crk-L adapter proteins (38Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T.

Lysates from NIH3T3 cells were precipitated with N-terminal biotinylated peptides spanning both SOCS3 phosphorylation sites (amino acids 200-225). In order to map the Nck and Crk-L binding sites, we measured Nck and Crk-L binding to peptides containing pY204/pY221, single pY204 or pY221 phosphorylation sites, or a control unphosphorylated peptide of identical sequence. As shown in Fig. 2A, both Nck and Crk-L bound the pY204/pY221 peptide (lanes 2 and 6), as well as the pY221 singly phosphorylated peptide (lanes 4 and 8). However, both molecules failed to interact with the pY204 peptide (lanes 3 and 7) or the unphosphorylated control (lanes 1 and 5).Table IPutative RasGAP binding sitesMoleculeSequencep62 DOKS P P A L Y A E P LS Q D S L Y S D P LK E D P I Y D E P EP P Q G L Y D L P RV K E E G Y E L P YP A T D D Y A V P Pp56 DOK-2P G T Q L Y D W P YA P E G E Y A V P EL P D H I Y D E P ESOCS3 Tyr221E F L D Q Y D A P LSOCS3 Tyr204aNon binding.G H L D S Y E K V TConsensus sequenceY X X Pa Non binding. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Nck and Crk-L SH2 domains bind phosphorylated SOCS3 Tyr221.A, N-terminal biotinylated peptides spanning the SOCS3 phosphorylation sites (amino acids 200-225) were prebound to streptavidin beads. Lysates from 5 × 106 NIH3T3 cells were precipitated with streptavidin beads bound to pY(204, 221) double-phosphorylated peptides, singly phosphorylated pY204 or pY221 peptides, or an unphosphorylated control peptide of the same amino acid sequence. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for Nck (lanes 1-4) or Crk-L (lanes 5-8). B, 293T cells were transiently transfected with mammalian expression vector pEBB encoding N-terminal Myc-tagged WT Nck (lane 1); a Nck SH2 mutant, R308A (lane 2); or WT Nck SH2 domain (lane 3). 293T cells were also transfected with pME18S encoding C-terminal FLAG-tagged WT Crk-L (lane 5) or the Crk-L SH2 mutant R39A (lane 6). Cell lysates were precipitated with biotinylated pY221 SOCS3 phosphopeptide bound to streptavidinagarose beads, and the precipitates were analyzed in Western blotting with anti-Myc antibodies to detect Nck (lanes 1-4) or anti-FLAG antibodies to detect Crk-L (lanes 5-6). C, GST-Nck fusion protein binds to phosphorylated full-length SOCS3. 293T cells were transiently transfected with SOCS3-HA tag pME18S either alone or in combination with pME18S encoding Jak1. Cell lysates were split and precipitated with GST-Nck or GST proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and the precipitates were analyzed in Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies, to detect SOCS3 (panel a). Expression controls for SOCS3 (panel b), tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak1 (panel c), and phosphorylated SOCS3 (panel d) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further characterize the requirements for SOCS3/Nck and SOCS3/Crk-L interactions, we examined the binding of SOCS3 pY221 phosphopeptide to WT and SH2 domain mutants of Nck and Crk-L. 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Nck or FLAG-tagged Crk-L expression vectors. Included were WT full-length Nck, a Nck SH2 domain mutant (R308A), WT Nck SH2 domain alone (lacking the N-terminal SH3 domains), as well as WT Crk-L and a Crk-L SH2 mutant (R39A). Lysates from transfected cells were precipitated with the SOCS3 phosphopeptide and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies to detect Nck or Crk-L. As shown in Fig. 2B, the binding of Nck and Crk-L to the SOCS3 phosphopeptide was dependent on intact SH2 domains. WT Nck and Crk-L bound strongly to the peptide (lanes 2 and 5), while both SH2 mutants failed to bind (lanes 3 and 6). In addition, strong binding of the Nck SH2 domain to the SOCS3 peptide demonstrates that an intact SH2 domain is sufficient for the interaction, and the 3 N-terminal SH3 domains of Nck are not required for binding (lane 4). We next determined whether full-length phosphorylated SOCS3 was capable of interacting with Nck. 293T cells were transiently transfected with a pME18S HA-tagged SOCS3 expression construct either alone or in combination with pME18S-Jak1 vector, to induce SOCS3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Cell lysates were split and precipitated with either GST or GST-Nck proteins coupled to glutathione beads, followed by anti-HA tag Western blotting to detect SOCS3. As shown in Fig. 2C, full-length SOCS3 interacted with the GST-Nck fusion protein when tyrosine phosphorylated (lane 4), whereas unphosphorylated SOCS3 failed to interact with Nck (lane 3). In a previous report, we determined that stimulation of fibroblasts with PDGF for 1 h induces SOCS3 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation (35Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to determine whether endogenous SOCS3/Nck and SOCS3/Crk-L complexes form in ligand-activated cells, we stimulated NIH3T3 cells with PDGF-BB for 1 h to induce SOCS3 expression. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SOCS3 antiserum followed by Western blotting with anti-Nck or anti-Crk-L antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, PDGF stimulation of NIH3T3 cells induces SOCS3 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation (panels B and C). In addition, SOCS3 immunoprecipitates from stimulated cells contain Nck and Crk-L (panel A), demonstrating that endogenous SOCS3 interacts with these adapter protei"
https://openalex.org/W2061358722,"The Zeta class of glutathione transferases (GSTs) has only recently been discovered and hence has been poorly characterized. Here we investigate the substrate binding and kinetic mechanisms of the human Zeta class GSTZ1c-1c by means of pre-steady state and steady-state experiments and site-directed mutagenesis. Binding of GSH occurs at a very low rate compared with that observed for the more recently evolved GSTs (Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes). Moreover, the single step binding mechanism observed in this enzyme is reminiscent of that found for the Theta class enzyme, whereas the Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes have adopted a multistep binding mechanism. Replacement of Cys16 with Ala increases the rate of GSH release from the active site causing a 10-fold decrease of affinity toward GSH. Cys16 also plays a crucial role in co-substrate binding; the mutant enzyme is unable to bind the carcinogenic substrate dichloroacetic acid in the absence of GSH. However, both substrate binding and GSH activation are not rate-limiting in catalysis. A peculiarity of the hGSTZ1c-1c is the half-site activation of bound GSH. This suggests a primitive monomer-monomer interaction that, in the recently diverged GSTP1-1, gives rise to a sophisticated cooperative mechanism that preserves the catalytic efficiency of this GST under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2095345370,"The primary sequence of the N-terminal somatomedin B (SMB) domain of native vitronectin contains 44 amino acids, including a framework of four disulfide bonds formed by 8 closely spaced cysteines in sequence patterns similar to those found in the cystine knot family of proteins. The SMB domain of vitronectin was isolated by digesting the protein with endoproteinase Glu-C and purifying the N-terminal 1–55 peptide by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Through a combination of techniques, including stepwise reduction and alkylation at acidic pH, peptide mapping with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and NMR, the disulfide bonds contained in the SMB domain have been determined to be Cys5:Cys9, Cys19:Cys31, Cys21:Cys32, and Cys25:Cys39. This pattern of disulfides differs from two other connectivities that have been reported previously for recombinant forms of the SMB domain expressed in Escherichia coli. This arrangement of disulfide bonds in the SMB domain from native vitronectin forms a rigid core around the Cys19: Cys31 and Cys21:Cys32 disulfides. A small positively charged loop is created at the N terminus by the Cys5: Cys9 cystine. The most prominent feature of this disulfide-bonding pattern is a loop between Cys25 and Cys39 similar to cystine-stabilized α-helical structures commonly observed in cystine knots.

Computational predictions for the structure of this domain using a threading algorithm were challenging compared with other domains from vitronectin (16Xu D. Baburaj K. Peterson C.B. Xu Y. Proteins. 2001; 44: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as there were no reported structures at the time for homologues of this small domain containing four disulfides. Nevertheless, there are over 100 homologues in the sequence data base, suggesting that this folding motif has been conserved in evolution. Only recently have three-dimensional structures describing the SMB domain become available from two different approaches. First, an x-ray structure has been reported on a co-crystal of PAI-1 and a recombinant form of the SMB domain expressed in Escherichia coli (17Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we completed the determination of a solution structure for the SMB domain purified from circulating vitronectin that was isolated from human plasma (18Mayasundari A. Whittemore N.A. Serpersu E.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29359-29366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the two structures differ in overall fold, they share a common feature, a single α-helix that contains key amino acids for PAI-1 binding. Not surprisingly, a recent report using NMR on a recombinant SMB arrived at a similar structure to that observed in the co-crystal with PAI-1 (19Kamikubo Y. De Guzman R. Kroon G. Curriden S. Neels J.G. Churchill M.J. Dawson P. Oldqiej S. Jagielska A. Sheraga H.A. Loskutoff D.J. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6519-6534Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Key to understanding the structure of the SMB domain is defining the correct disulfide connectivities of the eight cysteines that exist in vivo. The magnitude of the problem can be appreciated by comparison with classic work on ribonuclease, in which over 100 possibilities exist for unique disulfide-bonding patterns for 8 sulfhydryls, and improper oxidation of disulfides during refolding yields an ensemble of misfolded enzymes exhibiting less than 1% activity (20Anfinsen C.B.

Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar). In terms of primary sequence, the SMB region is similar to a growing class of proteins known to form cystine knots (22Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Sun P.D. Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, unlike typical examples of the growth factor cystine knot or the inhibitory cystine knot proteins, the SMB domain of vitronectin has four disulfide bridges rather than the more familiar three disulfide arrangement. In this respect, the SMB domain shares sequence features with some members of cystine knot families that block ion channels, have anti-microbial activity and the bone morphogenic protein agonists (24Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 25Escoubas P. Rash L. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 555-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Craik D.J.

We chose to isolate the N terminus of vitronectin from the native monomeric form of the protein purified from human plasma for the purposes of this study, to avoid any potential pitfalls inherent in using a recombinant protein to determine native structure. Analyses of several representatives of the cystine knot family have shown that disulfide bonds may be eliminated or misfolded compared with those found in the native peptide, while retaining complete or nearly complete biological activity (29Hiro'oka T. Maassen D. Berger P. Boime I. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 30Zhu Q. Liang S. Martin L. Gasparini S. Menez A. Vita C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11488-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no reliable way to assure that a peptide derived from a recombinant source truly represents the disulfide connectivities of the native protein.Determining the cysteine linkages of proteins that contain closely spaced complex disulfide bonds is a difficult problem. A number of methods have been employed to address the analytical issues posed by these structures, but they all have limitations. Often, a combination of techniques must be recruited to completely characterize the disulfide-bonding pattern in such proteins (31Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1749-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Wu J. Watson J.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 194: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yen T.Y. Yan H. Macher B.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The primary approach used here was the selective partial reduction of the disulfide bonds in the SMB domain using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), followed by alkylation of the freed cysteines by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) under acidic conditions to avoid disulfide scrambling. The SMB region was cleaved from vitronectin by endoproteinase Glu-C, purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and partially reduced with TCEP under acidic conditions. The partially reduced isoforms were subjected to peptide mapping using mass spectrometry, and the polypeptide was characterized by 1H NMR to identify the individual disulfide pairings. Our results indicate that the domain scaffold with its intricate network of disulfides is important to orient the single α-helix within this domain (18Mayasundari A. Whittemore N.A. Serpersu E.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29359-29366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) properly for binding of ligands including PAI-1 and uPAR. The SMB domain thus represents a new member of the cystine-stabilized helix (CSH) family (34Tamaoki H. Miura R. Kusunoki M. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Moroder L. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—NEM and TCEP hydrochloride were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Dithiothreitol (DTT) and trifluoroacetic acid were from Pierce. Iodoacetamide (IAM) and bovine insulin were from Sigma. Guanidine HCl, Tris base, dibasic sodium phosphate, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium sulfate, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, HPLC grade methanol, and HPLC grade acetonitrile were from Fisher Scientific (Suwanee, GA). Sequencing grades of endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were from Roche Applied Science.Endoproteinase Glu-C Digestion of Vitronectin—Native vitronectin was purified from human blood plasma using a modification of the method developed by Dahlback and Podack (35Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and stored as a precipitate under saturated ammonium sulfate. The ammonium sulfate slurry of vitronectin was pelleted in 2-ml Eppendorf® tubes in a Beckman Microfuge at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was dissolved in 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.02 m iodoacetamide, 0.05 m Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 2–4 mg/ml as determined by absorbance at 280 nm. The dissolved vitronectin (5–10 mg) was placed in the dark for 1–2 h at ∼25 °C to block free cysteines. With the free cysteines S-carbamidomethylated, the full-length vitronectin was then transferred to a Slide-A-Lyzer® dialysis cassette from Pierce with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off, where it was dialyzed against three changes of 1 liter of 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4, 0.125 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, adjusted with phosphoric acid. Finally, the alkylated vitronectin was dialyzed exhaustively against 0.1 m Na2HPO4, 0.125 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, adjusted with phosphoric acid. The protein was removed from the dialysis cassette and the concentration determined by absorbance at 280 nm. The concentration was adjusted to 1–2 mg/ml using the same buffer. The protease, endoproteinase Glu-C, was added to vitronectin at a 1:100 ratio (w/w), and the digest was performed at 37 °C for 24–30 h.Purification of Intact and Partially Reduced Forms of the SMB Domain—The peptides generated by the endoproteinase Glu-C digestion of vitronectin were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a linear gradient at 0.5 ml/min from 5 to 55% acetonitrile over 107 min. The gradient was made by mixing buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v) in water) and buffer B (acetonitrile with 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v)) in the appropriate proportions on an Agilent 1100 series quaternary pump HPLC system. A multiple wavelength detector allowed for monitoring of samples at 220 and 280 nm, and a fluorescent detector was used for monitoring for tryptophan fluorescence (excitation 280 nm, emission 356 nm). A C-18 Nucleosil column custom packed by Alltech (5-μm particle size, 100 Å pore size, 4.6 × 150 mm) was used. Column temperature was maintained at 50 °C. Fractions were collected using a Gilson FC203 B fraction collector for identification by MALDI-MS. Additional purification prior to reduction was performed using the same column and HPLC system with a linear gradient at 0.5 ml/min from 15 to 45% B over 60 min.Partial Reduction with TCEP and Alkylation with NEM—Partial reductions were carried out with an excess of TCEP and the degree of reduction controlled by stopping the reaction at various times by the addition of NEM. The times and concentrations were adapted from Young et al. (36Young Y. Zeni L. Rosenfeld R.D. Stark K.L. Rohde M.F. Haniu M. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The HPLC fraction containing the peptide to be reduced was dried using a Savant Speed-Vac with a dry ice and methanol trap. The dried fractions were dissolved in freshly prepared 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), pH 2.8. TCEP was prepared immediately prior to use at a concentration of 0.35 m in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), pH 2.8. NEM was also freshly prepared at a concentration of 0.8 m in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), pH 2.8, and 50% methanol (v/v). Solutions containing TCEP and NEM were protected from the light at all times. A 0.05 m Tris base buffer, pH 7.8, was freshly prepared to titrate the partially reduced samples before alkylation with NEM. Immediately prior to performing the partial reduction, the amount of Tris buffer necessary to titrate a given amount of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), pH 2.8, to pH 6.5 was determined empirically. TCEP was added to peptide to yield a solution with a final concentration of 0.02 m TCEP. Samples were generally withdrawn at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min and sufficient NEM was added to the reaction to create a 5:1 molar ratio of NEM to TCEP. Following the addition of NEM, Tris buffer was added to raise the pH to 6.5 to facilitate the alkylation reaction. Alkylation was allowed to proceed at ambient temperature (∼25 °C) for at least 2 h. The partially reduced and alkylated peptides were then separated by HPLC as described above and identified by MALDI-MS. Sampling times were adjusted as necessary to enrich for individual isoforms. Additional purification of partially reduced and alkylated forms was performed using a Nucleosil C-18 column and HPLC system with a linear gradient at 0.5 ml/min from 15 to 45% B over 60 min, as described above.Digestion of Partially Reduced Forms of the SMB Domain—Partially reduced forms of the SMB region of vitronectin were digested with endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin, and/or chymotrypsin to generate peptides for the determination of individual disulfide bonds. Prior to digestion, partially reduced, alkylated, and HPLC-purified peptides were completely reduced with DTT, and any free cysteines were S-carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide. Fractions containing the individual partially reduced isoforms were dried on the Savant Speed-Vac and dissolved in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. Subsequently, DTT (1 m stock) was added to each peptide at a final concentration of 0.01 m, and the sample was incubated for 4 h to completely reduce any remaining disulfide bonds in the partially reduced and alkylated peptide. Iodoacetamide (1 m stock in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5) was added to the fully reduced peptide to give a final concentration of 0.1 m. S-Carbamidomethylation with iodoacetamide was performed in the dark at ambient temperature (∼25 °C) for 2 h.Prior to protease digestion, S-carbamidomethylated samples were desalted using a 300-mg Maxi-Clean® C-18 cartridge from Alltech according to manufacturer's instructions, washed on the cartridge with 3% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), eluted with 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), dried on the Savant Speed-Vac, and dissolved in the appropriate digestion buffer. All buffers for digestion of partially reduced forms were prepared on the day of use, and digests were performed at 37 °C for ∼15 h. Endoproteinase Glu-C digests were performed in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4. Trypsin and chymotrypsin digests were performed in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. All enzymes were added to give a ratio of ∼50:1 substrate to enzyme (w/w). In the case of dual digests, the peptide was dried after the first digest using the Savant Speed-Vac, then dissolved in the appropriate buffer for the second digest, and enzyme was added in a 50:1 substrate to enzyme (w/w) ratio. After the digestion sequence was complete, the resulting peptide mixture was dried directly on the Savant Speed-Vac and dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v). Alternatively, the sample was passed over a 300-mg Maxi-Clean® C-18 cartridge from Alltech, washed on the cartridge with 3% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), eluted with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v), dried as described above, and dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v) for MALDI-MS.MALDI-MS—MALDI mass spectra were obtained in positive ion mode using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE time-of-flight mass spectrometer, or a Voyager Elite DE reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer, each equipped with a nitrogen laser (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Spectra from the Voyager DE instrument were obtained in linear mode with +20 kV total accelerating voltage, +18.8 kV applied to the grid, +10 V applied to the guide wire, and a 110-ns acceleration delay. Spectra from the Voyager Elite DE instrument were obtained in linear mode with +25 kV total accelerating voltage, +23 kV applied to the grid, +37.5 V applied to the guide wire, and a 100-ns acceleration delay. Spectra are averages of up to 256 individual laser pulses, obtained from several locations on each sample spot. Sample aliquots were applied to a pre-spotted thin-layer matrix, prepared by applying 0.5-μl portions of 5 g/liter nitrocellulose (Immobilon NC Pure, Millipore, Bedford MA), 20 g/liter α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich; re-crystallized from ethanol before use) in 1:1 isopropyl alcohol: acetone to the sample plate and allowed to dry (37Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar). External calibration of the m/z axis was performed using gramicidin S and bovine insulin. Expected masses to compare with the observed MALDI-MS results were calculated using Protein Prospector (38Karl R. Clauser P.B. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar).Electrospray MS—Analysis was also performed by electrospray quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry (LCQ Deca, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Protease digestion samples that were purified by HPLC were desalted using a C-18 ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the peptides were eluted in 10 μl of 50:50 acetonitrile:water. A 100-μl volume of 48:48:2 acetonitrile:water:acetic acid was added to the desalted sample. The mixture was then infused directly into the electrospray source of the mass spectrometer. The +5 charge state ion of the 1–55 digest fragment, at m/z 1257.3, was isolated using a 5 m/z isolation width and subjected to collision-induced dissociation to produce a tandem mass spectrum. Charge state deconvolution produced a plot with abscissa units of mass (Da).NMR Spectroscopy—A sample of the SMB domain (residues 1–51 of vitronectin) was prepared for NMR measurements by cyanogen bromide digestion and HPLC purification, as described (18Mayasundari A. Whittemore N.A. Serpersu E.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29359-29366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were collected using ∼90 μm SMB in a 500-μl sample volume in both D2O and H2O containing 10% D2O at pH 4.4 and 298 K. All NMR experiments were performed on a 600 MHz Varian INOVA instrument equipped with a single gradient axis and a triple resonance probe for the observation of proton, carbon, and nitrogen nuclei. Two-dimensional NMR data were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using the States-Haberkorn method for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension (39States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). Spectra of SMB in H2O were recorded by using WET (40Ogg R.J. Kingsley P.B. Taylor J.S. J. Magn. Reson. Ser.

Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4817) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 150, 200, and 250 ms. TOCSY spectra (44Shaka A.J. Lee C.J. Pines A. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 274-293Google Scholar) were recorded using the DIPSI (decoupling in presence of scalar interaction) spin-lock sequence with a 8-kHz radio frequency field and mixing times of 15, 30, 60, and 80 ms. Typically, spectra were acquired with 256 t1 increments, 2048 data points, a relaxation delay of 1 s, and a spectral width of 8500 Hz. For DQF-COSY spectra (45Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar), 512 t1 increments were acquired. Spectra were recorded with 64–96 scans per increment for NOESY, 24–80 scans per increment for TOCSY, and 56 scans per increment for DQF-COSY. In all NOESY and TOCSY spectra, the data were multiplied by a 60–90° phase shifted sin2 window function in both dimensions before Fourier transformation.NMR Data Analysis—NMR data were processed with Felix 2000 and SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, The University of California, San Diego) software operating on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 work station or on a Silicon Graphics Origin 300 server. Cross-peak intensities observed in NOE experiments were divided into four categories as strong, medium, weak, and very weak. These intensities were converted into distance restraints as follows: strong, 1.8–2.7 Å; medium, 1.8–3.4 Å; weak, 1.8–4.5 Å, and very weak 1.8–6.0 Å. An additional 1.0 Å was added to upper limits involving methyl protons. Similarly, an additional 0.5 Å for methylene protons and 2.3 Å for degenerate Hδ and Hϵ protons of tyrosines and phenylalanines were added to upper limits. Also, 0.2 Å was added to the upper limits of NOEs involving amide protons. Coupling constants were extracted from the DQF-COSY spectra. Backbone Φ angles were restrained to -120 ± 50° for 3JHNHα = 8–9 Hz, and -120 ± 40° for 3JHNHα > 9Hz. A restraint of -100 ± 80° was also applied to the Φ angle for residues that show stronger NHi-Hαi-1 NOE than the intraresidue NH-Hα NOE (46Clubb R.T. Ferguson S.B. Walsh C.T. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A total of 329 NOE restraints and 18 Φ restraints were used in structure determination. All calculations were carried out using the AMBER force field interfaced with DISCOVER (Accelerys, San Diego, CA) on an Origin300 work station. Random structures were generated by subjecting the peptide to an initial 10,000-step minimization at 298 K. The temperature was then raised gradually to 1,000 K during a 1,000-step dynamics simulation. The peptide was subjected to minimization and a 10-ps dynamics run at 1,000 K. The NMR-derived restraints were then imposed on the peptide and the peptide was slowly annealed to 298 K in a 100-ps trajectory. Finally, the structures were subjected to further minimization at 298 K. The force constant for the distance restraints was 100 kcal/mol Å-2 and the dielectric constant was 4.RESULTSEndoproteinase Glu-C Digestion of Vitronectin and Isolation of the N-terminal Peptide—Determination of the disulfide-bonding pattern of the SMB domain of vitrone"
https://openalex.org/W2011911339,"To create a human therapeutic vaccine able to circumvent self-tolerance against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, foreign T helper epitopes were inserted into human TNFα, with minimal effect on the native three-dimensional structure. TNFα variants were screened for solubility, structural stability, biological activity, and after immunization, for eliciting inhibitory antibodies. The longest and most flexible loop in TNFα, also designated loop 3, is the only region that is not involved in intra- or intermolecular interactions and therefore constitute an attractive insertion site. However, the extension of the flexible loop by epitope insertions destabilized the TNFα molecule. Therefore, two cysteines were introduced to form a stabilizing disulfide bond between loops 2 and 3. In a second design approach, three TNFα monomers were linked by two T cell epitopes and expressed as a single chain TNFα trimer. TNFα variants that were expressed as soluble proteins also had a conserved tertiary structure, as determined by circular dichroism. The biological activity of the TNFα variants was of the same magnitude as human TNFα in cellular assays. Introduction of three separate single-point mutations (D143N, A145R, or Y87S) diminished the cytotoxicity of the mutated variants 50-800-fold compared with native TNFα. Antisera from mice immunized with the different TNFα variants were able to cross-react with native human TNFα and to inhibit TNFα signaling via the TNF receptors in vitro, suggesting that the structural binding epitopes of native human TNFα and thus the native conformation were conserved in the constructed vaccine candidates.

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFRI, tumor necrosis factor RI; TNFRII, tumor necrosis factor RII; MALDITOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is a pleiotropic cytokine, which plays a central role in immune regulation and as an inflammatory and host defense mediator (1Feldman M. Taylor P. Paleolog E. Brennan F.M. Maini R.N. Transplant. Proc. 1998; 30: 4126-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The multiple biological effects of TNFα are mediated both through binding of membrane-bound and soluble TNFα to two cell surface TNF receptors TNFRI and TNFRII, each displaying diverse kinetics of activation upon binding of TNFα (2Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The successful use of TNFα antagonists in relieving pain and symptoms in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease has confirmed the important role of TNFα in inflammatory diseases. At present, the anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies Infliximab (3Lochs H. Adler G. Beglinger C. Duchmann R. Emmrich J. Ewe K. Gangl A. Gasche C. Hahn E. Hoffmann P. Kaskas B. Malchow H. Pohl C. Raedler A. Renner E. Scholmerich J. Schreiber S. Stange E. Tilg H. Vogelsang H. Weigert N. Zeitz M. Z. Gastroenterol. 1999; 37: 509-512PubMed Google Scholar) and Adalimumab (4Machold K.P. Smolen J.S. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2003; 3: 351-360PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the soluble TNF receptor Etanercept (5Yung R.L. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 2: 216-221PubMed Google Scholar), have been approved for clinical use as TNFα antagonists. In addition, several alternative anti-TNFα treatments, such as intracellular kinase inhibitors, TNFα synthesis inhibitors, TNFα membrane-release inhibitors, as well as other soluble TNFα blockers are under development (6Girolomoni G. Pastore S. Albanesi C. Cavani A. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 1590-1595PubMed Google Scholar). Another potential strategy to target overexpression of TNFα is the induction of antibody responses against TNFα in the patient through immunization or active immunotherapy. However, one obstacle in the development of such a vaccine is that immunological T cell tolerance against TNFα needs to be circumvented to induce a sufficiently strong immune response with the capacity to neutralize endogenous TNFα. By the use of the AutoVac™ technology, where a foreign immunodominant T helper cell epitope is inserted into the native self-protein, T cell tolerance to the self-protein can be circumvented (7Dalum I. Butler D.M. Jensen M.R. Hindersson P. Steinaa L. Waterston A.M. Grell S.N. Feldmann M. Elsner H.I. Mouritsen S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of hetero-reactive T cells leads to an induction of T cell-dependent polyclonal antibody production, which has the ability to cross-react with and neutralize the endogenous target protein. Most importantly, immunization with a modified self-protein, containing a foreign and immunodominant T cell epitope, allows for the immune response to be driven by hetero-reactive, rather than auto-reactive, T cells and re-immunization is a prerequisite to maintain high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Clearly, the development of a therapeutic and safe vaccine against TNFα would be preferable to the use of monoclonal anti-TNFα antibodies or engineered TNF receptors with respect to the amount of protein needed for each treatment and the convenience of the patients. The aim of the current investigation was to develop a modified human TNFα protein that, upon immunization, would induce the activation of T cells specific for the modified protein and the generation of an antibody response that could cross-react and neutralize native human TNFα. However, to be able to induce a polyclonal B cell response with high cross-reactivity to the wild type protein, it was of pivotal importance to insert the foreign immunodominant T cell epitope into the native TNFα sequence in such a way that the structural identity and, consequentially, conformational B cell epitopes between the modified protein and wild-type human TNFα were maintained. Introduction of foreign epitopes in a trimeric protein, like TNFα, without interfering with the native conformation is not trivial. Active TNFα consists of three homologous monomers that self-associate into a symmetrical non-covalent trimer with a molecular weight of 52,000 (8Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P. Nature. 1989; 338: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The individual 157-amino acid monomer consists of anti-parallel β-sheets organized into a jellyroll-like structure (9Narhi L.O. Philo J.S. Li T. Zhang M. Samal B. Arakawa T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11447-11453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with an intra-molecular disulfide bond between residues Cys69 and Cys101. By circular dichroism, it has been shown that the trimeric structure unfolds at 60 °C where α-helical structures are introduced in the monomer (9Narhi L.O. Philo J.S. Li T. Zhang M. Samal B. Arakawa T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11447-11453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, more than half the amino acids in TNFα have been investigated through different point mutations by various researchers (10Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Most of the point mutations resulted in decreased stability, solubility, and/or trimer formation leading to low expression yields and the formation of inclusion bodies when expressed in Escherichia coli. The subsequent refolding required for the formation of trimeric proteins is at best a cumbersome process, mainly because of the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize a correctly folded molecule. To avoid the generation of inclusion bodies and to maintain the biophysical characteristics of native human TNFα, we have investigated several different strategies. These include the identification of a flexible loop where the foreign T cell epitope could be inserted with negligible effect on the intra- or intermolecular interactions of the trimer protein, and expression of a single chain TNFα trimer with the T cell epitopes inserted as linkers between the monomers. Construction of TNFα AutoVac™ Variants from Synthetic Genes—Synthetic genes encoding either a TNFα monomer or a single chain TNFα trimer were designed by codon optimization of the TNFα gene for E. coli expression, according to the codon usage data base. Codons with a frequency in E. coli of less than 10% were excluded. The genes were obtained as sequenced clones from GeneArt GMBH, in the case of the TNFα monomer as a single clone, and in the case of the trimer, as three colony PCR products each representing one of the three embedded TNFα genes. Codon usage was modified to create three TNFα monomers with identical amino acid sequences but with distinct cDNA sequences, for the single chain TNFα trimer (TNF_T) gene. This was done to circumvent PCR recognition problems upon assembly of the monomers. The three PCR products were cloned using the TOPO system (Invitrogen), into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. These clones were then used as templates in three separate PCR to generate fragments that were assembled by SOE PCR (11Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Briefly, two fragments were assembled to generate a dimeric TNFα gene, which subsequently was used as template to assemble the final single chain TNFα trimeric gene. The assembled gene was cloned into the pET28b+ vector and transformed into competent HMS174 E. coli cells. A sequence verified clone was isolated and used as template for the generation of the single chain TNFα trimer constructs. The TNFα monomeric cDNA was moved from the pCR-Script vector to the pET28b+ vector, and used as template for the generation of flexible loop constructs. Insertion of Epitopes—The artificial T cell Pan DR epitope named PADRE (sequence AKFVAAWTLKAAA) (12Alexander J. Sidney J. Southwood S. Ruppert J. Oseroff C. Maewal A. Snoke K. Serra H.M. Kubo R.T. Sette A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 751-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) was inserted into the flexible loop variants and the tetanus toxoid epitopes P2 and P30 (sequence QYIKANSKFIGITEL, and sequence FNNFTVSFWLRVPKVSASHLE) into the single chain TNFα trimer by the SOE PCR technique, to generate TNFα AutoVac™ variants. All variants were sequence verified and transformed into the E. coli strain HMS174(DE3). TNFα AutoVac™ Expression—All proteins were expressed in HMS174 cells in defined media (13Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Different combinations of temperature (37 and 25 °C) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were tested for optimal expression. Purification of TNFα Variants—Purification of the flexible loop TNFα variants was based on a combination of Bio-Gel hydroxyapatite HTP (Bio-Rad) and Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (14Paquet A. Levesque A. Page M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 667: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The single chain TNFα trimer variants were purified to apparent homogeneity by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. The monoclonal antibody Infliximab (3Lochs H. Adler G. Beglinger C. Duchmann R. Emmrich J. Ewe K. Gangl A. Gasche C. Hahn E. Hoffmann P. Kaskas B. Malchow H. Pohl C. Raedler A. Renner E. Scholmerich J. Schreiber S. Stange E. Tilg H. Vogelsang H. Weigert N. Zeitz M. Z. Gastroenterol. 1999; 37: 509-512PubMed Google Scholar) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). After capture, the single chain TNFα trimers were eluted with 100 mm glycine, 500 mm NaCl, pH 11. Fractions were collected, pooled, and transferred directly to dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using Autoflex equipment (BRUKER Daltonik, Germany). Sinapinic acid was used as matrix with samples of TNFα variants previously desalted and concentrated using ZipTipHPL (MilliPore, Denmark). Trypsin digestion (Promega) of TNFα variants were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, using sequence grade trypsin by incubation for 20 h at room temperature. Peptides were mixed directly (1:1) with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-Hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% acetonitrile (v/v), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) followed by application onto an AnchorChip target plate. The analysis was carried out in linear mode. Circular Dichroism Analysis—Circular dichroism measurements were carried out on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter instrument (Gross-Umstadt, Germany) with quartz cells of 1-mm path length. Proteins were examined at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The thermal denaturation was followed by scans from 280 to 200 nm at temperatures ranging from 25 to 85 °C. N-terminal Sequencing—N-terminal sequencing of variants were routinely done on a model 476A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). ProSorb cartridges (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for desalting samples prior to the analysis. Measurement of Direct Binding to TNFRI and TNFRII—Polystyrene microtiter plates (Maxisorp, Nunc A/S, Denmark) were coated overnight with 50 ng/ml TNFR (I or II; R&D Systems), respectively, in a coating buffer (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.5). After blocking with an ELISA buffer (10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.0005% phenol red in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2), the plates were washed with a washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). The investigated TNFα variant was applied to the microtiter plate in serial dilutions in the ELISA buffer and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. The plates were subsequently washed and bound TNFα variants were detected by applying biotinylated goat anti-human TNFα (BAF210, R&D Systems), diluted to 0.5 μg/ml in the ELISA buffer, and incubated for 1 h. After washing, the plates were incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (RPN1231V, Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:1000 in the ELISA buffer, washed, and developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma P-8287) (1 mg/ml) dissolved in citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5, and H2O2 (0.03%). The plates were read on an Elx 808 ELISA reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Burlington, VT) at 490 nm, using 620 nm as reference. Quantitative TNFα ELISA—7.0 μg/ml rabbit anti-goat antibodies were coated overnight in coating buffer. Goat anti-human TNFα in the ELISA buffer was incubated for 1 h and subsequently washed. TNFα variants and human TNFα (R&D Systems) as standard were applied to the microtiter plate in serial dilutions in the ELISA buffer and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. After washing, detection was made as described for the receptor ELISA. The concentrations of the variants were calculated by interpolation to the TNFα standard fitted to a four-parameter plot using KC4 software (Bio-Tec Instruments). Immunizations—Groups of 10 Balb/C female mice (Taconic M&B, Denmark) were immunized subcutaneously with 50 μg of protein emulsified in Complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). Two, 6, and 10 weeks later, mice were boosted with 25 μg of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). One week after each boost (i.e. 3, 7, and 11 weeks after the first immunization), blood samples were collected and serum was prepared. Sera were stored at -20 °C until analyzed. All mice were between 7 and 12 weeks of age, at the start of the experiments. All experimental procedures had been approved by the Danish Animal Experimentation Inspectorate. Cell Line—The KYM-1D4 (KD4) cell line derived from human rhabdomyosarcoma cells was kindly provided from A. Meager (Division of Immunology, National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls). Culturing of cells was essentially performed as described previously (15Meager A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 144: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cell Culture Assays—For neutralization assays, KD4 cells were cultured in triplicates in microtiter plates at 2 × 104 cells/well in the presence of a constant concentration of in-house produced human wild type TNFα (100 pg/ml a concentration inducing at least half-maximum cellular death) and titrated amounts of mouse sera. In addition, pooled control serum from mice, which had received 3-4 immunizations with an irrelevant protein (KLH) in Complete Freund's adjuvant/incomplete Freund's adjuvant, was used as a negative control in the neutralization assay. For cytotoxicity assays, cells were cultured as above in the presence of titrated amounts of human TNFα or TNFα AutoVac™ variants. After 48 h of incubation, cell survival was determined by MTS, inner salt (CellTiter 96® AQueous 1 Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega). In the neutralization assay, relative cell viability was calculated by dividing the mean optical density value from wells with cells cultured in the presence of TNFα and sera with the mean optical density value from wells where cells had been cultured in the absence of both protein and sera. The IC50 value, corresponding to the amount of sera resulting in 50% inhibition of TNF-mediated cell cytotoxicity, was determined by interpolating the OD50 value onto the x axis (Y50 = (Ymax - Ymin)/2 + Ymin, where Ymax is the relative cell viability of cells cultured in the absence of sera and TNFα (i.e. 100%) and Ymin is the maximum relative cell viability observed for cells cultured in the presence of TNFα and titrated amounts of sera from control immunized mice). In the cytotoxicity assay, relative cell viability was calculated by dividing the mean optical density value of cells cultured in the presence of TNFα variants with the mean optical density value of cells cultured in the absence of TNFα. An ED50 value, corresponding to the concentration of TNFα inducing half-maximum cytotoxicity, was calculated as described for the IC50 value (i.e. Y50 = (Ymax - Ymin)/2 + Ymin, where Ymax is the relative cell viability of cells cultured in the absence of TNFα (i.e. 100%) and Ymin is the minimal OD value obtained from cells cultured in the presence of TNFα variants). Design of Flexible Loop Variants—The purpose of this work was to insert a foreign T cell epitope into the native TNFα molecule to create stable and soluble TNFα AutoVac™ variants. The crystal structure of TNFα bound to its receptor has not been published. However, from the structure of the TNFα family member TRAIL bound to the DR5 receptor, it is expected that the three major receptor interacting sites of the TNFα molecules are located along the edge of TNFα (16Cha S.S. Sung B.J. Kim Y.A. Song Y.L. Kim H.J. Kim S. Lee M.S. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31171-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To create TNFα AutoVac™ variants that could induce a polyclonal antibody response that was directed to receptor binding epitopes and thereby able to inhibit TNFα activity, the T cell epitope insertions were not performed in the proposed receptor binding regions. Prior to this work, we constructed numerous variants where, e.g. parts of β-strands of TNFα had been substituted with foreign T cell epitopes. However, this strategy resulted in expression as inclusion bodies in E. coli. This is in contrast to native human TNFα that is readily expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli (17Van Ostade X. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consequently, we used another approach to find permissive sites for epitope insertions within regions of TNFα that would not affect the conformation of the core TNFα molecule. This was done by identification of flexible regions from crystal structures of TNFα, together with information from superimposition of human and murine TNFα structures and sequence alignment of TNFα from different species. In this way loop 3 (Arg103-Lys112) was identified as a potential site for insertion of epitopes. The PADRE epitope was inserted at several positions in flexible loop 3 by direct insertion and/or with deletion of one or more amino acids in TNFα (Fig. 1). The resulting variants were analyzed for soluble expression in E. coli. Interestingly, only variants where the T cell epitope had been inserted C-terminal (e.g. TNF4, TNF7, and TNF8) and not N-terminal of Gly108 were expressed as soluble proteins. The stability of proteins can be increased by insertion of cysteines that form disulfide bonds (18Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Levitt M. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6562-6566Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We therefore designed another TNFα variant, TNF4A, containing an extra disulfide bond, to examine if this would have a beneficial effect on the variant stability. Stabilization of the TNF4A variant was done by introduction of a new disulfide bond opposite the native disulfide bond, connecting the flexible loop 3 to the non-flexible loop 2 (Lys65-Val74). Thereby, the inserted PADRE peptide became positioned between two disulfide bonds both connecting loops 3 to 2 (Fig. 2). To achieve this the crystal structure of TNFα was analyzed, and Gln67 and Ala111 were selected for substitution with cysteines. The distance between the Cα atoms of these residues is 5.2 Å, approximately the same distance as between the residues harboring the native disulfide bond (Cys69 and Cys101; 5.7 Å). As for TNF4 (without the extra disulfide bond), TNF4A was also successfully expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli (Fig. 1). A schematic view of the structure of the flexible loop variants with and without the introduced disulfide bond is seen in Fig. 3, A and B. The highest expression levels (200 mg/liter) of soluble flexible loop variants, as determined by ELISA, were observed when cultured at 25 °C, both pre- and post-induction.Fig. 3Design of TNFα AutoVac™ variants. Two different strategies were used for design of TNFα variants. In the flexible loop variants, the PADRE epitope was inserted into the TNFα sequence with or without deletions (A). A stabilizing disulfide bridge was introduced (B), and in the single chain TNFα trimer approach the epitopes were inserted between the monomers (C).

From the crystal structure of native trimeric TNFα it was perceived that the C-terminal Leu157 is located at the entrance of the interface region of the three monomers, where they make important salt bridges to Lys11 in the successive monomer (8Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P. Nature. 1989; 338: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The distance between the Cα atom of residue Leu157 to the Cα of Arg6 of the next monomer (the first five residues are not determined in the crystal structure) is only 12-15 Å. To minimize the disruptive forces on Leu157, glycine linkers (GGG) of approximately 10 Å length were introduced between the epitopes and the TNFα monomers. A schematic overview of the structure is seen in Fig. 3C. Optimal growth conditions were found to be the same as for the flexible loop variants, i.e. 25 °C, both pre- and postinduction. However, protein expression levels were lower for the single chain TNFα trimers with an approximate expression of 20 mg/liters. Characterization of Purified Variants—After purification, the N-terminal sequences were determined and found to be identical to the TNFα sequence. The molecular masses, as determined by MALDI-TOF, correlated with the theoretical values within 1 or 2 daltons. Reduced SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the purity was about 90% for all the variants. Under certain expression conditions, 5-10% of the flexible loop constructs were degraded. The single chain TNFα trimer (TNF_T) was expressed as a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to a trimer, but breakdown products corresponding to dimeric and monomeric bands were also detected in Western blots (data not shown). Non-reduced Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the flexible loop variants migrated as monomeric TNFα. In the same analysis, the variant containing the introduced cysteines (TNF4A) also migrated as a monomer, indicating that the intramolecular disulfide bonds were correctly formed. Flexible loop variants were tested for solubility at high concentrations and were readily soluble at concentrations ranging from 0.75 to 50 mg/ml in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, without significant precipitation. Far-UV spectra equivalent to human TNFα were obtained by circular dichroism analyses. All examined variants had a characteristic minimum at 220 nm, indicating a predominantly β-stranded protein structure (data not shown). Stability of the TNFα variants was analyzed by near-UV circular dichroism during heat-induced denaturation. Denaturation temperatures were above 40 °C for the single chain TNFα trimer, ∼50 °C for the monomer variants, and ∼65 °C for the variant that was stabilized by introduction of a new disulfide bond (see Fig. 4). As expected, native human TNFα denatured at 60 °C (9Narhi L.O. Philo J.S. Li T. Zhang M. Samal B. Arakawa T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11447-11453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The correct formation of the two disulfide bonds in TNF4A was confirmed by MALDI-TOF analyses on non-reduced and reduced trypsin-digested samples. Under non-reduced conditions a peak of 4,955.18 daltons was identified. This peak consists of a tripeptide held together by the two introduced cysteines and the two naturally occurring cysteines (Fig. 5A). After reduction of the trypsin-digested TNF4A, the tripeptide complex disappeared and a new peak of 2,583.81 daltons appeared. This peak has a mass analogous to the Ala119-Lys141 peptide representing the longest cysteine containing peptide (Fig. 5B). The second cysteine containing peptide Gly66-Arg82 was detected as a weaker peak at 1779.28 daltons. The third peptide was too short to be identified in this assay. Further evidence of the stabilizing effect of the introduced disulfide bond was done by a comparison of reduced and non-reduced SDS-PAGE that included purified TNF4A with partial cleavage in the PADRE region. Two degradation products, resulting from PADRE cleavage, were seen in reduced gels at 12 and 6 kDa, below the 18-kDa intact monomer band. Because TNF4A migrates as a single monomeric band at 18 kDa in non-reduced SDS-PAGE, the introduced disulfide bond must link the two degradation fragments together (data not shown). All variants eluted analogous to the human TNFα in size exclusion chromatography analyses corresponding to a theoretical TNFα trimer weight of 52,000 for the variants (results not shown). Biological Activity of TNFα Variants and Design of Partially Inactivated Variants—TNFα has toxic activity when injected into animals (19Asher A. Mule J.J. Reichert C.M. Shiloni E. Rosenberg S.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 963-974PubMed Google Scholar) and humans (20Yang S.C. Grimm E.A. Parkinson D.R. Carinhas J. Fry K.D. Mendiguren-Rodriguez A. Licciardello J. Owen-Schaub L.B. Hong W.K. Roth J.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3669-3676PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the flexible loop and single chain TNFα trimer variants exhibited cytotoxicity comparable with the wild type TNFα in a cell based assay (Fig. 6A). TNF4A was even 3-5-fold more toxic than human TNFα. The cytotoxicity of the TNFα variants is suggestive of a native-like conformation. A strong toxicity is, however, not desirable in a vaccine. Consequently, to reduce the cytotoxicity of the TNFα AutoVac™ molecules, three different point mutations known to significantly reduce the toxicity of TNFα were intro"
