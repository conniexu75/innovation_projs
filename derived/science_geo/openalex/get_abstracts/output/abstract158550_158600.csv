https://openalex.org/W2012571494,"beta-Arrestins, originally discovered in the context of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization, also function in internalization and signaling of these receptors. We identified c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) as a binding partner of beta-arrestin 2 using a yeast two-hybrid screen and by coimmunoprecipitation from mouse brain extracts or cotransfected COS-7 cells. The upstream JNK activators apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 were also found in complex with beta-arrestin 2. Cellular transfection of beta-arrestin 2 caused cytosolic retention of JNK3 and enhanced JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated by ASK1. Moreover, stimulation of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor activated JNK3 and triggered the colocalization of beta-arrestin 2 and active JNK3 to intracellular vesicles. Thus, beta-arrestin 2 acts as a scaffold protein, which brings the spatial distribution and activity of this MAPK module under the control of a GPCR."

https://openalex.org/W2032064716,"Modulation doping of a semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube along its length leads to an intramolecular wire electronic device. The nanotube is doped n-type for half of its length and p-type for the other half. Electrostatic gating can tune the system into p-n junctions, causing it to exhibit rectifying characteristics or negative differential conductance. The system can also be tuned into n-type, exhibiting single-electron charging and negative differential conductance at low temperatures. The low-temperature behavior is manifested by a quantum dot formed by chemical inhomogeneity along the tube."

We have engineered individual biomolecular motors and nanoscale inorganic systems, and we describe their integration in a hybrid nanomechanical device powered by a biomolecular motor. The device consisted of three components: an engineered substrate, an F1-ATPase biomolecular motor, and fabricated nanopropellers. Rotation of the nanopropeller was initiated with 2 mM adenosine triphosphate and inhibited by sodium azide."

These YopJ family members were shown to act as cysteine proteases. The catalytic triad of the protease was required for inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in animal cells and for induction of localized cell death in plants. The substrates for YopJ were shown to be highly conserved ubiquitin-like molecules, which are covalently added to numerous regulatory proteins. YopJ family members exert their pathogenic effect on cells by disrupting this posttranslational modification."

https://openalex.org/W2029112137,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports disulfide bond formation by a poorly understood mechanism requiring protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ERO1. In yeast, Ero1p-mediated oxidative folding was shown to depend on cellular flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) levels but not on ubiquinone or heme, and Ero1p was shown to be a FAD-binding protein. We reconstituted efficient oxidative folding in vitro using FAD, PDI, and Ero1p. Disulfide formation proceeded by direct delivery of oxidizing equivalents from Ero1p to folding substrates via PDI. This kinetic shuttling of oxidizing equivalents could allow the ER to support rapid disulfide formation while maintaining the ability to reduce and rearrange incorrect disulfide bonds."

https://openalex.org/W2018992923,"We now show that NO serves as a substrate for multiple members of the mammalian peroxidase superfamily under physiological conditions. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase, and lactoperoxidase all catalytically consumed NO in the presence of the co-substrate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Near identical rates of NO consumption by the peroxidases were observed in the presenceversus absence of plasma levels of Cl−. Although rates of NO consumption in buffer were accelerated in the presence of a superoxide-generating system, subsequent addition of catalytic levels of a model peroxidase, MPO, to NO-containing solutions resulted in the rapid acceleration of NO consumption. The interaction between NO and compounds I and II of MPO were further investigated during steady-state catalysis by stopped-flow kinetics. NO dramatically influenced the build-up, duration, and decay of steady-state levels of compound II, the rate-limiting intermediate in the classic peroxidase cycle, in both the presence and absence of Cl−. Collectively, these results suggest that peroxidases may function as a catalytic sink for NO at sites of inflammation, influencing its bioavailability. They also support the potential existence of a complex and interdependent relationship between NO levels and the modulation of steady-state catalysis by peroxidases in vivo.

Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 2Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions, such as during inflammation and vascular disease, rates of NO consumption become excessive and impaired response to endothelium-derived relaxing factor or NO are observed (1Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Accordingly, factors which influence rates of NO removal following its synthesis by nitric-oxide synthases (NOS)1 are of significant interest. The autoxidation of NO in aqueous solutions is slow at physiological concentrations of O2 and NO (3Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In the vascular compartment, a major pathway for NO removal is through near diffusion-controlled interaction with erythrocyte oxyhemoglobin yielding ferric (met)hemoglobin and nitrate (NO3−) (4Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, during inflammation and vascular disease, oxyhemoglobin levels do not typically alter and enhanced production of NO by NOS is observed. These observations suggest that the rate of NO consumption from the subendothelial space of atherosclerotic vessels and other inflammatory tissues is enhanced (1Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 2Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms accounting for accelerated removal of NO under these conditions are still unclear. One potential pathway for accelerated NO consumption in tissues is through its rapid reaction with superoxide (O⨪2) yielding peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (1Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 2Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Moncada S. Funct.

This reaction may be of particular importance wherever enhanced rates of NO and O⨪2 production occur, such as in the subendothelial space and other sites of inflammation and phagocyte activation. However, NO consumption by reaction with O⨪2 does not account for the complete loss of NO-dependent signaling to vascular smooth muscle cells (8White C.R. Darley-Usmar V. Berrington W.R. McAdams M. Gore J.Z. Thompson J.A. Parks D.A. Tarpey M.M. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8745-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), suggesting that alternative pathways exist for depletion of NO. In vitro studies demonstrate that NO is a potent scavenger of a variety of radical intermediates such as lipid peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals (9O'Donnell V.B. Chumley P.H. Hogg N. Bloodsworth A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Freeman B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15216-15223Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Goss S.P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol.

Similar processes likely occur in atherosclerotic lesions where lipid oxidation products are enriched (13Suarna C. Dean R.T. May J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Reactions of NO with radical intermediates of enzymes that catalyze electron transfer reactions are another potential pathway for NO consumption. For example, recent studies by O'Donnell and colleagues (14O'Donnell V.B. Taylor K.B. Parthasarathy S. Kuhn H. Koesling D. Friebe A. Bloodsworth A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20083-20091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated turnover-dependent consumption of NO by 15-lipoxygenase, an enzyme implicated in atherogenesis (15Cyrus T. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Tangirala R. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Funk CD. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar,16Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1487-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The role of these pathways in modulating NO-dependent signaling in vivo remains to be determined. The ability of NO to react with hemoproteins at nearly diffusion-controlled rates, promoting activation of guanylate cyclase and possibly inhibition of many heme and non-heme proteins by interacting with their metal centers is well known (17Palmer R.M. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9337) Google Scholar, 18Wink D.A. Osawa Y. Darbyshire J.F. Jones C.R. Eshenaur S.C. Nims R.W. Arch. Biochem.

Wilson M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Likewise, a variety of studies have documented the ability of NO to bind to the heme moiety of peroxidases (24Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Kobayashi K. Tamura M. Hayashi K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Edwards S.L.

Chem. 1986; 261: 6734-6741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both spectroscopic and rapid kinetics measurements were recently used to demonstrate that NO rapidly binds to both ferric (Fe(III)) and ferrous (Fe(II)) forms of myeloperoxidase (MPO) (28Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), a hemoprotein that is present in abundance in neutrophils, monocytes and certain subpopulations of tissue macrophages, such as in atherosclerotic lesions (29Agner K. Akeson A. Ehrenberg A. Structure and Function of Oxidation-Reduction Enzymes. Pergamon Press, Oxford1972: 329-335Google Scholar, 30Klebanoff S.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Although human neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood do not normally contain inducible NOS, neutrophils within human buffy coat preparations pretreated with cytokines are reported to express inducible NOS (31Evans T.J. Buttery L.D. Carpenter A. Springall D.R. Polak J.M. Cohen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9553-9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Moreover, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that MPO and inducible NOS in cytokine-treated human neutrophils are both co-localized and secreted from the primary granules of activated leukocytes (31Evans T.J. Buttery L.D. Carpenter A. Springall D.R. Polak J.M. Cohen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9553-9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Finally, numerous cell types generate NO at sites of inflammation. Hence, MPO typically performs its functions in environments where NO is formed. MPO uses H2O2and a variety of co-substrates to generate reactive oxidants and diffusible radical species (32Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A. Anderson M.M. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, a major co-substrate is Cl− yielding hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent chlorinating oxidant with microbicidal and viricidal properties (38Klebanoff S.J. Waltersdorph A.M. Rosen H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The reactive species formed are thought to play a key role in the ability of MPO to promote destruction of invading parasites and pathogens during the host response (39Petrides P.E. Nauseef W.M. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 659-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 40Aratani Y. Koyama H. Nyui S. Suzuki K. Kura F. Maeda N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, MPO-generated oxidants are also linked to tissue oxidation in cardiovascular disease and other inflammatory disorders (41Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 42Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 43Hazen S.L.

Dean R.T. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). At ground state MPO exists in the ferric (Fe(III)) form. Like other peroxidases, MPO-Fe(III) uses H2O2 as a substrate and is in turn oxidized two electron (e−) equivalents forming a redox intermediate termed compound I, a ferryl π cation radical (MPO-Fe(IV)=O⋅+π) with a formal heme charge of +5. The oxidation of halides (e.g.Cl−, Br−, I−) and pseudo halides (e.g. SCN−) by MPO compound I occurs through a single 2 e− transfer reaction, where the heme of MPO is reduced to ferric state and the corresponding hypohalous acid is formed (45Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 46Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar). MPO compound I can also oxidize numerous organic and inorganic substrates by two successive 1 e− transfers generating compound II (MPO-Fe(IV)=O) and MPO-Fe(III), respectively. Reduction of compound II to ground state is the rate-limiting step in the typical peroxidase cycle, and it can be accelerated by physiological reductants like O⨪2 and ascorbic acid (45Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 46Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. 1st Ed.

Van Wart H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5666-5670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that NO can modulate the catalytic activity of MPO (28Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). High levels of NO inhibited MPO catalysis by the formation of a stable six-coordinate low spin nitrosyl complex, MPO-Fe(III)-NO. In contrast, low levels of NO enhanced the initial rate of MPO-catalyzed peroxidation of substrate, presumably by accelerating the rate-limiting step in the peroxidase cycle, reduction of compound II (28Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The latter observation suggested that interactions between NO and compounds I and II of mammalian peroxidases might serve as a mechanism for catalytic consumption of NO. Consistent with this hypothesis, Ischiropoulos and colleagues (24Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported several years ago that the presence of NO in samples interferes with H2O2 determinations by ferrihorseradish peroxidase (HRP) (24Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and, during the preparation of this report, the rate of reaction of NO with compounds I and II of this plant peroxidase were reported (49Glover R.E. Koshkin V. Dunford H.B. Mason R.P. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have focused on the interactions of NO as a ligand for the heme group of mammalian peroxidases (24Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Kobayashi K. Tamura M. Hayashi K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Edwards S.L.

The present studies evaluate whether mammalian peroxidases use NO as a substrate under physiological conditions and thus may limit its bioavailability at sites of inflammation. NO gas was purchased from Matheson Gas Products, Inc., and used without further purification. For each experiment, a fresh saturated stock of NO was prepared under anaerobic conditions. The extent of nitrite/nitrate (NO2−/ NO3−) build-up in NO preparations over the time course used for the present studies was < 1–1.5% (per mole of NO), as determined by anion exchange HPLC under anaerobic conditions (50Thayer J.R. Huffaker R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All other reagents and materials were of the highest purity grades available and obtained from Sigma or the indicated source. Human EPO was isolated from porcine whole blood obtained fresh at the slaughterhouse according to the method of Jorg (51Jorg A. Pasquier J.-M. Kelebanoff S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 701: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) employing guaiacol oxidation as the assay (38Klebanoff S.J. Waltersdorph A.M. Rosen H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Purity of EPO preparations was assured before use by demonstrating a RZ of > 0.9 (A 415/A 280), SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie Blue staining, and in-gel tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase staining to confirm no contaminating MPO activity (52van Dalen C.J. Whitehouse M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). MPO was initially purified from detergent extracts of human leukocytes by sequential lectin affinity and gel filtration chromatography as described (53Rakita R.M. Michel B.R. Rosen H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Trace levels of contaminating EPO were then removed by passage over a sulfopropyl Sephadex column (54Wever R. Plat H. Hamers M.N. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purity of isolated MPO was established by demonstrating a RZ of 0.87 (A 430/A 280), SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie Blue staining, and in-gel tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase staining to confirm no contaminating EPO activity (52van Dalen C.J. Whitehouse M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically utilizing extinction coefficients of 89,000 and 112,000m−1cm−1/heme of MPO (55Agner K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1963; 17: S332-S338Crossref Google Scholar) and EPO (56Bolscher B.G. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 57Carlson M.G. Peterson C.G. Venge P. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1875-1879PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The concentration of the MPO dimer was calculated as half the indicated concentration of heme-like chromophore. Bovine LPO was obtained from Worthington Biochemistry Corp. (Lakewood, NJ) and used without further purification. Purity was confirmed by demonstrating aRZ of 0.75 (A 412/A 280) and SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie Blue staining. NO measurements were carried out using an NO-selective electrode (ISO-NO Mark II, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) connected to a chart recorder. Experiments were performed at 25 °C by immersing the electrode in 10 ml of 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, under air. NO was added to continuously stirred buffer solution from an NO-saturated stock, and the rise and fall in NO concentration was continuously monitored. To determine the effect of H2O2 and peroxidases on NO levels during steady-state catalysis, 10 μl of H2O2 (100 μm final) and 50 μl of enzyme (150 nm final) were added to the reaction mixture. Where indicated, solutions were supplemented with NaCl (100 mm) and/or a cell-free O⨪2-generating system comprised of lumazine (0.4 mm) and bovine milk xanthine oxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Superoxide generation under the conditions utilized was ∼40 μm/min, as measured by the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c(58Lampert M.B. Weiss S.J. Blood. 1983; 62: 645-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anaerobic spectra of MPO-Fe(III) were recorded at 25 °C in septum-sealed quartz cuvettes that were equipped with a quick-fit joint for attachment to a vacuum system. MPO samples were made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and equilibrated with catalyst-deoxygenated N2. Cuvettes were maintained under N2 or NO atmosphere during spectral measurements. The kinetics of compound II formation and decay in the absence and presence of different NO concentrations were performed using a dual syringe stopped-flow instrument obtained from Hi-Tech Ltd. (model SF-51). Measurements were carried out under anaerobic atmosphere at 25 °C and monitored at 455 nm (an isosbestic point of compound I and MPO ground state) following rapid mixing of equal volumes of an H2O2-containing buffer solution and an MPO solution that contained different NO concentrations. The time course of absorbance change was fit to either single or double exponential functions as indicated. The rate constants for the formation (k on) and decay (k off) of the MPO-Fe(III)-NO complex in the presence of plasma levels of the alternative substrate Cl− (100 mm) were determined by monitoring absorbance change at 430 nm at 10 °C. The time course was accurately fit to the first-order exponential equation (Y = 1 − e −kt ) using a nonlinear least-squares method provided by the instrument manufacturer. Signal to noise ratios for all kinetic analyses were improved by averaging at least six to eight individual traces. Our initial experiments utilized an NO-selective electrode to determine whether NO serves as a general substrate for peroxidases. Reactions were performed under conditions where peroxidases were present in catalytic amounts. Following addition of an aliquot of NO-saturated buffer to the continuously stirred reaction mixture (6 μm NO final), the NO signal rose rapidly, achieved a maximum after ∼30 s, and fell gradually to the origin as NO was depleted by autoxidation (Fig.1 A). Addition of H2O2 to the reaction mixture had no significant effect on the rate of NO decay (Fig. 1 A), similar to prior reports (24Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subsequent addition of MPO, EPO, or LPO to the reaction mixture caused a rapid decay in the level of free NO (Fig. 1), indicating that NO is consumed as a substrate by mammalian peroxidases during steady-state catalysis. Reversal of the order of peroxidase and H2O2 addition demonstrated a modest brief decrement in NO concentration following addition of only the peroxidase (presumably due to heme Fe(III)-NO complex formation) and then a similar significant acceleration in NO consumption upon subsequent addition of H2O2 (Fig. 1 B, only data for MPO shown).Figure 6Effect of NO concentration on MPO compound II formation, duration, and decay. An anaerobic solution containing sodium phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.0) supplemented with H2O2 (20 μm) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of buffer containing 0.86 μm of MPO-Fe(III) and differing concentrations of NO at 25 °C. MPO compound II formation, duration, and decay were monitored as a function of time by observing spectral changes at 455 nm. The final concentration of NO in mixtures is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 1Consumption of NO by mammalian peroxidases.

MPO was initially used as a model peroxidase because of its abundance at sites of leukocyte recruitment and activation during inflammation (30Klebanoff S.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and its well known use of the abundant halide Cl− as substrate (32Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Lampert M.B. Weiss S.J. Blood. 1983; 62: 645-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the rates of NO consumption mediated by MPO in the presenceversus absence of plasma levels of Cl− were virtually indistinguishable (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the fact that MPO is far from saturated at plasma levels of Cl− (52van Dalen C.J. Whitehouse M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). NO consumption by MPO was to a large extent prevented by preincubation of the enzyme solution with sodium azide, a peroxidase inhibitor (59Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1861-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Similar results were observed with other mammalian peroxidases (data not shown). Leukocyte activation in vivo is accompanied by MPO secretion and O⨪2 formation during the respiratory burst. Since O⨪2 interacts so rapidly with NO (60Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar), it was unclear whether peroxidases could accelerate NO consumption under these conditions. Addition of NO to buffer containing a cell-free O⨪2-generating system resulted in accelerated removal of NO, as detected by continuous monitoring with a NO-selective electrode (Fig.3). Subsequent addition of catalytic amounts of a mammalian peroxidase (data for MPO shown) resulted in the enhanced removal of NO from the buffer (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed with other mammalian peroxidases (data not shown). Finally, addition of MPO to media containing plasma levels of Cl−(100 mm), NO, and a O⨪2-generating system resulted in a marked acceleration in the rate of NO consumption above and beyond that observed with only the O⨪2-generating system (Fig. 3). Thus, peroxidases like MPO can effectively act as catalysts for NO consumption under conditions likely to be physiological in the phagolysosome or at sites of inflammation. As previously reported, addition of H2O2 to MPO-Fe(III) in the absence of co-substrates leads to the accumulation of compound II via rapid initial formation of compound I, and subsequent spontaneous one e− heme reduction (45Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 48Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. Van Wart H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5666-5670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compound II, the rate-limiting intermediate in the peroxidase cycle, possesses a characteristic Soret absorbance peak at 455 nm that is easily distinguished from the Soret absorbance peaks of MPO-Fe(III) and the MPO-Fe(III)-NO, as shown in Fig. 4. MPO compound II is unstable and converted gradually to the ground state, MPO-Fe(III), within minutes of initiating the reaction. To examine the kinetics of interaction between NO and MPO compounds I and II, we utilized stopped-flow spectroscopy.

By tracking disclinations during annealing with time-lapse atomic force microscopy, we observe a dominant mechanism of disclination annihilation involving three or four disclinations (quadrupoles). Pairwise disclination annihilation events are suppressed as a result of the topological constraints in this system. The kinetic scaling laws with exponents observed here are consistent with topologically allowed annihilation events involving multiple disclinations.

We visualized the phosphorylation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ErbB1 (ErbB1-GFP) receptors in cells focally stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) covalently attached to beads. This was achieved by quantitative imaging of protein reaction states in cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with global analysis of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) data. The rapid and extensive propagation of receptor phosphorylation over the entire cell after focal stimulation demonstrates a signaling wave at the plasma membrane resulting in full activation of all receptors.

Although succession is a fundamental concept in ecology, it is poorly understood in the context of aquatic environments. The prevailing view is that lakes become more enriched in nutrients as they age, leading to increased biological production. Here we report the opposite pattern of lake development, observed from the water chemistry of lakes that formed at various times within the past 10,000 years during glacial retreat at Glacier Bay, Alaska. The lakes have grown more dilute and acidic with time, accumulated dissolved organic carbon and undergone a transient rise in nitrogen concentration, all as a result of successional changes in surrounding vegetation and soils. Similar trends are evident from fossil diatom stratigraphy of lake sediment cores. These results demonstrate a tight hydrologic coupling between terrestrial and aquatic environments during the colonization of newly deglaciated landscapes, and provide a conceptual basis for mechanisms of primary succession in boreal lake ecosystems."

When female embryonic stem cells with two active X chromosomes were used as donors, random X inactivation was seen in the TE and embryo. These results demonstrate that epigenetic marks can be removed and reestablished on either X chromosome during cloning. Our results also suggest that the epigenetic marks imposed on the X chromosomes during gametogenesis, responsible for normal imprinted X inactivation in the TE, are functionally equivalent to the marks imposed on the chromosomes during somatic X inactivation."

In this process, phospholipase A2 catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, while COX catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into PGs (2Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W.

De Witt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with newly developed selective COX-2 inhibitors also have shown suppression of PG production and acute tissue inflammation (12Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. McGarity K.L. Bremer M.E. Isakson P.C.

Therefore, COX-2 may play a critical role in the development of local and systemic inflammatory responses.The different responses of the genes encoding COX-1 and COX-2 reflect, at least in part, differences in the regulatory elements in the 5′ flanking regions of these two genes. In the COX-2 gene (Fig.1), promoter elements for nuclear factor κB (NFκB, −223/−214) and nuclear factor interleukin-6 (NF-IL6, −132/−124) and a cAMP-responsive element (CRE, −59/−53) have been found to be important in regulating transcription (14Inoue H.

However, the relative contribution of the different promoter elements in mediating COX-2 transcription in macrophages has not been completely elucidated.In the present work, we have investigated the regulation ofCOX-2 gene expression in endotoxin-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages and THP-1 monocytic cells. Our data show that there is transcriptional redundancy among the NFκB, NF-IL6, and CRE promoter sites although maximal transcriptional activity requires cooperation among these elements. Also in a redundant manner, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways are capable of inducing COX-2 transcription through NFκB, NF-IL6, or CRE promoter sites. These results are important for understanding why COX-2 expression is up-regulated during macrophage activation.DISCUSSIONCOX-2 expression and PG synthesis in macrophages may be important in eliciting local and systemic inflammatory responses. When exposed to LPS and other pro-inflammatory stimuli, macrophages secrete PGs as a result of increased arachidonic acid release and COX-2 enzyme activity. Increased COX-2 activity may result from increased enzymatic activity or mRNA stability (26Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Sheng H. Shao J. Dixon D.A. Williams C.S. Prescott S.M. Du Bois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but in endotoxin-treated macrophages it results mainly from augmented rates of transcription of theCOX-2 gene. Therefore, the signaling mechanisms governingCOX-2 gene transcription could be a potential target of strategies designed to suppress local or systemic inflammatory responses. However, the inter-relation between signaling pathways and promoter sites in the COX-2 gene and the individual role of these cis-acting elements in mediating transcription are not well understood.Our data show that in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and THP-1 monocytic cells there is redundancy in the transcriptional activation of theCOX-2 gene both at the extranuclear signaling level and at the promoter level. Overexpression of dominant negative mutants for different MAPKs and PKC isoforms do not abrogate the effects of LPS onCOX-2 transcription indicating that there is redundancy at the signaling level. Mutation of a single NFκB, NF-IL6, or CRE site also does not abrogate the LPS effect indicating that there is redundancy at the promoter level. Therefore, transcriptional repression of COX-2 could not be accomplished by targeting a single signaling pathway or transcription factor/promoter element.Our results indicate that LPS induces COX-2 expression in cells of macrophage/monocytic cell lineage through the binding of transcription factors to the NFκB, NF-IL6, and CRE promoter elements situated within the first 327 base pairs in the 5′ flanking region. The participation of at least two of these cis-acting elements is necessary to achieve maximal induction of transcription. We also show that there is lack of specificity in the signaling pathways that mediateCOX-2 gene expression through each of these promoter sites. LPS can activate different MAPK pathways to induce COX-2 gene transcription: through NFκB via ERK-2, p38, and JNK pathways, through NF-IL6 via a p38 pathway, and through CRE via ERK-2 and JNK pathways. Moreover, PKC-ζ signaling seems to mediate transcription after LPS treatment through all three promoter sites. Therefore, individual signaling pathways, such as ERK-2, p38, JNK, or PKC-ζ, appear to be sufficient to mediate COX-2 gene transcription by virtue of their ability to recruit transcription factors to at least two promoter sites.Previous studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of NFκB activation decreases COX-2 expression in macrophage-like cells (19Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and COX-2 transcription through the NFκB promoter site also has been demonstrated (20Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The role of other cis-acting elements and their cooperation in promoting transcription was not evaluated in those studies. Other investigators have attempted to characterize the signaling pathways leading to COX-2 transcriptional activation. In one study, MAPK signaling was found to be necessary in LPS-mediated activation of the COX-2 NFκB promoter site (19Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem.

Cell. 1999; 10: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A recent report on the transcriptional regulation of the murine COX-2 gene in LPS-treated RAW 246.7 cells showed that two NF-IL6 sites are necessary for maximal induction of transcription and that without a functional CRE site transcription cannot occur (21Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of a MEKK-1/JNK pathway was necessary for induction of murine COX-2 transcription. This study differs from ours in that specificity rather than redundancy, both at the signaling pathway and promoter levels, characterizes LPS-mediated induction of COX-2 transcription. The differences in results may reflect differences in transcriptional regulation between the murine promoter, studied by these investigators, and the human promoter, utilized in our work.In summary, we have presented experiments with mutant COX-2 promoter reporter constructs and with expression vectors for wild type or dominant negative mutants for MAPK and PKC isoforms. These experiments demonstrate the redundant rather than specific character of the cell signaling leading to COX-2 gene transcription in endotoxin-treated macrophage/monocytic cells. Redundancy in the signaling pathways and promoter elements regulating COX-2 gene transcription may constitute an important mechanism ensuring increased levels of COX-2 in macrophage/monocytic cells during inflammation. Cyclooxygenase (COX)1can be a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), lipid mediators that contribute to the development of inflammatory responses (1Davies P. Bailey P.J. Goldenberg M.M. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 335-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In this process, phospholipase A2 catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, while COX catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into PGs (2Marnett L.J. Rowlinson S.W. Goodwin D.C. Kalgutkar A.S. Lanzo C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22903-22906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 3Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, the product of two different genes. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues and may be responsible for housekeeping functions (4Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In contrast, COX-2 is not detectable in most normal tissues or resting immune cells, but its expression can be induced by endotoxin, cytokines, growth factors, and carcinogens (5Hempel S.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Kelley D.J. Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H.

Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Macrophage activation is accompanied by a significant increase in COX-2 expression, whereas levels of COX-1 remain unchanged (7Riese J. Hoff T. Nordhoff A. De Witt D.L. Resch K. Kaever V. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Nanayama T. Hara S. Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Prostaglandins. 1995; 49: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In vivo macrophage COX-2 immunoreactivity is a characteristic finding in the synovium of patients with osteoarthritis as well as in other forms of inflammation, whereas COX-1 expression typically remains unchanged (9Sano H. Hla T. Maier J.A. Crofford L.J. Case J.P. Maciag T. Wilder R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 10Vane J.R. Mitchell J.A. Appleton I. Tomlinson A. Bishop-Bailey D. Croxtall J. Willoughby D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit PG synthesis through the inhibition of COX activity, which confers on them anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties (11Meade E.A. Smith W.L. De Witt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with newly developed selective COX-2 inhibitors also have shown suppression of PG production and acute tissue inflammation (12Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. McGarity K.L. Bremer M.E. Isakson P.C. Gregory S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Moreover, homozygous deletion of the Cox-2 gene in mice led to a striking mitigation of endotoxin-induced hepatocellular cytotoxicity (13Dinchuk J.E. Car B.D. Focht R.J. Johnston J.J. Jaffee B.D. Covington M.B. Contel N.R. Eng V.M. Collins R.J. Czerniak P.M. et al.Nature. 1995; 378: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Therefore, COX-2 may play a critical role in the development of local and systemic inflammatory responses. The different responses of the genes encoding COX-1 and COX-2 reflect, at least in part, differences in the regulatory elements in the 5′ flanking regions of these two genes. In the COX-2 gene (Fig.1), promoter elements for nuclear factor κB (NFκB, −223/−214) and nuclear factor interleukin-6 (NF-IL6, −132/−124) and a cAMP-responsive element (CRE, −59/−53) have been found to be important in regulating transcription (14Inoue H. Nanayama T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The CRE appears to be the crucial site in epithelial cells (17Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. De Vito B. Weksler B.B. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), whereas other promoter elements, such as those for NFκB and NF-IL6, seem to have a role in regulating COX-2 gene transcription in macrophage-like cells (19Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, the relative contribution of the different promoter elements in mediating COX-2 transcription in macrophages has not been completely elucidated. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation ofCOX-2 gene expression in endotoxin-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages and THP-1 monocytic cells. Our data show that there is transcriptional redundancy among the NFκB, NF-IL6, and CRE promoter sites although maximal transcriptional activity requires cooperation among these elements. Also in a redundant manner, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways are capable of inducing COX-2 transcription through NFκB, NF-IL6, or CRE promoter sites. These results are important for understanding why COX-2 expression is up-regulated during macrophage activation. DISCUSSIONCOX-2 expression and PG synthesis in macrophages may be important in eliciting local and systemic inflammatory responses. When exposed to LPS and other pro-inflammatory stimuli, macrophages secrete PGs as a result of increased arachidonic acid release and COX-2 enzyme activity. Increased COX-2 activity may result from increased enzymatic activity or mRNA stability (26Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Sheng H. Shao J. Dixon D.A. Williams C.S. Prescott S.M. Du Bois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but in endotoxin-treated macrophages it results mainly from augmented rates of transcription of theCOX-2 gene. Therefore, the signaling mechanisms governingCOX-2 gene transcription could be a potential target of strategies designed to suppress local or systemic inflammatory responses. However, the inter-relation between signaling pathways and promoter sites in the COX-2 gene and the individual role of these cis-acting elements in mediating transcription are not well understood.Our data show that in both RAW 264.7 macrophages and THP-1 monocytic cells there is redundancy in the transcriptional activation of theCOX-2 gene both at the extranuclear signaling level and at the promoter level. Overexpression of dominant negative mutants for different MAPKs and PKC isoforms do not abrogate the effects of LPS onCOX-2 transcription indicating that there is redundancy at the signaling level. Mutation of a single NFκB, NF-IL6, or CRE site also does not abrogate the LPS effect indicating that there is redundancy at the promoter level. Therefore, transcriptional repression of COX-2 could not be accomplished by targeting a single signaling pathway or transcription factor/promoter element.Our results indicate that LPS induces COX-2 expression in cells of macrophage/monocytic cell lineage through the binding of transcription factors to the NFκB, NF-IL6, and CRE promoter elements situated within the first 327 base pairs in the 5′ flanking region. The participation of at least two of these cis-acting elements is necessary to achieve maximal induction of transcription. We also show that there is lack of specificity in the signaling pathways that mediateCOX-2 gene expression through each of these promoter sites. LPS can activate different MAPK pathways to induce COX-2 gene transcription: through NFκB via ERK-2, p38, and JNK pathways, through NF-IL6 via a p38 pathway, and through CRE via ERK-2 and JNK pathways. Moreover, PKC-ζ signaling seems to mediate transcription after LPS treatment through all three promoter sites. Therefore, individual signaling pathways, such as ERK-2, p38, JNK, or PKC-ζ, appear to be sufficient to mediate COX-2 gene transcription by virtue of their ability to recruit transcription factors to at least two promoter sites.Previous studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of NFκB activation decreases COX-2 expression in macrophage-like cells (19Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and COX-2 transcription through the NFκB promoter site also has been demonstrated (20Inoue H. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The role of other cis-acting elements and their cooperation in promoting transcription was not evaluated in those studies. Other investigators have attempted to characterize the signaling pathways leading to COX-2 transcriptional activation. In one study, MAPK signaling was found to be necessary in LPS-mediated activation of the COX-2 NFκB promoter site (19Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem.

In mammalian cells, iron derepresses ferritin mRNA translation, whereas it induces ferritin gene transcription in plants. Promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis analysis, combined with gel shift assays, has allowed identification of a new cis-regulatory element in the promoter region of the ZmFer1 maize ferritin gene. This Iron-Dependent Regulatory Sequence (IDRS) is responsible for transcriptional repression of ZmFer1 under low iron supply conditions. The IDRS is specific to the ZmFer1iron-dependent regulation and does not mediate the antioxidant response that we have previously reported (Savino et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 33319–33326). In addition, we have cloned AtFer1, the Arabidopsis thaliana ZmFer1 orthologue. The IDRS element is conserved in theAtFer1 promoter region and is functional as shown by transient assay in A. thaliana cells and stable transformation in A. thaliana transgenic plants, demonstrating its ubiquity in the plant kingdom.AF229850 In eukaryotic cells, ferritin synthesis is controlled by the intracellular iron status.

Therefore, metal homeostasis requires regulatory circuits to coordinate metal uptake and storage (1Winge D.R. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Such mechanisms involve metal sensing proteins that transduce the signal within the cell to modulate gene expression. These proteins often act as regulatory factors, binding RNA or DNA cis-elements to promote or repress gene expression (1Winge D.R. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Among these metals, iron is one of the most abundant and is highly reactive as a pro-oxidant in Haber-Weiss reactions to generate free radicals (3Halliwel B. Gutteridge J. Atlas of Science: Biochemistry. 1988; : 48-51Google Scholar). Furthermore, aerobic organisms have to overcome iron insolubility and then maintain iron in a bioavailable form (4Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Plants, due to their immobility, need to tightly regulate iron homeostasis to prevent both iron toxicity or deficiency (5Guerinot M.L. Yi Y. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Recently, genes involved in iron uptake in plants have been cloned: fro2, encoding a root ferric reductase (6Robinson N.J. Procter C.M. Connolly E.L. Guerinot M.L. Nature. 1999; 397: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), andirt1, encoding a putative ferrous transporter (7Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Inside the plant cell, a particular class of plastid-localized proteins, the ferritins, are able to store iron in a safe and bioavailable form (8Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. Grignon N. Vansuyt G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ferritins are ubiquitous proteins found in bacteria, animals, and plants, and, upon assembly, able to store up to 4500 iron atoms (4Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Ferritin gene regulation has become a model to study iron-regulated expression both in the plant and animal kingdoms. In animal cells, ferritin synthesis is mainly regulated at the translational level in response to iron (2Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), whereas in plants transcriptional control has been demonstrated in soybean cells (9Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In maize, iron overload induces accumulation of both ferritin mRNA and protein subunits (10Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant Mol.

Two nuclear maize ferritin genes have been characterized and namedZmFer1 and 2 (12Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The ZmFer2 gene is regulated by a cellular pathway involving the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA),1 whereasZmFer1 is regulated by an ABA-independent pathway (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using derooted plantlets and maize cell suspension cultures, we have shown that this gene is regulated by both iron and redox signals (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, ZmFer1 mRNA increase of abundance is induced by hydrogen peroxide treatments, and the iron-induced accumulation of this transcript is abolished in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant agent. The accumulation of ZmFer1mRNA induced by both H2O2 and iron treatments were inhibited in the presence of the Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of dephosphorylation events in the transduction pathways regulating ZmFer1 gene expression. To further characterize the regulation of the ZmFer1 maize ferritin gene, we have developed a transient expression assay in maize cells. Using this system, a 2.2-kbp DNA fragment of the ZmFer1 gene was shown to be sufficient to regulate reporter gene expression in response to iron, with the same characteristics as observed for the endogenousZmFer1 gene regulation (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this paper, this transient expression assay was used to identify an Iron-Dependent Regulatory Sequence (IDRS) essential for the regulation by iron of the maize ZmFer1 and the Arabidopsis thaliana AtFer1 ferritin genes. Stable transformation of A. thaliana plants was performed to demonstrate the functionality of this element in planta. Maize BMS (Black Mexican Sweet) cells were cultivated as described (13Savino G.

The pRD109 and pAHC18 plasmids were used as internal standards as described previously (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol.

The DNA probe was end-labeled, and gel shift assays were performed as described in Villain et al. (16Villain P. Mache R. Zhou D.X. J. Biol.

Genetics. 1990; 126: 713-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive bacteriophage DNA was prepared by polyethylene glycol precipitation (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the genomic DNA fragment was subcloned in pUC18 and sequenced. All the constructs for transient expression assays were made using standard recombinant DNA techniques (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and sequenced. Oligonucleotides are written in the 5′ to 3′ orientation. An NsiI/SacI fragment containing 1600 bp of ZmFer1 promoter was subcloned intoPstI/SacI-digested pRD109 to obtain p1600.EcoRI digestion of p1600 and religation gave pPL. TheHindIII/NcoI fragment of p1600 was introduced in pBI320X (20Lagarde D. Basset M. Lepetit M. Conejero G. Gaymard F. Astruc S. Grignon C. Plant J. 1996; 9: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) to obtain p495. p124, p64, and p27 were obtained by subcloning corresponding PCR fragments restricted with ClaI and EcoRI into p495 previously cut with ClaI andEcoRI. Primers used to generate PCR fragments were primers 1 (cccatcgatggacgcctccaccatccag) and 4 (gaattctgcgcgtgggtagtgg) for p124, primers 2 (cccatcgatgctccctccgccttctcc) and 4 for p67, and primers 3 (cccatcgatgtctccaatctgctaccccc) and 4 for p27. To obtain p124luc theClaI/NcoI fragment from p124 plasmid was subcloned in pSLluc+de. pSLluc+de was constructed by removing theEcoRI site from the plasmid obtained after subcloning the luc+ coding sequence from the pSP-luc+ vector (Promega) in theEcoRI/NcoI-digested p59Luc (21Eyal Y. Curie C. McCormick S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to obtain pmTC1, pmTC2, and pmTC12, using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) and primers 5 (atatttctggatggccatggcgtccatcgatac) and 6 (gcggagggagcgcgccatgggctcgtggcggggc). Mutagenesis of the GC, SHS, G box, and CAAT box sequences were made using the two-step PCR method as described previously (22Van Wuytswinkel O. Savino G. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The primers used were 1, 7 (ggtagcagattggagacccatggacggctgagatttggag), 8 (ctccaaatctcagccgtccatgggtctccaatctgctacc), and 4 to generate pmGb; primers 1, 9 (gattggagacacgtggaccatggagatttggagaaggcgg), 10 (ccgccttctccaaatctccatggtccacgtgtctccaatc), and 4 to generate pmSHS; primers 1, 11 (gagcgcgtggagggctcgccatgggcgggggactggggag), 12 (ctccccagtcccccgcccatggcgagccctccacgcgctc), and 4 to generate pmGC; and primers 1, 13 (gcgtgggggtagcaccatggagacacgtggacggctgagat), 14 (atctcagccgtccacgtgtctccatggtgctacccccacgc), and 4 to generate pmCAATb. All mutagenized promoter fragments were subcloned in theClaI/EcoRI-digested p124luc. AtFer1PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI and NcoI and subcloned in the pBI320X, using primers 17 (ccggaattcggatgtagcacgaggccgccac) and 15 (cgtggccatggttggaaaatgtagaagagg) for pIDRSWT; primers 18 (ccggaattcggatgtagcacgaggggatcccacggcccctacatc) and 15 for pmIDRS-1; and primers 16 (ccggaattctttcatatccaccctccacg) and 15 for pΔIDRS. To generate pmIDRS-2, DNA fragment amplified with primers 19 (ccggaattccattggatgtagccatgggggatcccacggc) and 15, using pmIDRS-1 as template, was subcloned in theEcoRI/BamHI-digested pmIDRS-1. For the gain-of-function constructs, the minimum 35S promoter was amplified using primers (catcgatgacgtaagggatgacgcacaatcc and cgaattctcctctccaaatgaaatgaacttcct) with p35Sluc as template and subcloned in the ClaI/EcoRI-digested p124luc to give pGFluc. Oligonucleotides (cgacccgcccgccacgagccctccacgcgctat and cgatagcgcgtggagggctcgtggcgggcgggt) were annealed and concatemerized. Monomer, dimers, and trimers were selected and subcloned in theClaI-digested pGFluc. An AtFer1 1400-bp promoter region was amplified using primers 15 and 20 (ccggaattcccatatctctcgagaaaggatagag), digested with EcoRI and NcoI, and subcloned in pBI320X (pAt1400IDRS). To generate the pAt1400m*IDRS, a two-step PCR approach was performed as described (22Van Wuytswinkel O. Savino G. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using primers 15, 20, 21 (ggggccgtgggatcccccatggctacatccaatgggatag), and 22 (ccggaattccattggatgtagccatgggggatcccacggc), and the PCR fragment was subcloned in pBI320X. The constructs At1400IDRS and At1400 m*IDRS were excised by XhoI-SacI digestion and subcloned into a pMOG 402 binary vector. The resulting plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefasciens MP90 strain (23Höfgen R. Willmitzer L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). These bacteria have been used to transform A. thaliana using the flower dip method (24Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic seeds were surface-sterilized and spread onto Petri dishes containing MS/2 solid medium (14Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) and 50 μm iron-EDTA. Germination was synchronized by placing dishes for 2 days at 4 °C. Subsequently, plants were transferred in a growth chamber under the following conditions: 21 °C/18 °C, 16 h/8 h, day/night, 150 μE.s−1.m−2. After 10 days, plantlets were transferred onto iron-free MS/2 solid medium for 4 days. Then, the aerial parts of the plants were excised and incubated for 24 h onto MS/2 liquid medium containing 500 μm iron-citrate or no iron. Protein extracts were prepared, and reporter gene activity was measured as previously described (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). In a previous study (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we have set up a transient expression assay, using particle bombardment-mediated transformation, to studyZmFer1 maize ferritin gene regulation. This system enabled us to show that a 2.2-kbp fragment of the ZmFer1 gene fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene mimics the regulation of the endogenous gene. An 8-fold increase of GUS activity was measured in response to iron overload (13, see pSL5 in Fig.1). Furthermore, iron-induced expression of the ZmFer1-GUS fusion gene was inhibited by the antioxidant agent NAC, and the Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor OA. These results are in agreement with data obtained by Northern blot analysis of the ZmFer1 gene expression. The ZmFer1-GUS fusion pSL5 contained 1.6 kbp of the promoter sequence and the region spanning from exon 1 to 3 (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To localize cis-acting elements involved in the iron-dependent regulation of theZmFer1 ferritin gene, we have performed a deletion analysis of the 2.2-kbp ZmFer1 fragment mentioned above. Intron sequences were required to observe a significant level of expression of the construct in maize cells (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This was in agreement with our general knowledge that introns are essential for the expression of many genes from monocotyledonous plants (26Vasil V. Clancy M. Ferl R.J. Vasil I.K. Hannah L.C. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These intron sequences act mainly by stimulating the basal level of gene expression. However, it could not be ruled out that intron sequences present in the pSL5 construct play a role in the iron-dependent regulation of the fusion gene. To clarify this point, ZmFer1 intron sequences were substituted by an intronic region of the rice actin gene, which has been shown to strongly enhance reporter gene expression when present in a chimeric construct (27McElroy D. Blowers A.D. Jenes B. Wu R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that this rice actin gene DNA fragment did not contain iron-regulated sequences (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This switch from maize ferritin to rice actin intron sequences results in a strong increase of expression of the construct in the absence of iron, although the promoter sequence was the same (pSL5 and p1600 in Fig. 1). Iron treatment of the cells lead to a 4.5-fold increase in GUS activity (Fig. 1, p1600). This slight decrease from 8- to 4.5-fold of the induction factor appears to be a result of the intron sequence replacement. This phenomenon could be linked, in part, to the strong stimulation of gene expression in the presence of the rice intron sequences. However, the expression of the construct remains inducible by iron overload, suggesting that essential sequences for this regulation are not located within introns. The p1600 construct still contains 61 bp of the ZmFer1 5′-untranslated region. Deletion of this sequence up to the previously identified transcription initiation sites (12Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) did not affect the pattern of expression of the construct (data not shown). Therefore, a promoter deletion analysis was performed, starting from the p1600 fusion gene containing 1600 bp ofZmFer1 promoter sequence (Fig. 1). Reduction of the promoter length from 1600 to 495 or 124 bp results in a decrease from 4.5- to 2.5-fold induction in response to iron (Fig. 1). Such a decrease could be linked to the presence of regulatory sequences participating to the iron-dependent regulation of ZmFer1 gene. These deletions had no effect on the level of expression in low iron conditions and demonstrate that essential iron response elements are localized upstream of −124 bp. The reduction of promoter size from −124 bp to −64 bp lead to a more drastic effect. The expression level in low iron conditions increased to the iron-induced level of the −124-bp construct, and stimulation by iron was abolished. A further deletion from −64 to −27 bp did not change this pattern of expression. The promoterless construct (pPL) does not support reporter gene expression. Therefore, the 60-bp region spanning from −124 to −64 appears to contain essential regulatory sequences for iron-induced expression of ZmFer1 maize ferritin gene. Furthermore, our results suggest that this region would be involved in the repression ofZmFer1 expression in low iron conditions. To further analyze and localize the cis-acting elements implicated in this regulation, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was used. This approach was performed on a −124-bp ZmFer1promoter, which represents the minimal promoter to maintain an iron-induced expression of the chimeric gene. This fragment was fused to rice actin introns as mentioned above and to the luciferase reporter gene. A 3.3-fold increase in luciferase activity was measured in response to iron treatment, when this construct was analyzed by transient expression in BMS cells (Fig.2 B, p124Luc). This confirms the results obtained with the GUS gene as reporter (Fig.1). Within the 124 bp of ZmFer1 promoter, some putative regulatory sequences were identified by sequence comparison for preferential mutagenesis as follows. A sequence named TC2 was found only in the ZmFer1 promoter, at positions −72 to −66, and not in ZmFer2 promoter (Fig. 2 A). These two promoters share significant sequence identity in their proximal region (12Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but ZmFer2 is regulated by an ABA pathway and not by the iron-dependent pathway studied in this paper (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TC2 sequence mutagenesis led to a 3.3-fold increase of luciferase activity under low iron conditions, and iron stimulation of expression was reduced to a 1.4-fold increase (Fig. 2 B, pmTC2). The ZmFer1 promoter region contains another sequence similar to the TC2 element, named TC1, localized at position −119 bp (Fig.2 A). TC1 sequence mutation alone did not affect the iron-induced regulation of the reporter gene (Fig. 2 B,pmTC1). However, a double mutation of TC1 and TC2 resulted in enhanced basal expression of Luc and absence of induction by iron (Fig. 2 B, pmTC12). These data suggests that, in the absence of a functional TC2 element, the TC1 sequence could partially substitute for TC2, whereas this sequence does not play a major role in the wild type ZmFer1 promoter. Sequences flanking the TC2 sequence were also analyzed to define more precisely this putative cis-acting element. The region upstream of TC2 was of particular interest, because mutations in the sequence called GC (Fig. 2 A) lead to a pattern very similar to the TC2 mutant (Fig. 2 B, pmGC). This result extends the regulatory region to both TC2 and GC sequences. This DNA fragment of 16 bp, which appears to be essential for the ZmFer1 ferritin gene regulation by iron, was named Iron-Dependent Regulatory Sequence (IDRS). The ZmFer1 promoter region contains a CAAT box sequence in position −23 (Fig. 2 A). This element has been described as a general cis-acting element, but can also be involved in specific responses. Indeed, ferritin H gene transcriptional control by heme in Friend Leukemia cells is mediated by a CCAAT element (28Faniello M.C. Bevilacqua M.A. Condorelli G. Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Avvedimento V.E. Cimino F. Costanzo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7623-7626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and this sequence plays also a role in the transactivation of genes in response to antioxidant treatment in a human colorectal cancer cell line (29Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Dransfield D.T. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30056-30361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutation of the CAAT box sequence present in theZmFer1 promoter did not affect the expression pattern of the fusion gene in low or high iron conditions (Fig. 2). The Gbox element (CACGTG) (Fig. 2 A) is a common regulatory sequence in plant gene promoters involved in many environmental stress responses (30Menkens A.E. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the ZmFer1 promoter Gbox revealed this sequence not to be required for the iron-dependent regulation of the ZmFer1 maize ferritin gene. Transcriptional regulation of soybean ferritin gene has been clearly demonstrated by nuclear run-on experiments (9Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The corresponding gene has been cloned (31Proudhon D. Wei J. Briat J.F. Theil E.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and we have compared the promoter sequences of this soybean ferritin gene and ZmFer1. Interestingly, a conserved region (Fig. 2 A, SHS), distinct from the IDRS element, was found in the proximal region of these two promoters. However, mutational analysis of this sequence in a transient expression assay revealed that this sequence is not involved inZmFer1 gene regulation by iron in maize cells (Fig.2 B, pmSHS). By a combined approach of promoter deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, we have, therefore, been able to localize an essential region for ZmFer1 regulation by iron, which we have named IDRS. We have previously shown, by Northern blot experiments and transient expression in maize cells, that the iron-induced expression of ZmFer1 gene is inhibited by NAC or OA (13Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the presence of NAC, the pSL5ZmFer1-GUS fusion expression was strongly reduced in both untreated and iron-treated cells, but an increase of GUS activity was still induced by iron. Such results suggested that antioxidant agents could affect the level of expression of this gene, rather than the iron-dependent activation of ZmFer1 gene. Therefore, it was interesting to determine whether these effects are mediated by the IDRS element. To address that question, p124Luc, pmTC12, and pmGC (see Fig. 2 A) construct expression was analyzed by transient expression in the presence of NAC or OA (data not shown). These experiments revealed that OA and NAC inhibitions ofZmFer1 gene expression are not mediated by the IDRS, which appears to be specific to the iron response. Regulatory elements, distinct from the IDRS, are therefore required to mediate the antioxidant effect at the promoter level. To further characterize the IDRS element, gain-of-function experiments were performed to establish whether this sequence is sufficient to confer iron-dependent regulation to a minimal promoter. A construct containing a −80-bp 35S CAMV promoter sequence fused to rice actin intron sequences, and the luciferase reporter gene was prepared. The IDRS element was cloned upstream of this construct, conserving the distance between this regulatory sequence and the TATA box as in ZmFer1 gene. The IDRS fragment corresponds to the ZmFer1 promoter region from −88 to −62 bp and was cloned in 1, 2, or 3 copies. For each construct, a significant level of expression was measured, but no iron-dependent regulation was observed (data not shown). Increasing the fragment length to −124 to −62 of theZmFer1 promoter led to the same result. These data suggest that some additional elements are required to establish the iron regulation or that a specific chromatin context is essential and not reproduced in the fusion gene. To determine if the IDRS element could effectively bind nuclear transcription factors, gel shift experiments were performed. For this purpose, a double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide corresponding to the IDRS was used (Fig. 3 B). This probe was incubated in the presence of nuclear extracts prepared from maize cells treated or not by iron (Fig. 3 A). In both low or high iron conditions, only one complex was observed (Fig.3 A). The signal was more abundant after iron treatment, but a signal was also clearly detectable when iron level was low (Fig.3 A, lane 2). Addition of 1 μm iron citrate in the protein extract from iron-depleted cells, or β-mercaptoethanol as a reducer, or diamide as an oxidant in both extracts, had no effect on the observed complex (data not shown). To address the specificity of this complex, the reaction was performed in the presence of a range of molar excess of cold probe. A dose-dependent decrease of the binding was detected (Fig.3 A, lanes 4–7). In contrast, in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of nonspecific DNA, which did not contain IDRS, no effect on DNA binding was observed. Therefore, a nuclear protein, or protein complex, specifically binds the IDRS element in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis of the ZmFer1 promoter enabled us to establish that base changes within IDRS affect the chimeric ZmFer1-Luc"

It has been estimated that in 1997 there were 8 million new cases of active tuberculosis that were added to the already existing 16 million cases (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione R.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). In the same year, 2 million people died of tuberculosis as a result of an astonishing case fatality rate of 23–50% (1Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione R.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). This high death rate for a disease treatable with available antibiotics reflects the geographic superimposition of HIV1 and M. tuberculosis infection, and the logistical and economic burden of at least 6 months of multidrug therapy required to treat the disease. New drugs to shorten therapy and vaccine candidates to prevent M. tuberculosis infection are badly needed but will only come with a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms of M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. The cell envelope of M. tuberculosis is a highly complex array of distinctive lipids and glycolipids that has been intensely scrutinized as a potential effector in the interaction of M. tuberculosis with the human host (2Brennan P.J.

Investigation into the role of the cell envelope in virulence has been hampered by a lack of defined mutants of M. tuberculosis that fail to synthesize specific components of the cell surface. Recently, advances in the genetic manipulation of M. tuberculosis have allowed isolation of several mutants with defined cell envelope deficiencies and altered virulence (5Cox J.S. McNeil M.

M. tuberculosis synthesizes three classes of mycolic acids, very long chain α-alkyl, β-hydroxyl fatty acids (Fig. 1) in its cell envelope. These three classes of mycolic acids, α-, methoxy-, and ketomycolates, are modified with cyclopropane rings and methyl branches through the combined action of a large family of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyl transferases that modify double bonds in the meromycolate chain. The oxygenated mycolic acids contain either cis- or trans-cyclopropane rings at their proximal position. Whereas the putativecis-cyclopropane synthetase of the methoxymycolates has been identified (8Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The finding that pcaA was required for proximal cyclopropanation of the α-mycolate molecule was surprising because this function had been previously attributed tocmaA2, another cyclopropane synthetase of M. tuberculosis (3Barry III, C.E.

When introduced intoMycobacterium smegmatis on a multicopy plasmid,cmaA2 introduces cis-cyclopropane rings at the proximal position of the α-mycolate and the epoxymycolate, a position occupied by a double bond in the wild-type mycolates of this strain (11George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Despite this lack of substrate specificity in M. smegmatis, the function of cmaA2 in M. tuberculosis was thought to be proximal cyclopropanation of the α-mycolate molecule. Thus, the functions of pcaA andcmaA2 appeared to overlap. To define the function ofcmaA2 and to more completely explore the substrate specificity of the SAM-dependent methyl transferases ofM. tuberculosis, we have inactivated cmaA2 inM. tuberculosis and shown here that cmaA2 is thetrans-cyclopropane synthetase for both the methoxy- and ketomycolates. Wild-type M. tuberculosis Erdman is a stock of an animal-passaged strain that has been passaged once in vitro. M. tuberculosis strain Erdman was grown at 37 °C in 7H9 (broth) or 7H10 (agar) (Difco) media with OADC enrichment (Becton Dickinson), 0.5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80 (broth), and where appropriate, hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 50 μg/ml or kanamycin (Sigma) 20 μg/ml. TheM. tuberculosis Erdman strain with the ΔcmaA2::hyg allele is designated mc23120. For mycolic acid analysis, the wild-type strain was wild-type Erdman transformed with pmv306 hygro, an integrating vector that supplies a single copy hygromycin resistance gene. A ΔcmaA2::hyg allele was constructed by amplifying the flanking regions of the cmaA2 gene and inserting these fragments on either side of the hygromycin resistance gene. Specifically, a 619-bp flanking region of cmaA2 5′ to the start codon was amplified by PCR using primers omsg33 and omsg34, which contain XbaI and Asp7181 sites at their respective 5′-termini. A 646-bp flanking region 3′ to the stop codon was amplified using primers omsg35 and omsg36, which introduceHindIII and SpeI sites, respectively. The PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and inserted flanking the hygromycin cassette in pMSG284, a cloning vector containing a bacteriophage lambdacos site, a PacI site, and the hygromycin resistance gene flanked by resolvase sites. The final knockout construct (pMSG104) was packaged into phAE87 as previously described (6Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) to create phMSG104. PhMSG104 was used to transduce wild-typeM. tuberculosis to hygromycin resistance as previously described (6Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). For complementation, an M. tuberculosis Erdman cosmid library was screened for cmaA2-containing clones by PCR. Cosmid 3E4 was digested with XbaI/NcoI and a 2093-bp fragment containing Rv504c, cmaA2, and part of Rv502 was cloned into pmv206 hyg to create pMSG129. To create an inframe deletion of Rv504c, the 1522-bpBstEII/HindIII fragment, the 2279-bpBstEII/MluI fragment, and the 2203-bpMluI/HindIII fragment from pMSG129 were isolated after creating blunt ended BstEII ends with the Klenow fragment and were ligated in a three piece ligation to create pMSG133. Using this strategy, Rv504c was reduced to a truncated fusion protein of 81 amino acids. The reading frame of the fusion joint was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create single copy complementation constructs, the inserts of pMSG129 and pMSG133 were subcloned into pmv306kan, a site-specific integrating mycobacterial vector (12Lee M.H. Pascopella L. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3111-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) to create pMSG134 and pMSG136, respectively. M. smegmatisstrain mc2 155 was transformed with pMSG129 or vector control and total mycolic acids that were prepared as described below. Total mycolic acids were examined by proton NMR for the presence ofcis- or trans-cyclopropane residues. For coexpression of cmaA2 with mmaA1, themmaA1 open-reading frame with its putative promoter (13Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol.

For radiolabeled mycolic acids, 50 ml of mid-log phase liquid cultures were incubated with 50 μCi of [14C]acetate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 12–18 h. Total mycolic acid methyl esters were prepared as described previously (6Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and precipitated with toluene/acetonitrile. Analytical and preparative TLC was performed as previously described (6Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and radio TLCs were analyzed on a phosphorimager cassette (Molecular Dynamics). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 27 °C on either a Bruker DRX300 or DRX600 spectrometer in deuterochloroform (Cambridge Isotope Labs) and were referenced to the chloroform peak. Two-dimensional DQF-COSY and TOCSY NMR experiments were performed at 27 °C on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TXI probe. Typically, 256T 1 increments, each with 64 scans and 4000 data points over a spectral width of 5 kHz, were collected for each spectrum. The two-dimensional TOCSY experiment employed a 100 ms MLEV17 mixing sequence with a 9kHz spinlock field. Data processing and analysis was performed using Bruker XWINNMR software. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction was performed as described (14Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar) on the Multalin server. To define the function ofcmaA2 in M. tuberculosis, we sought to deletecmaA2 from the chromosome of the Erdman strain of M. tuberculosis by allelic exchange. We constructed a substrate for allelic exchange at cmaA2 by replacing the coding region with a hygromycin resistance gene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We packaged this knockout construct into a specialized transducing mycobacteriophage and infected wild-type M. tuberculosis as previously described.

Antibiotic-resistantM. tuberculosis clones were screened for allelic exchange atcmaA2 by Southern blotting. Three hygromycin-resistant clones contained the cmaA2 disruption (Fig.2 B), and one was designated mc23120 and used for further studies. To show that any phenotype observed for the cmaA2 mutant was attributable to the cmaA2 mutation, we complemented thecmaA2 mutant with cmaA2 in single copy under its own promoter. Inspection of the genomic sequence surroundingcmaA2 suggests that this gene is transcribed as the second gene in a two gene operon with Rv504c, a gene of unknown function (see Fig. 2 A for diagram). To complement thecmaA2 mutant with only cmaA2 under its native promoter, we reconstructed the cmaA2 operon with an inframe deletion in Rv504c and complemented the cmaA2mutant in single copy with this inframe deletion construct (pMSG136). The strains mc23120 and mc23120 (pmsg136) were analyzed in the subsequent experiments. As shown previously for pcaA (6Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) in the absence of a cyclopropane synthetase, the mycolic acids of M. tuberculosis would likely acquire an unsaturation. Therefore, we examined [14C]acetate-labeled mycolic acids of thecmaA2 mutant by two-dimensional argentation TLC. This TLC system has been described previously for the analysis of M. tuberculosis mycolic acids (6Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 11George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, the TLC plate is impregnated with silver nitrate leaving an unimpregnated strip along the left edge. The sample is developed first along the unimpregnated strip to separate the mycolates by polarity (Fig.3 A, arrow 1). The plate is then developed in the silver dimension (Fig. 3 A, arrow 2), separating the mycolates by degree of unsaturation. Silver nitrate retards the migration of unsaturated lipids relative to saturated or cyclopropanated lipids. Therefore, in the absence of a cyclopropane synthetase, an unsaturated mycolic acid retarded in the second dimension might appear. The TLC pattern of wild-type M. tuberculosis mycolates is shown in Fig. 3 A. The α-, methoxy-, and ketomycolates are labeled and correspond to the structures given in Fig. 1.cis- and trans-Cyclopropanated oxygenated mycolates are not distinguished in this TLC system. Inactivation ofcmaA2 alters the oxygenated mycolic acids. Specifically, two new mycolic acid species are visible in the cmaA2 mutant with the polarity of methoxy- and ketomycolates but which are retarded by silver impregnation (Fig. 3 B). The α-mycolate of thecmaA2 mutant is identical to that from wild-type in its mobility. To demonstrate that this phenotype is due specifically to the loss of cmaA2, we examined the mycolic acids from the complemented mutant. Wild-type mycolic acid patterns were restored in the complemented strain, demonstrating that the altered oxygenated mycolates are secondary to the cmaA2 mutation (Fig.3 C). Thus, inactivation of cmaA2 causes the accumulation of an unsaturated subpopulation of oxygenated mycolates, demonstrating that cmaA2 is required for the proper cyclopropanation of these lipids. Because the cmaA2 mutant has defects in a subpopulation of oxygenated mycolates, we reasoned thatcmaA2 may be involved in either the cis ortrans cyclopropanation of these molecules. To define the mycolic acid alteration in the cmaA2 mutant, we examined total mycolic acids from wild-type and the cmaA2 mutant by1H NMR, a technique that can clearly distinguish betweencis- and trans-cyclopropane residues. Thecis- and trans-cyclopropane proton resonances contributed by the three mycolic acid classes of wild-type M. tuberculosis are visible in the region of the NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 4 A, top panel (3Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In this expansion of the region from −0.4 ppm to 0.8 ppm, the characteristic resonances of cis-cyclopropane hydrogens (−0.33 ppm 2H, 0.56 ppm 1H) andtrans-cyclopropane hydrogens (0.15 ppm 2H, 0.45 ppm 1H) can be distinguished (Fig. 4 A, cis- andtrans-cyclopropane structures label corresponding peaks). The cis-cyclopropane proton peak at 0.67 ppm (1H) and thetrans-cyclopropane proton peak at 0.70 ppm are overlapping. In the wild-type Erdman strain used in this study, the ratio ofcis/trans cyclopropane hydrogens is 8:1, lower than in previously examined laboratory strains (13Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10041-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cmaA2 mutant lacks trans-cyclopropane rings, as evidenced by the complete absence of the complex mutiplets at 0.15 and 0.45 ppm in the spectrum shown in Fig. 4 B. Importantly, the cis-cyclopropane resonances are unaffected. The TLC data presented above demonstrates that the oxygenated mycolates in thecmaA2 mutant contain a subpopulation of unsaturated mycolates. Accordingly, the NMR spectrum of the total mycolates from the cmaA2 mutant contains a complex multiplet at 5.33 ppm that is not present in wild-type mycolates (Fig. 4, A andB), consistent with the presence of the unsaturated mycolates in the mutant strain. To further investigate the structure of the altered oxygenated mycolic acids in the cmaA2 mutant, we examined the mycolic acids of wild-type and mutant strains by two-dimensional COSY and TOCSY proton NMR spectroscopy. We first confirmed the previously reported structure of the cyclopropyl groups and their surrounding functional groups in total mycolic acids from wild type (Fig. 4 D). According to the two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum, the cis-cyclopropyl hydrogen resonances at −0.33, 0.56, and 0.67 ppm all belong to the coupled spin network, as do the trans-cyclopropyl hydrogen resonances at 0.15, 0.45, and 0.7 (Fig. 4 D). In addition, the trans-cyclopropyl group protons are adjacent to a methyl branch, as evidenced by a TOCSY cross-peak between thetrans-cyclopropane proton resonances and a doublet at 0.95 ppm (Fig. 4 D). Two-dimensional TOCSY spectroscopy of purified methoxymycolates from the cmaA2 mutant confirmed the lack oftrans-cyclopropyl protons demonstrated on the one-dimensional spectrum (Fig. 4 E). In addition, the unsaturated derivatives of the methoxymycolates seen on TLC contain predominantly trans double bonds, as evidenced by the TOCSY cross-peak between the vinyl proton resonance centered at 5.33 ppm and the methyl branch resonance at 0.95 ppm (Fig. 4 F and Ref. 8Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and a COSY cross-peak between the vinyl protons and a methine proton resonance at 2 ppm (data not shown). cis-Cyclopropanes andcis double bonds in mycolic acids are not adjacent to methyl branches. Accordingly, a weak resonance at 5.39 ppm does not show a TOCSY cross-peak with the methyl branch at 0.95 ppm, indicating a small amount of cis-unsaturated methoxymycolate (Fig.4 F, box at 0.95 ppm) in the cmaA2mutant methoxymycolates. The trans cyclopropanation defect in the cmaA2mutant was somewhat surprising as cmaA2 had previously been shown to catalyze the formation of cis-cyclopropane rings when overexpressed in M. smegmatis (11George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered whether the lack of trans-cyclopropane residues in the cmaA2 mutant could be an indirect effect on another, as yet undefined, cyclopropane synthetase. To investigate this possibility, we purified individual mycolate classes of thecmaA2 mutant by preparative TLC and examined them by proton NMR. Individual mycolate classes were examined for the presence of cyclopropane and methyl branch resonances known or likely to be added by the SAM-dependent methyl transferases of M. tuberculosis. The α-mycolate of the cmaA2 mutant was identical to wild-type α-mycolate (data not shown). As detailed above, the methoxymycolate of the cmaA2 mutant exhibited characteristic resonances of cis-cyclopropane protons, methyl branch protons adjacent to a methoxyl group (0.85 ppm, doublet), and the allylic methyl branch of the proximal trans double bond (0.95 ppm, doublet, Ref. 8Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The ketomycolate also contained all predicted resonances except for the trans-cyclopropane residues. Therefore, as assessed by proton NMR of individual mycolate classes from the cmaA2 mutant, the only cyclopropane or methyl branch missing from the mycolic acids of the mutant is thetrans-cyclopropane ring. The data presented above show that cmaA2 is the trans-cyclopropane synthetase of M. tuberculosis. To confirm thatcmaA2 produces cis-cyclopropane rings in M. smegmatis as had been previously reported (11George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we introducedcmaA2 into M. smegmatis on a multicopy plasmid under its own promoter. NMR examination of total mycolic acids from this strain revealed cis-cyclopropane proton resonances but not trans-cyclopropane proton resonances (data not shown). Mmas1 appears to catalyze the isomerization of the proximalcis double bond in oxygenated mycolates with the introduction of an allylic methyl branch (13Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10041-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As this isomerization is necessary for trans-cyclopropane formation, we investigated whether cmaA2 would produce trans-cyclopropane rings in M. smegmatis when introduced with mmaA1. When coexpressed with mmaA1, cmaA2 still catalyzed only cis-cyclopropane formation (data not shown). The mycolic acid methyl transferases of M. tuberculosisare a large family of highly homologous proteins that modify the mycolic acids of the cell wall with cyclopropane rings and methyl branches. Although cyclopropanated fatty acids are found in many bacteria (17Grogan D.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. (Washington, D. C.). 1997; 61: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), M. tuberculosis has evolved an elaborate enzymatic system of cyclopropane synthetases not found in any other bacteria. In this work we have shown that one of these transferases,cmaA2, is a trans-cyclopropane synthetase for oxygenated mycolates and that the other members of this gene family cannot compensate for the loss of cmaA2. All of the members of this gene family share striking amino acid sequence similarity. The sequence alignment of these proteins shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the individual cyclopropane synthetases share substantial amino acid identity over most of their length and that the sequence divergence between the members is limited to several distinct regions. Despite this striking sequence conservation, each member of this gene family appears to have a distinct catalytic function that cannot be compensated by another member of the family. Specifically, we have shown previously that inactivation of pcaA abolishes proximal cyclopropanation of the α-mycolate molecule despite intact cmaA2,mmaA2, and cmaA1 genes. It is interesting to note in the sequence alignment that CmaA2 contains an 8-amino acid segment at amino acids 152–160 that is not present in any of the other methyl transferases. As CmaA2 is the only trans-cyclopropane synthetase of the group, this eight amino acid segment may be important for catalysis or substrate binding. In addition, a phylogenetic tree derived from these sequences demonstrates that there are three distinct groups within this gene family that are consistent with the known or suspected functions of these proteins (Fig. 5). The first group contains MmaA3 and MmaA4, two proteins that introduce the methoxy group in the distal position of the methoxymycolates (7Dubnau E. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Laneelle M.A., Yu, K.

Zhu Y. Crane D.D. Barry III, C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The second group contains CmaA2, MmaA1, and UmaA1. MmaA1 is likely responsible for the isomerization of the proximal cis double bond to a trans double bond in the meromycolate chain with simultaneous introduction of an allylic methyl branch (13Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10041-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of MmaA1 in M. tuberculosis produced an excess of both trans unsaturated andtrans-cyclopropanated mycolic acids, MmaA1 action is presumably an early step in trans-cyclopropane synthesis. It is therefore logical that CmaA2 is within the same phylogenetic subfamily. UmaA1 has no known function at present. The last group contains PcaA, CmaA1, and MmaA2. All of these enzymes are known or putative cis-cyclopropane synthetases. PcaA synthesizes the proximal cis-cyclopropane ring of the α-mycolates (6Glickman M.S. Jacobs W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), CmaA1 produces a distal cis-cyclopropane ring in the α-mycolate of M. smegmatis (15Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and MmaA2 likely synthesizes the proximal cis-cyclopropane ring of the methoxymycolates (8Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Dubnau E. Laneelle M.A. Soares S. Benichou A. Vaz T. Prome D. Prome J.C. Daffe M. Quemard A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structural studies of these proteins may help elucidate the basis for their substrate specificity. Several explanations are possible for the ability of cmaA2to produce cis-cyclopropanes in M. smegmatis. Given the high sequence identity within this gene family, it is possible that cmaA2 can inefficiently catalyzecis-cyclopropane synthesis when highly overexpressed. Alternatively, the substrate specificity of these enzymes may be determined in part by physical association in multienzyme complexes. Although this possibility has not been examined experimentally, these enzymes catalyze the sequential modification of the meromycolate chain of mycolic acids and therefore could associate in multienzyme complexes to achieve efficient modification of a mycolic acid subclass. Therefore, it is possible that in M. smegmatis, CmaA2 cannot associate with other methyl transferases and the correct CmaA2 substrate is not available. The significance of trans-cyclopropanated oxygenated mycolic acids for M. tuberculosis pathogenesis is unknown. However, previous work has shown that clinical strains of M. tuberculosis have higher trans-cyclopropane content than extensively passaged laboratory strains, suggesting that in vivo growth either dynamically enhancestrans-cyclopropane formation or favors subpopulations ofM. tuberculosis with higher trans-cyclopropane content (13Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10041-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the high proportion oftrans-cyclopropane rings in the wild-type M. tuberculosis strain used in this study as this strain was recently passaged through animals and has not been passaged significantlyin vitro. The results presented here define cmaA2as the trans-cyclopropane synthetase of M. tuberculosis. Further examination of the cmaA2 mutant in animal models of infection will broaden our understanding of the role of individual cyclopropane residues in general, and oftrans-cyclopropane residues in particular, in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis.

These results are discussed in terms of a homology model of rapsyn, based on the three-dimensional structure of the TPR domain of protein phosphatase 5. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor green fluorescent protein tetratricopeptide repeat polymerase chain reaction A characteristic and important feature of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction is the clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR)1 at high surface density (∼10,000/μ2) in the post-synaptic membrane underlying the nerve terminal, with the nAChR surface density decreasing by a factor of 100–1000 within a few microns. Rapsyn, a peripheral membrane protein of muscle, plays a critical role in the clustering of nAChRs and in the organization of the postsynaptic cytoskeletal complex (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Mutant mice lacking rapsyn show severe neuromuscular abnormality marked by the absence of nAChR clusters in the postsynaptic membrane as well as the absence of cytoskeletal components such as utrophin and dystroglycan (2Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). When expressed in nonmuscle cells, rapsyn forms membrane-associated clusters and recruits nAChRs to these clusters (3Froehner S.C. Luetje C.W. Scotland P.B. Patrick J.

Furthermore, when coexpressed in fibroblasts rapsyn also clusters β-dystroglycan, the integral membrane protein of the dystrophin complex (7Apel E.D. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), as well as the agrin receptor, the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (8Gillespie S.K.H. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies provide evidence for a direct interaction between rapsyn and the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan (11Cartaud A. Coutant S. Petrucci T.C. Cartaud J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11321-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of rapsyn is not known. However, rapsyn primary structure suggests the presence of distinct structural domains (summarized in Fig. 1). The amino terminus of rapsyn is myristoylated (12Carr C. Tyler A.N. Cohen J.B. FEBS Letts. 1989; 243: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Frail D.E. McLaughlin L.L. Mudd J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapsyn-(6–319) is predicted to form 8 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) (14Ponting C.C.P. Phillips C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), while rapsyn-(298–331) contains a putative coiled-coil domain (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal cysteine-rich domain of rapsyn between amino acids 363 and 402 is predicted to be a RING-H2 domain (15Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Rapsyn amino acids 403–406 contain a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by both protein kinase A and protein kinase C. We recently provided a first characterization of the rapsyn structural domains involved in membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR clustering (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that rapsyn NH2-terminal fatty acylation is both required and sufficient for membrane targeting and that rapsyn-(1–90), containing two TPR domains, is sufficient for self-association. In addition, while rapsyn-(1–360) clustered nAChRs, rapsyn-(1–287) did not, indicating that rapsyn-(287–360) is important for nAChR clustering. Within rapsyn-(287–360) we identified a putative coiled-coil domain, rapsyn-(298–331), and showed that disruption of the coiled-coil propensity by alanine insertions prevented nAChR clustering. These results indicated that the COOH-terminal rapsyn RING-H2 domain and the adjacent phosphorylation sites were not essential for either rapsyn or nAChR clustering. We report here further mutational analyses of rapsyn to elucidate the role of the coiled-coil domain in nAChR clustering and the role of the TPRs in rapsyn self-association. These rapsyn mutants, fused at their COOH termini to GFP, were expressed transiently in 293T cells along with nAChR subunits and were visualized by fluorescence microscopy 24–36 h after transfection. The results indicate that nAChR clustering depends critically on the structure of the hydrophobic surface of the coiled-coil domain but not on the hydrophilic surface. While TPRs mediate rapsyn self-association, nAChR clustering is retained in mutants lacking as many as four TPRs. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs except Bpu1102I (Life Technologies, Inc.). T4 DNA ligase and oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in 100 μl using 20 ng of the template pGL-rapsyn (mouse rapsyn subcloned into pGreenLantern vector; Life Technologies, Inc.), 50–100 pmol of each primer, 250 μm each dNTP, and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. All constructs were tested both by restriction enzyme analysis and by sequencing across the full-length of the inserted fragments. This construct encodes rapsyn amino acid sequence 1–41 containing the consensus sequence forN-myristoylation and TPR1. Primers GACACTATAGAAGGTACG and GCAAGTACTGCCCACGAGGTCAGAGCCCTT were used along with the template pGL-rapsyn-(1–412)-GFP (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting plasmid was digested with SpeI and NotI, and the fragment containing the rapsyn sequence was subcloned into pGL vector lacking the GFP insert (made by digesting pGreenLantern with NotI, removing the GFP insert, and religating the vector fragment). GFP cDNA was then inserted at the NotI site to result in pGL-rapsyn-(1–41)-GFP. This construct encodes rapsyn amino acid sequence 1–15, which contains the consensus sequence forN-myristoylation fused in-frame to amino acids 33–90 (TPR2). Primers GTGTGGATGAAGCAGCTGGAGAAGGGCTCT and GCCATCCAGTTCCACGAG were used along with pGL-rapsyn-(1–90)-GFP (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting PCR product was digested with PvuII and NotI, followed by ligation with pGL-rapsyn-(1–15), which was obtained by digesting pGL-rapsyn with PvuII and NotI. GFP cDNA was then inserted at the NotI site, resulting in pGL-rapsyn-(1–15,33–90)-GFP. This construct encodes full-length rapsyn with a deletion of amino acids 16–90 (TPRs 1 and 2). The cDNA fragment of mouse rapsyn fromPvuII (43) to BstUI (269) was deleted. Following digestion of pGL-rapsyn-(1–412)-GFP with PvuII, the vector and insert fragments were isolated. The insert fragment consisting of rapsyn sequence was further digested with BstUI andNotI. The vector fragment was digested with NotI. The vector fragment with PvuII-NotI ends was then ligated with the insert fragment with BstUI-NotI ends, resulting in pGL-rapsyn-(▴16–90). GFP cDNA was then inserted at the NotI site to generate pGL-rapsyn-(▴16–90)-GFP. This construct encodes full-length rapsyn with a deletion of amino acids 91–254 (containing TPRs 3–6). The cDNA fragment of mouse rapsyn fromBstUI(269) to EcoRV (760) is deleted. Following digestion of pGL-rapsyn-(1–412)-GFP with SpeI and EcoRV, the vector and insert fragments were isolated. The insert fragment consisting of rapsyn sequence was further digested withBstUI. The vector fragment with SpeI andEcoRV ends was then ligated with the insert fragment withSpeI-BstUI ends, resulting in pGL- rapsyn-(▴91–254)-GFP. This construct encodes full-length rapsyn with a deletion of amino acids 194–254 (TPR 6). The cDNA fragment of mouse rapsyn fromHincII (577) toEcoRV (760) is deleted.

This construct encodes full-length rapsyn with a deletion of amino acids 255–287 (TPR 7). The cDNA fragment of mouse rapsyn fromEcoRV (760) toPmlI (859) is deleted. pGL-rapsyn-(1–412)-GFP was digested with EcoRV and PmlI. The vector fragment consisting of rapsyn sequence was isolated and religated, resulting in pGL-rapsyn-(▴255–287)-GFP. This construct encodes full-length rapsyn with a deletion of amino acids 288–348 which contain the coiled-coil domain (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment of mouse rapsyn betweenBsaAI sites (859 and 1042) is deleted. Mouse rapsyn cDNA was subcloned into pSVL vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pSVL-rapsyn was then digested with BsaAI and the vector fragment containing rapsyn sequence was isolated and religated, resulting in pSVL-rapsyn-(▴288–348). pBK-CMV (Stratagene) was used as a shuttle vector to subclone rapsyn-(▴288–348) into pGL vector, and GFP cDNA was then inserted at the NotI site, resulting in pGL-rapsyn-(▴288–348)-GFP. This construct, which encodes rapsyn amino acids 1–340, terminates immediately after the coiled-coil domain and lacks the RING-H2 domain as well as the 20 amino acids between the coiled-coil and the RING-H2 domains. This construct differs from rapsyn-(1–360)-GFP (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which includes these 20 amino acids. Primers GATGGGCCCGCGGCCGCTCTAGAAGTCCCTTTGCTGCGGTAGATGCTCTCACT and TACGACTCCGCTATGAGC were used along with pGL-rapsyn as a template in a PCR to amplify rapsyn cDNA sequence from 805–1020. The underlined letters denote the introduced XbaI site. The resulting PCR product was digested with PmlI andXbaI, and it was substituted in place of thePmlI-XbaI fragment of pGL-rapsyn-GFP, resulting in pGL-rapsyn-(1–340)-GFP. This construct encodes a rapsyn mutant that lacks TPRs 1 and 2, the coiled-coil domain, and the RING-H2 domain. The NH2-terminal sequence of pGL-rapsyn-(1–287)-GFP (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) between SpeI andEcoRV was removed and replaced with that from pGL-rapsyn-(▴16–90)-GFP. This construct encodes a rapsyn mutant that lacks TPRs 1 and 2 and the RING-H2 domain, but includes the coiled-coil domain. The NH2-terminal sequence of pGL-rapsyn-(1–340)-GFP between SpeI and EcoRV was removed and replaced with that from pGL-rapsyn-(▴16–90)-GFP. This construct encodes the coiled-coil domain of rapsyn in fusion with GFP.

The resulting PCR product was digested with SpeI andXbaI and then inserted into pGL vector. This construct encodes for rapsyn amino acids G2A-360, lacking the consensus sequence forN-myristoylation and the cysteine-rich RING-H2 domain. pGL-rapsyn-(G2A)-GFP and pGL-rapsyn-(1–360)-GFP (described previously (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) were digested with SpeI andEcoRV. The NH2-terminal sequence (SpeI-EcoRV) of rapsyn was swapped with that of rapsynG2A resulting in pGL-rapsyn-(G2A-360)-GFP. This construct encodes the RING-H2 domain of rapsyn fused with GFP. Primers AGATAAAATAGAATAACTAGTGCCACCATGGTAGTGAGGTTCCACGAGTGCGTGGAGGAGACTGAG and GCCATCCAGTTCCACGAG were used along with pGL-rapsyn-(1–412)-GFP as a template in a PCR to amplify rapsyn cDNA sequence from 1045 to 1236.

The two fragments encompassing the mutation were annealed with each other, extended by mutually primed synthesis, and amplified by a second PCR.

The resulting PCR product was digested with PmlI and Bpu1102I and then substituted in place of the corresponding wild-type rapsyn sequence in pGL-rapsyn-GFP. Transfection of 293T cells by the calcium phosphate method, cell staining, and immunofluorescence experiments were done as described (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), except that the staining was done on cells fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde followed by an incubation with a buffer containing PBS, 10% calf serum, 4% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mml-lysine for 1 h. Under these conditions, α-bungarotoxin binding to surface nAChRs was similar to that of unfixed cells, and the distribution of nAChRs on the cell surface was generally uniform with submicron granularity. Most of the rapsyn clusters ranged from 1 to 5 μ in size with occasional larger plaques of 5–10 μ. Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope with a Nikon 100X Plan Fluor objective (NA1.3). Green and red fluorescence were visualized through Nikon 91617 (excitation, 480 ± 20 nm; emission, 515–560 nm) and 96171 filters (excitation, 540 ± 10 nm; emission, 590–650 nm), respectively. In some experiments photographs were taken with Kodak 160T film and digitized. Most of the images were acquired with a Micromax CH250 CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) using MetaMorph software. Figures were prepared from the digitized images using Adobe Photoshop. Anti-rapsyn monoclonal MAb19F4A, used in the identification of rapsyn in Fig. 6, was prepared by using Torpedo rapsyn as immunogen (16Carr C. Fischbach G.D. Cohen J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Based upon epitope mapping studies it has been shown to recognize rapsyn amino acid sequence 396–411. 2J. Cohen, unpublished data. In our immunofluorescence studies, it did not recognize rapsyn-(1–360) or other smaller fragments (data not shown). In general, within each cell expressing both rapsyn and nAChR, not all rapsyn clusters are associated with nAChRs. This is expected since only the surface nAChRs are labeled with α-bungarotoxin, while rapsyn-GFP is distributed at the plasma membrane and also intracellularly. For experiments involving expression of rapsyn-GFP (or mutants) and nAChRs in 293T cells, quantification of nAChR clusters relative to rapsyn clusters was done as follows. In each experiment, 100 cells positive for both rapsyn and nAChR expression were identified. For these we quantified the number of cells with nAChRs that co-localized with rapsyn clusters and the number of cells with nAChRs distributed diffusely. In experiments involving rapsyn mutants with TPR deletions, in some cells nAChRs were seen both clustered with rapsyn and also distributed diffusely on the surface. For quantification, these cells were classified as containing clustered nAChRs. Each experiment was repeated at least four times, cells were scored as above, and the results are presented as the % of cells with nAChR clusters (mean and S.D.). All molecular modeling studies were done with Insight II, Version 98 (MSI, San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics IRIS work station. The mouse rapsyn TPR domain was homology modeled based upon the three-dimensional crystal structure of the TPR domain of protein phosphatase 5 (17Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The coordinates of this domain, containing 3 TPRs, were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Base (PDB number 1A17). The sequences of the rapsyn TPRs 1–7 (14Ponting C.C.P. Phillips C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were used sequentially to create the model. TPRs 1–3 and 4–6 were each modeled individually, and then they were combined in register. TPR 7, initially modeled with TPR 8, was then added. For rapsyn, the intervening sequences between TPRs 2 and 7 each contain 6–9 amino acids, while in protein phosphatase 5 there are no residues between TPRs. For rapsyn random loops were generated for these sequences, and these loops were then fused with the TPR structures. Rapsyn amino acids 286–331 were modeled as an energy minimized, single long helix, based on our previous prediction that rapsyn 298–331 has a high propensity to be organized as an α-helical coiled-coil (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The orientation of the coiled-coil domain with respect to the TPRs was done arbitrarily and represents only one of the possibilities. The entire rapsyn model was then energy minimized using the Discover module, first with steepest descent algorithm and then by conjugate gradient algorithm until the energy of the entire molecule was low. Previously we had shown (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that rapsyn-(1–287)-GFP could self-associate but not cluster nAChRs, while rapsyn-(1–360)-GFP could cluster nAChRs. Furthermore, rapsyn amino acids 298–331 were predicted to have a high propensity to form an α-helical coiled-coil, and alanine insertions within this region that disrupted coiled-coil propensity also disrupted rapsyn's ability to cluster nAChRs without affecting rapsyn self-association. To further assess the importance of the rapsyn coiled-coil domain in nAChR clustering, we made two additional constructs: (i) rapsyn-(1–340)-GFP, with the rapsyn sequence terminated immediately after the coiled-coil domain; and (ii) rapsyn-(▴288–348)-GFP, full-length rapsyn with the coiled-coil domain deleted (Fig. 2 a). When expressed in 293T cells, rapsyn-(1–340)-GFP formed distinct membrane-associated clusters in all transfected cells and clustered nAChRs at the cell surface (Fig. 2, b and c) in 95 ± 5% of cells expressing both proteins. The appearance of rapsyn/nAChR clusters was indistinguishable from that of wild-type rapsyn. In contrast, the construct lacking the coiled-coil domain, rapsyn-(▴288–348)-GFP, formed membrane-associated clusters similar to wild type but did not cluster nAChRs (Fig. 2, d ande). When nAChR distribution was quantified in six separate transfection experiments, nAChRs were clustered with rapsyn in only 8 ± 2% of cells. These results establish that the coiled-coil domain is essential for nAChR clustering, while the adjacent amino acids 340–360 of rapsyn are not necessary. Rapsyn-(298–331) has a high propensity to organize as a coiled-coil domain, since it can form a 10-turn amphipathic α-helix with a hydrophobic moment of 0.6 (6Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 a). When modeled as a right-handed α-helix, the amphipathic character of the helix is clearly visualized with a hydrophobic face (Fig. 3 b, left) and a hydrophilic face (Fig. 3 b, right). Striking features of the hydrophilic surface are the presence of a strip of six-acidic side chains forming a continuous surface over four helix turns and the presence of 5 lysine residues spaced to form a lysine ladder. These lysines are conserved in rapsyn from different species. The hydrophobic surface, which extends over 10 turns, consists of 5 alanine residues in the first four helical turns and nine bulky side chains (Leu, Ile, and Val). To analyze the importance of the particular amino acids that contribute to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic helix surfaces, three constructs with point mutations were tested (Fig.4 a): (i) rapsyn-(298–331)-ED → QN-GFP, full-length rapsyn fused to GFP with the 3 Glu and 2 Asp within amino acids 298–331 mutated to Gln and Asn, respectively; (ii) rapsyn-(298–322)-KR → Q-GFP, with the 4 Lys and 1 Arg within amino acids 298–322 all replaced by Gln; (iii) rapsyn-(298–331)-LIV → A-GFP, with the 6 Leu, 1 Ile, and 2 Val within amino acids 298–331 all replaced by alanine. None of these substitutions altered the coiled-coil propensity as calculated by the COILS program (18Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). When expressed in 293T cells, rapsyn-(298–331)-ED → QN-GFP formed distinct clusters in all transfected cells. nAChRs were clustered with rapsyn at the surface (Fig. 4, b-d) in 72 ± 7% cells expressing both proteins and were diffusely distributed in the other cells. Similarly, rapsyn-(298–322)-KR → Q-GFP also"

Low-energy electron microscopy and atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy reveal that bronze forms on the surface by a complicated, unanticipated cooperative mechanism: Ordered two-dimensional tin islands containing several hundred thousand atoms spontaneously sweep across the surface, leaving bronze alloys in their tracks. We propose that this process, driven by surface free energy, is a version of the ""camphor dance"" observed on liquid surfaces, and should be a general mechanism of surface alloying when surface diffusion is faster than exchange into the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2112754143,"Single-walled carbon nanotubes are ideal systems for investigating fundamental properties and applications of one-dimensional electronic systems. The interaction of magnetic impurities with electrons confined in one dimension has been studied by spatially resolving the local electronic density of states of small cobalt clusters on metallic single-walled nanotubes with a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. Spectroscopic measurements performed on and near these clusters exhibit a narrow peak near the Fermi level that has been identified as a Kondo resonance. Using the scanning tunneling microscope to fabricate ultrasmall magnetic nanostructures consisting of small cobalt clusters on short nanotube pieces, spectroscopic studies of this quantum box structure exhibited features characteristic of the bulk Kondo resonance, but also new features due to finite size."

NO is thought to be a major cause of islet β-cell dysfunction and apoptotic β-cell death, which results in type I diabetes. Since protein kinase C (PKC) mediates some of the actions of cytokines in other cell types, our aim was to assess the role of PKC in IL-1β-induced iNOS expression in pancreatic β-cells. PKCδ, but not PKCα, was specifically activated in the rat INS-1 β-cell line by IL-1β as assessed by membrane translocation. Moreover, iNOS expression and NO production were significantly attenuated by the PKCδ specific inhibitor rottlerin and overexpression of a PKCδ kinase-dead mutant protein. Conversely, overexpression of PKCδ wild type protein significantly potentiated this response. These results were confirmed at the mRNA level by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. However, a role at the level of transcriptional regulation appeared unlikely, since PKCδ was not required for the activation of NF-κB, activating protein 1, and activating transcription factor 2 signaling pathways in response to IL-1β. There was, however, a significant increase in iNOS mRNA stability mediated by PKCδ wild type, while PKCδ kinase-dead acted reciprocally, reducing iNOS mRNA stability. The results indicate that, in addition to transcriptional activation, mRNA stabilization is a key component of the mechanism by which IL-1β stimulates iNOS expression in β-cells and that PKCδ plays an essential role in this process.

Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), and this is particularly true of iNOS mRNA, which is targeted for rapid degradation because of signals in the 3′-untranslated region (12Nunokawa Y.

PKCδ and PKCα are the predominant PKC isozymes expressed in islets and insulinoma cells (29Knutson K.L. Hoenig M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but their role in IL-1β-induced gene expression has not been defined. Determination of that role was the aim of the current study. Using adenoviral constructs for overexpression of wild-type and kinase-dead PKC isoforms in the INS-1 cell line, we demonstrate that PKCδ is necessary for IL-1β-stimulated iNOS protein expression and NO production and that the underlying mechanism is control of iNOS mRNA stability. The rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 was grown in RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin G sodium (500 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine (reagents from Life Technologies, Inc.) and passaged by trypsinization into T150 flasks (Becton and Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NY). INS-1 cells (passage 15–30) were routinely seeded at 0.5 × 106/well of a 24 well plate for experiments, and used on day 4 at around 80% confluency. Pancreatic islets were isolated from 230–270-g male Wistar rats by ductal infusion of collagenase, purified on Histopaque 1077 gradient, and then hand-picked under a binocular microscope. Islets were maintained in culture for 48 h in RPMI containing 5.5 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin G sodium (500 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine. Islets were incubated with 300 pg/ml IL-1β in the presence or absence of rottlerin (10 μm) for the final 24 h. cDNA for mouse PKCα and rat PKCδ (generous gifts from Fredrick Mushinski and Peter Parker, respectively) were first subcloned into pALTER (Promega, Annandale, New South Wales, Australia) using conventional molecular biological techniques (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed according to the protocol using the mutagenic primers 5′-TACGCCATCAGGATCCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTTGCAATCAGGTACCTGAAGAAG-3′ (for PKCα and PKCδ, respectively) (Beckman Instruments, Gladesville, Australia) targeted to conserved lysine residues in the ATP binding domain. Mutants were designated PKCαKD (K368R substitution) and PKCδKD, (K376R substitution). Overexpression of kinase-dead forms have previously been shown to act in an isoenzyme-specific dominant negative fashion (31Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while our data (not shown) and others have confirmed that the PKCδKD mutant is catalytically inactive (20Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant PKC cDNAs were then subcloned from pALTER into pXCMV, an adenoviral shuttle vector constructed in this laboratory by subcloning the pRcCMV (Invitrogen) expression cassette into pXCX3, derived from pXCX2 (34Spessot R. Inchley K. Hupel T.M. Bacchetti S. Virology. 1989; 168: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus was then prepared by recombination with the adenovirus plasmid pJM17, essentially as described by Graham and Prevec (35Graham F.L. Prevec L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1991; 7: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar). The MX17 control is an adenovirus that contains just the virus backbone (pJM17) and the expression cassette from pXCX3, but without cDNA. Adenovirus-mediated expression of PKCα and PKCδ proteins was determined by infecting INS-1 cells at 10–20 plaque-forming units/cell, in 200 μl of medium and then incubating for 1 h at 37 °C, mixing every 15 min. Virus was then removed, and fresh medium was applied. At 48 h postinfection, proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and PKCα or PKCδ expression was determined by immunoblotting as described below. At 48 h of culture, INS-1 cells were exposed to 300 pg/ml IL-1β (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for the times indicated. Cells were then washed in ice-cold PBS and cytosol, and membrane fractions were prepared, essentially as described (36Schmitz-Peiffer C. Browne C.L. Oakes N.D. Watkinson A. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 169-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins in individual fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels (all reagents from Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted as described below. Whole cell lysate fractions were prepared from INS-1 cells by washing monolayers in ice-cold PBS and resuspending in modified Laemmli sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) containing 1% SDS and 10% mercaptoethanol. Membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared above were also resuspended in this buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-blot; Bio-Rad) by electroblotting, blocked with 5% milk powder, and probed with appropriate antibodies, i.e. mouse anti-PKCα antibody from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), rat anti-PKCδ and iNOS antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and cRel, IκBα, IκBβ, phospho-p38, JNK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 antibodies from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA), and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to x-ray film (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Signal intensities were determined by densitometric analysis (on a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI and software by IPLabGel, Signal Analytics, VA). INS-1 and islets cells were either infected with recombinant adenovirus as described above or exposed to PKC inhibitors (Calbiochem) 30 min prior to the application of 300 pg/ml IL-1β. After 24-h exposure to IL-1β, 100 μl of medium was analyzed for nitrite via the Griess diazo reaction (38Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Analysis of iNOS expression in INS-1 cells was performed by washing the remaining cells in PBS and immunoblotting cell lysates as described above, using a rat anti-iNOS antibody. INS-1 cells were treated appropriately, harvested by washing with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 s. The PBS was removed, and cells were resuspended in 175 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotonin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were incubated for 10 min on ice before the addition of 9 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and vortexed for 20 s. The nuclear fraction was pelleted at 13,000 × g for 20 s and washed once in buffer A, without resuspending the pellet. 40 μl of buffer C (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotonin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin) was then applied, and the pellet was resuspended by vortexing and vigorous agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. This nuclear fraction was then pelleted for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and supernatant was removed for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. INS-1 cells were transfected with pCIneo (Promega) and κB, API (kind gifts from Malcom Handel, Garvan Institute) and ATF2 (Promega) luciferase reporter DNA using Superfectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The κB luciferase plasmid has six NF-κB sites and a γ-fibrinogen basal promoter, while the AP-1 plasmid has three AP-1 sites also driven by the γ-fibrinogen basal promoter. Stably transfected populations were selected using neomycin (400 μg/ml) over 6 weeks. Stable cell lines were then seeded in 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and exposed to adenovirus after a 24-h culture. 48 h postinfection, cells were exposed to 300 pg/ml IL-1β for 4 h, and luciferase activity was measured using the LucLite luciferase assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured using a Canberra Packard (Sydney, Australia) TopCount microplate scintillation counter. INS-1 cells were cultured in six-well plates (at 1 × 106 cells/well) and infected with adenovirus as described above. At 48 h postinfection, cells were exposed to 300 pg/ml IL-1β for either 6 or 12 h. To measure message stabilization, cells were exposed to actinomycin D (1 μm) for the indicated times. Cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol/well (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified using absorbance at 260 nm. cDNA synthesis was performed using a preamplification kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 5 μg of RNA in each reaction. PCR was then performed using 2 μl of cDNA, oligonucleotides specific for either β-actin or iNOS (39Shimabukuro M. Ohneda M. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR amplification protocol was designed to allow quantification of iNOS and β-actin PCR product while in the exponential phase of amplification. Products were amplified using a 5-min hot start at 95 °C and 18 (β-actin) or 24–28 cycles (iNOS) of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 74 °C. Products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, visualized on a GelDoc 1000 illuminator (Bio-Rad), and analyzed using IPLabGel software. All results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student'st test. Pancreatic islets and β-cell lines have been well documented to contain PKC, of which the predominant isoenzymes expressed are PKCα and PKCδ (29Knutson K.L. Hoenig M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,40Tian Y.M. Urquidi V. Ashcroft S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine whether these isozymes are involved in IL-1β signaling in the clonal insulin secreting INS-1 cell line, we first measured PKC translocation to the plasma membrane as an indicator of activation. In response to IL-1β, PKCδ translocates from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction of INS-1 cells as early as 2 min after stimulation with IL-1β (Fig.1 A). No such translocation with PKCα was observed. Densitometric analysis (Fig. 1 B) revealed that accumulation of PKCδ in the membrane fraction was more than doubled by 2 min stimulation and significantly elevated for at least 7.5 min. To determine whether PKC activation participated in iNOS induction by IL-1β in β-cells, we measured iNOS expression and NO production in the presence of specific PKC inhibitors (41Hofmann J. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). IL-1β stimulated the induction of NO production and iNOS expression at 24 h in INS-1 cells (Fig. 2,A and B). When incubated with 30 nmGo6976, a PKC inhibitor selective for PKCα (41Hofmann J. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 42Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), iNOS expression and NO production were not inhibited (but instead were enhanced). However, rottlerin (10 μm), which selectively inhibits PKCδ, almost completely inhibited production of NO. Most importantly, rottlerin also completely inhibited IL-1β-stimulated NO accumulation in isolated rat pancreatic islets (Fig. 2 C), confirming that this effect is not limited to the INS-1 cells. These results therefore implicate PKCδ in IL-1β signaling and prompted us to investigate its role more directly. Recombinant adenovirus capable of overexpressing WT and KD mutant forms of PKCδ were generated and used to infect INS-1 cells. Recombinant PKC adenovirus induced a high degree of overexpression by 72 h relative to MX17 control virus (Fig.3 A). A direct role for PKCδ in IL-1β-induced NO production and iNOS expression was confirmed using the adenoviral constructs as shown in Fig. 3, B andC, respectively. IL-1β stimulated a robust induction of iNOS and a 6-fold increase in NO production in INS-1 cells infected with control virus. Overexpression of PKCδWT, however, significantly potentiated the NO response to IL-1β without affecting basal levels. Similar effects were seen on iNOS expression. Effects of PKCδKD overexpression were reciprocal to those of PKCδWT, with IL-1β-stimulated iNOS expression markedly reduced and NO production levels almost completely abolished. The results above suggest that PKCδ activation is required for IL-1β-stimulated iNOS protein expression. To assess the underlying mechanism, we first measured iNOS mRNA levels after a 12-h exposure to IL-1β. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig.4 A) showed that IL-1β robustly induces iNOS message from virtually undetectable levels. Overexpression of PKCδWT significantly potentiated message abundance, over 2-fold compared with the MX17 control virus. Conversely, overexpression of PKCδKD reduced iNOS message levels to 40% of control. The results confirm that PKCδ plays a major role in controlling IL-1β−induced iNOS expression by effects mediated at the level of mRNA. The transcription factor AP-1 plays a role in regulating iNOS gene expression in pancreatic β-cells (2Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 5Welsh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8307-8312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because PKCs are important regulators of AP-1 activity in many cells, acting upstream of JNK/SAPK, we first examined the potential for PKCδ to act in this pathway. Fig. 5 A shows the results of Western blot analysis to measure JNK/SAPK activation using phosphospecific antibodies that recognize only the activated form of these kinases. IL-1β clearly activated this kinase but in a manner that was unaffected by the presence of PKCδWT or PKCδKD. In Fig.5 B, we show activation of AP-1-mediated luciferase expression in INS-1 stably expressing the AP-1 reporter plasmid and exposed to IL-1β for 4 h. Clearly, overexpression of either PKCδWT or PKCδKD had no effect on AP-1 activity stimulated by IL-1β. We next analyzed the ATF2 transcription factor and the role of PKC upon this pathway, since ATF2 has been shown to be regulated by PKC in other systems (21Kawasaki H. Song J. Eckner R. Ugai H. Chiu R. Taira K. Shi Y. Jones N. Yokoyama K.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We again used phosphospecific antibodies to measure the effect of PKCδWT and PKCδKD protein on IL-1β-induced activation of p38 (Fig. 6 A) and a specific luciferase reporter to measure ATF2 activity in INS-1 cells exposed to IL-1β. While the IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of p38 was unaltered by PKCδ overexpression, there were effects at the level of ATF2-mediated luciferase expression. In fact, PKCδWT clearly and significantly augmented both the basal and IL-1β response. This suggests that PKCδ might be sufficient for up-regulating ATF2 reporter activity. However, this effect is independent of IL-1β, since the response to PKCδWT and IL-1β appeared additive, and the PKCδKD mutant did not affect stimulated reporter activity. We next investigated the effect of PKCδ on various aspects of the NF-κB signaling cascade. NF-κB exists as a cytosolic heterodimer, where activation is mediated by degradation of an inhibitory (IκB) subunit, which thereby facilitates translocation of the active subunit (p65) to the nucleus. The time course of degradation and resynthesis of IκBα and IκBβ in response to IL-1β are shown in Fig.7 A. We also show the appearance of p65 in the nucleus over this time. Both IκBα and IκBβ are degraded in response to IL-1β with the concomitant appearance of p65 in the nucleus indicating activation of the NF-κB pathway. There is, however, no effect of either PKCδWT or PKCδKD on the kinetics of these events. Transcriptional activity of NF-κB in INS-1 cells stably transfected with the κB luciferase reporter construct was also investigated (Fig. 7 B). IL-1β induced a 20-fold increase in luciferase expression over 4 h, which was significantly enhanced by overexpression of the PKCδWT construct, as was basal luciferase expression. There was, however, no inhibition of IL-1β-induced κB-mediated luciferase expression by PKCδKD. As with the ATF2 data presented above, these results suggest that the PKCδ is sufficient to increase basal NF-κB reporter activity but acts independently of IL-1β. Since we did not observe a requirement for PKCδ activity in the regulation in the three major signaling pathways known to control IL-1β-induced iNOS gene expression in pancreatic β-cells, we next assessed whether PKCδ might exert effects at the level of iNOS mRNA stability. This was assessed by stimulating INS-1 cells for 6 h with IL-1β and then halting transcription with actinomycin D. RNA was harvested at 2, 4, and 6 h after this point. The results demonstrate that in control cells iNOS mRNA is degraded following actinomycin D treatment, with iNOS mRNA having a half-life (t 12) of ∼6 h (Fig.8). PKCδWT clearly reduces the rate of degradation such that at 6 h postapplication of actinomycin D, iNOS message levels are less than 30% below the peak levels prior to actinomycin D treatment. Conversely, PKCδKD overexpression increased the rate of iNOS mRNA degradation such that more then 80% of the message is degraded after 6 h in the presence of actinomycin D, and its t12 is reduced to less than 3 h. These observations strongly implicate a role for PKCδ in iNOS mRNA stabilization and provide a mechanism by which PKCδ can regulate IL-1β induced iNOS mRNA levels and protein expression. We have described a novel role for PKCδ in regulating NO generation in IL-1β-stimulated pancreatic β-cells. This was elucidated using specific PKC inhibitors and recombinant adenoviruses for overexpression of PKCδWT or -KD. Our results indicate that PKCδ activation was absolutely required for up-regulation of iNOS mRNA and protein levels, as well as generation of NO, in cells stimulated for 12–24 h with IL-1β. However, overexpression of PKCδKD did not inhibit any of the three major transcriptional pathways (AP-1, ATF-2, and NF-κB) known to be important for iNOS induction in IL-1β-stimulated β-cells (1Eizirik D.L.

Substitutions of the phosphorylation sites were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Glutamate (S1E) and aspartate (S1D) substitutions at site 1 resulted in the complete loss of PDC activity; however, these mutants were variably active in the decarboxylation and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol assays.

PDC comprises multiple copies of three catalytic enzymes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3); in addition, the complex also contains a binding protein referred to as E3-binding protein (E3BP), and two regulatory enzymes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and phosphopyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. E1 carries out the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid and the reductive acetylation of lipoyl moieties covalently linked to E2. E2 then catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups to CoA, forming acetyl-CoA and fully reduced lipoyl moieties. E3 reoxidizes the reduced lipoyl groups of E2 and transfers the electrons to NAD+, forming NADH. Sixty subunits of mammalian E2 and 12 subunits of E3BP form the inner core structure, whereas 20–30 tetrameric E1 (α2β2) components bind this core and 6 E3 homodimers bind to the E3BP subunits (1Reed L.J.

Regulation of mammalian PDC activity is accomplished in large part by phosphorylation (resulting in inactivation) of the E1 component by a family of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK 1–4 isozymes) and dephosphorylation (leading to activation) of phosphorylated E1 by a set of specific phosphatases (phosphopyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1–2 isozymes) (1Reed L.J.

In an earlier study, we investigated several human E1 mutants with single, double, and triple mutations by replacing serine with alanine and characterized their site-specific rates of phosphorylation and a random mechanism of dephosphorylation (9Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14297-14304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To probe the mechanism of inactivation of human E1 by phosphorylation, we have generated a family of mutant human E1s in which one of the three serine residues is replaced individually by amino acid residues of different size and charge. The results of this study indicate that phosphorylation of site 1 leads to the steric interference in catalysis and phosphorylation of site 3 may affect coenzyme binding. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promegaand Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sequenase 2.0 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [1-14C]Pyruvate and [35S]ATP were from PerkinEmler Life Sciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Ni2+-NTA)-agarose was obtained from Qiagen. The protein assay reagent was from Bio-Rad. pPDK1 and pPDK2 expression vectors and Escherichia coli strain BL21 with pPDHE2/E3BP were generously provided by Dr. Robert A. Harris (Indiana University School of Medicine). Several mutants of the three phosphorylation sites localized on the E1α subunit were made: serine 264 (site 1) was replaced with alanine (S1A), glutamate (S1E), glutamine (S1Q), and aspartate (S1D); serine 271 (site 2) was replaced with alanine (S2A), glutamate (S2E), and glutamine (S2Q); and serine 203 (site 3) was replaced with alanine (S3A) and glutamate (S3E). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a two-stage polymerase chain reaction (25Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) using pQE-9–6HE1α for substitution of Ser-264 (site 1), Ser-271 (site 2), and Ser-203 (site 3). pQE-9–6HE1α was constructed previously in this laboratory (16Korotchkina L.G. Tucker M.M. Thekkumkara T.J. Madhusudhan K.T. Pons G. Kim H. Patel M.S. Protein Exp. Purif. 1995; 6: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A single mutagenic primer and two primers of 5′ and 3′ ends including BamHI sites preceding the first codon and after the stop codon of the E1α sequence were used to amplify E1α cDNA. The following mutagenic primers (antisense) were used (mutated bases are shown in bold): 5′-GGGTCACTCATAGCGTGTCCGTGG-3′ for S1A, 5′-GGGTCACTCATCTCGTGTCCGTGGTAA-3′ for S1E, 5′-GGGTCACTCATCTGGTGTCCGTGGTAA-3′ for S1Q, 5′-GGGTCACTCATGTCGTGTCCGTGGTAA-3′ for S1D, 5′-CGTGTACGGTAAGCGACTCCAGGG-3′ for S2A, 5′-CGTGTACGGTACTCGACTCCAGGG-3′ for S2E, 5′-CGTGTACGGTACTGGACTCCAGGG-3′ for S2Q, 5′-CTCTCAACAGCCGTTCCCATTCC-3′ for S3A, and 5′-CTCTCAACCTCCGTTCCCATTCC-3′ for S3E. The amplified mutated E1α cDNAs were digested withBamHI and ligated to PQE-9 (containing a polyhistidine extension at the amino terminus). The complete coding sequence of each mutant E1 cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). To overexpress the mutant E1s, coexpression vectors carrying both E1α and E1β were constructed and transformed into E. coli M15 cells containing pDMI.1 plasmid, which encoded the lac repressor as described previously (16Korotchkina L.G.

The purified enzyme preparations had purity of more than 90% as judged by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (results not shown). Recombinant human E2-E3BP was purified (about 92% purity) from BL21 cells harboring pPDHE2/E3BP as described by Yang et al. (27Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Recombinant rat PDK1 and PDK2 were purified to about 92–95% purity from BL21 cells transformed with pPDK1 and pPDK2 expression vectors according to Bowker-Kinley et al. (28Bowker-Kinley M.M.

Recombinant human E3 was overexpressed and purified to about 96% purity as described by Liu et al. (29Liu T.-C. Korotchkina L.G. Hyatt S. Vettakkorumakankav N.N. Patel M.S. J. Biol.

E1 activity was assayed by three different assay systems: (i) by the formation of NADH after reconstitution of E1 with recombinant human E2-E3BP and recombinant human E3 in the PDC assay (to measure the overall complex activity) (21Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); (ii) by the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), the artificial electron acceptor in the DCPIP assay (to measure E1-catalyzed reaction only, decarboxylation of pyruvate, and oxidation of HE=TPP to acetate) (30Khailova L.S. Bernhardt R. Huebner G. Biokhimiia. 1977; 42: 113-117PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) by the production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]pyruvate in the absence of an electron acceptor in the decarboxylation assay (decarboxylation of pyruvate and release of acetaldehyde) (31Sheu K.F. Hu C.W. Utter M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1463-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Kerr D.S. Ho L. Berlin C.M. Lanoue K.F. Towfighi J. Hoppel C.L. Lusk M.M. Gondek C.M. Patel M.S. Pediatr. Res. 1987; 22: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For the PDC assay, E1 (0.8–1 μg) was preincubated in the cuvette with a premixed mixture of recombinant human E2-E3BP and recombinant human E3 in the ratio of 1:3:3 for 1 min at 37 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNAD+, 156 μm CoA, 4 mm cysteine, 0.2 mm TPP. The reaction was then started with the addition of 2 mm pyruvate, and the formation of NADH was monitored spectrophotometrically. In one set of experiments (Fig. 2), PDC activity was measured by the formation of 14CO2from [1-14C]pyruvate by reconstituted PDC instead of monitoring the formation of NADH. The DCPIP assay was carried out at 37 °C with E1 (20–50 μg) in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm TPP, and 100 μm DCPIP; the reaction was started by the addition of 5 mm pyruvate, and the reduction of DCPIP was monitored at 600 nm. Activity in the decarboxylation assay was measured with E1 reconstituted in PDC and free E1 (1–20 μg) in the absence of an electron acceptor in 85 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, containing 3.4 mm MgCl2, 0.34 mm TPP, and 0.82 mm[1-14C]pyruvate. Apparent K m values for TPP and pyruvate were determined in the PDC and DCPIP assays by varying the concentrations of TPP from 0.03 to 100 μm(PDC assay) or from 0.2 to 200 μm (DCPIP assay) and the concentrations of pyruvate from 10 to 800 μm (PDC assay) or from 1 to 1500 μm (DCPIP assay). The linear portions (initial rates) of the time curves were used to calculate the kinetic parameters from double-reciprocal plots. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of product formed/min at 37 °C. Correlation coefficients in all kinetic experiments were at least 95%. Protein was measured by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). E1 mutants with site 1, 2, or 3 only (S2A,S3A, S1A,S3A, and S1A,S2A, respectively) were phosphorylated by PDK1 or PDK2 in the presence of E2-E3BP and 100–500 μm ATP depending upon the site to be phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was performed at 30 °C in 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol. To measure decarboxylation and DCPIP activity of the phosphorylated mutant E1s, modified E1s were washed on Millipore Ultrafree (UFV5BQK25) filters and concentrated. Controls (without phosphorylation) were treated in the same way. To study inactivation of E1 by phosphorylation of site 1, 2, or 3 in the presence of TPP, mutants having site 1 only, site 2 only, or site 3 only were phosphorylated by PDK1 in the presence of E2-E3BP, and wild-type E1 was phosphorylated mostly at site 1 by PDK2 in the absence of E2-E3BP-subcomplex. Activity of PDK2 for site 2 is <1% of its activity for site 1 in the absence of E2-E3BP. Site 3 is not modified by PDK2. 2L. G. Korotchkina and M. S. Patel, unpublished results. E1s were incubated in the conditions described above with ATP and different compounds as specified in the figure legends. Aliquots (0.8–1 μg of E1) were withdrawn at the indicated times and added to a 1-ml cuvette containing the components for the PDC assay. PDC was allowed to reconstitute for 1 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of pyruvate. The results of all experiments were calculated using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Highly purified recombinant human wild-type and phosphorylation site-specific mutant E1s were used to determine activities using three different assays. A comparison of the activities of site 1 E1 mutants (S1A, S1E, S1Q, and S1D) in the PDC assay, DCPIP assay, and decarboxylation assay is shown in Fig. 1 A. Mutants S1E and S1D with a single negative charge at that site had undetectable activity in the PDC assay (Fig. 1 A), which was expected if these mutations mimicked phosphorylation of site 1 in inhibiting PDC activity (Fig. 1 B). The S1Q E1 mutant (without a negative charge at that site) had only about 3% of the activity in the PDC assay, whereas S1A mutant E1 had about 58% of the control PDC activity. These results indicate that the size of the substituted residue and possibly its orientation and not only the negative charge at site 1 contributes to inactivation of E1. All the site 1 mutants demonstrated considerable levels of activity (46–62%) in the decarboxylation assay and in the DCPIP assay (63–90% activity). Only the S1D mutant E1 had a very low activity (about 10%) in the DCPIP assay, probably due to high inactivation during the catalytic reaction. The progress curve of the PDC reaction for the S1D mutant E1 was linear only during the first 30 s, after which the rate of the reaction decreased significantly (results not shown). We do not have an explanation for this kinetic behavior, as this effect was not studied further. Wild-type E1 phosphorylated at site 1 only had ∼59% activity in the decarboxylation assay (Fig. 1 B), similar to that observed for the substitution mutants at site 1 (Fig.1 A). Activity in the DCPIP assay was 45% for the phosphorylated wild-type E1, and PDC activity was undetectable (Fig.1 B). As seen from the three different assays, the reduction in the activities for the site 2 or site 3 E1 mutants was less variable for each mutant (about 20%) and ranged from 30% to 70% inhibition (Fig.1 C). It should be noted that the substitution of S2 or S3 with glutamate or glutamine inhibited PDC activity by only 50% (Fig.1 C), whereas substitution of serine at S1 with glutamate resulted in complete inactivation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the findings with the site 2 or site 3 substitution E1 mutants, phosphorylation of either site 2 or site 3 alone, drastically reduced (more than 90%) PDC activity (Fig. 1 D), as opposed to only about 40% reduction in the decarboxylation assay. Substitution of site 2 or 3 with glutamate did not mimic the phosphorylation effect. To investigate whether the binding of the mutant E1s in the PDC could affect its activity, we measured the activities of the site 1 mutant E1s bound to E2 (in PDC) or in the free state, using the decarboxylation assay. As expected, wild-type E1-PDC activity as measured by the 14CO2 formation (25.8 ± 3.4 units/mg of E1; Fig. 2 A) was similar to that determined by NADH formation in the PDC assay (29.0 ± 0.9 units/mg of E1; Fig. 1 A). Site 1 mutants showed variable inhibitory effects on PDC activity (measured by14CO2 formation), which were similar to the ones reported for PDC activity in the PDC assay (NADH formation) in Fig. 1 A. The measurements of E1 activity in the S1 substitution mutants bound to E2 and in the free states showed similar activities except for the S1D E1 mutant, which had about twice as much E1 activity when bound compared with the free state (Fig.2 A). Phosphorylation of site 1 in wild-type E1 had similar levels (about 45%) of E1 activity in the decarboxylation assay when E1 was bound to E2 or was in the free state (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the interaction of the site 1 E1 mutants (except the S1D mutant) with E2 had no effect on their E1 activity in the decarboxylation assay. Kinetic parameters of the site 1 mutants were determined in the DCPIP assay (Table I) because three of the four site 1 mutants had no activity or negligible activity in the PDC assay (Fig.1 A). Apparent K m values for pyruvate increased for E1 mutants with alanine (3.2-fold), glutamate (4.5-fold), and glutamine (2.6-fold) substitutions at site 1. In contrast, apparentK m values for TPP remained unaffected for the glutamate-substituted mutant but only slightly increased for the glutamine-substituted (1.7-fold), and alanine-substituted (2.7-fold) site 1 mutant E1s. Kinetic parameters were not determined for the S1D E1 due to its strong inactivation under the assay conditions.Table ICatalytic parameters of wild-type and site-specific mutant E1s determined in PDC and DCPIP assaysAssayE1k catK m for TPPk cat/K m for TPPK m for pyruvatek cat/K m for pyruvateK i for pyrophosphateLag-phasePyruvate-induced inhibitions−1μms−1μm−1μms−1μm−1μm%PDCWT680.08850521.3165YesS1A441.00441210.36133NoS2A440.19232411.07143YesS2E330.7842780.42478NoS2Q460.26175590.78195YesS3A540.09600541.0085YesS3E392.16181480.26499NoDCPIPWT0.660.980.675.10.1354.6S1A0.602.670.2216.20.03725.5S1E0.591.110.5322.80.01927.1S1Q0.391.710.2313.50.02927.0S2A47.2S2E32.8S2Q38.8S3A46.5S3E9.9K m and k cat values are apparentK m and k cat values.

For the mutants of sites 2 and 3, kinetic parameters were determined using the PDC assay (Table I). Apparent K m values for pyruvate did not change for the mutants of sites 2 and 3 (except about 2.8-fold increase for S3E). In contrast, apparentK m values for TPP increased for the site 2 mutants (2.4-, 9.8-, and 3.2-fold for S2A, S2E, and S2Q mutant E1s, respectively) and ∼27-fold for S3E (with only about 2% catalytic efficiency with TPP; Table I). This latter result indicates a possible effect of glutamate substitution for serine at site 3 on TPP interaction with this mutant E1. Earlier mammalian E1 was reported to have a lag-phase in the progress curve of the PDC reaction (34Tripatara A. Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Human E1 displayed a lag-phase only in the presence of low TPP concentrations (below 1 μm); the lag-phase was suggested to reflect E1 activation during catalysis (34Tripatara A. Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Of several mutant E1s investigated, only S1A, S2E, and S3E did not show the lag-phase in the PDC reaction under the experimental conditions employed (Table I). The absence of the lag-phase could reflect a change in the conformation of the E1 active site caused by these mutations. The information about the presence of the lag-phase presence for S1E, S1Q, and S1D E1s is not available due to the lack or negligible PDC activity of these mutant proteins. Human E1 was shown previously to be subject to substrate-induced inactivation during incubation with TPP plus pyruvate involving acetylation of the protein groups (35Korotchkina L.G. Ali M.S. Patel M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, except for the mutant S3E E1 with only about 10% inhibition, all other mutant E1s tested showed inhibition from 25% to 55%. Mutation of site 3 (S3E) could affect TPP binding, which is required to achieve the substrate-induced inactivation. It is noteworthy that inactivation of the site 1 mutant E1s (S1A, S1E, and S1Q) was only about one-half (∼26%) as compared with that observed for the wild-type E1 (∼55%). This may be due to the different conformation of the active site and/or protection of the protein groups involved in the substrate-induced inactivation (S1A, S1E, S1Q). To further investigate the changes in TPP binding, pyrophosphate was used as a competitive inhibitor of TPP in wild-type and mutant E1s in the PDC assay (Table I). Glutamate substitution at site 2 or site 3 caused a marked reduction in its affinity for pyrophosphate that correlated with the increased apparent K m values for TPP (Table I). The less efficient binding of pyrophosphate may be due to the presence of the negative charge in the S2E and S3E mutant E1s. However, the mutant S2Q also showed a 3-fold increase inK i. Unfortunately, the K i value for the S1E and S1Q mutant E1s could not be determined due to the lack of activity of this enzyme in the PDC assay. E1 is able to use α-ketobutyrate and α-ketoisovalerate as substrates in the DCPIP assay (36Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and only α-ketobutyrate in the PDC assay (due to specificity of the E2 component) (37Bisswanger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possible changes in substrate recognition by the E1 mutants (TableII). The mutants of site 1 (except S1D) had higher activity with α-ketobutyrate than wild-type E1. The most striking observation was a 5-fold higher activity of the S1Q mutant E1 compared with wild-type E1. The DCPIP activity of S1Q with α-ketobutyrate as a substrate (169 milliunits/mg) was as high as the activity with pyruvate as a substrate (153 milliunits/mg), whereas the activity of the wild-type E1 with α-ketobutyrate as a substrate (34 milliunits/mg) was much less than with pyruvate (242 milliunits/mg) (Table II). The E1 mutants of sites 2 and 3 displayed activity nearly similar to the wild-type E1 with α-ketobutyrate as a substrate, whereas their activity with pyruvate was less than that observed for the wild-type E1. When α-ketoisovalerate, the α-keto acid of isoleucine, was used as a substrate, all of the mutants display"

PIP2 is the best substrate for phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, and PIP2hydrolysis generates two second messengers, 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binds to specific receptors and induces release of calcium from intracellular stores (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar), whereas DG activates protein kinase C (PKC) (2Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5734) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PIP2 can be further phosphorylated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase for generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a mediator of cell growth and survival (3Auger K.R.

In addition, PIP2 directly modulates the activity of numerous enzymes and proteins involved in diverse cellular processes including exocytosis (5Hay J.C. Fisette D.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K.

Consistent with this important role played by PIP2 in cellular signaling, intracellular PIP2 levels are strictly regulated (10Hokin L.E. Int. Rev.

In response to various extracellular stimuli, a hydrolysis of PIP2 has taken place, and its levels are rapidly decreased, resulting in the shortage of PIP2. However, since compensatory synthesis of PIP2 is rapidly induced, PIP2 levels are constantly maintained, and the subsequent generation of second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DG is renewed (12Kaulen H.D. Gross R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1976; 35: 364-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PIP2 is synthesized from phosphatidylinositol (PI) by two lipid kinases, phosphatidylinositol kinase (PIK) and PIPK. At least two immunologically distinct PIPK subtypes, PIPK type I and PIPK type II (13Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

Most PIP2 synthesis is catalyzed by type I enzymes, which phosphorylate the D-5 position of the inositol ring of PI 4-phosphate (PI4P). Recently, type II enzymes have been reported to be a PI 5-phosphate 4-kinase (19Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C.

However, a lot of parts are not yet clear to explain how PIPK activity is regulated by extracellular stimulation during a few minutes in cells. Considering this, we hypothesized that PIPKI itself is a substrate for some protein kinase in response to extracellular stimuli, which allows it to regulate the enzymatic activity. In particular, this is reasonable, since PIPKI from plasma membrane ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe is phosphorylated by casein kinase I and is thereby inactivated (33Vancurova I. Choi J.H. Lin H. Kuret J. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and activation of PKC by phorbol ester PMA treatment, which leads to phosphorylation of cellular proteins, stimulates PIP2 synthesis (22Halenda S.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Boon A.M. Beresford B.J. Mellors A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, tyrosine phosphoproteins associated with EGF receptor have PI4K and PIPK activity (24Payrastre B. Plantarid M. Breton M. Chambaz E. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Cochet C. Filhol O. Payrastre B. Hunter T. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 637-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these data, there is still no direct evidence for regulation of PIPK activity by phosphorylation in mammalian cells. Thus, in this study, we examine whether there is a kinase that catalyzes PIPK phosphorylation and thereby regulates the activity. Here we show that PIPKI is phosphorylated and inactivated by protein kinase A (PKA) both in vitro and in vivo, and we identify the PKA phosphorylation site of PIPKIα. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of PIPKIα in response to LPA treatment is induced by dephosphorylation of PIPKIα. Our findings suggest that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of PIPKIα are important for regulation of PIP2 biosynthesis and phospholipid signaling in cells. PI4P was purified by neomycin column chromatography from crude phospholipids extracted from bovine spinal cord (34Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blot analysis were from Nihon Eido (Tokyo, Japan). Thin layer chromatography silica plates and cellulose plates for separation of phospholipids, phosphoamino acids, and phosphopeptides were from Merck.

NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Serum starvation was performed by culturing cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 12–24 h. Full-length cDNAs encoding mouse PIPKIα, PIPKIβ, and PIPKIγ were ligated into the Sal I-Bam HI site of pCMV-Myc or the Bam HI site of pEF-BOS-Myc mammalian expression vectors. NIH 3T3 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells per dish and cultured overnight. 15 μg of expression plasmid was transfected into cells by the Ca2+ phosphate method (35Winstel R.

After incubation for 4 h, cells were washed with fresh medium and cultured for an additional 12 h. In stimulation experiments, the culture medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh serum-free medium at least 12 h prior to stimulation. In protein kinase or phosphatase inhibitor experiments, various inhibitors were added throughout the preincubation for times indicated prior to addition of growth factors. Expression plasmid-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The expressed enzyme was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and washed three times with lysis buffer and then once with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA). The reaction was started by adding 50 μm PI4P, 50 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 μl. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the lipids were extracted with 1 n HCl and chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume) and spotted onto TLC plates. The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (40:13:15:12:7), and the products were observed by autoradiography or quantified with a Fuji BAS 2000 image analyzer. All assays were performed in the linear range with regard to the protein amounts and the incubation time in each assay system. Phosphorylation of PIPKI by PKA was carried out as described previously (36Von Willebrand M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 1 μg of GST-PIPKI protein was immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and then incubated in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmEGTA, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.1 μg of PKA catalytic subunit for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer or ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The reaction mixture was centrifuged, and the beads were subsequently washed three times with PBS and then subjected to PIPK activity assay or SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Myc-tagged PIPKI was immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected NIH 3T3 cells. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and then once with alkaline phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently resuspended in 2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 50% glycerol and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. 1 μg of GST-PIPKIα immobilized on beads was phosphorylated with PKA and subsequently washed first with PBS and then dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EGTA). The resulting beads were incubated in 50 μl of dephosphorylation buffer containing 0.5 units of PP1 or PP2A (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at 30 °C for 30 min. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged PIPKIα and placed in fresh serum-free medium for at least 12 h prior to initiation of metabolic 32P labeling experiments. Cells were subsequently incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h and then labeled in the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) for 6 h. After Bt2cAMP treatment, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and PIPKIα was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Immune complexes were washed once in lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The radioactive band corresponding to PIPKIα was cut out of the gel and subjected to phosphoamino acid and tryptic peptide mapping. Phosphorylated proteins excised from gel bands were hydrolyzed in 6n HCl for 3 h at 110 °C. The resulting amino acids, together with standard phosphoamino acids, were spotted onto cellulose thin layer plates and were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis in 2.5% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid, pH 1.9, and then in 5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine, pH 3.5. Labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. Positions of the standard phosphoamino acids were detected by ninhydrin staining. Tryptic peptide mapping was performed as described previously (37Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 921-923PubMed Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled PIPKI was digested twice with 10 μg of tosylsulfonylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. Released phosphopeptides were spotted onto on cellulose thin layer plates and separated first by electrophoresis at 1,000 V in pH 1.9 buffer for 27 min and then by ascending chromatography in n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (75:50:15:60). Anti-Myc antibody precipitates of Myc-tagged PIPKI expressed in NIH 3T3 cells appeared as broad bands on Western blots. Thus, we first examined whether these electrophoretic mobility shifts are caused by phosphorylation of PIPKI. After NIH 3T3 cells expressing Myc-PIPKI α, β, or γ were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1, phosphorylation of all type I enzymes was evident in intact cells. These results show that the mobility shift of Myc-PIPKI was caused by phosphorylation. To identify the kinase chiefly responsible for phosphorylation of PIPKI in NIH 3T3 cells, the effects of various protein kinase inhibitors, the PKC inhibitor H7, the PKA inhibitor H89, the calmodulin dependent kinase inhibitor KN-62, and tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein on PIPKIα phosphorylation were tested. Surprisingly, H89 at 50 μm severely suppressed the shift in mobility of Myc-PIPKIα, suggesting that phosphorylation of PIPKIα occurred in a PKA-dependent manner. In contrast, no significant shift in PIPKIα mobility was observed in response to treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with any of the others inhibitors (Fig.2 A). Next, to determine whether the enzymatic activity of PIPKI is affected by its phosphorylation, the activity of Myc-PIPKIα immunoprecipitated from NIH 3T3 cells treated with or without H89 was measured. PIP kinase activity was clearly elevated in cells treated with H89, amounting to about 150% of that in cells not treated or treated with other kinase inhibitors (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, H89 inhibited phosphorylation of all PIPKI isoenzymes (Fig. 2 B). Thus, type I PIPK enzymes appear to be phosphorylated and inactivated by PKA. The effect of PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of PIPKIα, PIPKIβ, and PIPKIγ on their activities was testedin vitro with the corresponding GST-PIPKI fusion proteins expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli cells. Incubation of PIPKI proteins with the catalytic subunit of PKA and [γ-32P]ATP resulted in phosphorylation and 50% inhibition of all PIPKI subtypes (Fig.3 A). In addition, treatment of Myc-PIPKIα immunoprecipitated from NIH 3T3 cell lysates with alkaline phosphatase clearly decreased the electrophoretic mobility of Myc-PIPKIα and increased its activity by about 170% (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, incubation of the Myc-PIPKIα immunoprecipitates with PKA catalytic subunit did not significantly decrease PIPK activity, despite additional mobility shifts. The shift in mobility of PIPKIα by in vitro PKA phosphorylation was likely due to phosphorylation of physiologically irrelevant sites that are not phosphorylated in vivo and do not affect PIPK activity. To determine directly the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of PIPKI, activity of PIPKIα was examined in a time-dependent manner during phosphorylation by PKA. After [γ-32P]ATP addition, the level of GST-PIPKIα phosphorylation was maximal in 20 min and sustained for at least 1 h. The inhibition time course of PIPKIα activity, (maximally inhibited to 50% of the control) correlated closely with the phosphorylation time course by PKA, showing that activity of PIPKIα is regulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation (Fig.4). we next tried to characterize the phosphorylation sites of PIPKIα by PKA. Phosphoamino acid analysis of [32P]GST-PIPK Iα, which was produced in vitro by incubation with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP, revealed predominant phosphorylation of only serine residues (Fig. 5). No phosphotyrosine was detected by Western blot analysis with PY-20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). To identify further the PKA phosphorylation sites of PIPKIα, wild type and several C-terminal deletion mutants of PIPKIα were constructed and designated Iα full, Iα-(1–392), Iα-(1–260), and Iα-(1–175), respectively. The wild type and mutants were expressed in E. coli cells to produce GST fusion proteins. Purified GST proteins were incubated with the PKA catalytic subunit and [γ-32P]ATP, and fusion protein phosphorylation was quantified. As shown in Fig.6 A, deletion mutants Iα-(1–392) and Iα-(1–260) showed similar phosphorylation level to that of Iα full. In contrast, the Iα-(1–175) mutant, which lacks 365 C-terminal residues of PIPKIα, resulted in dramatically reduced phosphorylation, by only 3.5% of Iα full. These results suggest that the PKA phosphorylation sites exist within a central region, approximately 85 amino acids between 175 and 260 of PIPKIα. By interrogating the primary sequence of this region, we found that there are PKA phosphorylation site consensus sequence (RRX S) and serine residues conserved in all three PIPKI as shown in the results of Figs. 1, 2 B, and 3 A. Based on these results, serine-to-alanine point mutations were performed in PIPKIα that corresponded to putative PKA phosphorylation sites containing serine 207 or 214. Purified mutant and wild type PIPKIα proteins were incubated with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP, and the reaction products were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. No significant change in the level of phosphorylation was observed in the S207A mutant. In contrast, the phosphorylation level of S214A mutant was 60% less than that of wild type PIPKIα (Fig. 6 B). Ser-214 was likely to be a major PKA phosphorylation site in PIPKIα.Figure 6Determination of PKA phosphorylation site of PIPKIα. A, phosphorylation of C-terminal deletion mutants. C-terminal deletion mutants of GST-PIPKIα were generated with endogenous restriction enzymes,Eco RI, Hin dIII, and Sph I and designated Iα-(1–392), Iα-(1–260), and Iα-(1–175), respectively. Wild type, Iα full, and deletion mutant proteins were phosphorylated with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. B, amino acids between 175 and 260 of PIPKI are aligned. PKA phosphorylation site consensus sequences (RRX S) areshaded, and serine residues conserved in all three PIPKI isoforms are in black. Phosphorylation levels of point mutant proteins of GST-PIPKIα were tested. C, tryptic peptide mapping of PIPKIα. NIH 3T3 cells expressing Myc-PIPKIα were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Myc-PIPKIα immunoprecipitated from the labeled cell lysate and GST-PIPKIα phosphorylated with PKA in vitro were digested with trypsin. Released phosphopeptides were separated first by electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer and then by ascending chromatography. Sample origin is marked by arrow. Main phosphopeptides are numbered. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm this, peptide-map analysis was performed on tryptic cleavage fragments of wild type and mutant proteins phosphorylated by PKAin vitro. Three major phosphopeptides were detected in two-dimensional maps of wild type PIPKIα tryptic fragments (spots 1–3 in Fig. 6 C). However, in maps of S214A mutant, spots 2 and 3 had disappeared. These two spots appear to be derived from incomplete digestion products by trypsin, whereas spot 1 was not changed. However, surprisingly, tryptic peptide maps of PIPKIα expressed in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in only two phosphopeptides, which have disappeared in maps of S214A mutant. In addition, treatment of the cells with Bt2cAMP neither induced phosphorylation of additional sites nor significantly increased the phosphorylation level of Ser-214 (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that PIPKIα exists as the Ser-214 phosphorylated form in most NIH 3T3 cells. Western blot analysis using lysates of NIH 3T3 cells expressing S214A mutant showed that this mutated PIPKIα protein had migrated to the lowest mobile band (data not shown). It is well known that PIPK activity is increased in response to various extracellular stimuli. However, little is known about the signal pathway that leads to PIPKIα activation. Thus, we first examined how phosphorylation of PIPKI is changed in response to extracellular stimuli. As shown in Fig. 7 A, stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells with LPA induced a transient but clear suppression of PIPKIα phosphorylation, which peaked at 3 min and then rapidly declined. Good correlation was observed between PIPKI dephosphorylation and activation. Since LPA activates pathways involving PKC and/or Ca2+ signaling in a variety of cells (43Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 44van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 45Cook S.J. McCormick F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 46Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NIH 3T3 cells were treated with the phorbol ester PMA, an activator of PKC. This treatment induced a strong dephosphorylation, and PIPKIα activity increased by about 150% of the untreated control at 30 min (Fig. 7 B). However, as shown in Fig. 7 C, treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with calphostin C, a selective PKC inhibitor, completely blocked PIPKIα dephosphorylation in response to LPA. To assess the requirement of Ca2+ in this regulation, we next used a combination of EGTA and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-AM, antagonist of Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ entry. Interestingly, LPA-induced dephosphorylation and activation of PIPKIα was not different (data not shown). Ionophore, A23187, treatment also had no effect (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that a PKC-dependent pathway, not a Ca2+-dependent pathway, played a key role in the dephosphorylation and activation of PIPKIα in response to LPA. Furthermore, we examined whether major serine/threonine phosphates such as protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase type 2 (PP2A) are involved in the LPA-induced dephosphorylation of PIPKIα. Pretreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with okadaic acid (OA), a potent inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, also completely blocked dephosphorylation and activation by LPA (Fig. 7 C), suggesting that an OA-sensitive phosphatase, PP1 or PP2A, presumably regulates dephosphorylation and activation of PIPKIα in response to LPA stimulation. To examine whether OA-sensitive phosphatase directly participates in dephosphorylation and activation of PIPKIα, dephosphorylation assays were performed with 32P-labeled GST-PIPKIα, which was produced by incubation with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP in vitro. As shown in Fig. 8, PP1 clearly dephosphorylated and activated PIPKIα.32P-Labeled GST-PIPKIα treated with PP2A was also found to be dephosphorylated; however, its activity remained unchanged (data not shown). Taking these results together, we conclude that activation via dephosphorylation of PIPKIα is catalyzed by PP1. In the present study, we show that PIPKI is a phosphoprotein, and the PIPKI phosphorylation state is dynamically regulated by the opposing actions of a PIPKI kinase and a PIPKI phosphatase in response to external stimuli (Fig. 9). Most of the PIPKIα expressed in NIH 3T3 cells existed in fully phosphorylated form by PKA at serine 214 even in the resting cells, which was likely to allow PIPKIα to be in an inactive state. In fact, when NIH 3T3 cells expressing PIPKIα were stimulated with Bt2cAMP, we saw no significant mobility shift (data not shown). However, potential stimuli such as LPA led to dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of PIPKIα. PP1 was identified as a primary candidate for LPA-mediated PKC-dependent phosphatase. In addition, from the results of Fig. 3 B and in vitro dephosphorylation with PP2A, PP2A is likely to function at another phosphorylation site, not Ser-214, that is phosphorylated by PKA only in vitro. Ser-214 is a major phosphorylation site of PIPKIα by PKA in vitro and in vivo. This site is conserved in both type I (14Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and type II isoenzymes (18Ito T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, type II enzymes do not have perfect PKA phosphorylation site consensus sequences, and we did not detect any mobility shift of type IIα by Western blot analysis after treatment with either H89 or Bt2cAMP. This is consistent with results of earlier studies showing that PIPKIIγ is phosphorylated by a serine kinase but not by PKA or PKC (18Ito T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, in NIH 3T3 cells, activity regulation via phosphorylation of PIPK type I is more likely to be important for maintaining intracellular total PIP2 levels because PI4P, the major substrate for PIPKI, is extremely abundant than PI5P, the substrate for PIPK type II (19Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Several groups reported that PIP2 synthesis is regulated by extracellular stimuli. Treatment of HEK-293 cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitor alters PIP2 levels (38Rumenapp U. Schmidt M. Olesch S. Ott S. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Rho protein and phospholipase D activation appear to be involved in this process. However, involvement of PIPK was also remained unclear, and in the present study, we did not detect any change in phosphorylation or activation of PIPKIα in NIH 3T3 cells in response to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-EGF antibody from EGF receptor-transfected mouse cells or A431 cells, an epidermoid carcinoid cell line overexpressing EGF receptors, showed PIK activity and PIPK activity (24Payrastre B. Plantarid M. Breton M. Chambaz E. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Cochet C. Filhol O. Payrastre B. Hunter T. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 637-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in any case, tyrosine phosphorylation by itself did not alter the activity of PIPK. Thus, it seems likely that some other tyrosine kinase or phosphotyrosyl protein interacts with both EGF receptor and PIK or PIPK. Although involvement of PKC in the inositol phospholipid metabolism has been also investigated in many reports, the exact role PKC plays is not well understood. PMA treatment increased PIP2 levels 1.5–2.5-fold in lymphocytes (23Boon A.M. Beresford B.J. Mellors A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and in human platelets (22Halenda S.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) but did not stimulate PIP2 hydrolysis by phospholipase C. Thus, direct effect on inositol lipid kinase or phosphatase through activation of PKC was suggested (22Halenda S.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results in this study provided evidence suggesting that PKC, which is usually activated by the PIP2 hydrolysis product DG, contributes to maintenance of PIP2 level through a feedback regulation of PIPKI in response to receptor activation. PIP2 synthesis is also regulated by GTP-binding proteins. Phosphatidic acid (PA)-stimulated PIPK activity was found to be associated with Rac in a GTPγS-dependent manner in liver and Swiss 3T3 cells (39Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and interaction between Rho and PIPK activity was demonstrated in mouse fibroblast cell lines (30Ren X.D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M, A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 31Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In addition, the ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) interacts with PIPK. Godi et al. (40Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Tullio G.D. Iurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and Jones et al. (41Jones D.H. Morris J.B. Morgan C.P. Kondo H. Irvine R.F. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) recently showed that PIPKI and PI4Kβ are direct effectors of ARF1. ARF1 activated by GTPγS recruits PIPKI and PI4Kβ to the Golgi complex, resulting in a potent stimulation of PIP2 synthesis in Golgi membrane, and these effects were independent of the known activities of ARF on a coat proteins and phospholipase D. At the Golgi membranes, PIP2 stimulates not only guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ARF1 but also a GTPase-activating factor for ARF1 in a PA-dependent manner. Thus, PIP2 up-regulates and down-regulates ARF activity and, consequently, vesicular trafficking in Golgi membrane. Therefore, control of PIP2levels at this cellular compartment is essential. Phosphorylation of PIPKI by PKA may reduce PIP2 resynthesis in Golgi membrane and participate in feedback regulation of ARF1 activity. In fact, when we tested the effect of PA on the activity of PIPK, inhibition of PIPKI activity by phosphorylation was not affected by PA (data not shown). Recently, Martin et al. (42Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Rosa J.L. Crottet P. Velasco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19050-19059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that activation of PKA induces binding of ARF1 to Golgi membranes, and this binding is mediated by an unknown target protein, which is phosphorylated by PKA and dephosphorylated by OA-sensitive phosphatase. In addition, this step is not dependent on guanine nucleotides. Therefore, we speculate that the target protein that is phosphorylated by PKA is PIPKI and that PIP2 formed by PIPKI promotes stable association of ARF1 with the Golgi membrane. Instead of guanine nucleotide factors, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PIPKI is likely to regulate activity of ARF1 and thereby control its association with Golgi membrane. That is, PIPKI first increases recruitment of ARF1 in Golgi membrane through PIP2 generation, and then inactivation of PIPKI by PKA-dependent phosphorylation would likely promote the generation or extraction of trafficking vesicles, thereby subsequently stimulating the ARF recruitment cycle to Golgi membrane. We expect that further studies with antibodies that specifically recognize PIPKI phosphorylated at Ser-214 will help address this speculation."
https://openalex.org/W2009465486,"Bacterial invasion, like the process of phagocytosis, involves extensive and localized protrusion of the host cell plasma membrane. To examine the molecular mechanisms of the membrane remodeling that accompanies bacterial invasion,soluble NSF attachment proteinreceptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane traffic was studied in cultured cells during infection by Salmonella typhimurium. A green fluorescent protein-tagged chimera of VAMP3, a SNARE characteristic of recycling endosomes, was found to accumulate at sites of Salmonella invasion. To analyze the possible role of SNARE-mediated membrane traffic in bacterial infection, invasion was measured in cells expressing a dominant-negative form of N -ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor (NSF), an essential regulator of membrane fusion. Inhibition of NSF activity did not affect cellular invasion by S. typhimurium nor the associated membrane remodeling. By contrast, Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis was greatly reduced in the presence of the mutant NSF. Most important, dominant-negative NSF significantly impaired the fusion of Salmonella-containing vacuoles with endomembranes. These observations indicate that the membrane protrusions elicited by Salmonella invasion, unlike those involved in phagocytosis, occur via an NSF-independent mechanism, whereas maturation of Salmonella-containing vacuoles is NSF-dependent.

Although it is not yet clear how a variety of bacterial species induce the formation of the vacuoles that engulf them, it has been established that the process of invasion has much in common with that of phagocytosis (1Brumell J.H. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R277-R280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Meresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Moreno E. Desjardins M. Finlay B.

Both processes typically involve membrane remodeling events, namely pseudopodial extension during phagocytosis and ruffling during bacterial invasion, and both phenomena are associated with changes in the actin cytoskeleton of the host cell (1Brumell J.H. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R277-R280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As well, like phagosomes, bacteria-containing vacuoles can undergo a maturation process (2Meresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Moreno E. Desjardins M. Finlay B. Gorvel J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E183-E188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 373-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, whereas phagocytosis and invasion are superficially similar, it is not clear whether the molecular mechanisms of internalization are shared. Current models of phagocytosis suggest that phagosomes are generated by receptor-mediated “zippering” of the host cell plasma membrane against the surface of opsonized particles, accompanied by the active extension of pseudopodia (5Griffin Jr., F.M. Griffin J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 788-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Brown E.J.

A source of intracellular membrane is required for the membrane remodeling that allows for pseudopod formation, and recent evidence suggests that specific endosomal compartments are involved in particle engulfment (9Lennartz M.R.

It is now apparent that the soluble NSFattachment protein receptor (SNARE)1 protein VAMP3, an integral component of the recycling endosome, plays an important role in phagocytosis, possibly participating in localized fusion events at the site of phagosome formation and thus driving pseudopodial extension (12Bajno L.

It is not known if endosomal compartments have a central role in the process of bacterial invasion, but the extensive membrane remodeling that accompanies cellular infection by Salmonella typhimurium suggests that invasion by this bacterial pathogen may mechanistically parallel phagocytosis. In the current study, we examined the role of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in S. typhimurium invasion. Because of the established similarities with phagocytosis, the role of VAMP3 in invasion was analyzed first. However, because the exact intracellular compartments and the repertoire of SNARE proteins that may be involved in bacterial invasion are not known, the role of membrane fusion was also investigated through the general inhibition of SNARE-mediated membrane traffic, specifically by blocking the activity of N -ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor (NSF). NSF is an ATPase/chaperone that is responsible for the disassembly of SNARE complexes and is therefore an essential regulator of intracellular membrane fusion events (13Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). We generated a mutant form of NSF (E329Q-NSF) that is deficient in ATP hydrolysis and therefore inhibits the function of endogenous NSF, resulting in a dominant-negative effect (14Ward D.M. Leslie J.D. Kaplan J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We found that acute expression of E329Q-NSF inhibits phagocytosis in a macrophage cell line. By contrast, invasion of S. typhimurium into epithelial cells was not impaired by the dominant-negative NSF; however, maturation of Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) was inhibited. Sheep red blood cells (SRBC), goat anti-SRBC IgG, and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were purchased from ICN. Human IgG was purchased from Baxter Healthcare Corp. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Wisent (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Brefeldin A and G418 were obtained from Calbiochem and Fugene 6 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-transferrin (Tfn) and tetramethylrhodamine-phalloidin were from Molecular Probes. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Latex beads (3 μm diameter), ATP, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody to α-mannosidase II was a generous gift of Dr. Marilyn Farquhar (University of California, San Diego). The phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled antibody to mouse FcγII/III receptors (CD16/CD32) was purchased from PharMingen. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide was purchased from Difco. Monoclonal antibody to human LAMP-1 was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Polyclonal antibody to GFP, Alexa 350-, and Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was obtained from Pierce. To produce an antiserum to NSF, His6-tagged recombinant NSF protein was expressed in bacteria and purified according to Whiteheartet al. (15Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The protein was then mixed with Freund's adjuvant and used to immunize rabbits by following standard procedures. The NSF antibody was affinity-purified from rabbit serum by binding to and eluting from an NSF-coupled Affi-Gel 10 column (Bio-Rad). pEGFP-N1 was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The acylation motif of Lyn kinase fused to GFP (PM-GFP) was a kind gift of Dr. Tobias Meyer (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). The VAMP3-GFP chimera is described elsewhere (12Bajno L. Peng X.-R. Schreiber A.D. Moore H.-P. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) NSF in pQE-9 (pQE-9-NSF; Whiteheart et al. (15Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar)) was a generous gift of Dr. S. Whiteheart (University of Kentucky). WT NSF was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using a multistep strategy. First, the 3′-coding region was excised from pQE-9-NSF usingHin dIII and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (pcDNA3.1–3′NSF). Second, a fragment encompassing most of the coding region of NSF, including the ATG start codon, was excised from pQE-9-NSF usingBam HI and Nhe I and ligated independently into pcDNA3.1 (pcDNA3.1–5′NSF). Third, pcDNA3.1–5′NSF was digested with Xba I and Nhe I, and this fragment was then ligated into a pcDNA3.1–3′NSF backbone that had been digested with Nhe I, yielding a complete and contiguous coding sequence of NSF within pcDNA3.1 (pcDNA3.1-NSF). The fidelity of this, and all NSF constructs employed in this study, was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Generation of an NSF gene bearing a point mutation in the ATPase domain of the D1 region of NSF was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction-mediated, plasmid-based, site-specific mutagenesis. To replace the glutamate at position 329 of NSF with glutamine (Gln substituted at Glu329), pQE-9-NSF was used as the target vector. Two complementary polymerase chain reaction primers containing the desired point mutation in NSF were made and used along with the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene Cloning Systems. Transformed bacterial clones were screened by DNA sequencing to identify clones containing the mutated form of the NSF gene in pQE9. This clone of mutant NSF cDNA was designated E329Q NSF. To introduce the E329Q mutation into NSF in pcDNA3.1,Bsp EI/Bst EII digestion of E329Q NSF in pQE-9 was used to generate a cDNA cassette, containing the mutated region of NSF, that was subcloned into like digested WT NSF in pcDNA3.1. NSF constructs in pQE9 were expressed inEscherichia coli, and the His6-tagged proteins were purified as described above. Purified wild-type and E329Q NSF proteins were used for in vitro ATPase assays using pNPP as a chromogenic ATP analogue, based on the method of Mignaco et al. (16Mignaco J.A. Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 mm ATP and 6 mm pNPP (final concentrations) were freshly added to a buffer of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.65 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. With this was mixed 20–25 μg/ml purified NSF protein, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Reactions were quenched with NaOH, to a final concentration of 60 mm, and absorbance at 425 nm was read on an Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. Activities were calculated by determining quantities of pNPP produced based on a molar extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 104m−1 cm−1(16Mignaco J.A. Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For controls with NEM, protein samples were incubated in the presence of 2.5 mm NEM for 15 min on ice prior to addition to the assay. RAW 264.7 and COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection, and FcγRIIA-transfected COS-1 cells (COS-2A) have been described previously (8Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D.C.

COS-2A were periodically maintained in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. For cell-based assays, cells were grown on 25-mm glass coverslips to 50–75% confluence. Transfections of exponentially growing populations of cells were done with the Fugene 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with either WT NSF or E329Q NSF alone or cotransfected with EGFP and then incubated, depending upon the assay, for periods of 5, 8, or 16 h prior to analysis. For cotransfections, a mass ratio of EGFP:NSF cDNA of 10:1 was used, and immunofluorescent staining of the cells was performed to confirm that greater than 95% of EGFP-positive cells were ectopically expressing NSF. To study transferrin endocytosis, cells were serum-starved for 1 h in DMEM and subsequently incubated with 50 μg/ml labeled Tfn for 30–45 min, after which excess Tfn was washed away. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 20–30 min. If permeabilization was necessary for staining of intracellular markers, fixed cells were bathed in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. Cells were then blocked with 5% skim milk powder/PBS for at least 1 h. For staining, cells were incubated in the presence of primary antibody, at 37 °C, for 1½ h, washed, incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h, washed, and mounted using DAKO mounting medium (DAKO Corp.). For analysis of VAMP3-GFP expression and cleavage by TeTx, transfected cells were lysed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentrations of the extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples were boiled in sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore), and the membranes were then blocked with 5% milk powder in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6). The membranes were probed with a polyclonal antibody to GFP, washed, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. After washing, the labeled proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To analyze cell surface Fc receptor expression, transfected RAW cells were incubated with PE-labeled anti-Fc receptor antibody for 1 h on ice. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACStar Plus flow cytometer and CELLQUEST software (Becton Dickinson). The filter settings were 530/30 and 575/26 nm for GFP and PE, respectively. Quantitation of NSF expression and transferrin labeling in RAW cells and of surface Fc receptor expression in COS-2A cells was done by examining labeled cells with a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope. Cell Images were captured using WinView 32 software (Princeton Instruments) and subsequently analyzed using NIH Image software. Individual cell boundaries were defined manually, and fluorescence intensity was integrated over calculated cell areas. For phagocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells, 3-μm latex beads were opsonized with human IgG, 1 h room temperature, and washed with PBS to remove unbound IgG. Opsonized beads were then added to RAW cells plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound beads were then washed away, and internalized beads were quantified under Nomarski optics. For phagocytosis in COS-2A cells, SRBCs were opsonized with goat anti-SRBC IgG for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, opsonized SRBCs were added to COS-2A cells plated in complete medium and incubated for 30 min or 1 h at 37 °C. Extracellular SRBCs were removed by hypotonic lysis (water, 30 s), and internalized SRBCs were quantified as above. When assessing phagocytosis in cells transfected with EGFP, it was possible to quantify internalized particles using fluorescence microscopy due to the exclusion of GFP from the interior of the phagosomes. In this way, cells could be fixed after phagocytosis and counter-stained, for example with NSF antibody in experiments where cells had been cotransfected with NSF cDNA. To assess particle binding efficiency, transfected RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with opsonized SRBCs for 30 min at 4 °C. Nonadherent SRBCs were washed away with PBS, and the number of bound SRBCs/cell was quantified under light microscopy. The S. typhimurium strain 1344 was used and has been described previously (20Francis C.L. Starnbach M.N. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3077-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Overnight bacterial cultures were diluted 1:30 into fresh Luria-Burtani broth and incubated at 37 °C, shaking for 3 h. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 2 min and then resuspended in PBS. The bacteria were diluted in Earle's buffered salt solution (EBSS), pH 7.4, and added to COS-1 cells that had been plated on coverslips at a density of ∼50 bacteria per cell. Infection was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. Excess bacteria were washed away with PBS, and the cell monolayers were then incubated in growth medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were processed for immunofluorescence by fixing in 2.5% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, washing, and blocking with 1% BSA/2% donkey serum/PBS. Samples were stained for external bacteria by incubating with rabbit anti-S. typhimurium LPS antibody followed by Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody. Subsequent to this, the samples were again incubated in blocking buffer, this time containing 0.1% saponin. The samples were then stained for total bacteria (external and internalized) with the same primary antibody followed by Alexa 350-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody. For examination of vacuole maturation, fixed and permeabilized samples were stained for total bacteria with the anti-LPS antibody and Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody and counterstained for LAMP-1 with the monoclonal anti-human LAMP-1 antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the focal exocytosis of VAMP3-containing vesicles at sites of particle internalization during phagocytosis (12Bajno L. Peng X.-R. Schreiber A.D. Moore H.-P. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the possibility that VAMP3-containing vesicles may play a role in the membrane remodeling that accompanies cellular invasion by S. typhimurium. Cells expressing a chimeric VAMP3-GFP construct (12Bajno L. Peng X.-R. Schreiber A.D. Moore H.-P. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) were subjected to invasion by S. typhimurium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shortly after infection (6–8 min), the distribution of VAMP3-GFP was monitored by fluorescence microscopy, whereas the localization of bacteria was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody to S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (anti-LPS). In resting COS-1 cells VAMP3-GFP was present in vesicles that were observable throughout the cytoplasm but accumulated particularly in a juxta-nuclear cluster, typical of recycling endosomes (Fig. 1 a), consistent with previously published observations (21McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Comparatively little VAMP3 was present on the cell surface in otherwise untreated cells. In cells undergoing invasion by S. typhimurium, in contrast, VAMP3-GFP was seen to accumulate at or near the plasmalemma at sites of bacterial attachment (Fig. 1, b andc). Accumulation of VAMP3-GFP occurred both at sites whereSalmonella bacteria were external and at sites where the bacteria had been internalized. However, although VAMP3-GFP accumulated at these sites, it was not clear if this represented only intracellular movement of the fluorescent protein or mobilization and exocytosis of this SNARE at sites of invasion. To examine this possibility, we tested for the appearance of the COOH terminus of VAMP3-GFP (bearing the GFP moiety) on the cell surface by staining the cells with an antibody against GFP. Following invasion, COS-1 cells transfected with VAMP3-GFP were gently fixed (using 2.5% paraformaldehyde) but not permeabilized. Staining of the cells then revealed external GFP (Fig. 1 d) at sites of VAMP3-GFP accumulation (Fig. 1 e) that corresponded with sites of attachment of external bacteria (Fig.1 f). These observations indicate that accumulation of VAMP3-GFP can occur prior to internalization of S. typhimurium and that the accumulation of this chimera is accompanied by its insertion into the plasma membrane. The localization and plasmalemmal insertion of VAMP3-GFP at sites of bacterial invasion suggest that membrane fusion events mediated by this SNARE may contribute to the membrane remodeling that is involved in bacterial invasion. To test this possibility, a cDNA encoding the light chain of the tetanus toxin (TeTx) was cotransfected into COS-1 cells along with VAMP3-GFP. To confirm that cotransfection of these two vectors resulted in significant cleavage of VAMP3-GFP, transfected cell populations were harvested and examined by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody. Fig. 2 shows an anti-GFP Western blot of extracts from mock-transfected COS-1 cells (lane 1) and COS-1 cells transfected with EGFP alone (lane 2), VAMP3-GFP alone (lane 3), or VAMP3-GFP plus TeTx (lane 4). Comparison of lanes 3 and4 reveals that coexpression of TeTx and VAMP3-GFP results in essentially the complete cleavage of the VAMP3-GFP chimera. The two lower bands in lanes 3 and 4 are protein species, possibly products of degradation, that are not influenced by coexpression of tetanus toxin. To study the effect of TeTx on the mobilization of VAMP3-GFP that accompanies Salmonella invasion, COS-1 cells were transfected with both VAMP3-GFP and TeTx prior to invasion assays withS. typhimurium. As depicted in Fig.3 b, the expression of TeTx altered the distribution of VAMP3-GFP within COS-1 cells. Tetanus toxin is known to cleave the cytoplasmic portion of VAMP3, and the observed redistribution of this SNARE is indicative of the accumulation of the transmembrane/lumenal domain-GFP moiety of the chimera in the Golgi apparatus (22Randhawa V.K. Bilan P.J. Khayat Z.A. Daneman N. Liu Z. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Peng X.R. Coppola T. Regazzi R. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2403-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Most important, in COS cells coexpressing VAMP3-GFP and TeTx, accumulation of VAMP3-GFP at sites of S. typhimurium invasion was markedly reduced (Fig. 3, b andc). The observation that TeTx blocked the accumulation of VAMP3 near sites of Salmonella invasion prompted us to test whether TeTx would also block Salmonella invasion, in a manner analogous to its known effect on phagocytosis (10Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Sjolin C. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To quantitate the effect of TeTx on invasion, transfected cells were exposed to S. typhimurium, and the fraction of cells harboring intracellular bacteria was estimated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see also Fig. 3, d–f). Surprisingly, whereas expression of TeTx altered the basal distribution of VAMP3 and prevented its accumulation at sites of bacterial internalization, it had no discernible effect on the number of cells invaded bySalmonella (Fig. 4). As well, the number of bacteria that invaded individual COS-1 cells was not affected by the expression of tetanus toxin (data not shown). Furthermore, expressing EGFP, alone, or EGFP and TeTx in COS-1 cells had no effect on Salmonella invasion (not shown). These results suggest that, although VAMP3 accumulates at sites of invasion, accumulation and function of this protein are not required for S. typhimurium entry into the cells. The finding that TeTx had no effect on Salmonella invasion contrasts with previous studies that demonstrated a role of VAMP proteins in phagocytosis (10Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Sjolin C. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These results are not necessarily incompatible because, although VAMP3 may be required for phagocytosis, other SNARE proteins, possibly including TeTx-insensitive isoforms of VAMP, may be essential for S. typhimurium invasion. It is impractical and in some cases impossible to use specific toxins to test the function of all the SNARE proteins expressed in COS-1 cells that may be involved in Salmonella invasion. Instead, a general inhibitor of SNARE-mediated membrane traffic was sought. A logical target for this purpose was NSF, an ATPase/chaperone protein responsible for the disassembly of SNARE complexes and an essential regulator of membrane fusion events. To inhibit NSF activity, we introduced a point mutation in the Chinese hamster NSF gene which resulted in the substitution of glutamine for glutamic acid at residue 329 (E329Q) within the catalytic site of the D1 domain of NSF. E329Q-NSF has been described elsewhere and shown to form hexamers that bind ATP but do not hydrolyze it (14Ward D.M. Leslie J.D. Kaplan J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). When mixed with wild-type protein, E329Q-NSF forms mixed hexamers that also lack activity, leading to a dominant-negative effect. To verify the effectiveness of the mutation, purified, recombinant wild-type, and mutant NSFs were assayed for nucleotidase activity in vitro, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild-type NSF had an activity of 0.382 ± 0.019 μmol pNPP/mg/h (means ± S.E.). Wild-type NSF, incubated with 2.5 mm NEM, had an activity of 0.05 ± 0.023 μmol of pNPP/mg/h, and the activity of E329Q-NSF was 0.142 ± 0.011 μmol of pNPP/mg/h. Consistent with the findings of others (15Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), the intrinsic activity of E329Q NSF was ∼30% that of wild-type NSF. The remaining nucleotidase activity of E329Q-NSF is attributable to the second catalytic site in the D2 domain of the protein (15Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M."

The genetic basis underlying the ontogenesis of opioid receptors in animals has been disclosed for the kappa opioid receptor (KOR)1 from studying transgenic animal models in our laboratory (17Hu X. Cao S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Opioid receptors are expressed specifically in the central nervous system in the adult, primarily in the areas associated with pain sensation and behavior changes, but how they are expressed in these tissues/cells is not understood. Recently, we have demonstrated the expression of opioid receptors in early developing animals (18Chen H.-C. Wei L.-N. Loh H.H. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In a KOR-lacZ transgenic reporter mouse model (17Hu X. Cao S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that an ∼4-kilobase pair sequence, which spans 3 kilobase pairs of the 5′ untranscribed region, the first exon, the first intron, and the translational control located in exon 2 of the mouse KOR gene, is able to direct lacZ reporter expression, recapitulating most of the endogenous KOR expression patterns during developmental stages as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (16Zhu Y. Hsu M.S Pintar J.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2538-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most significantly, KOR-lacZ is expressed widely in early developing embryos and is restricted more to the nervous system and sensory organ primordia in mid- to late-gestation stages (17Hu X. Cao S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To understand how the KOR gene is regulated for specific expression in developing animals, we have tested various hormones and opioid compounds in developing animals as well as an embryonal carcinoma cell model, P19, which constitutively expresses the KOR gene (18Chen H.-C. Wei L.-N. Loh H.H. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found retinoic acid (RA) to be a potent suppressor of the KOR gene in both animals and P19 cells. This study aims at understanding the mechanism of RA suppression of KOR gene expression. We now report the identification of an intronic silencer element that contains a binding site for the Ikaros 1 (Ik-1) transcription factor. Ik-1 is induced by RA in P19, and its overexpression in P19 results in suppressed KOR mRNA expression, accompanied by chromatin histone deacetylation on the KOR promoters. This study proposes a novel mechanism of targeted suppression of the opioid receptor gene by RA through Ik-1 binding to an intronic silencer, which renders histone deacetylation of the promoters. The homologous reporters were constructed by inserting different KOR genomic DNA fragments (19Lu S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into a luciferase cassette lacking the promoter pGL3B (Promega, Madison, WI). K45 contained a KOR genomic fragment of 1320 bp from the BamHI site to the ATG codon. K18 and K19 were truncated from K45, generating reporters starting from the end of exon I (retaining intact intron 1) or deleted in intron 1, respectively. K20 was generated by removing intron I from its original position in K45 and inserting it in front of the BamHI site. K27 was made by deleting 76 bp (SphI site) from K20. The heterologous reporters were constructed by fusing various KOR genomic fragments to either the tK (K38, K50, K49, and K48) or SV40 (K85) promoter. K38, K50, K49, and K48 each contained a KOR sequence of 387 bp (−401 to −15), 310 bp (−324 to −15), 257 bp (−271 to −15), and 149 bp (−163 to −15), respectively. K85 contained a 128-bp KOR sequence (−269 to −142). All of the nucleotide positions were numbered in relationship to the initiating codon, ATG. The expression vector of Ik-1 was a gift from Dr. S. T. Smale (20Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G. Turck C. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutated reporters K97 (m1) and K99 (m2) were made by introducing these mutated sequences into the background of K45 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and K98 and K100 were made in the background of K85. COS-1 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). P19 cell were transfected using Superfect lipofection (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). A specific reporter (0.5 μg) and 0.05 μg of cytomegalovirus-lacZ internal control were used in each transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and specific reporter gene activity, after normalizing to internal control and represented as relative luciferase units, was determined as described previously (21Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All of the transfection experiments were carried out at least three times with duplicate or triplicate cultures to obtain the means and the standard errors of the means. Two methods were used to examine endogenous Ik-1 expression in P19 cells, including reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analyses. P19 cells were transfected with either an Ik-1 expression vector (20Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G. Turck C. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or an empty vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by Superfect lipofection. Twenty hours after transfection, total RNA was isolated, and KOR expression was detected with an established RT-PCR protocol (22Wei L.-N. Hu X. Bi J. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar). For RA treatment, P19 cells were treated with 1 μmall-trans-RA for 18, 24, or 48 h or for 3 days. The Ik-1 specific primers are 5′-GGTGAACGGCCTTTC3-′ (exon 4) and 5′-TTCTTCCTTAATGAC-3′ (exon 6) (20Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G. Turck C. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Amplified KOR (730, 760, and 800 bp for isoforms a, b, and c, respectively) and Ik-1 (304 bp) fragments were detected on Southern blots and quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Actin-specific primers were included for internal control in each RT-PCR. For Northern blot analysis, RNA was isolated from P19 and separated on a denaturing agarose gel followed by blotting onto a nylon membrane and detection with Ik-1 cDNA probes. The sequence of the wild type Ik element on intron 1 of the KOR gene is 5′-GGGTGGGAAGGGGATTT-3′, and two mutants with mutations (underlined) introduced into either the first or the second repeat are 5′-GGGTGTTAAGGGGATTT-3′ (m1) and 5′-GGGTGGGAAGGTTATTT-3′ (m2), respectively. The annealed oligos were end-labeled with –[α-32P]dCTP by Klenow fragment. Ik-1 protein was synthesized in TNT reactions (Promega) from a T7 expression vector (pSP73, Promega) that contained Ik-1 cDNA. DNA-protein interactions were detected as described (23Chinpaisal C. Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18077-18085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of TNT product was incubated with 2 ng of labeled DNA fragments at 4 °C for 30 min, and the reaction mixture was resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels followed by PhosphorImager analyses. For antibody reactions, 2 μl of antibody (20-fold dilution) and TNT product were allowed to react at 4 °C for 15 min followed by the addition of DNA probes for 30 min at 4 °C. COS-1 cells (10-cm plate) were transfected with a KOR reporter (K45) containing both promoters 1 and 2 together with either the Ik-1 expression vector or an empty vector. The ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, histone was cross-linked to DNA by the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%, and cells were sonicated in 200 μl of lysis buffer. One-quarter of the total lysate was used for monitoring total DNA input, which was diluted 20-fold in PCR. The rest of the lysate was cleared with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose slurry. One-half of the cleared lysate was incubated with an anti-acetylated Histone 3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, and the other half was used for a negative control (nonspecific antibody). After reversing the cross-link, the eluted immunocomplex was digested with proteinase K, and DNA was purified by phenol extraction. DNA was precipitated for detection by PCR with primers specific to the KOR promoter regions, i.e. 5′-GATGCACAGTAGCTTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCAAGGAAGCAAGTGGTAGC-3′ for promoter 1 and 5′-GAGGGTGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-CTGGAAAGCGAGAAGGTG-3′ for promoter 2. Amplified fragments were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. For the ChIP assay to determine Ik-1 binding to the KOR sequence in P19, an anti-Ik antibody was used to precipitate chromatin. To amplify sequence flanking the Ik-binding site, primers 5′-CCCGAGGGTGAAGCAA-3′ and 5′-TGGCCGCCCATCCCAA-3′ were used to amply a fragment of 126 bp flanking the Ik-binding site. Previously, we showed that three mouse KOR isoform mRNA species could be generated as a result of using dual promoters and alternative splicing (19Lu S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Wei L.-N. Hu X. Bi J. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we detected constitutive expression of the KOR gene in mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 stem cells (18Chen H.-C. Wei L.-N. Loh H.H. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In an attempt to examine the KOR gene expression pattern in RA-induced P19 cell differentiation model, we found that RA suppressed total KOR gene expression in P19. To examine the suppressive nature of RA on the expression of KOR mRNA isoforms, we used an established RT-PCR procedure with the help of specific primers to detect the expression of specific KOR mRNA isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1, it appeared that all three isoforms, a, b, and c, were suppressed by RA in P19 cells. Because the potential regulatory sequence common to the three isoform mRNA species is intron 1, we then determined whether intron 1 was involved in KOR suppression by using reporter assays conducted in P19 cells, as shown in Fig.2A. Three KOR reporters, K45, K19, and K20, each contained or deleted in intron 1, were generated and tested in P19 cells. The two constructs, which contained intron 1 in either its natural position (K45) or a relocated upstream position (K20), were both suppressed as compared with the construct deleted in intron 1 (K19), suggesting that intron 1 contained a sequence responsible for suppression of the KOR gene in P19 background. An Ik-binding site (5′-GGGAAGGGGAT-3′) located at −278 to −288, ∼185 bp upstream of the promoter 2 initiation site, was found by sequence alignment. Intron 1 sequence was then further dissected and fused to a heterologous promoter, thymidine kinase (tK) promoter, and tested in P19 cells as shown in Fig. 2B. All three of the reporters (K38, K50, and K49) that retained this putative Ik-binding site were suppressed, whereas the reporter deleted in this putative Ik-binding site (K48) was not suppressed as compared with the controltk reporter. These results suggested that the Ik-binding sequence of intron 1 in the KOR gene could be a negative element that might be responsible for its suppression by RA in P19. We then determined whether Ik-1 had a suppressive effect on KOR reporter gene expression and whether the putative Ik-binding site was a functional regulatory sequence. For a functional assay of Ik-1 activity on KOR gene expression, we first examined a panel of KOR reporters, including K45, K19, K20, generated previously (Fig. 2A), and two more deletions, K18 (retaining only intron 1 at its natural position) and K27 (a shorter intron 1 placed at the upstream of promoter 1), in COS-1 cells cotransfected with an Ik-1 expression vector as shown in Fig.3A. All of the KOR reporters that retained the Ik-binding sequence were suppressed by Ik-1 expression in COS-1 cells, whereas the reporter (K19) deleted in this sequence was not suppressed. This Ik-binding site was further confirmed to be effective in the context of heterologous promoters, because the SV40 promoter driven by this sequence was also suppressed in COS-1 cells cotransfected with an Ik-1 expression vector, as shown in Fig. 3B. Moreover, the reporter containing this sequence was suppressed by Ik-1 in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 3C. Therefore, it was concluded that the Ik-binding element on KOR intron 1 was a functionally negative element responsive to Ik-1-mediated gene suppression, as determined in the context of both homologous and heterologous promoters. The data presented above showed that Ik-1 was a negative factor for KOR expression as determined in reporter assays. To further determine whether Ik-1 could suppress endogenous KOR expression in P19 stem cells, we then introduced Ik-1 expression vectors into P19 stem cells and analyzed the expression of endogenous KOR mRNAs 20 h following transfection, as shown in Fig.4. The results revealed that all three of the KOR mRNA isoforms were suppressed, although to different extents, confirming that elevated Ik-1 expression down-regulated endogenous KOR gene expression for all three mRNA isoforms. RA suppressed endogenous KOR gene expression in P19, following treatment for ∼2–3 days (Fig. 1), suggesting an indirect nature of the suppressive effect of RA. It was then predicted that RA treatment might induce regulatory components, such as Ik-1, responsible for KOR suppression. To examine such a possibility, we then determined whether Ik-1 could be induced by RA treatment in P19 cells using both RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses. Using specific primers in PCR that allowed Ik-1 to be amplified to a 304-bp fragment, it was found that Ik-1 mRNA expression was indeed elevated in RA treated cultures. As shown in Fig.5, A and B, Ik-1 was induced by RA after 18 h of treatment, and the induction peaked at 24 h and then leveled off. Fig. 5C shows the Northern blot analysis of Ik-1 mRNA expression in untreated P19 cells (ctrl) and RA-induced P19 (RA, 24 h). The bottom panel shows the amount and integrity of these RNA preparations. Ik-1 mRNA was clearly induced by RA as demonstrated in both RT-PCR and Northern blot. The experiments described above demonstrated that, in P19 cells, either RA or Ik-1 expression could suppress the expression of all three KOR mRNA isoforms. In addition, RA induced Ik-1 expression, preceding the suppression of KOR gene for ∼24 h. Therefore, Ik-1 could be a physiological mediator responsible for the suppression of the KOR gene by RA. To examine whether the Ik response element was indeed an Ik-binding element, gel mobility shift experiments were performed as shown in Fig. 6A. The wild type Ik element was bound specifically by Ik-1 protein as evidenced by the competition of cold probes (lanes 2–6). We then mutated either one of the two repeats and tested these mutated sequences for Ik-1 binding in gel shift assays. Interestingly, mutation at the first repeat (m1, lane 7) did not affect Ik-1 binding, whereas mutation at the second repeat (m2, lane 8) abolished the specific binding. Furthermore, when an anti-Ik antibody was added into the reaction mixture, the shifted band diminished, indicating a disruption of Ik-DNA interaction by this antibody. In the presence of preimmune serum, the specifically retarded band remained the same (lane 10), supporting the specificity of the effect of antibody observed on lane 9. The gel shift patterns remained the same when nuclear extracts isolated from P19 transfected with the Ik-1 expression vector were used (data not shown). To further confirm the biological activity of thisIkaros-binding sequence, the two mutations (m1 and m2) were introduced into KOR reporter K45 and the heterologous reporter K85, andIkaros-mediated repression of these reporters was examined in COS-1 cells. Mutations on the background of K45 are designated as K97 and K99 for mutants 1 and 2, respectively. Mutations on the background of K85 are designated as K98 and K100 for mutants 1 and 2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6B, mutant 1 had no effect onIkaros-mediated repression of these reporters (K97 and K99), whereas mutant 2 abolished Ikaros-mediated repression (K98 and K100). This result confirmed that repression of reporters containing the Ikaros-binding sequence was indeed mediated by Ikaros binding to this sequence. Therefore, it was concluded that the putative Ik-binding sequence on intron 1 of the KOR gene was a functional Ik-1 binding site, which could mediate the suppression of KOR gene expression. Ik-1 has been shown to be associated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes (24Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3010-3090Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which would silence target genes by deacetylating specific gene promoters. To determine whether Ik-1 binding to the KOR sequence in P19 could be enhanced by RA and whether Ik-1 expression would affect the acetylation status of histone proteins on the KOR promoters, ChIP assays were performed as shown in Fig.7. The principle was based upon immunoprecipitation of acetylated chromatin, but not deacetylated chromatin, by a specific anti-acetylated histone antibody followed by PCR detection of the immunoprecipitated DNA sequences. If, as predicted, Ik-1 could bring the HDAC complexes to KOR intron I, which was in close proximity to promoters 1 and 2, KOR promoter regions would be deacetylated upon the overexpression of Ik-1. Thus, chromatin in KOR promoters would not be immunoprecipitated with the anti-acetylated histone antibody, and no KOR promoter DNA sequences could be detected by PCR. To examine this scenario, we first tested the histone acetylation status of KOR promoters in the presence or absence of Ik-1 in COS-1 cells, as shown in Fig. 7A. COS-1 cells were transfected with the KOR reporter containing both promoters 1 and 2, K45, in the presence or absence of Ik-1 expression vector. An anti-acetylated histone antibody was used to precipitate chromatin. Immunoprecipitated chromatin DNA was then detected by PCR with primers flanking either KOR promoter 1 (top panel) or promoter 2 (middle panel). It is obvious that only in the absence of Ik-1 were KOR promoter histones acetylated, and thereby immunoprecipitated, and the DNA sequences of these regions detected (lane 2). On the contrary, in the presence of Ik-1, these KOR sequences could not be detected (lane 1), indicating histone deacetylation on these KOR promoter regions presumably brought about by Ik-1 binding. For a control of antibody specificity, a nonspecific antibody (anti-TR2) was used in parallel reactions as shown in lanes 3 and 4. With this nonspecific antibody, no PCR products were detected, confirming the specificity of immunoprecipitation of acetylated chromatin detected in lane 2. Lanes 5 and 6 are positive controls of input, lane 7 shows a negative control reaction of water, and lane 8 shows a positive control using plasmid DNA for PCR. For the control of equal loading of reactions in the presence (lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of Ik-1, a nonspecific promoter, the cytomegalovirus promoter of the expression vector, was also examined, as shown on the bottom panel of this figure. On this nonspecific promoter, chromatin acetylation was the same for reactions in the presence (lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of the Ik-1 expression vector, confirming equal loading of these two reactions. These results support the effect of Ik-1 expression on the acetylation status of KOR promoters, i.e. Ik-1 expression brings about histone deacetylation of KOR promoters. To provide evidence for changes in Ik-1 binding to the Ik-binding site of KOR in P19 cells following RA induction, a ChIP assay was conducted using an anti-Ik antibody to precipitate chromatin, as shown in Fig.7B. P19 cells were transfected with K45 and treated with RA or vehicle for 24 h. Cells were lysed for the ChIP assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Anti-Ik antibody was used to precipitate DNA, and the precipitate was subjected to PCR with specific primers flanking the Ik-binding site. As shown in lanes 1 and 2, specific fragments were amplified only in the presence of anti-Ik antibody. Moreover, RA enhanced Ik-1 binding (lane 2) to the Ik-1 binding site as compared with an untreated culture (lane 1). In the absence of anti-Ik antibody, no PCR products were detected (lanes 3 and 4). Lanes 5 and 6 show input control, lane 7 shows water control, and lane 8 shows the plasmid control. These data provide physiologically relevant evidence for RA induction of Ik-1 which acts as a negative regulator for KOR gene expression. The effect of Ik-1 is mediated by its binding to the Ik-1 element of KOR intron 1, which recruits HDAC and renders histone deacetylation of KOR promoter regions. We present the first evidence for a negative regulation of KOR gene expression by RA and provide a molecular mechanism underlying this suppressive phenomenon. P19 stem cells express KOR constitutively at a basal level, and RA induces an elevation of Ik-1 expression in these cells within 20 h. An Ik-binding element was identified in the first intron of this gene, which can be bound specifically by Ik-1 protein. This Ik-binding element is a position-independent, functional, negative DNA element as demonstrated in reporters driven by the KOR promoters or heterologous promoters. Elevation of Ik-1 in P19 suppresses the endogenous KOR gene expression for all three of the mRNA isoforms, accompanied by increased binding of Ik-1 to its intron 1 sequence and histone deacetylation in the KOR promoter regions. This study is the first to demonstrate hormonal regulation of opioid receptor gene expression, which involves chromatin remodeling brought about by a negative transcription factor that is induced by RA. The suppression of the KOR gene by RA does not occur until 2–3 days of treatment (Fig. 1), suggesting the indirect nature of RA suppression of the KOR gene. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that within a 4-kilobase pair regulatory region of the mouse KOR gene, no typical RA response element can be found. Interestingly, Ik-1 is transiently induced by RA within 20 h, preceding the suppression of KOR by RA for ∼24 h. This would leave enough time for Ik-1 to regulate the KOR gene. Because induction of Ik-1 expression occurs relatively early and levels off as culture is depleted of RA (Fig. 5), it is possible that the Ik-1 gene contains an RA response element. However, this possibility remains to be examined experimentally. The presence of a negative element in the first intron of KOR gene is interesting. This intron also encodes the second promoter of the KOR gene, and therefore, it may potentially be involved in both the transcriptional control of promoter 2 and alternative splicing of transcripts initiated from promoter 1. The fact that the suppressive activity of this intron, particularly the Ik-binding element, is position-independent and is functional in the context of heterologous promoters would suggest that this intron is a common regulatory element for both promoters 1 and 2 of the KOR gene. Furthermore, because Ik binding renders both promoters 1 and 2 of the KOR gene deacetylated, a most probable hypothesis for HDAC action on this gene is a spreading model. Upon Ik binding, HDAC is recruited and spread along the regulatory region of KOR gene. Both promoters are thus deacetylated and tightly packed. However, the extent of the suppressive effects of Ik-1 on RNA variants transcribed from the two KOR promoters may vary because this sequence can also affect splicing of transcripts derived from promoter 1 (isoforms a and b). This hypothesis is supported by the results of overexpressing Ik-1 in P19, where the three isoforms are all suppressed but to different extents (Fig. 4). According to the DNA sequence, the KOR gene belongs to the housekeeping gene category because no TATA or CCAAT boxes can be found; this is in agreement with the fact that KOR is constitutively expressed in P19 stem cells at a basal level. In our transgenic mouse model (17Hu X. Cao S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), KOR-lacZ reporter gene is also more widely expressed in early gestation stages before the birth of neurons. However, in older embryos, KOR-lacZ expression becomes restricted to specific areas of the central nervous system, primarily in sensory organ primordia. It is possible that the chromatin structure of the KOR gene is readily open in certain stem cells, such as P19 and those of young embryos, for a basal level of gene activity. When cells undergo differentiation such as being induced by RA, KOR expression is shut down in most cell lineages except specific mature KOR neurons. The silence of the KOR gene may be brought about by specific negative regulatory factors induced by RA, such as Ik-1 protein. However, it remains to be determined what positive factors are required to maintain or induce the expression of KOR gene in mature KOR neurons. Ikaros transcription factors, also named LyF-1 (25Lo K. Landau N.R. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), are found to be relatively restricted to the early stages of lymphoid cells (26Georgopoulos K.D. Moore D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). KOR expression is apparent in P19 stem cells, which constitute a pool of precursor cells for a variety of cell lineages. It is widely recognized that P19 is induced by RA to differentiate into various cell types including neurons. However, neurons, especially KOR-positive neurons, do not appear until the later stages of differentiation (18Chen H.-C. Wei L.-N. Loh H.H. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that KOR-expressing stem cells will gradually change cell fate as various transcription factors are induced by RA. Ikaros could be one of these important factors that help to shape early cell differentiation processes and turn off certain genes such as the KOR gene. In fact, KOR expression has been detected in lymphoid cell lineages, such as R1.1, in addition to mature KOR neurons (19Lu S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the suppression of the KOR gene by a lymphoid transcription factor is physiologically relevant. Important questions to be answered in the future would be why the KOR gene is active in undifferentiated cells and how the KOR gene is reactivated in mature KOR neurons after being suppressed during early stage of differentiation. Recently, two reports have demonstrated the recruitment of mSin3A·HDAC complexes to a neurally restrictive silencer element that regulates more than 20 neuron-specific genes (27Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledins R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 28Naruse Y. Aoki T. Kojima T. Mori N. Proc. Natl. Sci. Acad. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13691-13696Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrates the presence of a novel gene silencer in the KOR gene intron 1, which is a target of a specific transcription factor, Ik-1. The repressive activity of Ikaros has first been suggested to involve its interaction with mSin3, which binds to histone deacetylases (24Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3010-3090Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that Ikaros can also repress gene expression by interacting with a repressor, CtBP, that acts in a HDAC-independent manner (29Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our current studies show increased Ik-1 expression in RA-induced P19, which renders the KOR gene suppressed and histone deacetylated in the KOR promoter regions, presumably brought about by recruiting HDAC complexes. Although our studies support HDAC-dependent action of Ikaros on KOR gene expression, it cannot be ruled out that other mechanisms may exist for Ikaros-mediated KOR gene regulation, such as a potential role of other repressors in KOR regulation. Our study is a first example of negative regulation of an opioid receptor gene by RA, mediated by a transcription regulator that can potentially cause histone deacetylation on the promoters and interact with other gene repressors. We thank Drs. S. T. Smale and K. Georgopoulos for providing the Ik-1 expression vector and anti-Ik antibody. We particularly thank the members of Dr. Smale's laboratory for sharing the protocol for gel shift assays."

The assembly of bacteriophage P22 portal rings has been characterized in vitro using a recombinant, His-tagged protein. Although the portal protein remained primarily unassembled within the cell, once purified, the highly soluble monomer assembled into rings at room temperature at high concentrations with a half time of approximately 1 h. Circular dichroic analysis of the monomers and rings indicated that the protein gained α-helicity upon polymerization. Thermal denaturation studies suggested that the rings contained an ordered domain that was not present in the unassembled monomer. A combination of 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binapthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS) binding fluorescence studies and limited proteolysis revealed that the N-terminal portion of the unassembled subunit is meta-stable and is susceptible to structural perturbation by bis-ANS. In conjunction with previously obtained data on the behavior of the P22 portal protein, we propose an assembly model for P22 portal rings that involves a meta-stable monomeric subunit. The Salmonella typhimuriumbacteriophage P22 assembles an icosahedral capsid precursor called a procapsid. The oligomeric portal protein ring, located at one vertex, comprises the conduit for DNA entry and exit.

During the morphogenesis of the double-strand DNA-containing phage, the icosahedral symmetry of the head is interrupted by the presence of a unique portal vertex. In all double-strand DNA phage characterized thus far, this vertex is occupied by a single protein arranged as an oligomeric ring (1Hendrix R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In each case, the portal rings have symmetries that differ from the symmetry of the surrounding capsid resulting in a symmetry mismatch that precludes a regular interaction between the portal and capsid proteins (1Hendrix R.W.

The formation of this vertex is essential for viability, because it comprises a conduit through which the DNA enters and leaves the head during the viral life cycle. Assembly intermediates during head formation are short-lived and have not been characterized. This has hampered efforts to characterize the mechanism of portal vertex formation. The well-characterized assembly pathway of bacteriophage P22 is ideally suited for the continued investigation of such interactions.During bacteriophage P22 morphogenesis, the earliest detectable assembly intermediate is a procapsid (4King J.

When the unfolded Rubisco in guanidine hydrochloride is diluted at 4 °C, a folding intermediate (Rubisco-I) is rapidly formed, which remains in an unstable monomeric state and gradually develops into folded monomer (Rubisco-M) at 4 °C but undergoes irreversible aggregation at 25 °C. Refolding of Rubisco-I to Rubisco-M is a very slow process, taking about 20 h for 70% conversion at 4 °C. Rubisco-M is stable at 4 °C and is capable of forming an active dimer spontaneously when incubated at a temperature higher than 10 °C. The dynamic dimerization process has been measured in a temperature range of 4–35 °C by HPLC, and the results demonstrate that the dimerization is strongly facilitated by the temperature.

This is the major entry point for CO2 into the biosphere. The enzyme also catalyzes the oxygenation of the same substrate, giving rise to a molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate and a molecule of phosphoglycolate (1Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From a structural viewpoint Rubisco may be isolated in either of two forms, I and II. In higher plants, algae, and most other photosynthetic organisms, the enzyme is a complex molecule consisting of eight large (L, M r ∼ 55,000) and eight small (S,M r ∼ 14,000) subunits, forming an L8S8 (form I) complex. In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, on the other hand, the enzyme is a dimer of large subunits, L2 (form II), each of relative molecular weight 55,000 (2Tabita F.R. McFadden B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3459-3464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of Rubisco is of special biological interest for two main reasons: first, the enzyme represents a model system in the study of chloroplast biogenesis, because its subunits are synthesized in different cellular compartments. Second, it has not been possible to reconstitute any higher plant Rubisco from fully dissociated subunits (3Roy H. Cannon S. Gilson M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Studies of in vitro assembly have primarily focused on the simple dimeric enzyme from R. rubrum. It has been shown that accessory proteins or “molecular chaperones” (5Ellis R.J. Science. 1990; 250: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) are required to assist the assembly of unfolded monomers or nascent polypeptide chains along a pathway that favors the formation of the correctly folded and properly arranged active dimer (6Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 7Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). It is well established that when dimeric Rubisco from R. rubrum is synthesized in Escherichia coli, successful assembly requires fully functional chaperonin proteins: chaperonin 10 (cpn10) (GroES) and cpn60 (GroEL) (6Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated thatin vitro reconstitution of the catalytically functional dimeric Rubisco from an unfolded, biologically inert state depends on the presence of both chaperonins and MgATP (7Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 8Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The chaperonin-facilitated refolding of Rubisco can be dissected into two steps. In the first step, a non-native state of the protein, folding intermediate (Rubisco-I), is stabilized by forming a binary complex with cpn60. In the second step, cpn10 couples the K+-dependent hydrolysis of ATP to release the folded monomers of the target protein from cpn60. In the absence of chaperonins, the unfolded Rubisco could also revert spontaneously to the native state but only under a restricted set of conditions: low temperatures and low protein concentrations. Beyond these conditions, irreversible aggregation occurred (8Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 9van der Vies S.M. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Little is known about the dimerization process of the folded monomers, which is the last step in the reconstitution of native Rubisco. In most experiments the refolding process of unfolded protein to a folded monomer and the assembling process of the folded subunits to a multisubunit complex can not be distinguished, and it is difficult to produce an initial state where the folded monomers remain stable. In this study, we demonstrate that the spontaneous reconstitution to a fully active Rubisco can occur with a clearly defined two-stage process from the completely unfolded state. The unfolded Rubisco monomers fromR. rubrum first undergo slow refolding and remain in a stable monomeric state at 4 °C. Dimerization of the folded monomers is initiated by elevating temperature to above 10 °C. Rate of formation and final yield of the dimeric Rubisco is strongly dependent on the temperature in addition to the incubation time. The purple nonsulfur bacterium R. rubrum was grown in a culture medium containing butyrate as a carbon source as described previously (10Ormerod J.G. Ormerod K.S. Gest H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 94: 449-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 11Tabita F.R. McFadden B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3453-3458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rubisco from R. rubrum was prepared according to a reported procedure (11Tabita F.R. McFadden B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3453-3458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Extraction and purification of the enzyme were conducted using a buffer (pH 8.0, 4 °C) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm NaHCO3 (TEMMB buffer). The fraction precipitated in 30–60% saturated (NH4)2SO4 was resuspended in TEMMB buffer and chromatographed by a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 25 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by a gel-filtration column (Sephacryl S-200 HR, 2.5 × 100 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluted fractions containing Rubisco were chromatographed again by a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and finally by a size-exclusion HPLC column (TSKgel G3000SW, 2.15 × 30 cm, Tosoh). The enzyme was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified Rubisco was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −85 °C until use. The concentration of Rubisco was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (12Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar), giving an absorption coefficient of ε280 nm = 7.20 × 104m−1 cm−1 for Rubisco protomer. The molecular weight of Rubisco protomer was taken as 55,000 from light scattering measurement (2Tabita F.R. McFadden B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3459-3464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase activity and the CO2/O2 specificity of Rubisco were determined by 31P NMR method as described in the previous papers (13Wang Z.-Y. Luo S. Sato K. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 257: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Wang Z.-Y. Luo S. Sato K. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Photosynth.

The starting material for spontaneous reconstitution experiments was prepared by denaturing native Rubisco in guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) solution. A small aliquot of Rubisco was dissolved in 6 mGdn-HCl solution of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT) to a protomer concentration of 13.9 μm. The unfolding was continued for at least 30 min at 25 °C. Refolding was achieved by diluting 30 μl of the unfolded Rubisco into 1.47 ml of the standard refolding buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mmMgCl2 at 4 °C. To determine the degree of refolding in a particular experiment, an aliquot of native Rubisco was treated by the same procedure, except that Gdn-HCl was omitted. Dimerization was initiated by elevating the temperature of the refolded samples in an incubator for a period of time without changing the solution composition. Further experimental details are given in the figure legends. All HPLC measurements were performed in a 4 °C chamber. Buffers used for elution were degassed and filtered through a Millipore 0.22-μm filter. The samples were centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 5 min at a desired temperature prior to injection to remove any possible precipitate. Typically, 100 μl of Rubisco sample in the native, refolded, or reconstituted state was loaded on a size-exclusion HPLC column (TSKgel G3000SWXL, 0.78 × 30 cm, Tosoh) equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2m Na2SO4. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and elution of the protein was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using an ultraviolet detector (UV-8020, Tosoh). The standard molecular weight marker (Calibration Proteins II for chromatography) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals Biochemica (Germany). Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured in a wavelength range of 215 and 260 nm with a Jasco J-720W spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. Data were collected at 1.0-nm intervals with accumulation of 15 times. Autofluorescence spectra were recorded with an RF-5300PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu) using a 1- × 1-cm quartz cuvette at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 290 nm. Fluorescent probe 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt (bis-ANS) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The fluorescence experiments using bis-ANS were carried out under conditions similar to those for autofluorescence except that the excitation wavelength was set at 390 nm. Fig. 1 shows the HPLC elution profiles of native and dissociated Rubisco using a size-exclusion column. The elution buffer contained 0.2 mNa2SO4, because the silica gel-based column is a “nonideal size-exclusion” column and could not be calibrated in a low ionic strength buffer due to nonspecific ionic interactions of charged groups of the gel matrix with the protein (15Bhattacharyya D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9726-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Regnier F.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 137-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Native Rubisco, N, was eluted at 17 min as a single peak. The elution time corresponded to an apparent molecular weight of 116,000 as calculated from the calibration (Fig. 1, inset), confirming a dimeric form of the enzyme. The dissociated Rubisco monomer (after refolding for 60 min at 4 °C), M, was eluted at 18.2 min, corresponding to a monomeric form with a M r of 58,000. Because the time required for refolding and dimerization is much longer (∼8 h for 35% activity recovery) than the time used for the HPLC analysis, the whole reconstitution process can be monitored by the HPLC system. Fig. 2 A shows the time changes of HPLC elution profiles of the refolding Rubisco species at 4 °C after dilution of the guanidine-denatured protein. All the profiles exhibited similar feature with a major elution peak at 18.2 min, indicating that the Rubisco existed in a monomeric state at this temperature. There was a small peak with a slightly shorter elution time, which was thought to correspond to a dimeric form, but this peak did not develop over 24 h. Fig. 2 B shows the effect of incubation time at 4 °C (first stage) on the dimer formation. The subsequent incubation at 25 °C (second stage) was conducted for 30 min for all samples. The dimeric peaks increased significantly, and correspondingly, the monomeric peaks decreased. Further extension of the second stage incubation time to 2 h at 25 °C resulted in nearly complete conversion to the dimer species (Fig. 2 C). The remainder of the monomers that cannot be converted even for longer incubation time at 25 °C indicates the existence of a small amount of misfolded species. Activity recovery was found to have good correlation with the amount of dimers as calculated from the peak areas of the chromatograms (Fig. 2 C). It should be mentioned that reducing agent DTT is essential for both refolding and reconstitution of the active Rubisco. All experiments of refolding and reconstitution were performed in the buffer containing 5 mm DTT. Comparing the peak areas of dimer and monomer in Fig. 2, one may note that the peak areas were almost unchanged for the refolding species at 4 °C within 24 h (Fig. 2 A), whereas the total peak areas changed remarkably upon the first stage refolding time at 4 °C (Fig. 2, B and C). About two-thirds of the total species were undetected for the samples with shorter refolding times (2–2.5 h) in the first stage at 4 °C before elevating the incubation temperature to 25 °C. Because no additional peaks were detected during 0–16 min in the elution profiles, the loss of species may be attributed to the formation of large aggregates, which were finally removed by the centrifugation before injecting into the HPLC column. With the increasing refolding time at 4 °C, the total peak area increased, indicating that only the folded monomers formed in the first stage are capable of forming dimers subsequently at higher incubation temperatures. Therefore, there were at least three species in the refolding solution. At 4 °C, most species exist as monomers but in two states: one as the refolding intermediates (Rubisco-I) and the other as folded monomers (Rubisco-M). Both of the monomeric species gave essentially the same elution time in the chromatogram. In the early stage of refolding, most of the monomeric species can be considered as Rubisco-I, which is unstable at 4 °C and tends to form irreversible aggregates at 25 °C. With the increasing refolding time at 4 °C, Rubisco-I was slowly folded into a more stable Rubisco-M. Complete conversion from Rubisco-I to Rubisco-M took about 24 h under the experimental conditions of this study. Rubisco-M is stable at 4 °C and undergoes spontaneous dimerization by incubation at temperatures higher than 4 °C to form native dimer (Rubisco-N). Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of second stage dimerization of the Rubisco-M formed at 4 °C for 24 h. Higher temperature led to higher formation rate and yield of the dimer species. The temperature effect was most significant between 15 and 30 °C, as more than 90% of reconstitutable Rubisco-M was converted into dimers within 30 min of incubation at 30 °C. These results clearly demonstrate that dimerization of the Rubisco is triggered by elevation of temperature and the rate of dimer formation and final yield are strongly dependent on the temperature. The reconstituted Rubisco gave the same CD and autofluorescence spectra, along with the CO2/O2 specificity factor as the native Rubisco (supplementary material), indicating that all structural and functional characteristics have been fully recovered. HPLC technique has been extensively applied to study the dissociation and reconstitution processes of oligomeric proteins (15Bhattacharyya D.

We demonstrated in this study that the spontaneous reconstitution of active Rubisco is a sequential process in which three distinct states can be observed using the size-exclusion HPLC. On the basis of our observations, the pathway of the reconstitution of dimeric Rubisco from a completely unfolded state (Rubisco-U) may be described as follows. First, the Gdn-HCl-denatured Rubisco is rapidly converted to an unstable intermediate state, Rubisco-I, by dilution. Second, refolding of the Rubisco-I to folded monomers, Rubisco-M, is a very slow process that takes about 24 h for completion at 4 °C. We could not directly observe the difference between Rubisco-I and Rubisco-M from the chromatogram, because both species eluted at the same retention time. However, we were able to indirectly evaluate the proportion of the two species from the subsequent dimerization process, because only Rubisco-M is capable of forming an active dimer when elevating the incubation temperature. The last step is the dimerization of Rubisco-M to form the native dimeric Rubisco (Rubisco-N). We further showed that the three states can be controlled by changing either time or temperature of incubation. Proportion of Rubisco-M to Rubisco-I is determined by the incubation time at 4 °C, whereas the proportion of Rubisco-N to Rubisco-M is strongly dependent on the temperature in addition to the incubation time. Several factors are found to affect the spontaneous refolding and reconstitution processes of Rubisco. Previous studies reported that a “critical aggregation concentration” (CAC) exists in the reactivation of Rubisco (9van der Vies S.M. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Below the CAC, Rubisco-I can spontaneously develop into the native state (reactivation). However, at concentrations higher than the CAC, the Rubisco-I undergoes irreversible aggregation. The aggregation occurs rapidly (21Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and proceeds until the concentration of Rubisco-I falls to the CAC (9van der Vies S.M. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, the CAC was determined to be about 0.9 μm(protomer concentration of Rubisco-U), and we also observed that the formation of aggregates was promoted by increasing the concentration of Rubisco-I above the CAC (data not shown). Temperature is another important factor in the Rubisco refolding (8Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because the CAC decreases quickly as temperature increases (9van der Vies S.M. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), higher temperatures promote the irreversible aggregation of Rubisco-I. Aggregation is believed to result from irregular hydrophobic interaction between the Rubisco-I molecules on the surfaces exposed (22Mitraki A. King J. Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 690-697Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We conducted a fluorescence experiment using the hydrophobic fluorophore bis-ANS (23Rosen C.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Brand L. Gohlke J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 843-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 25Musci G. Metz G.D. Tsunematsu H. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2034-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and observed that there was more than a 10-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity for the refolding species incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, as compared with the native Rubisco. This indicates the presence of a large region of exposed hydrophobic surface formed in the early stage of refolding. Further kinetic measurements on the binding of bis-ANS to protein revealed that refolding of Rubisco at 4 °C was a very slow process and the fluorescence decreased to a level near to that of native Rubisco when the Rubisco-M was further incubated at 25 °C (supplemental material). It should be emphasized that DTT plays an essential role in whole processes from denaturing to reconstitution of the Rubisco. When Rubisco was unfolded in 6 m Gdn-HCl in the absence of DTT followed by refolding and reconstitution procedures, no spontaneous reactivation or very little recovery of the activity was detected. There are ten cysteine residues in R. rubrum Rubisco (26Hartman F.C. Stringer C.D. Lee E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 232: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the enzyme is devoid of disulfide bond (27Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 989-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of DTT may be explained in terms of protection of formation of the disulfide bonds that lead to misfolding during unfolding and refolding processes. Reversible dimer-monomer dissociation of Rubisco from R. rubrum was investigated using hydrostatic pressure (28Erijman L. Lorimer G.H. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5187-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Full reversibility after dissociation was observed to depend on the presence of small ligands, such as Mg2+ and NaHCO3. It has been well established that the reconstitution of active Rubisco from unfolded polypeptides is facilitated by the molecular chaperones, such as GroEL and GroES of E. coli, and MgATP (6Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 7Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In previous studies, a site-directed mutant, K168E, which exists as a stable monomer, was often used to characterize the “native” monomeric state (9van der Vies S.M. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), corresponding to the Rubisco-M of this study, in connection with the role of chaperones in the interaction with folding intermediates. The Rubisco in this state was shown to have a similar secondary structure content but less ordered tertiary structure than that of the native dimer. We demonstrated in this study that the stable Rubisco-M species can be spontaneously formed at 4 °C without involvement of chaperones and be identified by HPLC analysis in its intact state.
