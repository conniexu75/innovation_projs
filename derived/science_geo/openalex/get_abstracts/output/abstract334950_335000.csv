One source, from Sagittarius, is close to the galactic center, and the other, from Ophiuchus, may coincide with Kepler's 1604 supernova. All the x-ray sources are fairly close to the galactic plane."

The multiple curvilinear regression gives the best prediction of species number, with island area making the only significant contribution. The proportion of species endemic to the Galápagos is highest in the arid, transition zone and on small islands, and lowest in the littoral and mesic zones. This is explained in terms of zone-specific immigration and extinction rates and the very recent appearance of moist upland climates in the archipelago."
https://openalex.org/W2005361630,"A family of synthetic elastic fibers, designated spandex fibers, has been developed, providing new degrees of sheerness and effective ""power"" in elastic fabrics. These fibers have segmented polyurethane structures. They are durable, they are white and accept dye readily, and they can be set by heat. The development of these fibers has led to new textile technology and to new uses for elastic fabrics."
https://openalex.org/W2008074376,"Climate exerts a universal dominant influence on ecology, but processes of karstification have an equally high ecological influence in carbonate rock regions. Development of karst features depends greatly on the degree to which water containing carbon dioxide has been able to move on and through carbonate rocks and to remove some of the rock in solution. Distinctive features of many karst terranes include scarcity of soils, scarcity of surface streams, and rugged topography; less distinctive are the highly permeable and cavernous rocks, especially at the shallow depths. This high permeability gives rise to many practical problems, including (i) scarcity and poor predictability of groundwater supplies, (ii) scarcity of surface streams, (iii) instability of the ground, (iv) leakage of surface reservoirs, and (v) an unreliable waste-disposal environment. Natural karst processes in some carbonate rock regions have caused a greater restriction in the development of biota than man can ever be suspected of causing."

The depths exceed those of the estuaries where the species flourishes. Radiocarbon measurements indicate that the oysters were alive 8000 to 11,000 years ago. It is concluded that the oysters lived in lagoons or estuaries which became submerged when the sea level rose at the end of the latest glacial epoch."
https://openalex.org/W2026627122,"I have tried to describe some current research trends in seismology which are specifically directed toward solving the problem of detecting, locating, and identifying underground nuclear explosions. Attention has been directed specifically toward problems which arise in efforts to obtain information at distances in excess of 2500 kilometers. The main scientific advantage which accrues from working at such distances is that the seismic signals suffer minimal distortion by the geological complexities of the earth. Extrapolation of the data to the question of an international test ban is not within the scope of this article. Suffice it to note that all of the parameters must, in the final resort, be resolved in terms of probabilities. In some cases the seismological probabilities can be estimated with reasonable degrees of accuracy, but the future of the test ban question depends not only on seismology but on such questions as inspection and what probabilities are acceptable."
https://openalex.org/W2035728275,"An analysis of disaster reports on coal mine explosions indicates that gas explosions are randomly distributed throughout the year, whereas dust explosions (which may or may not be triggered by a gas explosion) occur with greater frequency during the dry fall and winter months. The lack of adequate moisture during cold weather tends to increase the rate and severity of the dust explosions."

https://openalex.org/W1991468281,The parameters in a statistical theory of multiple-lane traffic have been determined from two independent sets of data. The numerical values of the parameters calculated by four different methods of estimation are in essential agreement with one another. The data suggest the important role of adaptive human behavior in determining the characteristics of congested flow.
https://openalex.org/W2036423886,"The mystery of the orientation of the Great Pyramids of Giza has remained unexplained for many decades. The general alignment is 4 minutes west of north. It is argued that this is not a builders' error but is caused by movement over the centuries. Modern theories of continental drift do not predict quite such large movements, but other causes of polar wandering give even smaller shifts. Thus, continental drift is the most likely explanation, although somewhat implausible, especially as relevant measurements have been made over a 50-year period, whereas geophysical measurements of sea-floor spreading relate to million-year time scales."

https://openalex.org/W2042102511,"Of the three stated goals of this symposium two have been amply realized. All those interested in basic research can become acquainted with the work of colleagues in other fields, and clinicians may gain a glimpse of what is new. But the book fails to attain the third goal, of providing information immediately pertinent to diagnosis and patient care. The book is organized into four parts: morphology, biochemistry, physiology and pharmacology, and pathophysiology. Each part concludes with a discussion consisting mainly of questions, generally of a sophisticated nature, from the audience. Except for a few chapters, eg, Lowry's essay on energy metabolism of the nerve cell, most of the subject matter concerns the synapse, which is, after all, the functional end of the nervous system. But a"

The characteristics of many materials can be influenced by the trace-element impurities found in various systems. For example, the quality of steel is altered by its trace oxygen content1; the presence of trace vanadium in crude-oil poisons the platinum catalysts used in the cracking process by the oil industry2; sodium and chloride concentrations in sweat are used for the detection of cystic fibrosis in children today3; and the concentration of trace pesticides in foodstuffs have importance.4 Numerous other practical applications of trace-element determinations have been investigated and reported on in the literature5 in virtually all of the sciences."
