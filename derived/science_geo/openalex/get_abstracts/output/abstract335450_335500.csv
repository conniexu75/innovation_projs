https://openalex.org/W1985711302,"The latitudinally diachronous appearance of angiosperm pollen during the Cretaceous is well documented, but the subsequent diversification and accompanying significant changes in floristic dominance have not been assessed quantitatively for a wide range of paleolatitudes. Trend surfaces fitted to within-palynoflora diversity data from 1125 pollen and spore assemblages show that angiosperms first become floristically prominent in low paleolatitude areas( approximately 20 degrees N to 20 degrees S). Non-magnoliid dicotyledons show a similar but slightly delayed pattern of increase and are the principal component of angiosperm diversity from all areas sampled. Monocotyledons and magnoliid dicotyledons are significant primarily in low to middle paleolatitude palynofloras( approximately 50 degrees N to 20 degrees S) during the latest Cretaceous. As angiosperms become increasingly prevalent the importance of most non-angiosperm taxa either decreases or remains unchanged. The only apparent exception is a striking increase in gnetalean diversity concurrent with the initial angiosperm diversification at low paleolatitudes."

https://openalex.org/W1982184772,"X-ray diffraction measurements have been carried out on cesium iodide (CsI) to 302 gigapascals with a platinum pressure standard. The results indicate that above 200 gigapascals CsI at 300 K has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure with the ideal c/a ratio of 1.63 +/- 0.01. The crystal structure and pressure-volume relations converge at high pressure with those of solid xenon, which is isoelectronic with CsI. The results indicate a significant loss of ionic bonding in the hexagonal close-packed metallic phase of CsI at ultrahigh pressure."

https://openalex.org/W1595575870,"The Hayward fault, located on the east side of the San Francisco Bay, represents a natural laboratory for seismologists, because it does not sleep silently between major earthquakes. In his Perspective, Simpson discusses the study by Bürgmann et al., who have used powerful new techniques to study the fault. The results indicate that major earthquakes cannot originate in the northern part of the fault. However, surface-rupturing earthquakes have occurred in the area, suggesting that they originated to the north or south of the segment studied by Bürgmann et al. Fundamental questions remain regarding the mechanism by which plate tectonic stresses are transferred to the Hayward fault."
https://openalex.org/W1596826728,"The National Ignition Facility (NIF), a superlaser being built here at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in an effort to use lasers rather than nuclear explosions to create a fusion reaction, is supposed to allow weapons makers to preserve the nuclear arsenal--and do nifty fusion science, too. But a new report that examines its troubled past also casts doubt on its future. Even some of NIF's scientific and political allies are beginning to talk openly of a scaled-down version of the original 192-laser design."

https://openalex.org/W1561323949,"With the publication in recent weeks of two papers on a mass extinction 183 million years ago, researchers can add five suggestive cases to the list of extinctions with known causes. These extinctions coincide with massive outpourings of lava, accompanied by signs that global warming threw the ocean-atmosphere system out of whack. Although no one can yet pin any of these mass extinctions with certainty on the volcanic eruptions, scientists say it's unlikely that they're all coincidences."

https://openalex.org/W1582798248,"The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite of the Milky Way, is an important yardstick by which most intergalactic distances are measured. But as Cole explains in this Perspective, how far away the LMC is remains a matter of dispute, with far reaching implications in cosmology. But observations of Cepheids and of eclipsing binaries, two types of stars that allow absolute luminosity and thus absolute distances to be determined, are promising to resolve this important issue in the not too distant future."

https://openalex.org/W2133025422,"Virginia is at odds with other Atlantic coastal states over a plan to protect horseshoe crabs. Virginia officials have refused to accept a quota on their harvest, arguing that it's not based on good science. Now, the Department of Commerce has scheduled a moratorium, to go into effect next month, that is aimed at preserving what many believe is a dwindling population."

https://openalex.org/W1684150758,"The National Ignition Facility (NIF)--if it works as advertised, which is by no means certain given all of NIF's problems (see main text)--will pump almost 2 million joules of laser energy into a BB-sized pellet of hydrogen. But the bigger question is whether the pellet will actually achieve ignition--that is, undergo a sustained nuclear reaction that gives off as much energy as was put in? Most scientists on the project are cautiously optimistic, but others have grave doubts."

The roster of extrasolar planets, now nearing 50, suggests that stars are fecund breeding grounds for worlds but that young planets must battle hordes of rivals for a handful of stable orbits."
