https://openalex.org/W2264760947,"Background There are limited data on the epidemiology, diagnosis and optimal management of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease in children. Methods Retrospective cohort study of NTM cases over a 10-year-period at a tertiary referral hospital in Australia. Results A total of 140 children with NTM disease, including 107 with lymphadenitis and 25 with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), were identified. The estimated incidence of NTM disease was 0.6–1.6 cases / 100,000 children / year; no increasing trend was observed over the study period. Temporal analyses revealed a seasonal incidence cycle around 12 months, with peaks in late winter/spring and troughs in autumn. Mycobacterium-avium-complex accounted for most cases (77.8%), followed by Mycobacterium ulcerans (14.4%) and Mycobacterium marinum (3.3%). Polymerase chain reaction testing had higher sensitivity than culture and microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (92.0%, 67.2% and 35.7%, respectively). The majority of lymphadenitis cases underwent surgical excision (97.2%); multiple recurrences in this group were less common in cases treated with clarithromycin and rifampicin compared with clarithromycin alone or no anti-mycobacterial drugs (0% versus 7.1%; OR:0.73). SSTI recurrences were also less common in cases treated with two anti-mycobacterial drugs compared with one or none (10.5% versus 33.3%; OR:0.23). Conclusions There was seasonal variation in the incidence of NTM disease, analogous to recently published observations in tuberculosis, which have been linked to seasonal variation in vitamin D. Our finding that anti-mycobacterial combination therapy was associated with a reduced risk of recurrences in patients with NTM lymphadenitis or SSTI requires further confirmation in prospective trials."

In this study, the distribution of DON in the wheat kernel and the effect of exposure time to ozone on DON detoxification were investigated. A high concentration of toxin was found in the outer part of the kernel, and DON was injected from the outside to the inside. The degradation rates of DON were 26.40%, 39.16%, and 53.48% after the samples were exposed to 75 mg/L ozone for 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. The effect of ozonation on wheat flour quality and nutrition was also evaluated. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in protein content, fatty acid value, amino acid content, starch content, carbonyl and carboxyl content, and swelling power of ozone-treated samples. Moreover, the ozone-treated samples exhibited higher tenacity and whiteness, as well as lower extensibility and yellowness. This finding indicated that ozone treatment can simultaneously reduce DON levels and improve flour quality."

In particular, fibronectin has been documented to activate endothelial cells, resulting in their transition from a quiescent state to an active state in which the cells exhibit enhanced migration and proliferation. The goal of this study is to examine the role of polymerized fibronectin during vascular tubulogenesis using a 3 dimensional (3D) cell-derived de-cellularized matrix. A fibronectin-rich 3D de-cellularized ECM was used as a scaffold to study vascular morphogenesis of endothelial cells (ECs). Confocal analyses of several matrix proteins reveal high intra- and extra-cellular deposition of fibronectin in formed vascular structures. Using a small peptide inhibitor of fibronectin polymerization, we demonstrate that inhibition of fibronectin fibrillogenesis in ECs cultured atop de-cellularized ECM resulted in decreased vascular morphogenesis. Further, immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analyses reveal decreased expression of stromal matrix proteins in the absence of polymerized fibronectin with high co-localization of matrix proteins found in association with polymerized fibronectin. Evaluating vascular kinetics, live cell imaging showed that migration, migration velocity, and mean square displacement, are disrupted in structures grown in the absence of polymerized fibronectin. Additionally, vascular organization failed to occur in the absence of a polymerized fibronectin matrix. Consistent with these observations, we tested vascular morphogenesis following the disruption of EC adhesion to polymerized fibronectin, demonstrating that block of integrins α5β1 and αvβ3, abrogated vascular morphogenesis. Overall, fibronectin deposition in a 3D cell-derived de-cellularized ECM appears to be imperative for matrix assembly and vascular morphogenesis."

In the alkylquinolone biosynthetic pathway, the β-ketoacyl-(acyl carrier protein) synthase III (FabH)-like enzyme PqsBC catalyzes the condensation of octanoyl-coenzyme A and 2-aminobenzoylacetate (2-ABA) to form the signal molecule 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone. PqsBC, a potential drug target, is unique for its heterodimeric arrangement and an active site different from that of canonical FabH-like enzymes. Considering the sequence dissimilarity between the subunits, a key question was how the two subunits are organized with respect to the active site. In this study, the PqsBC structure was determined to a 2 Å resolution, revealing that PqsB and PqsC have a pseudo-2-fold symmetry that unexpectedly mimics the FabH homodimer. PqsC has an active site composed of Cys-129 and His-269, and the surrounding active site cleft is hydrophobic in character and approximately twice the volume of related FabH enzymes that may be a requirement to accommodate the aromatic substrate 2-ABA. From physiological and kinetic studies, we identified 2-aminoacetophenone as a pathway-inherent competitive inhibitor of PqsBC, whose fluorescence properties could be used for in vitro binding studies. In a time-resolved setup, we demonstrated that the catalytic histidine is not involved in acyl-enzyme formation, but contributes to an acylation-dependent increase in affinity for the second substrate 2-ABA. Introduction of Asn into the PqsC active site led to significant activity toward the desamino substrate analog benzoylacetate, suggesting that the substrate 2-ABA itself supplies the asparagine-equivalent amino function that assists in catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W2254349200,"Background One million neonates die each year in low- and middle-income countries because of neonatal sepsis; group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli are the leading causes. In sub-Saharan Africa, epidemiological data on vaginal GBS and E. coli carriage, a prerequisite for GBS and E. coli neonatal sepsis, respectively, are scarce but necessary to design and implement prevention strategies. Therefore, we assessed vaginal GBS and E. coli carriage rates and risk factors and the GBS serotype distribution in three sub-Saharan countries. Methods A total of 430 women from Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa were studied cross-sectionally. Vaginal carriage of GBS and E. coli, and GBS serotype were assessed using molecular techniques. Risk factors for carriage were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Vaginal carriage rates in reference groups from Kenya and South Africa were 20.2% (95% CI, 13.7–28.7%) and 23.1% (95% CI, 16.2–31.9%), respectively for GBS; and 25.0% (95% CI, 17.8–33.9%) and 27.1% (95% CI, 19.6–36.2%), respectively for E. coli. GBS serotypes Ia (36.8%), V (26.3%) and III (14.0%) were most prevalent. Factors independently associated with GBS and E. coli carriage were Candida albicans, an intermediate vaginal microbiome, bacterial vaginosis, recent vaginal intercourse, vaginal washing, cervical ectopy and working as a sex worker. GBS and E. coli carriage were positively associated. Conclusions Reduced vaginal GBS carriage rates might be accomplished by advocating behavioral changes such as abstinence from sexual intercourse and by avoidance of vaginal washing during late pregnancy. It might be advisable to explore the inclusion of vaginal carriage of C. albicans, GBS, E. coli and of the presence of cervical ectopy in a risk- and/or screening-based administration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Current phase II GBS vaccines (a trivalent vaccine targeting serotypes Ia, Ib, and III, and a conjugate vaccine targeting serotype III) would not protect the majority of women against carriage in our study population."
https://openalex.org/W2253607734,"Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to believe that events and power relations are secretly manipulated by certain clandestine groups and organisations. Many of these ostensibly explanatory conjectures are non-falsifiable, lacking in evidence or demonstrably false, yet public acceptance remains high. Efforts to convince the general public of the validity of medical and scientific findings can be hampered by such narratives, which can create the impression of doubt or disagreement in areas where the science is well established. Conversely, historical examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult for people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathematical model for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time, which yields failure probability for any given conspiracy. Parameters for the model are estimated from literature examples of known scandals, and the factors influencing conspiracy success and failure are explored. The model is also used to estimate the likelihood of claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax, vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the most generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of active participants-the results of this model suggest that large conspiracies (≥1000 agents) quickly become untenable and prone to failure. The theory presented here might be useful in counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences of bogus and anti-science narratives, and examining the hypothetical conditions under which sustainable conspiracy might be possible."
https://openalex.org/W2256732332,"In sub-Saharan Africa there is an increasing need to leverage available health care workers to provide care for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This study was conducted to evaluate adherence to Médecins Sans Frontières clinical protocols when the care of five stable NCDs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, epilepsy, asthma, and sickle cell) was shifted from clinical officers to nurses.Descriptive, retrospective review of routinely collected clinic data from two integrated primary health care facilities within an urban informal settlement, Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya (May to August 2014).There were 3,554 consultations (2025 patients); 733 (21%) were by nurses out of which 725 met the inclusion criteria among 616 patients. Hypertension (64%, 397/616) was the most frequent NCD followed by asthma (17%, 106/616) and diabetes mellitus (15%, 95/616). Adherence to screening questions ranged from 65% to 86%, with an average of 69%. Weight and blood pressure measurements were completed in 89% and 96% of those required. Laboratory results were reviewed in 91% of indicated visits. Laboratory testing per NCD protocols was higher in those with hypertension (88%) than diabetes mellitus (67%) upon review. Only 17 (2%) consultations were referred back to clinical officers.Nurses are able to adhere to protocols for managing stable NCD patients based on clear and standardized protocols and guidelines, thus paving the way towards task shifting of NCD care to nurses to help relieve the significant healthcare gap in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2257383410,"To describe the epidemiology of birth defects (BDs) in perinatal infants in Hunan Province, China, between 2005 and 2014.The BD surveillance data of perinatal infants (for stillbirth, dead fetus or live birth between 28 weeks of gestation and 7 days after birth) were collected from 52 registered hospitals of Hunan between 2005 and 2014. The prevalence rates of BDs with 95% confidence interval (CI) and crude odds ratio (ORs) were calculated to examine the associations of infant gender, maternal age, and region (urban vs rural) with BDs.From 2005 to 2014, there were a total of 925413 perinatal infants of which 17753 had BDs, with the average prevalence of 191.84 per 10000 PIs (perinatal infants), showing a significant uptrend. The risks of BDs are higher in urban areas versus rural areas (OR = 1.20), in male infants versus female infants (OR = 1.19), and in mothers above age 35 versus those below age 35 (OR = 1.24). The main five types of BDs are Congenital heart defects (CHD), Other malformation of external ear (OMEE), Polydactyly, Congenital malformation of kidney (CMK), and Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTE). From 2005 to 2014, the prevalence rates (per 10000 PIs) of CHD and CMK increased significantly from 22.56 to 74 (OR = 3.29, 95%CI: 2.65-4.11) and from 7.61 to 14.62 (OR = 1.92, 95%CI:1.30-2.84), respectively; the prevalence rates of congenital hydrocephalus and neural tube defects (NTDs) decreased significantly from 11.8 to 5.29 (OR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.31-0.65) and from 7.87 to 1.74 (OR = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.13-0.38), respectively.The prevalence rates of specific BDs in perinatal infants in Hunan have changed in the last decade. Urban pregnant women, male perinatal infants, and mothers above age 35 present different prevalence rates of BDs. Wider use of new diagnosis technology, improving the ability of monitoring, strengthening the publicity and education are important to reduce the prevalence of BDs."
https://openalex.org/W2266235606,"Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are currently considered two of the most important pathogens in nosocomial infections associated with catheters and other medical implants and are also the main contaminants of medical instruments. However because these species of Staphylococcus are part of the normal bacterial flora of human skin and mucosal surfaces, it is difficult to discern when a microbial isolate is the cause of infection or is detected on samples as a consequence of contamination. Rapid identification of invasive strains of Staphylococcus infections is crucial for correctly diagnosing and treating infections. The aim of the present study was to identify specific genes to distinguish between invasive and contaminating S. epidermidis and S. aureus strains isolated on medical devices; the majority of our samples were collected from breast prostheses. As a first step, we compared the adhesion ability of these samples with their efficacy in forming biofilms; second, we explored whether it is possible to determine if isolated pathogens were more virulent compared with international controls. In addition, this work may provide additional information on these pathogens, which are traditionally considered harmful bacteria in humans, and may increase our knowledge of virulence factors for these types of infections."
https://openalex.org/W2267884480,"Background Computer Networks have a tendency to grow at an unprecedented scale. Modern networks involve not only computers but also a wide variety of other interconnected devices ranging from mobile phones to other household items fitted with sensors. This vision of the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) implies an inherent difficulty in modeling problems. Purpose It is practically impossible to implement and test all scenarios for large-scale and complex adaptive communication networks as part of Complex Adaptive Communication Networks and Environments (CACOONS). The goal of this study is to explore the use of Agent-based Modeling as part of the Cognitive Agent-based Computing (CABC) framework to model a Complex communication network problem. Method We use Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM), as part of the CABC framework, to develop an autonomous multi-agent architecture for managing carbon footprint in a corporate network. To evaluate the application of complexity in practical scenarios, we have also introduced a company-defined computer usage policy. Results The conducted experiments demonstrated two important results: Primarily CABC-based modeling approach such as using Agent-based Modeling can be an effective approach to modeling complex problems in the domain of IoT. Secondly, the specific problem of managing the Carbon footprint can be solved using a multiagent system approach."
https://openalex.org/W2268546454,"A critical and understudied property of endothelial cells is their ability to form lumens and tube networks. Although considerable information has been obtained concerning these issues, including the role of Cdc42 and Rac1 and their effectors such as Pak2, Pak4, Par6b, and co-regulators such as integrins, MT1-MMP and Par3; many key questions remain that are necessary to elucidate molecular and signaling requirements for this fundamental process. In this work, we identify new small GTPase regulators of EC tubulogenesis including k-Ras, Rac2 and Rap1b that act in conjunction with Cdc42 as well as the key downstream effectors, IQGAP1, MRCKβ, beta-Pix, GIT1, and Rasip1 (which can assemble into multiprotein complexes with key regulators including α2β1 integrin and MT1-MMP). In addition, we identify the negative regulators, Arhgap31 (by inactivating Cdc42 and Rac) and Rasa1 (by inactivating k-Ras) and the positive regulator, Arhgap29 (by inactivating RhoA) which play a major functional role during the EC tubulogenic process. Human EC siRNA suppression or mouse knockout of Rasip1 leads to identical phenotypes where ECs form extensive cord networks, but cannot generate lumens or tubes. Essential roles for these molecules during EC tubulogenesis include; i) establishment of asymmetric EC cytoskeletal polarization (subapical distribution of acetylated tubulin and basal membrane distribution of F-actin); and ii) directed membrane trafficking of pinocytic vacuoles or other intracellular vesicles along acetylated tubulin tracks to the developing apical membrane surface. Cdc42 co-localizes subapically with acetylated tubulin, while Rac1 and k-Ras strongly label vacuole/ vesicle membranes which accumulate and fuse together in a polarized, perinuclear manner. We observe polarized apical membrane and subapical accumulation of key GTPases and effectors regulating EC lumen formation including Cdc42, Rac1, Rac2, k-Ras, Rap1b, activated c-Raf and Rasip1 to control EC tube network assembly. Overall, this work defines novel key regulators and their functional roles during human EC tubulogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2261437490,"A rapidly acting, single dose vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus would be highly beneficial for patients scheduled for major surgeries or in intensive care units. Here we show that one immunization with a multicomponent S. aureus candidate vaccine, 4C-Staph, formulated with a novel TLR7-dependent adjuvant, T7-alum, readily protected mice from death and from bacterial dissemination, both in kidney abscess and peritonitis models, outperforming alum-formulated vaccine. This increased efficacy was paralleled by higher vaccine-specific and α-hemolysin-neutralizing antibody titers and Th1/Th17 cell responses. Antibodies played a crucial protective role, as shown by the lack of protection of 4C-Staph/T7-alum vaccine in B-cell-deficient mice and by serum transfer experiments. Depletion of effector CD4+ T cells not only reduced survival but also increased S. aureus load in kidneys of mice immunized with 4C-Staph/T7-alum. The role of IL-17A in the control of bacterial dissemination in 4C-Staph/T7-alum vaccinated mice was indicated by in vivo neutralization experiments. We conclude that single dose 4C-Staph/T7-alum vaccine promptly and efficiently protected mice against S. aureus through the combined actions of antibodies, CD4+ effector T cells, and IL-17A. These data suggest that inclusion of an adjuvant that induces not only fast antibody responses but also IL-17-producing cell-mediated effector responses could efficaciously protect patients scheduled for major surgeries or in intensive care units."
https://openalex.org/W2414102402,"Automatic recording of birdsong is becoming the preferred way to monitor and quantify bird populations worldwide. Programmable recorders allow recordings to be obtained at all times of day and year for extended periods of time. Consequently, there is a critical need for robust automated birdsong recognition. One prominent obstacle to achieving this is low signal to noise ratio in unattended recordings. Field recordings are often very noisy: birdsong is only one component in a recording, which also includes noise from the environment (such as wind and rain), other animals (including insects), and human-related activities, as well as noise from the recorder itself. We describe a method of denoising using a combination of the wavelet packet decomposition and band-pass or low-pass filtering, and present experiments that demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in noise reduction over natural noisy bird recordings."
https://openalex.org/W2256042984,"Many phleboviruses (family Bunyaviridae) are emerging as medically important viruses. These viruses enter target cells by endocytosis and low pH-dependent membrane fusion in late endosomes. However, the necessary and sufficient factors for fusion have not been fully characterized. We have studied the minimal fusion requirements of a prototypic phlebovirus, Uukuniemi virus, in an in vitro virus-liposome assay. We show that efficient lipid mixing between viral and liposome membranes requires close to physiological temperatures and phospholipids with negatively charged headgroups, such as the late endosomal phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate. We further demonstrate that bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate increases Uukuniemi virus fusion beyond the lipid mixing stage. By using electron cryotomography of viral particles in the presence or absence of liposomes, we observed that the conformation of phlebovirus glycoprotein capsomers changes from the native conformation toward a more elongated conformation at a fusion permissive pH. Our results suggest a rationale for phlebovirus entry in late endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2259709871,"Invasive feral swine (Sus scrofa) cause extensive damage to agricultural and wildlife resources throughout the United States. Development of sodium nitrite as a new, orally delivered toxicant is underway to provide an additional tool to curtail growth and expansion of feral swine populations. A micro-encapsulation coating around sodium nitrite is used to minimize detection by feral swine and maximize stability for the reactive molecule. To maximize uptake of this toxicant by feral swine, development a bait matrix is needed to 1) protect the micro-encapsulation coating so that sodium nitrite remains undetectable to feral swine, 2) achieve a high degree of acceptance by feral swine, and 3) be minimally appealing to non-target species. With these purposes, a field evaluation at 88 sites in south-central Texas was conducted using remote cameras to evaluate preferences by feral swine for several oil-based bait matrices including uncolored peanut paste, black-colored peanut paste, and peanut-based slurry mixed onto whole-kernel corn. These placebo baits were compared to a reference food, whole-kernel corn, known to be readily taken by feral swine (i.e., control). The amount of bait consumed by feral swine was also estimated using remote cameras and grid boards at 5 additional sites. On initial exposure, feral swine showed reduced visitations to the uncolored peanut paste and peanut slurry treatments. This reduced visitation subsided by the end of the treatment period, suggesting that feral swine needed time to accept these bait types. The black-colored peanut paste was visited equally to the control throughout the study, and enough of this matrix was consumed to deliver lethal doses of micro-encapsulated sodium nitrite to most feral swine during 1–2 feeding events. None of the treatment matrices reduced visitations by nontarget species, but feral swine dominated visitations for all matrices. It was concluded that black-colored peanut paste achieved satisfactory preference and consumption by feral swine, and no discernable preference by non-target species, compared to the other treatments."

Some aaRS mutations cause mitochondrial disorders, including human mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (hmtThrRS) (encoded by TARS2), the P282L mutation of which causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. However, its catalytic and structural consequences remain unclear. Herein, we cloned TARS2 and purified the wild-type and P282L mutant hmtThrRS. hmtThrRS misactivates non-cognate Ser and uses post-transfer editing to clear erroneously synthesized products. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that the mutation induces a decrease in Thr activation, aminoacylation, and proofreading activities and a change in the protein structure and/or stability, which might cause reduced catalytic efficiency. We also identified a splicing variant of TARS2 mRNA lacking exons 8 and 9, the protein product of which is targeted into mitochondria. In HEK293T cells, the variant does not dimerize and cannot complement the ThrRS knock-out strain in yeast, suggesting that the truncated protein is inactive and might have a non-canonical function, as observed for other aaRS fragments.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 125-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This process starts with amino acid activation by condensation with ATP to form the aminoacyl adenylate aa-AMP and pyrophosphate. The activated amino acid then reacts with the 3′-end of the cognate tRNA to yield the aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA), which is transferred by EF-Tu to the protein biosynthesis machinery as a building block. Highly accurate protein synthesis is indispensable for cell growth. To maintain fidelity during protein synthesis, aaRS needs to select the correct amino acid and tRNA substrates from a large number of structurally similar molecules in the cells. The specificity of aaRS is greatly challenged by the presence of the 20 amino acids in which the physicochemical properties are sometimes very similar and by non-proteogenous amino acids and diverse metabolites produced by cell metabolism. aaRSs that do not show an overall selectivity above 1 in 3000 are predicted to require proofreading (editing) activity to maintain sufficient accuracy during aa-tRNA synthesis (3Loftfield R.B. Vanderjagt D. The frequency of errors in protein biosynthesis.Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In fact, editing activity has evolved in half of the currently identified aaRS to remove aberrantly produced aa-AMP (pretransfer editing) and/or aa-tRNA (post-transfer editing) (4Zhou X. Wang E. Transfer RNA: a dancer between charging and mis-charging for protein biosynthesis.Sci. China Life Sci. 2013; 56: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). tRNA mischarging may be toxic and deleterious for cells. Even a slight decrease in aminoacylation accuracy could cause an intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins and up-regulation of cytoplasmic protein chaperones in neurons, leading to severe mammalian neurodegeneration (5Lee J.W.

Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G.

Attardi G. tRNA punctuation model of RNA processing in human mitochondria.Nature. 1981; 290: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Except for two tRNALeu or tRNASer iso-acceptors, the other amino acids have only one corresponding tRNA (such as one mitochondrial tRNAThr(UGU)) for protein synthesis. MtDNA undergoes mutations at a higher rate than nuclear genomes because of the presence of reactive oxygen species, its freedom from histones, and lack of repair mechanisms (12Allen J.F. Raven J.A.

De Chirico A. Saccone C. Nucleotide substitution rate of mammalian mitochondrial genomes.J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, more than 200 point mutations and rearrangements associated with a large number of a wide spectrum of clinical abnormalities have been reported (14Scaglia F. Wong L.J. Human mitochondrial transfer RNAs: role of pathogenic mutation in disease.Muscle Nerve. 2008; 37: 150-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, over half of these mutations occurred in tRNA genes (15Florentz C. Sohm B. Tryoen-Tóth P. Pütz J. Sissler M. Human mitochondrial tRNAs in health and disease.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1356-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, mitochondrial aaRSs encoded by the nuclear genome are key components of the mitochondrial protein synthesis system. They are synthesized in the cytoplasm, imported into and function in the mitochondria (16Scheper G.C. van der Klok T. van Andel R.J. van Berkel C.G. Sissler M. Smet J. Muravina T.I. Serkov S.V.

Mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase deficiency causes leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). ThrRSs are present in all three domains of life and usually contain an N-terminal N1 domain, an N2 domain (for editing), an aminoacylation domain (for amino acid activation and tRNA charging), and an anticodon binding domain (for tRNA binding) (17Sankaranarayanan R. Dock-Bregeon A.C. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Moras D.

Based on an alignment of primary sequences, bacterial ThrRSs display an obvious difference to eukaryotic ThrRSs in the N-terminal N1 and N2 (editing) domains. Interestingly, despite the bacterial origin of mitochondria, human mitochondrial ThrRS (hmtThrRS) is more similar to eukaryotic cytoplasmic ThrRS. hmtThrRS is encoded by the TARS2 gene. Bacterial and eukaryotic cytoplasmic ThrRS, shown to misactivate non-cognate Ser, mainly use an efficient post-transfer editing activity to clear mischarged Ser-tRNAThr in addition to tRNA-dependent pretransfer editing (18Minajigi A.

In contrast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial ThrRS (ScmtThrRS) naturally lacks an editing domain and only harbors tRNA-independent and tRNA isoacceptor-specific pretransfer editing (21Ling J. Peterson K.M. Simonović I. Cho C. Söll D. Simonović M. Yeast mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase recognizes tRNA isoacceptors by distinct mechanisms and promotes CUN codon reassignment.Proc. Natl.

A minimalist mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase exhibits tRNA-isoacceptor specificity during proofreading.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 13873-13886Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As a result, ScmtThrRS lacks post-transfer editing and is an error-prone synthetase, forming Ser-tRNAThr, at least in vitro (22Zhou X.L. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Fang Z.P. Wang Y. Chen Y. Liu R.J. Eriani G. Wang E.D. A minimalist mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase exhibits tRNA-isoacceptor specificity during proofreading.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 13873-13886Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several bacterial or cytoplasmic aaRSs are critically dependent upon their editing activity to achieve accurate aminoacylation. However, in several cases, the corresponding human mitochondrial enzymes carry non-functional editing sites or lack editing domains, raising the question of their aminoacylation fidelity. In fact, these enzymes achieve fidelity using a more specific amino acid binding pocket, reducing the need of editing activity. This enhanced specificity compensating for the presence of a defunct editing site has been identified in human mitochondrial LeuRS (23Lue S.W. Kelley S.O. An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with a defunct editing site.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3010-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae mitochondrial PheRS (24Reynolds N.M. Ling J.

Concerning hmtThrRS encoded by TARS2, no information is available on its aminoacylation and editing activities. According to the increasing number of mutations in aaRS genes causing mitochondrial dysfunctions, including hmtThrRS (26Diodato D. Melchionda L. Haack T.B. Dallabona C. Baruffini E. Donnini C. Granata T. Ragona F. Balestri P. Margollicci M. Lamantea E. Nasca A. Powell C.A. Minczuk M. Strom T.M. Meitinger T. Prokisch H. Lamperti C. Zeviani M. Ghezzi D. VARS2 and TARS2 mutations in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), there is an interest in analyzing the functional properties of these molecules and developing new tools to examine their in vivo properties. Recently, two mutations (c.845C>T, encoding hmtThrRS-P282L and a nucleotide change in position +3 of intron 6 (g.4255A>G; c.695 + 3A>G)) were identified in TARS2 in two siblings presenting axial hypotonia and severe psychomotor delay associated with multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain defects (26Diodato D. Melchionda L. Haack T.B. Dallabona C. Baruffini E. Donnini C. Granata T. Ragona F. Balestri P. Margollicci M. Lamantea E. Nasca A. Powell C.A. Minczuk M. Strom T.M. Meitinger T. Prokisch H. Lamperti C. Zeviani M. Ghezzi D. VARS2 and TARS2 mutations in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both hmtThrRS protein and aminoacylated tRNAThr levels are decreased in the patients' cells. The g.4255A>G mutation has no influence in mRNA splicing (26Diodato D. Melchionda L. Haack T.B. Dallabona C. Baruffini E. Donnini C. Granata T. Ragona F. Balestri P. Margollicci M. Lamantea E. Nasca A. Powell C.A. Minczuk M. Strom T.M. Meitinger T. Prokisch H. Lamperti C. Zeviani M. Ghezzi D. VARS2 and TARS2 mutations in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); therefore, it was proposed that the c.845C>T mutation is responsible for patient phenotypes. However, how the mutation affects protein structure, stability, and catalytic activities remains largely unknown. In this study, we cloned TARS2, encoding the hmtThrRS precursor, and purified soluble hmtThrRS. In yeast, we found that the only S. cerevisiae tRNAThr is not an efficient substrate for hmtThrRS. To be used as an in vivo functional assay in yeast, we found that an extra human tRNA had to be added. We also showed that hmtThrRS misactivates non-cognate Ser, and a robust pretransfer editing, in addition to post-transfer editing, prevents the formation of mischarged tRNA. In addition, we explored the effect of mutation of Pro282 in detail and found that the mutant hmtThrRS-P282L causes an obvious decrease in amino acid activation, tRNAThr aminoacylation, and editing. Furthermore, we revealed that the mutation alters the structure and/or stability of the protein. Finally, in several cell lines, we identified a splicing variant of TARS2 encoding a truncated, catalytically inactive hmtThrRS. The variant is readily translated and imported into mitochondria, suggesting a noncanonical mitochondrial function. This phenomenon is reminiscent of other examples of synthetase fragments and supports the hypothesis that alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts of aaRS is a way to enlarge aaRS additional functions in higher eukaryotes (27Guo M.

The DNA sequences of the T7 promoter and the hmttRNAThr(UGU) gene were obtained by ligating two chemically synthesized DNA fragments for each strand, which were then ligated into the pTrc99b plasmid (precleaved with EcoRI/PstI) to construct pTrc99b-T7-hmttRNAThr(UGU). Then, the template was amplified for transcription in vitro using Phusion polymerase and the forward primer (5′ CACAGGAAACAGACCATGGGAATTC 3′) and reverse primer (5′ TGGTGTCCTTGGAAAAAGGTTTTCATCTC 3′). hmttRNAThr transcripts were obtained using the T7 RNA polymerase run-off procedure as described previously (7Zhou X.L.

For complementation assays, all genes of interest were cloned into the yeast expression vector, p425TEF and fused with a DNA fragment encoding a C-terminal His6 tag to facilitate protein level determination using an anti-His6 antibody. The hmtThrRS construct or the hmtThrRS plus hctRNAThr(AGU) constructs were transformed separately into the ScΔthrS strain (BY4743, thrS−, pRS426-ScThrRS). Transformants were selected on SD/Ura−/Leu− plates or SD/Ura−/Leu−/His− plates (for co-expression of hctRNAThr(AGU)), and a single clone was cultured in liquid SD/Leu− or SD/Leu−/His− medium. The culture was then diluted to a concentration of 1 OD600 (5 × 107 cells/ml); a 10-fold dilution series of the yeast cells was plated onto the SD/Leu−/5-FOA or SD/Leu−/His−/5-FOA medium to induce the loss of the rescuing plasmid (pRS426-ScthrS) and was grown for 3 days on 30 °C. The same procedure was used to check whether hmtThrRS variants could support the growth of the ScΔthrS strain. Yeast transformants were grown in liquid SD/Leu−/Ura− or SD/Leu−/Ura−/His−. Yeast cells were lysed following a previously described method (30Jazwinski S.M. Preparation of extracts from yeast.Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 154-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins in the cell lysates were detected by Western blotting with anti-His6 antibodies. The ATP-PPi exchange measurement was carried out at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 2.5 mm ATP, 2 mm tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate, 0.5–20 mm Thr or 50–800 mm non-cognate Ser, and 200 nm hmtThrRS or its variants. Samples of the reaction mixture were removed at specific time points and added into 200 μl of quenching solution containing 2% activated charcoal, 3.5% HClO4, and 50 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate. The solution was filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter followed by washing with 20 ml of Milli-Q water and 10 ml of 100% ethanol. The filters were dried, and [32P]ATP was counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). Aminoacylation kinetics were performed at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 2.5 mm ATP, 100 μm [14C]Thr, 0.5–10 μm hmttRNAThr, and 200 nm hmtThrRS or its variants. Misaminoacylation of hmttRNAThr with [14C]Ser was carried out at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 160 μm [14C]Ser, 5 μm hmttRNAThr, and 2 μm hmtThrRS or hmtThrRS-H133A/H137A. We performed the 32P labeling of hmttRNAThr at 37 °C in a mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm hmttRNAThr, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 μm ATP, 50 μm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 0.66 μm [α-32P]ATP, and 10 μm CCA-adding enzyme (CCase) for 5 min. Then, 0.1 unit of PPiase was added to the mixture for 5 min. The solution was extracted twice using phenol/chloroform and then precipitated in 3 volumes of ethanol. [32P]hmttRNAThr was incubated with Ser at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 5 μm unlabeled hmttRNAThr, 1.5 μm [32P]hmttRNAThr, 500 mm Ser, and 10 μm hmtThrRS-H133A/H137A for 1 h. The solution was then extracted twice using acid phenol (pH4.5)/chloroform and precipitated in 3 volumes of 100% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The precipitated sample was centrifuged (12,000 × g) at 4 °C for 30 min, dried at room temperature for 30 min, and dissolved in 5 mm MgCl2. The ratio of Ser-[32P]hmttRNAThr was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the sample washed with and without 5% trichloroacetic acid. Post-transfer editing of preformed Ser-[32P]hmttRNAThr was performed in a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm Ser-[32P]hmttRNAThr, and 200 nm hmtThrRS or its variants at 37 °C. Samples at specific time points were taken for ethanol precipitation with NaAc (pH 5.2) at −20 °C overnight. The precipitated samples were centrifuged (12 000 × g) at 4 °C for 30 min, dried at room temperature for 30 min, and digested with 6 μl of nuclease S1 (25 units) for 2 h at 37 °C. After nuclease S1 digestion, samples (2 μl) of the digestion mixture were loaded and separated by TLC in 0.1 m NH4Ac and 5% acetic acid. The plates were visualized by phosphorimaging, and the data were analyzed using MultiGauge version 3.0 software (Fujifilm). The AMP formation assay (using TLC) was carried out at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 units/ml PPiase, 40 mm Ser (or 4 mm Thr), 3 mm [α-32P]ATP, and 2 μm hmtThrRS or its variants in the presence and absence of hmttRNAThr. Samples (1.5 μl) at specific time points were quenched in 6 μl of 200 mm NaAc (pH 5.2). The quenched aliquots (1.5 μl of each sample) were spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates prewashed with water. The separation of Ser-[α-32P]AMP, [α-32P]AMP, and [α-32P]ATP was performed in 0.1 m NH4Ac and 5% acetic acid. The plates were visualized by phosphorimaging, and the data were analyzed using MultiGauge version 3.0 software (Fujifilm). Quantification of [α-32P]AMP was achieved by densitometry in comparison with [α-32P]ATP samples of known concentrations. hmtThrRS-SV was identified as a novel splicing variant of TARS2 (see “Results”). Human total RNA from five cell lines was extracted using a TRIzol Plus RNA purification kit (Life Technologies) and then was used to synthesize cDNA libraries using the SuperScript III First Strand synthesis kit (Life Technologies). Primer pair 1, targeting exons 8 and 9, was used to detect the native transcripts: primer 1-F, CACAACAGAATTGCTGAGGG; primer 1-R, AGGGCTCAGTTCATGGAAGA. Primer pair 2, recognizing the exon 7/exon 10 boundary, was used to detect the hmtThrRS-SV transcripts: primer 2-F, GACAGGTCCAACAGCAACAG; primer 2-R, CATACTCAGCCGATAGCAGC. qPCR was carried out using SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix kits (Life Technology) on an ABI 7500 instrument, set as follows: 1 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and then 72 °C for 45 s. A default melt curve program was run at the end of the qPCR cycles to verify the specificity of the PCR reaction. A single amplicon of the correct size of target DNA fragment was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplification efficiency was nearly 95%, which was determined from a calibration curve based on the Ct values and different concentrations of cDNA template. qPCR values obtained for each cell line were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. The relative amount of hmtThrRS-SV was calculated using the ΔΔCt method from the qPCR values of hmtThrRS and hmtThrRS-SV (31Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(-ΔΔC(T)) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123336) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transfected with the FLAG-tagged constructs of pCMV-3Tag-3A-TARS2 or pCMV-3Tag-3A-hmtThrRS-SV precursor according to a previously described method (32Ling C. Yao Y.N. Zheng Y.G.

After transfection for 24 h, cells were stained with 100 nm MitoTracker (Life Technologies, M-7512) for 20 min and then fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Fixed cells were blocked in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer containing 5% BSA and incubated with mouse anti-FLAG antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then immunostained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-605–150) and the nuclear counterstain DAPI. Fluorescent images were taken and analyzed using an FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus). The coding sequences of TARS2 and hmtThrRS-SV precursor were cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors pCMV-3Tag-3A (with a C-terminal 3× FLAG tag) and pCMV-3Tag-4A (with a C-terminal 3× c-Myc tag). Plasmid pCMV-3Tag-4A-hmtThrRS precursor, together with either pCMV-3Tag-3A-hmtThrRS precursor or pCMV-3Tag-3A, was co-transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 to express the genes of FLAG- or c-Myc-hmtThrRS as described previously (32Ling C.

https://openalex.org/W2469550460,"Background We characterized associations between smoking, alcohol, and recreational drug use and coronary plaque by HIV serostatus within the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Methods MACS participants (N = 1005, 621 HIV+ and 384 HIV-) underwent non-contrast CT scanning to measure coronary artery calcium; 764 underwent coronary CT angiograms to evaluate plaque type and extent. Self-reported use of alcohol, tobacco, smoked/inhaled cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, marijuana, inhaled nitrites, and erectile dysfunction drugs was obtained at semi-annual visits beginning 10 years prior to CT scanning. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were performed, stratified by HIV serostatus. Results Among HIV+ men, current smoking, former smoking, and cumulative pack years of smoking were positively associated with multiple coronary plaque measures (coronary artery calcium presence and extent, total plaque presence and extent, calcified plaque presence, and stenosis >50%). Smoking was significantly associated with fewer plaque measures of comparable effect size among HIV- men; current smoking and calcified plaque extent was the only such association. Heavy alcohol use (>14 drinks/week) was associated with stenosis >50% among HIV+ men. Among HIV- men, low/moderate (1–14 drinks/week) and heavy alcohol use were inversely associated with coronary artery calcium and calcified plaque extent. Few significant associations between other recreational drug use and plaque measures were observed. Conclusion Smoking is strongly associated with coronary plaque among HIV+ men, underscoring the value of smoking cessation for HIV+ persons. Alcohol use may protect against coronary artery calcium and calcified plaque progression in HIV- (but not HIV+) men. Few positive associations were observed between recreational drug use and coronary plaque measures."
https://openalex.org/W2267793926,"Background Socioeconomic inequalities in childhood obesity have been reported in most developed countries, with obesity more common in deprived groups. Whether inequalities are found in the prevalence of underweight, the rest of the body mass index (BMI) distribution, or have changed across time is not clear. Methods and Findings The sample comprised 5,027,128 children on entry (4 to 5 years old) and leaving (10 to 11 years) state primary (elementary) school who participated in the National Child Measurement Programme (England, United Kingdom). We used area-level deprivation (Indices of Multiple Deprivation at the lower super output area) as a measure of socioeconomic deprivation. From 2007–2008 to 2011–2012 inequalities in obesity between the most compared to least deprived group increased (from 7.21% to 8.30%; p<0.001), whereas inequalities in the prevalence of underweight (1.50% to 1.21%; p = 0.15) were stable during this period. There were no differences by age group or by sex, but a three-way interaction suggested inequalities in obesity had increased at a faster rate for 10 to 11 year old girls, than 4 to 5 year old boys, (2.03% vs 0.07%; p<0.001 for interaction). Investigating inequalities across the distribution of zBMI showed increases in mean zBMI (0.18 to 0.23, p<0.001) could be attributed to increases in inequalities between the 50th and 75th centiles of BMI. Using the 2011 to 2012 population attributable risk estimates, if inequalities were halved, 14.04% (95% CI 14.00% to 14.07%) of childhood obesity could be avoided. Conclusions Socioeconomic inequalities in childhood obesity and zBMI increased in England between 2007–2008 and 2011–2012. Inequalities in the prevalence of underweight did not change. Traditional methods of examining inequalities only at the clinical thresholds of overweight and obesity may have led the magnitude of inequalities in childhood BMI to be underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2258913832,"Biomarkers from multiple modalities have been shown to correlate with cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationships of these markers with each other, and the use of multiple markers in concert to predict an outcome of interest, are areas that are much less explored. Our objectives in this study were (1) to evaluate relationships among 17 biomarkers previously reported to associate with cognition in PD or AD and (2) to test performance of a five-biomarker classifier trained to recognize AD in identifying PD with dementia (PDD). To do this, we evaluated a cross-sectional cohort of PD patients (n = 75) across a spectrum of cognitive abilities. All PD participants had 17 baseline biomarkers from clinical, genetic, biochemical, and imaging modalities measured, and correlations among biomarkers were assessed by Spearman's rho and by hierarchical clustering. We found that internal correlation among all 17 candidate biomarkers was modest, showing a maximum pairwise correlation coefficient of 0.51. However, a five-marker subset panel derived from AD (CSF total tau, CSF phosphorylated tau, CSF amyloid beta 42, APOE genotype, and SPARE-AD imaging score) discriminated cognitively normal PD patients vs. PDD patients with 80% accuracy, when employed in a classifier originally trained to recognize AD. Thus, an AD-derived biomarker signature may identify PDD patients with moderately high accuracy, suggesting mechanisms shared with AD in some PDD patients. Based on five measures readily obtained during life, this AD-derived signature may prove useful in identifying PDD patients most likely to respond to AD-based crossover therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2404121948,"Enhanced production of 2-hydroxy-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (2-OH-PCA) by the biological control strain Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84 derivative 30-84O* was shown previously to promote cell adhesion and alter the three-dimensional structure of surface-attached biofilms compared to the wild type. The current study demonstrates that production of 2-OH-PCA promotes the release of extracellular DNA, which is correlated with the production of structured biofilm matrix. Moreover, the essential role of the extracellular DNA in maintaining the mass and structure of the 30-84 biofilm matrix is demonstrated. To better understand the role of different phenazines in biofilm matrix production and gene expression, transcriptomic analyses were conducted comparing gene expression patterns of populations of wild type, 30-84O* and a derivative of 30-84 producing only PCA (30-84PCA) to a phenazine defective mutant (30-84ZN) when grown in static cultures. RNA-Seq analyses identified a group of 802 genes that were differentially expressed by the phenazine producing derivatives compared to 30-84ZN, including 240 genes shared by the two 2-OH-PCA producing derivatives, the wild type and 30-84O*. A gene cluster encoding a bacteriophage-derived pyocin and its lysis cassette was upregulated in 2-OH-PCA producing derivatives. A holin encoded in this gene cluster was found to contribute to the release of eDNA in 30-84 biofilm matrices, demonstrating that the influence of 2-OH-PCA on eDNA production is due in part to cell autolysis as a result of pyocin production and release. The results expand the current understanding of the functions different phenazines play in the survival of bacteria in biofilm-forming communities."
https://openalex.org/W2413122677,"This paper explores several data mining and time series analysis methods for predicting the magnitude of the largest seismic event in the next year based on the previously recorded seismic events in the same region. The methods are evaluated on a catalog of 9,042 earthquake events, which took place between 01/01/1983 and 31/12/2010 in the area of Israel and its neighboring countries. The data was obtained from the Geophysical Institute of Israel. Each earthquake record in the catalog is associated with one of 33 seismic regions. The data was cleaned by removing foreshocks and aftershocks. In our study, we have focused on ten most active regions, which account for more than 80% of the total number of earthquakes in the area. The goal is to predict whether the maximum earthquake magnitude in the following year will exceed the median of maximum yearly magnitudes in the same region. Since the analyzed catalog includes only 28 years of complete data, the last five annual records of each region (referring to the years 2006–2010) are kept for testing while using the previous annual records for training. The predictive features are based on the Gutenberg-Richter Ratio as well as on some new seismic indicators based on the moving averages of the number of earthquakes in each area. The new predictive features prove to be much more useful than the indicators traditionally used in the earthquake prediction literature. The most accurate result (AUC = 0.698) is reached by the Multi-Objective Info-Fuzzy Network (M-IFN) algorithm, which takes into account the association between two target variables: the number of earthquakes and the maximum earthquake magnitude during the same year."
https://openalex.org/W2257123360,"The Drosophila mutant tko25t exhibits a deficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis, leading to a global insufficiency of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. This entrains an organismal phenotype of developmental delay and sensitivity to seizures induced by mechanical stress. We found that the mutant phenotype is exacerbated in a dose-dependent fashion by high dietary sugar levels. tko25t larvae were found to exhibit severe metabolic abnormalities that were further accentuated by high-sugar diet. These include elevated pyruvate and lactate, decreased ATP and NADPH. Dietary pyruvate or lactate supplementation phenocopied the effects of high sugar. Based on tissue-specific rescue, the crucial tissue in which this metabolic crisis initiates is the gut. It is accompanied by down-regulation of the apparatus of cytosolic protein synthesis and secretion at both the RNA and post-translational levels, including a novel regulation of S6 kinase at the protein level."
https://openalex.org/W1452934819,"The co-registration of eye tracking and electroencephalography provides a holistic measure of ongoing cognitive processes. Recently, fixation-related potentials have been introduced to quantify the neural activity in such bi-modal recordings. Fixation-related potentials are time-locked to fixation onsets, just like event-related potentials are locked to stimulus onsets. Compared to existing electroencephalography-based brain-machine interfaces that depend on visual stimuli, fixation-related potentials have the advantages that they can be used in free, unconstrained viewing conditions and can also be classified on a single-trial level. Thus, fixation-related potentials have the potential to allow for conceptually different brain-machine interfaces that directly interpret cortical activity related to the visual processing of specific objects. However, existing research has investigated fixation-related potentials only with very restricted and highly unnatural stimuli in simple search tasks while participant’s body movements were restricted. We present a study where we relieved many of these restrictions while retaining some control by using a gaze-contingent visual search task. In our study, participants had to find a target object out of 12 complex and everyday objects presented on a screen while the electrical activity of the brain and eye movements were recorded simultaneously. Our results show that our proposed method for the classification of fixation-related potentials can clearly discriminate between fixations on relevant, non-relevant and background areas. Furthermore, we show that our classification approach generalizes not only to different test sets from the same participant, but also across participants. These results promise to open novel avenues for exploiting fixation-related potentials in electroencephalography-based brain-machine interfaces and thus providing a novel means for intuitive human-machine interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2264019458,"Background Diabetes Mellitus is a multifaceted chronic illness and its life-long treatment process requires patients to continuously engage with the healthcare system. The understanding of how patients manoeuvre through the healthcare system for treatment is crucial in assisting them to optimise their disease management. This study aims to explore issues determining patients’ treatment strategies and the process of patients manoeuvring through the current healthcare system in selecting their choice of treatment for T2DM. Methods The Grounded Theory methodology was used. Twelve patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, nine family members and five healthcare providers from the primary care clinics were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Three focus group discussions were conducted among thirteen healthcare providers from public primary care clinics. Both purposive and theoretical samplings were used for data collection. The interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim, followed by line-by-line coding and constant comparison to identify the categories and core category. Results The concept of “experimentation” was observed in patients’ help-seeking behaviour. The “experimentation” process required triggers, followed by information seeking related to treatment characteristics from trusted family members, friends and healthcare providers to enable decisions to be made on the choice of treatment modalities. The whole process was dynamic and iterative through interaction with the healthcare system. The decision-making process in choosing the types of treatment was complex with an element of trial-and-error. The anchor of this process was the desire to fulfil the patient’s expected outcome. Conclusion Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus continuously used “experimentation” in their treatment strategies and help-seeking process. The “experimentation” process was experiential, with continuous evaluation, information seeking and decision-making tinged with the element of trial-and-error. The theoretical model generated from this study is abstract, is believed to have a broad applicability to other diseases, may be applied at varying stages of disease development and is non-context specific."
https://openalex.org/W2275202079,"Purpose To correlate the differentially expressed miRNAs with clinico-pathological features in uveal melanoma (UM) tumors harbouring chromosomal 3 aberrations among South Asian Indian cohort. Methods Based on chromosomal 3 aberration, UM (n = 86) were grouped into monosomy 3 (M3; n = 51) and disomy 3 (D3; n = 35) by chromogenic in-situ hybridisation (CISH). The clinico-pathological features were recorded. miRNA profiling was performed in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) UM samples (n = 6) using Agilent, Human miRNA microarray, 8x15KV3 arrays. The association between miRNAs and clinico-pathological features were studied using univariate and multivariate analysis. miRNA-gene targets were predicted using Target-scan and MiRanda database. Significantly dys-regulated miRNAs were validated in FFPE UM (n = 86) and mRNAs were validated in frozen UM (n = 10) by qRT-PCR. Metastasis free-survival and miRNA expressions were analysed by Kaplen-Meier analysis in UM tissues (n = 52). Results Unsupervised analysis revealed 585 differentially expressed miRNAs while supervised analysis demonstrated 82 miRNAs (FDR; Q = 0.0). Differential expression of 8 miRNAs: miR-214, miR-149*, miR-143, miR-146b, miR-199a, let7b, miR-1238 and miR-134 were studied. Gene target prediction revealed SMAD4, WISP1, HIPK1, HDAC8 and C-KIT as the post-transcriptional regulators of miR-146b, miR-199a, miR-1238 and miR-134. Five miRNAs (miR-214, miR146b, miR-143, miR-199a and miR-134) were found to be differentially expressed in M3/ D3 UM tumors. In UM patients with liver metastasis, miR-149* and miR-134 expressions were strongly correlated. Conclusion UM can be stratified using miRNAs from FFPE sections. miRNAs predicting liver metastasis and survival have been identified. Mechanistic linkage of de-regulated miRNA/mRNA expressions provide new insights on their role in UM progression and aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2266044804,"Consumers of fruits and vegetables are frequently exposed to small amounts of hormonally active pesticides, some of them sharing a common mode of action such as the activation of the human estrogen receptor α (hERα) or β (hERβ). Therefore, it is of particular importance to evaluate risks emanating from chemical mixtures, in which the individual pesticides are present at human-relevant concentrations, below their corresponding maximum residue levels. Binary and ternary iso-effective mixtures of estrogenic pesticides at effect concentrations eliciting a 1 or 10% effect in the presence or absence of 17β-estradiol were tested experimentally at the hERα in the yeast-based estrogen screen (YES) assay as well as in the human U2-OS cell-based ERα chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (ERα CALUX) assay and at the hERβ in the ERβ CALUX assay. The outcome was then compared to predictions calculated by means of concentration addition. In most cases, additive effects were observed with the tested combinations in all three test systems, an observation that supports the need to expand the risk assessment of pesticides and consider cumulative risk assessment. An additional testing of mixture effects at the hERβ showed that most test substances being active at the hERα could also elicit additive effects at the hERβ, but the hERβ was less sensitive. In conclusion, effects of the same ligands at the hERα and the hERβ could influence the estrogenic outcome under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2260438099,"Rhesus factor polymorphism has been an evolutionary enigma since its discovery in 1939. Carriers of the rarer allele should be eliminated by selection against Rhesus positive children born to Rhesus negative mothers. Here I used an ecologic regression study to test the hypothesis that Rhesus factor polymorphism is stabilized by heterozygote advantage. The study was performed in 65 countries for which the frequencies of RhD phenotypes and specific disease burden data were available. I performed multiple multivariate covariance analysis with five potential confounding variables: GDP, latitude (distance from the equator), humidity, medical care expenditure per capita and frequencies of smokers. The results showed that the burden associated with many diseases correlated with the frequencies of particular Rhesus genotypes in a country and that the direction of the relation was nearly always the opposite for the frequency of Rhesus negative homozygotes and that of Rhesus positive heterozygotes. On the population level, a Rhesus-negativity-associated burden could be compensated for by the heterozygote advantage, but for Rhesus negative subjects this burden represents a serious problem."
https://openalex.org/W2271158528,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is known to be a highly contagious childhood illness. In recent years, the number of reported cases of HFMD has significantly increased in mainland China. This study aims at the epidemiological features, spatiotemporal patterns of HMFD at the county/district level in mainland China.Data on reported HFMD cases for each county from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 were obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Cluster analysis, spatial autocorrelation, and retrospective scan methods were used to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of the disease.The annual incidences varied greatly among the counties, ranging from 0 to 74.31‰ with the median of 5.42‰ (interquartile range: 1.54‰-13.55‰) during 2008-2012 in mainland China. Counties close to provincial capital cities generally had higher incidences than rural counties. A seasonal distribution was observed between the northern and southern China, of which dual epidemic were shown in southern China and usually only one in northern China. Based on the global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis, we found that the spatial distribution of HFMD was presented a significant clustering pattern for each year (P<0.001), and hotspots of the disease were mostly distributed in coastal provinces of China. The retrospective scan statistic further identified the dynamics of spatiotemporal clustering areas of the disease, which were mainly distributed in the counties of eastern and southern China, as well as provincial capitals and their surrounding counties.The spatiotemporal clustering areas of the disease identified in this way were relatively stable, and imminent public health planning and resource allocation should be focused within those areas."
https://openalex.org/W2258329275,"In 2011 the first recorded bleaching event for the high latitude Houtman Abrolhos Islands (HAI) coral communities was documented. This bleaching event highlighted the question of whether a supply of 'heat tolerant' coral recruits from the tropical north would be sufficient to provide a level of resistance for these reefs to future warming events. Using Lagrangian modelling we showed that due to its regional isolation, large-scale larval input from potential tropical northern source populations to the HAI is unlikely, despite the southward flowing Leeuwin current. Successful recruitment to artificial substrates was recorded following the bleaching event. However, this was negligible (0.4 ± 0.1 recruits per tile) compared to 2013 post impact recruitment (128.8 ± 15.8 recruits per tile). Our data therefore provides preliminary evidence suggesting that the connectivity of the HAI with coral communities in the north is limited, and population maintenance and recovery is likely driven primarily by self-recruitment. Given the low thermal tolerance of the HAI coral communities, the dominance of Acropora, and the apparent reliance on self-recruitment, an increased frequency of thermally anomalous conditions at the HAI (such as experienced in 2011) has the potential to reduce the long-term stability of the HAI coral populations and species that depend upon them."
https://openalex.org/W2261526891,"Background and Objective We characterize the burden of liver disease in a cohort of PWID in Chennai, India, with a high prevalence of HCV. Materials and Methods 1,042 PWID were sampled through community outreach in Chennai. Participants underwent fasting blood draw, questionnaire and an examination that included liver stiffness assessment using transient elastography (Fibroscan) and assessment of steatosis via ultrasound. Results The median age was 39 years, all were male, 14.8% were HIV infected and 35.6% were HCV antibody positive, of whom 78.9% were chronically infected (HCV RNA positive). Median liver stiffness was 6.2 kPA; 72.9% had no evidence of or mild stiffness, 14.5% had moderate stiffness, and 12.6% had evidence of severe stiffness/cirrhosis. Prevalence of severe stiffness/cirrhosis was significantly higher among persons who were older, had a longer duration of injecting drugs, higher body mass index, higher prevalence of insulin resistance, higher prevalence of steatosis, higher HCV RNA levels and evidence of alcohol dependence. An estimated 42.1% of severe stiffness/cirrhosis in this sample was attributable to HCV. 529 (53.0%) had some evidence of steatosis. Prevalence of steatosis was higher among those who had larger waist circumference, insulin resistance, higher HDL cholesterol and a history of antiretroviral therapy. Conclusions We observed a high burden of liver disease in this relatively young cohort that was primarily driven by chronic HCV infection, metabolic factors (insulin resistance and steatosis) and heavy alcohol use. Interventions to improve access to HCV treatment and reduce alcohol use are needed to prevent further progression of liver disease."

Identification of the genes associated with the olfactory system, without the doubt will promote studying the insect chemical communication system. In this study, RNA-seq technology was used to sequence the antennae transcriptome of Athetis dissimilis, an emerging crop pest in China with limited genomic information, with the purpose of identifying the gene set involved in olfactory recognition. Analysis of the transcriptome of female and male antennae generated 13.74 Gb clean reads in total from which 98,001 unigenes were assembled, and 25,930 unigenes were annotated. Total of 60 olfactory receptors (ORs), 18 gustatory receptors (GRs), and 12 ionotropic receptors (IRs) were identified by Blast and sequence similarity analyzes. One obligated olfactory receptor co-receptor (Orco) and four conserved sex pheromone receptors (PRs) were annotated in 60 ORs. Among the putative GRs, five genes (AdisGR1, 6, 7, 8 and 94) clustered in the sugar receptor family, and two genes (AdisGR3 and 93) involved in CO2 detection were identified. Finally, AdisIR8a.1 and AdisIR8a.2 co-receptors were identified in the group of candidate IRs. Furthermore, expression levels of these chemosensory receptor genes in female and male antennae were analyzed by mapping the Illumina reads."
https://openalex.org/W2253490178,"Transposable elements (TEs), repeated mobile sequences, are ubiquitous in the eukaryotic kingdom. Their mobilizing capacity confers on them a high mutagenic potential, which must be strongly regulated to guarantee genome stability. In the Drosophila germline, a small RNA-mediated silencing system, the piRNA (Piwi-interacting RNA) pathway, is the main responsible TE regulating mechanism, but some stressful conditions can destabilize it. For instance, during interspecific hybridization, genomic stress caused by the shock of two different genomes can lead, in both animals and plants, to higher transposition rates. A recent study in D. buzatii—D. koepferae hybrids detected mobilization of 28 TEs, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms explaining this transposition release. We have characterized one of the mobilized TEs, the retrotransposon Helena, and used quantitative expression to assess whether its high transposition rates in hybrids are preceded by increased expression. We have also localized Helena expression in the gonads to see if cellular expression patterns have changed in the hybrids. To give more insight into changes in TE regulation in hybrids, we analysed Helena-specific piRNA populations of hybrids and parental species. Helena expression is not globally altered in somatic tissues, but male and female gonads have different patterns of deregulation. In testes, Helena is repressed in F1, increasing then its expression up to parental values. This is linked with a mislocation of Helena transcripts along with an increase of their specific piRNA levels. Ovaries have additive levels of Helena expression, but the ping-pong cycle efficiency seems to be reduced in F1 hybrids. This could be at the origin of new Helena insertions in hybrids, which would be transmitted to F1 hybrid female progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2259090724,"RS1, also known as retinoschisin, is a disulphide-linked, discoidin domain containing homo-oligomeric protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cellular and synaptic organization of the retina. This is highlighted by the finding that over 130 mutations in RS1 cause X-linked retinoschisis, a retinal degenerative disease characterized by the splitting of the retinal cell layers, disruption of the photoreceptor–bipolar synapses, degeneration of photoreceptors, and severe loss in central vision. In this study, we investigated the arrangement of the RS1 subunits within the oligomer complex using single particle electron microscopy. RS1 was seen as two stacked rings with each ring displaying a symmetrical cog wheel-like structure with eight teeth or projections corresponding to the RS1 subunits. Three dimensional reconstruction and molecular modelling indicated that the discoidin domain, the principal functional unit of RS1, projects outward, and the Rs1 domain and C-terminal segment containing intermolecular disulphide bonds are present in the inner ring to form the core octameric structure. These studies provide a basis for further understanding the role of the novel core RS1 octameric complex in retinal cell biology and X-linked retinoschisis."

Breast epithelial tissue, whether healthy or tumoral, is directly in contact with fat cells, which in turn could influence tumor multifocality. In this pilot study we investigated whether the fatty acid composition of breast adipose tissue differed according to breast cancer focality. Methods Twenty-three consecutive women presenting with non-metastatic breast cancer underwent breast-imaging procedures including Magnetic Resonance Imaging prior to treatment. Breast adipose tissue specimens were collected during breast surgery. We established a biochemical profile of adipose tissue fatty acids by gas chromatography. We assessed whether there were differences according to breast cancer focality. Results We found that decreased levels in breast adipose tissue of docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, the two main polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids of marine origin, were associated with multifocality. Discussion These differences in lipid content may contribute to mechanisms through which peritumoral adipose tissue fuels breast cancer multifocality."

Here we investigated whether corticosteroid treatment can attenuate HIV disease progression in antiretroviral-untreated patients. Methods Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial including 326 HIV-patients in a resource-limited setting in Tanzania (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01299948). Inclusion criteria were a CD4 count above 300 cells/μl, the absence of AIDS-defining symptoms and an ART-naïve therapy status. Study participants received 5 mg prednisolone per day or placebo for 2 years. Primary endpoint was time to progression to an AIDS-defining condition or to a CD4-count below 200 cells/μl. Results No significant change in progression towards the primary endpoint was observed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis (19 cases with prednisolone versus 28 cases with placebo, p = 0.1407). In a per-protocol (PP)-analysis, 13 versus 24 study participants progressed to the primary study endpoint (p = 0.0741). Secondary endpoints: Prednisolone-treatment decreased immune activation (sCD14, suPAR, CD38/HLA-DR/CD8+) and increased CD4-counts (+77.42 ± 5.70 cells/μl compared to -37.42 ± 10.77 cells/μl under placebo, p < 0.0001). Treatment with prednisolone was associated with a 3.2-fold increase in HIV viral load (p < 0.0001). In a post-hoc analysis stratifying for sex, females treated with prednisolone progressed significantly slower to the primary study endpoint than females treated with placebo (ITT-analysis: 11 versus 21 cases, p = 0.0567; PP-analysis: 5 versus 18 cases, p = 0.0051): No changes in disease progression were observed in men. Conclusions This study could not detect any significant effects of prednisolone on disease progression in antiretroviral-untreated HIV infection within the intent-to-treat population. However, significant effects were observed on CD4 counts, immune activation and HIV viral load. This study contributes to a better understanding of the role of immune activation in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01299948"

Methods A prospective cross-sectional study between September 2009 and December 2014 was carried out at ALTAMEDICA Fetal–Maternal Medical Centre, Rome, Italy. Of 25203 fetal biometric measurements, 12167 (48%) measurements of the cerebellar vermis were available. After excluding 1562 (12.8%) measurements, a total of 10605 (87.2%) fetuses were considered and analyzed once only. Parametric and nonparametric quantile regression models were used for the statistical analysis. In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed reference charts regarding various distributional assumptions on the ultrasound measurements at hand, we compared the gestational age-specific reference curves we produced through the statistical methods used. Normal mean height based on parametric and nonparametric methods were defined for each week of gestation and the regression equation expressing the height of the cerebellar vermis as a function of gestational age was calculated. Finally the correlation between dimension/gestation was measured. Results The mean height of the cerebellar vermis was 12.7mm (SD, 1.6mm; 95% confidence interval, 12.7–12.8mm). The regression equation expressing the height of the CV as a function of the gestational age was: height (mm) = -4.85+0.78 x gestational age. The correlation between dimension/gestation was expressed by the coefficient r = 0.87. Conclusion This is the first prospective cross-sectional study on fetal cerebellar vermis biometry with such a large sample size reported in literature. It is a detailed statistical survey and contains new centile-based reference charts for fetal height of cerebellar vermis measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2410483513,"India has one of the largest assemblages of tropical biodiversity, with its unique floristic composition of endemic species. However, current forest cover assessment is performed via satellite-based forest surveys, which have many limitations. The present study, which was performed in the Eastern Ghats, analysed the satellite-based inventory provided by forest surveys and inferred from the results that this process no longer provides adequate information for quantifying forest degradation in an empirical manner. The study analysed 21 soil properties and generated a forest soil quality index of the Eastern Ghats, using principal component analysis. Using matrix modules and geospatial technology, we compared the forest degradation status calculated from satellite-based forest surveys with the degradation status calculated from the forest soil quality index. The Forest Survey of India classified about 1.8% of the Eastern Ghats’ total area as degraded forests and the remainder (98.2%) as open, dense, and very dense forests, whereas the soil quality index results found that about 42.4% of the total area is degraded, with the remainder (57.6%) being non-degraded. Our ground truth verification analyses indicate that the forest soil quality index along with the forest cover density data from the Forest Survey of India are ideal tools for evaluating forest degradation."

Suspected cases reported between January 2010 and December 2012 were assessed for the timeliness of the sample collection, occurrence of measles clinical symptoms, and the results of the laboratory diagnoses. For 88% of the 2,708 suspected cases, a clinical specimen was collected within 7d of rash onset, of which 50% were IgM-positive and 2.6% were equivocal. The measles symptoms were reported in 91.4% of the cases; the occurrence of symptoms showed a positive association with the serological results (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9883, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2238–4.0157). Of the negative samples, 52% (n = 116) tested positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These results are in favor of using molecular detection to complement serological diagnosis in the context of measles surveillance approach in Morocco. In addition, the introduction of additional laboratory methods for differential diagnosis is required for the final classification of suspected cases with maculopapular rash and fever in the context of the measles elimination program."
https://openalex.org/W2270740282,"Rationale and Experimental Approach Aggregate dredging is a growing source of anthropogenic disturbance in coastal UK waters and has the potential to impact marine systems through the smothering of benthic fauna with organically loaded screening discards. This study investigates the tolerance of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis to such episodic smothering events using a multi-factorial design, including organic matter concentration, temperature, sediment fraction size and duration of burial as important predictor variables. Results and Discussion Mussel mortality was significantly higher in organically loaded burials when compared to control sediments after just 2 days. Particularly, M. edulis specimens under burial in fine sediment with high (1%) concentrations of organic matter experienced a significantly higher mortality rate (p<0.01) than those under coarse control aggregates. Additionally, mussels exposed to the summer maximum temperature treatment (20°C) exhibited significantly increased mortality (p<0.01) compared to those in the ambient treatment group (15°C). Total Oxygen Uptake rates of experimental aggregates were greatest (112.7 mmol m-2 day-1) with 1% organic loadings in coarse sediment at 20°C. Elevated oxygen flux rates in porous coarse sediments are likely to be a function of increased vertical migration of anaerobically liberated sulphides to the sediment-water interface. However, survival of M. edulis under bacterial mats of Beggiatoa spp. indicates the species’ resilience to sulphides and so we propose that the presence of reactive organic matter within the burial medium may facilitate bacterial growth and increase mortality through pathogenic infection. This may be exacerbated under the stable interstitial conditions in fine sediment and increased bacterial metabolism under high temperatures. Furthermore, increased temperature may impose metabolic demands upon the mussel that cannot be met during burial-induced anaerobiosis. Summary Lack of consideration for the role of organic matter and temperature during sedimentation events may lead to an overestimation of the tolerance of benthic species to smothering from dredged material."
https://openalex.org/W2258370840,"Mycoplasma infection in human and its contamination in cell cultures are worldwide problems. The drugs currently available for preventing or treating mycoplasma infection suffer from low sensitivity, strong resistance and high toxicity. Our previous work showed that Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) infection was mediated by the interaction between p37 of M. hyorhinis and Annexin A2 (ANXA2) of host cells, however the translational value of this mechanism was unknown. Herein, we synthesized the N-terminal of ANXA2 polypeptide (A2PP) and found that A2PP could decrease the infection of M. hyorhinis to gastric cancer cells and block M. hyorhinis infection-induced cell migration. Furthermore, we found that A2PP could reduce M. hyorhinis contamination of passage cells. Moreover, compared with the commercial antibiotics commonly used in cell culture to prevent M. hyorhinis infection, A2PP demonstrated a more effectiveness but a low toxicity on cell growth. Thus, our study for the first time revealed A2PP’s potential for the treatment and prevention of M. hyorhinis infection."
https://openalex.org/W2267939677,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and emphysema, which lead to reduced lung function and breathlessness. The pathologies of COPD are due to an abnormal immune response. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are an important population of innate lymphocytes and have been implicated in the regulation of immune responses associated with a broad range of diseases including COPD. We have here analyzed the role of iNKT cells in a model of COPD induced by repeated intranasal administration of iNKT cell agonist α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer). Our results demonstrated that mice that received repeated intranasal administration of α-GalCer had molecular and inflammatory features of COPD including airway inflammation with significant increases in infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes, CD8+ T cells, as well as proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. In particular, these mice also showed the presence of pulmonary emphysema, mucus production, and pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-4 reduced α-GalCer induced emphysema. This study indicates the importance of iNKT cells in the pathogenesis of COPD by an IL-4 dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2292601314,"Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) promote deactivation of heterotrimeric G proteins thus controlling the magnitude and kinetics of responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). In the nervous system, RGS7 and RGS9–2 play essential role in vision, reward processing, and movement control. Both RGS7 and RGS9–2 belong to the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins that form macromolecular complexes with R7-binding protein (R7BP). R7BP targets RGS proteins to the plasma membrane and augments their GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) activity, ultimately accelerating deactivation of G protein signaling. However, it remains unclear if R7BP serves exclusively as a membrane anchoring subunit or further modulates RGS proteins to increase their GAP activity. To directly answer this question, we utilized a rapidly reversible chemically induced protein dimerization system that enabled us to control RGS localization independent from R7BP in living cells. To monitor kinetics of Gα deactivation, we coupled this strategy with measuring changes in the GAP activity by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay in a cellular system containing μ-opioid receptor. This approach was used to correlate changes in RGS localization and activity in the presence or absence of R7BP. Strikingly, we observed that RGS activity is augmented by membrane recruitment, in an orientation independent manner with no additional contributions provided by R7BP. These findings argue that the association of R7 RGS proteins with the membrane environment provides a major direct contribution to modulation of their GAP activity.

In the nervous system, signaling through transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorGAPGTPase-activating proteinRGSregulator of G protein signalingR7BPR7-binding proteinMORμ-opioid receptor. plays a crucial role in a number of fundamental processes including differentiation, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity (1.Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mammalian G proteins and their cell type specific functions.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1159-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Upon binding to an extracellular ligand, GPCRs undergo a conformational change that leads to activation of intracellular heterotrimeric Gαβγ proteins. This process involves dissociation of G proteins into GαGTP and Gβγ subunits freeing them for the interaction with downstream effectors (2.Neer E.J. Heterotrimeric G proteins: organizers of transmembrane signals.Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the response depends on the amount of time G proteins spend in their activated state. Therefore, timely deactivation of G proteins is crucial for determining the overall extent of signaling. G protein-coupled receptor GTPase-activating protein regulator of G protein signaling R7-binding protein μ-opioid receptor. Deactivation of G proteins is controlled by Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins which act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerating the rate of GTP hydrolysis on the Gα subunit thereby promoting return of G protein to its inactive Gαβγ heterotrimeric state. It is currently well accepted that the RGS-catalyzed G protein deactivation is essential for determining timing, extent and sensitivity of G protein signaling in a number of GPCR pathways (3.Ross E.M.

Among more than 30 known RGS proteins in mammalian genomes, critical roles for the signaling in the nervous system has been attributed to the R7 family that includes RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. Two members of the R7 family in particular, RGS7 and long splice isoform of RGS9: RGS9–2, ensure timely Gα deactivation required in key neuronal processes including vision, motor control, reward behavior, and nociception (5.Anderson G.R.

However, the impact of membrane association relative to possible direct effects of R7BP is unknown. In this study we examined the contribution of membrane localization of RGS7 and RGS9–2 in regulation of MOR receptor signaling. We implemented a reversible-chemical dimerization system to control RGS localization independent of binding partners and evaluated real-time changes in GAP activity with and without R7BP in live cells. Our results show that membrane recruitment of RGS is sufficient for attaining the full potentiation of their GAP activity.

Approximately 75,000 cells were added to a 96-well plate followed by an equal volume of Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega, Madison, WI). BRET measurements were recorded at room temperature on a POLARstar Omega micro plate reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC) utilizing two emission photomultiplier tubes enabling simultaneous detection of light from masGRK3ct-Nluc (475 nm) and Gβ1γ2-Venus (535 nm) with a resolution of 50 milliseconds for every data point. BRET signal was calculated as the ratio of raw 535 nm intensity divided by the raw 475 nm intensity, which was then normalized by subtracting the baseline BRET ratio prior to agonist application and expressed as a percent of maximal BRET signal. Following BRET assay samples were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were lysed by sonication, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and total protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay Reagent. Samples were denatured in SDS/urea sample buffer, resolved on PAGEr Gold Gels (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), and transferred to PVDF membranes for detection with the following primary antibodies: sheep anti-RGS9–2 (20.Martemyanov K.A.

Species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West Pico ECL (Pierce) was used to capture the signal on film. Western blots were quantified using ImageJ software. The relative expression of RGS was determined by subtracting the band density from cells only expressing endogenous RGS proteins. For each BRET experiment a single exponential fit, 1/τ (s−1), was obtained from the deactivation phase of the curve. A kGAP rate constant was determined by subtracting the basal deactivation rate of cells only expressing endogenous RGS proteins. To compare GAP activity across experiments, kGAP values were then normalized to RGS expression from Western analysis and presented as kGAP/expression (s−1). A minimum of three biological replicates were performed for each experiment. To separate the contribution of protein-protein interactions from the effects of changes in the subcellular localization we sought to develop a system where we can measure RGS GAP activity as we change its association with the plasma membrane. To achieve this, we applied a recently described chemically induced dimerization system that allows controlling protein-protein interactions by a set of small molecule drugs in a rapid and completely reversible manner (41.Feng S. Laketa V. Stein F. Rutkowska A. MacNamara A. Depner S. Klingmüller U. Saez-Rodriguez J. Schultz C. A rapidly reversible chemical dimerizer system to study lipid signaling in living cells.Angew Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2014; 53: 6720-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The system utilizes interaction between two proteins, SNAPf and FKBP, which dimerize upon binding to a cell permeable small molecule rCD1. This interaction is rapidly disrupted by addition of a second small molecule FK506 that serves as a competitive antagonist. We positioned SNAPf to the plasma membrane, by appending it to the C-terminal membrane-targeting domain of K-Ras, which contains a polybasic cluster of amino acids followed by a site for prenylation, calling the resulting construct mSNAPf. The matching counterpart, FKBP was fused with the fluorescent protein mCherry and added to the N terminus of RGS7 and RGS9–2 (Fig. 1, A and B). When expressed in NG108–15 together with Gβ5 both FKBP-mCherry-RGS7 and FKBP-mCherry-RGS9–2 localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). This localization was no different than distribution of RGS7/Gβ5 and RGS9–2/Gβ5 complexes tagged only with mCherry but not FKBP (Fig. 1A) and matched previously documented localization of these proteins in transfected cells (28.Song J.H. Waataja J.J. Martemyanov K.A. Subcellular targeting of RGS9–2 is controlled by multiple molecular determinants on its membrane anchor, R7BP.J. Biol.

However, the RF (radiofrequency) fields that have been used in previous studies were weak (≤1.8W/kg), and the bio-effects on C. elegans were mostly negative or ambiguous. Therefore, this study used more intense RF fields (SAR = 3W/kg) and longer time course of exposure (60h at 25°C, L1 stage through adult stage) to investigate the biological consequences of 1750 MHz RF fields in wild-type worms. Methods The growth rates and lifespans of RF-exposure group and the control group were carefully recorded. RNA samples were collected at L4 (35h) and gravid adult (50h) stages for further high-throughput sequencing, focusing on differences between the RF-exposure and the sham control groups. Results The RF-exposed and sham control groups developed at almost the same rate and had similar longevity curves. In L4 stage worms, 94 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated genes were identified, while 186 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated genes were identified in adult stage worms. GO analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes at 35h were associated with growth, body morphogenesis and collagen and cuticle-based development. Genes that were linked to growth rate and reproductive development were differentially expressed at 50h. Some embryonic and larval development genes in the offspring were also differentially expressed at 50h. Ten genes were differentially expressed at both 35h and 50h, most of which were involved in both embryonic and larval developmental processes. Although prolonged RF fields did not induce significant temperature increase in RF exposure groups, the temperature inside worms during exposure was unknown. Conclusions No harmful effects were observed in prolonged exposure to 1750 MHz RF fields at SAR of 3W/kg on development and longevity of C. elegans. Although some differentially expressed genes were found after prolonged RF exposure, these differences were ascribed to oscillating gene expression patterns in L4 and gravid adult worms. It was also difficult to rule out a weak thermal effect caused by prolonged RF exposure inside the worms."
https://openalex.org/W2411211575,Visible light imaging of citrus fruit from Mie Prefecture of Japan was performed to determine whether an algorithm could be developed to predict the sugar content. This nondestructive classification showed that the accurate segmentation of different images can be realized by a correlation analysis based on the threshold value of the coefficient of determination. There is an obvious correlation between the sugar content of citrus fruit and certain parameters of the color images. The selected image parameters were connected by addition algorithm. The sugar content of citrus fruit can be predicted by the dummy variable method. The results showed that the small but orange citrus fruits often have a high sugar content. The study shows that it is possible to predict the sugar content of citrus fruit and to perform a classification of the sugar content using light in the visible spectrum and without the need for an additional light source.
https://openalex.org/W2268747459,"High levels of microparticles (MPs) circulate in the blood of patients with atherosclerotic diseases where they can serve as potential biomarkers of vascular injury and cardiovascular outcome. We used virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) to evaluate the relationship between the levels of circulating MPs and the coronary plaque composition in patients with stable angina. We included 35 patients with stable angina (22 men, age 64 ± 9 years) and a de novo target lesion. Preintervention gray-scale and VH-IVUS analysis was performed across the target lesion. Volumetric analysis was performed over a 10-mm-long segment centered at the minimum luminal site. Blood samples were obtained from the femoral artery before coronary angioplasty. MPs were measured using a solid-phase capture assay from a commercial kit. We divided participants into either a low MPs group or high MPs group based on the median value of MPs. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the groups. The plaque burden and remodeling index were similar between the groups. The presence of VH-IVUS-derived thin-cap fibroatheroma was not different between the groups. The percentage of the necrotic core (NC) was significantly higher in the high MPs group than in the low MPs group, both in planar (17.0 ± 8.8% vs. 24.1 ± 6.9%, p = 0.012) and volumetric analyses (17.0 ± 4.8% vs. 22.1 ± 4.3%, p = 0.002). Circulating MPs were positively correlated with the percentage of the NC area at the minimal luminal site (r = 0.491, p = 0.003) and the percentage of the NC volume (r = 0.496, p = 0.002). Elevated levels of circulating MPs were associated with the amount of NC in the target lesion in those with stable angina, suggesting a potential role of circulating MPs as a biomarker for detecting unstable plaque in patients with stable angina."

The response of the network output to the sensory input has been demonstrated in steady state. An analysis in terms of local sensitivity amplification characterizes the nature of the molecular switch. The sensitivity analysis of the model parameters within the framework of various correlation coefficients helps to decipher the contribution of the modular structure in signal propagation. Once classified, the model parameters are tuned to generate the behavior of some novel strains using simulated annealing, a stochastic optimization technique."
https://openalex.org/W2416669778,"The study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of a newly developed 356 Soccer Shooting Test (356-SST), and the discriminative ability of this test with respect to the soccer players' proficiency level and leg dominance. Sixty-six male soccer players, divided into three groups based on their proficiency level (amateur, n = 24; novice semi-professional, n = 18; and experienced semi-professional players, n = 24), performed 10 kicks following a two-step run up. Forty-eight of them repeated the test on a separate day. The following shooting variables were derived: ball velocity (BV; measured via radar gun), shooting accuracy (SA; average distance from the ball-entry point to the goal centre), and shooting quality (SQ; shooting accuracy divided by the time elapsed from hitting the ball to the point of entry). No systematic bias was evident in the selected shooting variables (SA: 1.98±0.65 vs. 2.00±0.63 m; BV: 24.6±2.3 vs. 24.5±1.9 m s-1; SQ: 2.92±1.0 vs. 2.93±1.0 m s-1; all p>0.05). The intra-class correlation coefficients were high (ICC = 0.70-0.88), and the coefficients of variation were low (CV = 5.3-5.4%). Finally, all three 356-SST variables identify, with adequate sensitivity, differences in soccer shooting ability with respect to the players' proficiency and leg dominance. The results suggest that the 356-SST is a reliable and sensitive test of specific shooting ability in men's soccer. Future studies should test the validity of these findings in a fatigued state, as well as in other populations."
https://openalex.org/W2411678484,"Inhibition of β-adrenergic signalling plays a key role in treatment of heart failure. Gsα is essential for β-adrenergic signal transduction. In order to reduce side-effects of beta-adrenergic inhibition diminishing β-adrenergic signalling in the heart at the level of Gsα is a promising option.We analyzed the influence of Gsα on regulation of myocardial function and development of cardiac hypertrophy, using a transgenic mouse model (C57BL6/J mice) overexpressing a dominant negative Gsα-mutant under control of the α-MHC-promotor. Cardiac phenotype was characterized in vivo and in vitro and under acute and chronic β-adrenergic stimulation. At rest, Gsα-DN-mice showed bradycardia (602 ± 13 vs. 660 ± 17 bpm, p<0.05) and decreased dp/dtmax (5037 ± 546- vs. 6835 ± 505 mmHg/s, p = 0.02). No significant differences were found regarding ejection fraction, heart weight and cardiomyocyte size. β-blockade by propranolol revealed no baseline differences of hemodynamic parameters between wildtype and Gsα-DN-mice. Acute adrenergic stimulation resulted in decreased β-adrenergic responsiveness in Gsα-DN-mice. Under chronic adrenergic stimulation, wildtype mice developed myocardial hypertrophy associated with increase of LV/BW-ratio by 23% (4.4 ± 0.2 vs. 3.5 ± 0.1 mg/g, p<0.01) and cardiac myocyte size by 24% (14927 ± 442 px vs. 12013 ± 583 px, p<0.001). In contrast, both parameters were unchanged in Gsα-DN-mice after chronic isoproterenol stimulation.Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Gsα leads to decreased β-adrenergic responsiveness and is protective against isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy. Thus, Gsα-DN-mice provide novel insights into β-adrenergic signal transduction and its modulation in myocardial overload and failure."
https://openalex.org/W2411210013,"Ammonia concentration (AMC) in poultry facilities varies depending on different environmental conditions and management; however, this is a relatively unexplored subject in Colombia (South America). The objective of this study was to model daily AMC variations in a naturally ventilated caged-egg facility using generalized additive models. Four sensor nodes were used to record AMC, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed on a daily basis, with 10 minute intervals for 12 weeks. The following variables were included in the model: Heat index, Wind, Hour, Location, Height of the sensor to the ground level, and Period of manure accumulation. All effects included in the model were highly significant (p<0.001). The AMC was higher during the night and early morning when the wind was not blowing (0.0 m/s) and the heat index was extreme. The average and maximum AMC were 5.94±3.83 and 31.70 ppm, respectively. Temperatures above 25°C and humidity greater than 80% increased AMC levels. In naturally ventilated caged-egg facilities the daily variations observed in AMC primarily depend on cyclic variations of the environmental conditions and are also affected by litter handling (i.e., removal of the bedding material)."
