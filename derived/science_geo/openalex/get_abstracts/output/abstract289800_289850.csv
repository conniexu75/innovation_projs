https://openalex.org/W1997436613,"A spiroplasma can be isolated and grown continuously in cell-free medium from stunted corn or from Drosophila injected with sap expressed from diseased corn. The organism is serologically related to, but not identical with, Spiroplasma citri, the causative agent of citrus stubborn disease. Leafhopers injected with cultured organisms induced typical symptoms of the corn stunt disease when placed on previously healthy corn plants."
https://openalex.org/W1990232121,"A spiroplasma isolated from corn infected with corn stunt disease has been successfully cultivated in vitro. Acid formation was associated with its growth in liquid medium, and fried egg-shaped or granulated colonies developed on solid agar medium. Healthy leafhopper vectors injected with or allowed to feed on isolates from various serial passages through liquid medium were able to transmit the corn stunt agent to healthy corn plants, inducing typical corn stunt disease in the plants. The spiroplasma was reisolated and cultivated from such diseased plants and was indistinguishable morphologically from the original isolates. These results provide the first definite proof that the corn stunt disease is caused by the corn stunt spiroplasma."

Separate long-term and short-term retrieval processes are implied. An alternative one-process model expressed by a logarithmic function is also considered."
https://openalex.org/W2062911985,"A system of primary wildland reserves may be required to ensure a diversity of plant and animal species in the future. A strategy for locating such reserves involves considerations of their location, number, size, and linkage. The equilibrium theory of island biogeography is a useful analytical tool for predicting future biogeographies according to the dynamics of present plant and animal distributions. Existing reserves in the United States are inadequate in size and number and are clumped in one geographic region. In a planned network there might be several levels of reserves, starting with first- and second-order watersheds of large enough size to support a stable population of large carnivores. Reserves should be distributed so that they include a maximum of the world's biological diversity. Lower-order reserves might serve as stepping-stones among which a supply of species might move as a kind of distributed storage and reintroduce themsleves when local instabilities occur. This would maintain a high immigration rate to balance an extinction rate which can only increase as human settlements expand."
https://openalex.org/W2079154243,"Features exhibited by a large number of sea floor photographs together with the dating of 187 sediment cores from the southeast Indian Ocean have revealed extensive manganese nodule development and sediment erosion in deep basinal areas. The most extensive nodule field, with an area of 106 square kilometers, occurs in the northwestern sector of the South Australian Basin and is named the Southeast Indian Ocean Manganese Pavement. The crests and flanks of the adjacent mid-ocean ridge are, in contrast, free of nodules and marked by much less dynamic bottom water conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2022408047,"The ester carbonyl stretch frequencies of complexes of the macrotetrolide nonactin with Na(+), K(+), Rb(+), Cs(+), Tl(+), NH(4)(+), NH(3)OH(+), and (NH(2))(2)CNH(2)(+) have been measured. For the larger alkali cations and the polyatomic cations, the ester carbonyl stretch frequency is linearly proportional to the cation-ester carbonyl electrostatic interaction energy. This constitutes direct evidence that the cation-nonactin interaction is primarily electrostatic, rather than mechanical (steric)."
