https://openalex.org/W4306721676,"In July 2022, the ongoing monkeypox (MPX) outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern. Modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN, also known as Imvamune, JYNNEOS or Imvanex) is a third-generation smallpox vaccine that is authorized and in use as a vaccine against MPX. To date, there are no data showing MPX virus (MPXV)-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals nor vaccine efficacy against MPX. Here we show that MPXV-neutralizing antibodies can be detected after MPXV infection and after historic smallpox vaccination. However, a two-shot MVA-BN immunization series in non-primed individuals yields relatively low levels of MPXV-neutralizing antibodies. Dose-sparing of an MVA-based influenza vaccine leads to lower MPXV-neutralizing antibody levels, whereas a third vaccination with the same MVA-based vaccine significantly boosts the antibody response. As the role of MPXV-neutralizing antibodies as a correlate of protection against disease and transmissibility is currently unclear, we conclude that cohort studies following vaccinated individuals are necessary to assess vaccine efficacy in at-risk populations."

However, the critical intracellular molecules that orchestrate neuroprotective functions of microglia remain poorly understood. In our studies, we find that targeted deletion of SYK in microglia leads to exacerbated Aβ deposition, aggravated neuropathology, and cognitive defects in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disruption of SYK signaling in this AD model was further shown to impede the development of disease-associated microglia (DAM), alter AKT/GSK3β-signaling, and restrict Aβ phagocytosis by microglia. Conversely, receptor-mediated activation of SYK limits Aβ load. We also found that SYK critically regulates microglial phagocytosis and DAM acquisition in demyelinating disease. Collectively, these results broaden our understanding of the key innate immune signaling molecules that instruct beneficial microglial functions in response to neurotoxic material."

However, it is unclear whether these immune responses are affected by the interval between infection and vaccination. Over a 2-month period, we evaluated antibody and B cell responses to a third-dose mRNA vaccine in 66 individuals with different infection histories. Uninfected and post-boost but not previously infected individuals mounted robust ancestral and variant spike-binding and neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells. Spike-specific B cell responses from recent infection (<180 days) were elevated at pre-boost but comparatively less so at 60 days post-boost compared with uninfected individuals, and these differences were linked to baseline frequencies of CD27lo B cells. Day 60 to baseline ratio of BCR signaling measured by phosphorylation of Syk was inversely correlated to days between infection and vaccination. Thus, B cell responses to booster vaccines are impeded by recent infection.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccines provide protection against symptomatic infection through the induction of strong humoral and cellular immunity (Laidlaw, and Ellebedy, 2022Laidlaw B.J.

The original two-dose BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine elicits antibodies that are highly effective at neutralizing the ancestral virus (Baden et al., 2021Baden L.R.

More recent studies show booster doses increase potency and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response and the induction of strong memory B cell responses against variants of concern (VOCs) (Goel et al., 2022Goel R.R.

Boosted immunity as a result of infection and vaccination, commonly referred to as hybrid immunity, is also highly protective against VOCs (Bhattacharya, 2022Bhattacharya D.

In a study designed to delineate the effects of mRNA vaccination and/or previous infection on symptomatic infection and severity of disease from Omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2, hybrid immunity resulting from previous infection and three doses of vaccine provided the best protection (Altarawneh et al., 2022Altarawneh H.N.

Hybrid immunity from prior infection can provide both quantitative and qualitative benefits by imprinting effector CD4+ T cell populations with enhanced antiviral properties and improving potency and breadth of B cell and antibody responses (Andreano et al., 2021Andreano E. Paciello I. Piccini G. Manganaro N. Pileri P. Hyseni I. Leonardi M. Pantano E. Abbiento V.

However, some of these benefits may not extend to booster doses (Rodda et al., 2022Rodda L.B. Morawski P.A. Pruner K.B. Fahning M.L. Howard C.A. Franko N. Logue J. Eggenberger J. Stokes C. Golez I. et al.Imprinted SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes define hybrid immunity.Cell. 2022; 185 (1588–1601.e14)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.03.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the effects may be modulated by vaccine and/or infection histories. For example, imprinting from booster vaccination has an attenuating effect on response to Omicron infection while responses to other VOCs are boosted and response to Omicron is severely dampened by prior infection with ancestral but less affected by infections with other VOCs (Reynolds et al., 2022Reynolds C.J. Pade C. Gibbons J.M. Otter A.D. Lin K.M. Muñoz Sandoval D. Pieper F.P. Butler D.K. Liu S. Joy G. et al.Immune boosting by B.1.1.529 (Omicron) depends on previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.Science. 2022; 377: eabq1841https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abq1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Added to the increasing complexities associated with effects of infection and re-infection histories are challenges associated with timing of vaccines and how repeated boosting, whether through vaccination or infection, affects the magnitude and durability of protective immunity. Previous findings from primary two-dose mRNA vaccines suggest that an extended interval between doses increases neutralizing antibody and cellular responses (Payne et al., 2021Payne R.P. Longet S. Austin J.A. Skelly D.T. Dejnirattisai W. Adele S. Meardon N. Faustini S. Al-Taei S.

Sannier G. Dubé M. Nayrac M. Painter M.M. Goel R.R. Laporte M. Medjahed H. Williams J.C. Brassard N. et al.A long interval between priming and boosting SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses enhances B cell responses with limited impact on T cell immunity.iScience. 2022; https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4189020Crossref Google Scholar). However, as exposures to SARS-CoV-2 increase, whether through vaccination, infection, or both, it is unclear how timing between exposures modulates these responses. The risk of deleterious effects on the immune system from repeated and frequent stimulation with the same antigen is known from animal models where antibody-mediated feedback and other regulatory mechanisms have been described (Mesin et al., 2020Mesin L. Schiepers A. Ersching J. Barbulescu A. Cavazzoni C.B. Angelini A. Okada T. Kurosaki T. Victora G.D.

Med. 2013; 210: 457-464https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20120150Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The role of pre-existing antibody levels in regulating and restricting B cell responses is also reported in a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinee plasma transfer model (Dangi et al., 2022Dangi T. Sanchez S. Lew M.H. Visvabharathy L. Richner J. Koralnik I.J. Penaloza-MacMaster P. Pre-existing immunity modulates responses to mRNA boosters..2022https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.27.497248Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on antibody and B cell responses to a third dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine in a longitudinal cohort of uninfected, previously infected, and post-boost infected subjects. While we find robust spike-specific antibody and B cell responses to the booster vaccine in both uninfected and post-boost infected individuals, responses are muted in those who were infected prior to boosting. We present evidence that the interval between prior infection and booster vaccination is a critical determinant of the immune response to the booster vaccine and that B cells of individuals who were recently infected are minimally responsive to the booster vaccine. Our findings thus identify timing relative to infection as a key factor in immune boosting. From October 2021 through March 2022, a cohort of 66 adults scheduled to receive a third dose (booster) of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine was recruited to donate blood at baseline (day 0) and days 30 and 60 post-vaccination. At day 60, participants were stratified into three groups based on exposure to SARS-CoV-2: uninfected (N = 44) by nucleocapsid antibody serology, prior-infected (N = 11), or post-infected (N = 11) depending on whether exposure occurred prior to or after booster vaccination, respectively (Figure 1A; Tables 1 and S1). In the post-infected group, BA.1 Omicron was the PCR-confirmed or suspected infecting variant while in the prior-infected group, all infections occurred before the first reports of Omicron (Table S1). The interval between vaccination and post-boost infection ranged from 12 to 44 days with a median of 29 days, and the interval between prior infection and vaccination ranged from 59 to 601 days with a median of 160 days (Tables 1 and S1). Demographics and schedule/source of vaccines did not significantly differ between the groups, except that age was slightly lower in the post-infected group compared with uninfected group, but not prior-infected group (Table 1; Figure S1A).Table 1Group characteristicsUninfected groupPrior-infected groupPost-infected groupSubjects (number)441111Age (years)54 (21–70)aMedian (range).45 (31–65)38 (23–56)Female gender (number, %)28 (64%)8 (73%)6 (54%)Prior infection to booster vaccine (days)N/A160 (59–601)N/ABooster vaccine to post infection (days)N/AN/A29 (12–44)Asymptomatic cases (number, %)N/A2 (18%)3 (27%)Moderna; Pfizer; mixed (number, %)37 (84%); 5 (11%); 2 (4%)8 (73%); 3 (27%)8 (73%); 3 (27%)Vaccine dose 1 to booster (days)318 (204–393)323 (256–393)322 (217–353)Day 30 visit from booster vaccine (days)30 (26–32)29 (28–32)30 (28–36)Day 60 visit from booster vaccine (days)60 (55–73)61 (56–68)60 (56–63)a Median (range). Open table in a new tab Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were measured against spike proteins of ancestral B.1 (D614G mutation) and nine variants, including VOC B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta; AY.4 lineage), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron; BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3 lineages) using a multiplex platform. Antibody titers increased from baseline to day 30 in all three groups, albeit more modestly for the prior-infected group (Figure S1B). By day 60, titers had plateaued in the uninfected group, increased slightly in the post-infected group against B.1 D614G and three variants, yet decreased in the prior-infected group against B.1 D614G and six variants (Figure S1B; Table S2). These temporal differences between groups, evaluated in a mixed-effects model considering time and exposure status, were highly significant for all three groups combined (Figures 1B and S1C) and between prior-infected and both uninfected and post-infected (p < 0.0001 for each of the 10 spike measurements) but not between uninfected and post-infected groups (Table S3 showing all comparisons). At baseline, titers against all 10 spike proteins were higher in the prior-infected than uninfected and post-infected groups, while day 60 titers were lower in the prior-infected than post-infected and for five variants in the uninfected group (Figure S1D; Table S2). Titers were similar between the uninfected and post-infected group at baseline and marginally higher at day 60 in the post-infected group (Figure S1D; Table S2). The combination of high baseline titers with modest increases post-boost in the prior-infected group translated into fold increases between baseline and day 60 that were much lower compared with those of the uninfected and post-infected groups (Figure 1C; Table S2). As expected, the fold increases were modestly higher in the post-infected group compared with the uninfected group (Figure 1C; Table S2). Serum neutralizing antibody activities were measured against B.1 D614G, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, and BA.1 using a pseudovirus-based assay (Gagne et al., 2022Gagne M. Moliva J.I. Foulds K.E. Andrew S.F.

Consistent with the antibody-binding titers, neutralization increased from baseline to day 60 in the uninfected and post-infected groups, whereas in contrast to antibody binding, neutralizing titers did not increase between baseline and day 60 in the prior-infection group (Figure S2A). These temporal differences, evaluated with the mixed-effects model described above, were highly significant for all three groups combined (Figure 1D), as well as between each group (p < 0.0001 for the three group comparisons and for each pseudovirus). Baseline neutralizing titers were higher in the prior-infected group compared with the uninfected and post-infected groups, while day 60 titers were higher in the post-infected compared with the other two groups (Figure S2B). These differences translated into higher fold increases between baseline and day 60 in the post-infected group compared with the two other groups and higher in the uninfected than prior-infected group (Figure 1E), consistent with the antibody-binding data. Overall, the kinetics and magnitude of antibody-binding and neutralizing titers differed between the groups, although most strikingly in the prior-infected group where antibody responses to the booster vaccine were muted. We used spectral flow cytometry to evaluate B cell responses to the booster vaccine with a 21-marker panel that included six tetramers for evaluating responses against the spike protein subunit 1 (S1) of B.1, its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), as well as identifying B cells that bound RBD and NTD of both B.1 and BA.1 (Figures 2A and S3A). Frequencies of B.1 RBD, NTD, as well as dual B.1/BA.1 RBD and NTD-binding B cells increased significantly from baseline to day 60 in the uninfected and post-infected groups, peaking at day 30 in the uninfected group while continuing to increase (RBD) in the post-infected group (Figure S3B). In contrast, frequencies of spike-binding B cells in the prior-infected group did not significantly increase between baseline and day 60 and declined between days 30 and 60 against B.1 RBD and NTD and B.1/BA.1 NTD (Figure S3B). These temporal differences between groups, evaluated with the mixed-effects model described above, were highly significant for all three groups combined (Figure 2B), as well as between group pairs (Table S4 showing all comparisons). As with antibody titers, baseline frequencies of spike-binding B cells were higher in the prior-infected than uninfected and post-infected groups for B.1 RBD and NTD and B.1/BA.1 RBD (Figure S3C). At day 60, spike-binding frequencies were similar between the prior-infected and uninfected group yet were lower for B.1 RBD and B.1/BA.1 RBD in both groups when compared with the post-infected group (Figure S3C). These temporal differences translated into higher fold increases between baseline and day 60 in the post-infected group compared with the two other groups and higher in the uninfected than prior-infected group for both RBD and NTD and dual counterparts (Figure 2C).Figure 2SARS-CoV-2 infection status alters B cell responses to booster vaccinationShow full caption(A) Representative binding of B.1 and BA.1 RBD and NTD tetramers to non-naive B cells at baseline and day 60 post booster vaccination.(B) Frequencies of B.1 and BA.1 RBD and NTD tetramer-binding B cells.(C) Fold-change day 60 over baseline of B.1 and BA.1 RBD and NTD tetramer-binding B cell frequencies.(D) Ratio of dual B.1/BA.1 to single B.1 RBD binding to B cells.Binding frequencies represent percentage of total CD19+ B cells; see also Figure S3A for gating strategy.

See also Figure S3 and Table S4. We then considered whether post-boost BA.1 infection and/or the booster vaccine altered the ratio of dual B.1/BA.1 to single B.1 RBD or NTD binding. For RBD, the ratio of dual B.1/BA.1 to single B.1 binding increased from baseline to day 60 in all three groups; however, the ratio was highest in the post-infected group and lowest in the prior-infected group (Figure 2D). For NTD, the ratios increased from baseline to day 60 in the uninfected and post-infected but not prior-infected group and at day 60, and the ratios at day 60 were similarly higher in the uninfected and post-infected than in the prior-infected group (Figure S3D). Overall, the B cell response to the booster vaccine was poor in magnitude and breadth in the prior-infected group, whereas the response is robust in the uninfected and post-infected groups, with the latter having an additional boost from the breakthrough infection. To gain further insight into B cell VOC responses after booster vaccination and the effect of post-boost BA.1 infection, we performed in vitro culturing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at baseline and day 60 using polyclonal stimulation with TLR7/8 agonist R848 and IL-2, known to favor memory B cell differentiation and antibody secretion (Goel et al., 2021Goel R.R. Painter M.M. Apostolidis S.A. Mathew D. Meng W. Rosenfeld A.M. Lundgreen K.A. Reynaldi A. Khoury D.S. Pattekar A. et al.mRNA vaccines induce durable immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern.Science. 2021; 374: abm0829https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm0829Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We measured culture-derived antibodies with the same multiplex platform used for serum IgG titers, although relative activity levels were typically 2 to 3 logs lower in cultures than in serum and reported per total secreted IgG (Figure 3A). Consistent with the spike-binding B cell kinetics, spike-specific antibodies secreted from cultured PBMCs increased between baseline and day 60 in the uninfected and post-infected but not prior-infected group (Figure S4A; Table S5). These temporal differences, evaluated with the mixed-effects model described above, were highly significant for all three groups combined (Figures 3A and S4B), between prior-infected and both uninfected and post-infected groups (p < 0.0001 for each of the 10 spike measurements), as well as between the uninfected and post-infected group, albeit somewhat less pronounced (Table S6 showing all comparisons). Baseline secreted antibodies were modestly higher in the prior-infected group compared with uninfected and/or post-infected group against the five non-Omicron spike proteins whereas there were no baseline differences against the five Omicron variants tested (Figure S4C; Table S5), the lack of measurable differences possibly due to low baseline Omicron-specific antibodies. However, by day 60, secreted antibody titers were lower in the prior-infected compared with both uninfected and post-infected group, and lower in the uninfected compared with the post-infected group (Figure S4C; Table S5). As with serum antibodies and spike-binding B cells, these temporal differences translated into higher fold increases of secreted antibodies between baseline and day 60 in the post-infected group compared with the two other groups and higher in the uninfected than prior-infected group against all 10 spike proteins (Figure 3B; Table S5). Overall, spike-specific antibodies secreted from memory B cells did not increase in the prior-infected group after the vaccine boost, and while levels compared with both uninfected and post-infected groups were similar or modestly higher at baseline, they were sharply lower by day 60.Figure S3Spike-binding B cells, related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Gating strategy for identifying non-naive B cells; also showing representative binding of B.1 NTD and S1 tetramers.(B) Frequencies of B.1 and BA.1 RBD and NTD tetramer-binding B cells in Figure 2B shown by group.(C) Comparison between the groups at baseline and day 60 of frequencies of B.1 and BA.1 RBD and NTD tetramer-binding B cells in Figure 2B.(D) As in Figure 2D but for NTD.Horizontal lines represent geometrical means and coloring scheme matches groups described in Figure 1A.

The robust secreted antibody response at day 60 in the large uninfected group provided an opportunity to consider whether antibodies derived from memory B cells had greater breadth compared with serum antibodies, as suggested in previous studies (Muecksch et al., 2022Muecksch F.

Accordingly, we compared ratios of B.1 D614G to variant antibody titers between the two sources. For seven of the nine spike variants tested, the fold difference was significantly reduced for the culture-secreted antibodies compared with those in serum while differences were not significant for two variants (Figure 3C), confirming the superior breadth in memory B cell compartment. The fold changes in memory B cell responses to booster vaccination were significantly lower in the prior-infected group compared with the two other groups, whether measured by direct binding (Figure 2) or secreted antibodies (Figure 3). However, at day 60, titers of secreted spike-binding antibodies were significantly lower in the prior-infected compared with the uninfected group (Figure S4C), while frequencies of spike-binding B cells were similar (Figure S3C). This contrast suggested that prior infection may have led to a reduced B cell responsiveness to stimulation after vaccination. We also observed a dichotomous pattern of antibody titers and B cell responses within the prior-infected group (clearly discernable in Figures 1B, 1D, and S1C) that may have been driven by the wide range of intervals between infection and vaccination (59–601 days: Tables 1 and S1). This led us to consider whether the interval between infection and vaccination may have contributed to the dif"

When T cells differentiate or become activated, they undergo substantial alterations in gene expression. Even though RNA expression levels are now well documented throughout different stages of T cells, it is not well understood how mRNA expression translates into the protein landscape. By combining paired RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry data of primary human CD8+ T cells, we report that mRNA expression is a poor proxy for the overall protein output, irrespective of the differentiation or activation status. Yet, gene class stratification revealed a function-specific correlation of mRNA with protein expression. This gene class-specific expression pattern associated with differences in gene characteristics such as sequence conservation and untranslated region (UTR) lengths. In addition, the presence of AU-rich elements in the 3'UTR associated with alterations in mRNA and protein abundance T cell activation dependent, gene class-specific manner. In conclusion, our study highlights the role of gene characteristics as a determinant for gene expression in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W4306410333,"In the mammalian brain TRPC channels, a family of Ca2+-permeable cation channels, are involved in a variety of processes from neuronal growth and synapse formation to transmitter release, synaptic transmission and plasticity. The molecular appearance and operation of native TRPC channels, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we used high-resolution proteomics to show that TRPC channels in the rodent brain are macro-molecular complexes of more than 1 MDa in size that result from the co-assembly of the tetrameric channel core with an ensemble of interacting proteins (interactome). The core(s) of TRPC1-, C4-, and C5-containing channels are mostly heteromers with defined stoichiometries for each subtype, whereas TRPC3, C6, and C7 preferentially form homomers. In addition, TRPC1/C4/C5 channels may co-assemble with the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1, thus guaranteeing both specificity and reliability of channel activation via the phospholipase-Ca2+ pathway. Our results unveil the subunit composition of native TRPC channels and resolve the molecular details underlying their activation."

Herrler T.

SARS-CoV-2 entry is believed to be initiated by the S1 domain within the S protein through binding to ACE2, followed by independent entry pathways: direct fusion between the viral membrane and plasma membrane at the cell surface and endocytosis that relies on endosomal-dependent uptake and final fusion between viral and lysosomal membranes in lysosomes. Both entry pathways require S protein priming, which is mediated by either the lysosomal protease cathepsin for the endocytosis pathway (7Hoffmann M. Kleine-Weber H. Schroeder S. Kruger N. Herrler T.

For the endocytosis pathway, cathepsin L in lysosomes may be the predominant lysosomal protease required for SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming (11Zhao M.M. Yang W.L. Yang F.Y. Zhang L. Huang W.J.

Ther. 2021; 6: 134Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Endocytosis can be classified into several types: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-dependent endocytosis, phagocytosis, lipid raft–mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis (12Mercer J. Helenius A. Virus entry by macropinocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 13Doherty G.J. McMahon H.T. Mechanisms of endocytosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 857-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Various viruses may take advantage of these endocytosis pathways for viral entry in a cell type–dependent manner (14Mercer J. Schelhaas M. Helenius A. Virus entry by endocytosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 803-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Macropinocytosis is the actin-dependent endocytic process responsible for nonspecific uptake of fluid, solutes, membranes, ligands, and smaller particles (including viruses) attached to the plasma membrane (12Mercer J. Helenius A. Virus entry by macropinocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 15Mercer J. Helenius A. Gulping rather than sipping: macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2012; 15: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Macropinocytosis-mediated viral entry requires virus binding, leading to intracellular signaling activation. The activated signaling further induces plasma membrane protrusion, vacuole closure, and vacuole formation. Finally, macropinosomes are formed and trafficked to lysosomes (15Mercer J. Helenius A. Gulping rather than sipping: macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2012; 15: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this process, Rac1-GTPase activation plays an important role in macropinocytosis: Rac1 regulates macropinocytosis by interacting with its specific effectors, the p21-activated kinases (Paks), thus modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which finally trigger membrane ruffling in the cell (15Mercer J. Helenius A. Gulping rather than sipping: macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2012; 15: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Pak1 is a serine/threonine kinase that can be activated by Rac1 or Cdc42. Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) activity is required to achieve a necessary H+ concentration transiently in the vicinity of the membrane to stimulate cytoskeleton remodeling (15Mercer J. Helenius A. Gulping rather than sipping: macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2012; 15: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Many viruses, including HIV-1, herpes simplex virus 1, Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus, vaccinia virus, species B human adenovirus serotype 3, echovirus 1, and group B Coxsackieviruses, have been reported to utilize macropinocytosis to enter host cells (12Mercer J.

Virol. 2009; 83: 4895-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for several coronaviruses, such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV-1, macropinocytosis was found to mainly facilitate CoV infection through enhanced cell-to-cell spreading rather than by promoting virus entry (18Freeman M.C. Peek C.T. Becker M.M. Smith E.C. Denison M.R. Coronaviruses induce entry-independent, continuous macropinocytosis.mBio. 2014; 5e01340-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent studies illustrated that clathrin-mediated endocytosis was involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry (19Bayati A. Kumar R. Francis V. McPherson P.S. SARS-CoV-2 infects cells after viral entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); however, whether SARS-CoV-2 utilizes macropinocytosis to enter host cells has not been fully investigated (20Li X. Zhu W. Fan M. Zhang J. Peng Y. Huang F. et al.Dependence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cholesterol-rich lipid raft and endosomal acidification.Comput. Struct. Biotechnol.

SARS-CoV-2 spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion may be very important for its pathogenesis. In almost 90% of patients who died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), atypical cells with syncytia showing a large cytoplasm containing a variable number of nuclei ranging from two to more than 20 were observed (22Braga L. Ali H. Secco I. Chiavacci E. Neves G. Goldhill D. et al.Drugs that inhibit TMEM16 proteins block SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia.Nature. 2021; 594: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Viral spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion may facilitate viral spread and evasion of inhibition by neutralizing antibodies (23Zeng C. Evans J.P. King T. Zheng Y.M. Oltz E.M. Whelan S.P.J. et al.SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cell-to-cell transmission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2111400119Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Rajah M.M. Bernier A. Buchrieser J.

Potential drugs targeting viral spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion may become an alternative therapy for COVID-19 (22Braga L. Ali H. Secco I. Chiavacci E. Neves G. Goldhill D. et al.Drugs that inhibit TMEM16 proteins block SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia.Nature. 2021; 594: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this study, we systemically evaluated the roles of macropinocytosis in SARS-CoV-2 entry and viral spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus and authentic virus infection models, we found that SARS-CoV-2 could hijack macropinocytosis to facilitate its entry. NHE, Rho GTPase Rac1, and its downstream Pak1 were essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T)–ACE2 cells. Furthermore, using a cell-to-cell fusion model, we also demonstrated that viral spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion was regulated by macropinocytosis. This knowledge is likely to provide insight into understanding the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and may be helpful to develop potential therapeutic agents. To test whether macropinocytosis was involved in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, we used a panel of compounds to treat the cells prior to viral infection, which includes 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), an inhibitor of macropinocytosis that targets NHE to block the macropinocytosis pathway, chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ), a commonly used compound to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), an inhibitor of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts that depletes cholesterol. The cell viability after treatment with these inhibitors was evaluated individually using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo, catalog number CK04; Fig. 1, A and B). After treatment, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. Viral copies in cell lysates were quantified by quantitative RT‒PCR (qRT–PCR). The results indicated that EIPA, MβCD, and CPZ significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 production compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control (Fig. 1A). For EIPA and CPZ, the inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner, which indicated that both macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis were involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. However, all doses of MβCD we tested showed similar inhibition levels. We speculated that a small amount of MβCD may effectively deplete cholesterol in lipid rafts. Since TMPRSS2 can mediate the direct fusion of viral and plasma membranes in several cell lines (7Hoffmann M. Kleine-Weber H. Schroeder S. Kruger N. Herrler T.

Hydroxychloroquine-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry is attenuated by TMPRSS2.PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17e1009212Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we next tested whether the aforementioned tested pathways were involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Caco-2 cells have been demonstrated to express high levels of endogenous TMPRSS2 and have been widely used as a SARS-CoV-2 infection model (25Meng B. Abdullahi A. Ferreira I. Goonawardane N. Saito A. Kimura I. et al.Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity.Nature. 2022; 603: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 26Pommerenke C. Rand U. Uphoff C.C. Nagel S. Zaborski M.

We found that all these inhibitors could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1B). However, the inhibitory activity was less potent than that in Vero E6 cells, suggesting that TMPRSS2-mediated direct fusion of the viral and plasma membranes and endocytosis-mediated entry may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 entry into Caco-2 cells. Taken together, these results indicated that macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts were all involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. To further investigate the role of macropinocytosis in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we synthesized the codon-optimized spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 and successfully produced a pseudotyped virus with a firefly luciferase reporter based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)–pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 (27Yuan S. Yin X. Meng X. Chan J.F. Ye Z.W. Riva L. et al.Clofazimine broadly inhibits coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2.Nature. 2021; 593: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ebolavirus (EBOV) has been reported to enter cells through macropinocytosis in a glycoprotein (GP)-dependent manner (28Nanbo A. Imai M. Watanabe S. Noda T. Takahashi K. Neumann G. et al.Ebolavirus is internalized into host cells via macropinocytosis in a viral glycoprotein-dependent manner.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6e1001121Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and VSV enters cells in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (29Matlin K.S. Reggio H. Helenius A. Simons K. Pathway of vesicular stomatitis virus entry leading to infection.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 609-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we used EBOV-GP and VSV-G envelope pseudotyped viruses as positive and negative controls, respectively. Next, we evaluated whether EIPA influenced SARS-CoV-2 entry in Vero E6 cells, and CPZ and MβCD were used as controls. The results showed that EIPA significantly decreased EBOV-GP and SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudovirus entry (Fig. 2A), although the inhibition of VSV-G pseudovirus entry was approximately 25 to 30%. As expected, CPZ significantly inhibited VSV-G and SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudovirus entry, and the decrease in EBOV-GP pseudovirus entry was only approximately 10% (Fig. 2A). MβCD also potently decreased EBOV-GP and SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudovirus entry (Fig. 2A). We further confirmed these observations in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2E). More importantly, these inhibitors worked in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B–D and F–H). Collectively, these results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 entry relied on macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Next, we tested whether TMPRSS2 could restore the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses inhibited by EIPA. EBOV-GP and VSV-G pseudoviruses were used as controls, and HEK293T–ACE2 cells were used as the infection model. TMPRSS2 expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). We found that the inhibitory effect of EIPA on pseudovirus entry mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was significantly restored by supplementation with TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3). As expected, TMPRSS2 had no effect on the entry of EBOV-GP and VSV-G pseudoviruses. Macropinocytosis requires coordinated activation of multiple signaling pathways for initiation (12Mercer J.

Signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is essential for inducing macropinocytosis in several systems (18Freeman M.C. Peek C.T. Becker M.M. Smith E.C. Denison M.R.

In addition, LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor that blocks macropinosome closure, was included for testing (32Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. A role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the completion of macropinocytosis and phagocytosis by macrophages.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). We also evaluated a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, for its effect on the entry of SARS-CoV-2. We first tested whether these inhibitors could effectively inhibit macropinocytosis. We used dextran MW 10,000 as a macropinocytosis marker. When macropinocytosis occurs, dextran is taken up by cells. We found that when cells were treated with EIPA, gefitinib, and LY294002, the uptake of dextran was effectively inhibited; conversely, genistein had less of an effect on the uptake of dextran (Fig. 4A). We next tested whether genistein, gefitinib, and LY294002 could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. We found that gefitinib and LY294002 substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells, whereas genistein had no effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that genistein may not be an ideal tyrosine kinase inhibitor for studying macropinocytosis, as has been demonstrated in vaccinia and Nipah viruses (15Mercer J. Helenius A. Gulping rather than sipping: macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2012; 15: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Schmidt F.I. Bleck C.K. Helenius A.

Ainouze M. Kweder H. Buckland R. Nipah virus entry can occur by macropinocytosis.Virology. 2009; 395: 298-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We next evaluated whether these inhibitors played a role in SARS-CoV-2 entry. We found that gefitinib and LY294002 substantially reduced EBOV-GP and SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudovirus entry but not VSV-G pseudovirus entry in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 4D). We observed a similar phenomenon in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4E). Since actin polymerization is a key step for macropinocytosis and cytochalasin B (Cyto-B) inhibits actin polymerization, which is required for macropinocytosis (12Mercer J. Helenius A. Virus entry by macropinocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 35Peterson J.R. Mitchison T.J.

Virol. 2011; 85: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we further investigated whether actin polymerization could affect SARS-CoV-2 entry. We found that Cyto-B could significantly inhibit EBOV-GP and SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudovirus entry in both Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4, F and G). Interestingly, VSV-G pseudovirus entry was also inhibited by Cyto-B (Fig. 4, F and G), indicating that actin polymerization is essential for virus infection. The initiation of macropinocytosis requires the activation of a signaling cascade mediated by small GTPases and kinases. Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1 are critical for MHV-induced macropinocytosis (18Freeman M.C. Peek C.T. Becker M.M. Smith E.C. Denison M.R. Coronaviruses induce entry-independent, continuous macropinocytosis.mBio. 2014; 5e01340-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, we selected Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1 to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 entry was associated with the classical macropinocytosis signaling pathway. First, we evaluated whether endogenous Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1 could influence SARS-CoV-2 entry. We knocked down the expression of Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1 by siRNA, and RhoA was used as a control. The results demonstrated that RNAi significantly decreased the expression of the indicated proteins, as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). The depletion of Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1 significantly decreased the uptake of dextran, indicating that micropinocytosis was successfully inhibited by RNAi (Fig. 5B). Depletion of Rac1 and Pak1 significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 entry, whereas a scrambled siRNA, along with a siRNA targeting RhoA or Cdc42, did not affect virus entry (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 induced macropinocytosis signals through Rac1 and Pak1 rather than through Cdc42, which is distinct from other coronaviruses, including MHV (18Freeman M.C. Peek C.T. Becker M.M. Smith E.C. Denison M.R. Coronaviruses induce entry-independent, continuous macropinocytosis.mBio. 2014; 5e01340-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We further confirmed this by the dominant-negative phenotype of the corresponding Rho GTPases. Vero E6 cells were transfected with Cdc42-T17N, Rac1-T17N, Pak1-R299, or RhoA-T19N (as a control), and the uptake of dextran was significantly decreased after Cdc42-T17N, Rac1-T17N, and Pak1-R299 transfection (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 entry into Vero E6 cells was profoundly dependent on Rac1, Pak1, and CDC42 (Fig. 5E); however, in HEK293T–ACE2 cells, pseudovirus entry depended on Rac1 and Pak1 rather than on CDC42 (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, by using a pseudovirus system harboring the enhanced GFP (EGFP) reporter, we confirmed that Cdc42-T17N-, Rac1-T17N-, and Pak1-R299-transfected cells were resistant to EBOV-GP and SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudovirus entry but not VSV-G pseudovirus entry (Fig. 5G). Taken together, the results indicated that the small GTPase Rac1 and Pak1 kinases were involved in the SARS-CoV-2 entry process. To investigate whether macropinocytosis was associated with viral spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion, HEK293T–ACE2 cells were mock cotransfected or cotransfected with a plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and a red fluorescent protein reporter plasmid as previously reported (27Yuan S. Yin X. Meng X. Chan J.F. Ye Z.W. Riva L. et al.Clofazimine broadly inhibits coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2.Nature. 2021; 593: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), followed by treatment with EIPA, CPZ, and MβCD at 6 h post-transfection (hpt). We observed that these inhibitors significantly decreased the number of nuclei in a syncytium and reduced syncytium size (Fig. 6, A–D). We further confirmed this phenomenon in Vero E6 cells, as shown in Figure 6, E–H. These data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 utilized macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts to initiate cell-to-cell fusion. For macropinocytosis, we next tested whether spike-induced cell-to-cell fusion required EGFR, PI3K, or other general tyrosine kinases. We found that gefitinib substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike–mediated syncytium size in HEK293T–ACE2 and Vero E6 cells (Fig. 7, A and B). However, LY294002 failed to block SARS-CoV-2 spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion and syncytium formation in HEK293T–ACE2 cells (Fig. 7, A and C) and possessed an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 entry. Syncytium formation was slightly blocked in Vero cells treated with LY294002 at a high concentration (Fig. 7, E and G). These results indicated that the PI3K pathway might not be important for SARS-CoV-2 spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion and underscored that SARS-CoV-2 entry and viral spike–mediated cell-to-cell fusion exhibited a distinct macropinocytosis dependency. Interestingly, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, exhibited a different effect on the cell-to-cell fusion of SARS-CoV-2 in different cell lines. In particular, we found that genistein showed lower inhibitory activity on cell-to-cell fusion in HEK293T–ACE2 cells than in Vero cells, indicating that the inhibitory activity of genistein is cell type dependent (Fig. 7, D and H). However, the crit"
https://openalex.org/W4296378996,"Filopodia are long finger-like actin-based structures that project out from the plasma membrane as cells navigate and explore their extracellular environment. The initiation of filopodia formation requires release of tension at the plasma membrane followed by the coordinated assembly of long unbranched actin filaments. Filopodia growth is maintained by a tip complex that promotes actin polymerization and protects the growing barbed ends of the actin fibers from capping proteins. Filopodia growth also depends on additional F-actin bundling proteins to stiffen the actin filaments as well as extension of the membrane sheath projecting from the cell periphery. These activities can be provided by a number of actin-binding and membrane-binding proteins including formins such as formin-like 2 (FMNL2) and FMNL3, and Inverse-Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (I-BAR) proteins such as IRTKS and IRSp53, but the specific requirement for these proteins in filopodia assembly is not clear. We report here that IRTKS and IRSp53 are FMNL2-binding proteins. Coexpression of FMNL2 with either I-BAR protein promotes cooperative filopodia assembly. We find IRTKS, but not IRSp53, is required for FMNL2-induced filopodia assembly, and FMNL2 and IRTKS are mutually dependent cofactors in this process. Our results suggest that the primary function for FMNL2 during filopodia assembly is binding to the plasma membrane and that regulation of actin dynamics by its formin homology 2 domain is secondary. From these results, we conclude that FMNL2 initiates filopodia assembly via an unexpected novel mechanism, by bending the plasma membrane to recruit IRTKS and thereby nucleate filopodia assembly."

Here, we present crystal structures of the zinc finger cluster 4 (ZFC4) domain of SALL4 (SALL4ZFC4) bound with different dsDNAs containing a conserved AT-rich motif. In the structures, two zinc fingers of SALL4ZFC4 recognize an AATA tetranucleotide. We also solved the DNA-bound structures of SALL3ZFC4 and SALL4ZFC1. These structures illuminate a common preference for the AATA tetranucleotide shared by ZFC4 of SALL1, SALL3, and SALL4. Furthermore, our cell biology experiments demonstrate that the DNA-binding activity is essential for SALL4 function as DNA-binding defective mutants of mouse Sall4 failed to repress aberrant gene expression in Sall4-/- mESCs. Thus, these analyses provide new insights into the mechanisms of action underlying SALL family proteins in controlling cell fate via preferential targeting to AT-rich sites within genomic DNA during cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4306734777,"Dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor into distant body tissues and organs is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. While most clinical strategies aim to reduce or impede the growth of the primary tumor, no treatment to eradicate metastatic cancer exists at present. Metastasis is mediated by feet-like cytoskeletal structures called invadopodia which allow cells to penetrate through the basement membrane and intravasate into blood vessels during their spread to distant tissues and organs. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 is highly expressed in breast cancer, where it mediates invadopodia formation and function via interaction with the actin-nucleation-promoting factor cortactin. Here, we designed a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor that contains the second proline-rich region (PRR2) sequence of Pyk2, which binds to the SH3 domain of cortactin and inhibits the interaction between Pyk2 and cortactin in invadopodia. The Pyk2-PRR2 peptide blocks spontaneous lung metastasis in immune-competent mice by inhibiting cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and actin polymerization-mediated maturation and activation of invadopodia, leading to reduced MMP-dependent tumor cell invasiveness. The native structure of the Pyk2-PRR2:cortactin-SH3 complex was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), revealing an extended class II interaction surface spanning the canonical binding groove and a second hydrophobic surface which significantly contributes to ligand affinity. Using structure-guided design, we created a mutant peptide lacking critical residues involved in binding that failed to inhibit invadopodia maturation and function and consequent metastatic dissemination in mice. Our findings shed light on the specific molecular interactions between Pyk2 and cortactin and may lead to the development of novel strategies for preventing dissemination of primary breast tumors predicted at the time of diagnosis to be highly metastatic, and of secondary tumors that have already spread to other parts of the body."

The results revealed intratumoral and intertumoral epithelium heterogeneity and tremendously differences in tumor and normal epithelium. The infiltration of myofibroblasts, one subtype of fibroblasts, might play important roles in the progression of ESCC. We also found that some differentially expressed genes and markers in epithelium and fibroblast subtypes showed prognostic values for ESCC. Diverse cell subtypes of T cells and myeloid cells were identified, including tumor-enriched HAVCR2+ CD4+ T cells with significantly exhausted signature. The epithelium and myeloid cells had more frequent cell–cell communication compared with epithelium and T cells.

https://openalex.org/W4306816430,"Reconstructing the evolution, diversity, and paleobiogeography of North America’s Late Cretaceous dinosaur assemblages require spatiotemporally contiguous data; however, there remains a spatial and temporal disparity in dinosaur data on the continent. The rarity of vertebrate-bearing sedimentary deposits representing Turonian–Santonian ecosystems, and the relatively sparse record of dinosaurs from the eastern portion of the continent, present persistent challenges for studies of North American dinosaur evolution. Here we describe an assemblage of ornithomimosaurian materials from the Santonian Eutaw Formation of Mississippi. Morphological data coupled with osteohistological growth markers suggest the presence of two taxa of different body sizes, including one of the largest ornithomimosaurians known worldwide. The regression predicts a femoral circumference and a body mass of the Eutaw individuals similar to or greater than that of large-bodied ornithomimosaurs, Beishanlong grandis , and Gallimimus bullatus . The paleoosteohistology of MMNS VP-6332 demonstrates that the individual was at least ten years of age (similar to B . grandis [~375 kg, 13–14 years old at death]). Additional pedal elements share some intriguing features with ornithomimosaurs, yet suggest a larger-body size closer to Deinocheirus mirificus . The presence of a large-bodied ornithomimosaur in this region during this time is consistent with the relatively recent discoveries of early-diverging, large-bodied ornithomimosaurs from mid-Cretaceous strata of Laurasia ( Arkansaurus fridayi and B . grandis ). The smaller Eutaw taxon is represented by a tibia preserving seven growth cycles, with osteohistological indicators of decreasing growth, yet belongs to an individual approaching somatic maturity, suggesting the co-existence of medium- and large-bodied ornithomimosaur taxa during the Late Cretaceous Santonian of North America. The Eutaw ornithomimosaur materials provide key information on the diversity and distribution of North American ornithomimosaurs and Appalachian dinosaurs and fit with broader evidence of multiple cohabiting species of ornithomimosaurian dinosaurs in Late Cretaceous ecosystems of Laurasia."

Whereas it is essential for preventing dental caries, its current affordability around the globe remains unclear. This study aimed to analyse the affordability of FT in as many as possible countries worldwide, to capture the extent of variations in FT affordability between high-, middle- and low-income countries. Methods A standardized protocol was developed to collect country-specific information about the characteristics of the cheapest available FT at a regular point of purchase. 82 members of the WHO Global Oral Health Network of Chief Dental Officers (CDOs), directors of WHO Collaborative Centres and other oral health experts collected data using mobile phone technology. In line with established methodologies to assess affordability, the Fluoride Toothpaste Affordability Ratio (FTAR) was calculated as the expenditure associated with the recommended annual consumption of FT relative to the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker (FTAR &gt;1 = unaffordable spending on fluoride toothpaste). Results There are significant differences in the affordability of FT across 78 countries. FT was strongly affordable in high-income countries, relatively affordable in upper middle-income countries, and strongly unaffordable in lower middle-income and low-income countries. The affordability of FT across WHO Regions was dependent upon the economic mix of WHO Regions’ member states. Conclusion FT is still unaffordable for many people, particularly in low-income settings. Strategies to improve the universal affordability of FT should be part of health policy decisions in order to contribute to reducing dental caries as a global public health problem."

However, the exact mechanism of podocyte injury in DN is incompletely understood. This study was conducted using db/db mice and immortalized mouse podocytes. High-throughput sequencing was used to identify the differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs in kidney of db/db mice. The lentiviral shRNA directed against long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) or microRNA-26a-5p (miR-26a-5p) agomir was used to treat db/db mice to regulate the SNHG5/miR-26a-5p pathway. Here, we found that the expression of transient receptor potential canonical type 6 (TRPC6) was significantly increased in injured podocytes under the condition of DN, which was associated with markedly decreased miR-26a-5p. We determined that miR-26a-5p overexpression ameliorated podocyte injury in DN via binding to 3′-UTR of Trpc6, as evidenced by the markedly reduced activity of luciferase reporters by miR-26a-5p mimic. Then, the upregulated SNHG5 in podocytes and kidney in DN was identified, and it was proved to sponge to miR-26a-5p directly using luciferase activity, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assay.

Lim L.L. Wareham N.J. Shaw J.E. Orchard T.J. Zhang P. et al.The Lancet Commission on Diabetes: using data to transform diabetes care and patient lives.Lancet. 2021; 396: 2019-2082Google Scholar). Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is among the most common and severe microvascular complications of DM and the primary cause of end-stage renal disease. Glomerular hypertrophy, podocyte injury, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and extracellular matrix deposition are characteristic pathological features of DN (2Umanath K. Lewis J.B. Update on diabetic nephropathy: core curriculum 2018.Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2018; 71: 884-895Google Scholar), and podocyte injury is thought to be a central link in the occurrence of DN. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of podocyte injury in DN are incompletely understood. Transient receptor potential canonical type 6 (TRPC6) is a nonselective receptor-operated cation channel that regulates reactive fibrosis and growth signaling (3Dietrich A. Gudermann T. TRPC6: physiological function and pathophysiological relevance.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 222: 157-188Google Scholar). Our previous studies found that TRPC6 is significantly upregulated in injured podocytes in the context of DN and plays a significant role in podocyte injury. Mechanistically, upregulated TRPC6 promotes podocyte injury by activating the NFAT pathway (4Ma R. Xu Y. Zhou H. Zhang D. Yao D. Song L. et al.Participation of the AngII/TRPC6/NFAT axis in the pathogenesis of podocyte injury in rats with type 2 diabetes.Mol. Med. Rep. 2019; 19: 2421-2430Google Scholar, 5Ma R. Liu L. Jiang W. Yu Y. Song H. FK506 ameliorates podocyte injury in type 2 diabetic nephropathy by down-regulating TRPC6 and NFAT expression.Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 2015; 8: 14063-14074Google Scholar). Targeting TRPC6 using pharmacological or genetic interventions could ameliorate podocyte injury and delay the progression of kidney diseases (6Ma R. Wang Y. Xu Y. Wang R. Wang X. Yu N. et al.Tacrolimus protects podocytes from apoptosis via downregulation of TRPC6 in diabetic nephropathy.J. Diabetes Res. 2021; 2021: 8832114Google Scholar, 7Spires D. Ilatovskaya D.V. Levchenko V. North P.E. Geurts A.M. Palygin O. et al.Protective role of Trpc6 knockout in the progression of diabetic kidney disease.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2018; 315: F1091-F1097Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of dysregulated expression of TRPC6 in DN remain obscure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play essential regulatory roles in almost all biological processes by modulating gene expression (8Treiber T. Treiber N. Meister G. Regulation of microRNA biogenesis and its crosstalk with other cellular pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 5-20Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that miRNAs play crucial roles in the occurrence and development of kidney diseases (9Guo C. Dong G. Liang X. Dong Z. Epigenetic regulation in AKI and kidney repair: mechanisms and therapeutic implications.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2019; 15: 220-239Google Scholar). In the context of DN, associations between podocyte injury and miRNA expression levels in the blood, urine, and kidney tissue have been reported (10Ishii H. Kaneko S. Yanai K. Aomatsu A. Hirai K. Ookawara S. et al.MicroRNAs in podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy.Front. Genet. 2020; 11: 993Google Scholar). Moreover, modulation of the expression of several miRNAs has been shown to protect against podocyte injury in DN (10Ishii H. Kaneko S. Yanai K. Aomatsu A. Hirai K. Ookawara S. et al.MicroRNAs in podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy.Front. Genet. 2020; 11: 993Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether specific miRNAs regulate TRPC6 in DN. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), commonly defined as RNA molecules more than 200 nucleotides in length, are significant players at almost every level of gene function and regulation (11Statello L. Guo C.J. Chen L.L. Huarte M. Gene regulation by long non-coding RNAs and its biological functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2021; 22: 96-118Google Scholar). Several studies reported that lncRNAs combine with miRNAs such that the targeted mRNA can escape negative regulation by a mechanism known as competing endogenous RNA (12Salmena L. Poliseno L. Tay Y. Kats L. Pandolfi P.P. A ceRNA hypothesis: the Rosetta stone of a hidden RNA language.Cell. 2011; 146: 353-358Google Scholar), and lncRNA appears to participate in diabetes and DN (13Guo J. Liu Z. Gong R. Long noncoding RNA: an emerging player in diabetes and diabetic kidney disease.Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2019; 133: 1321-1339Google Scholar). For instance, Deng et al. (14Deng Q. Wen R. Liu S. Chen X. Song S. Li X. et al.Increased long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 contributes to podocyte injury induced by high glucose through regulation of mitochondrial fission.Cell Death Dis. 2020; 11: 814Google Scholar) found that increased lncRNA Meg3 expression contributed to podocyte injury induced by high glucose, suggesting that specific lncRNA plays a critical role in the progression of DN. However, regulation of podocyte injury by specific lncRNAs via the TRPC6 pathway has not been reported. The baseline indicators of db/db mice are shown in Table 1. Histologic analysis revealed marked glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial expansion in db/db mice compared with control db/m mice (Fig. 1A). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) revealed that the foot processes were fused, and basement membranes were thickened in db/db mice (Fig. 1B). The expression of nephrin and podocin was decreased significantly (Fig. 1C), suggesting podocyte injury. Then, we found that Trpc6 mRNA and protein levels were increased significantly in the kidneys of db/db mice (Fig. 1, D and E). Immunostaining of TRPC6 indicated that the TRPC6 expression significantly increased in injured podocytes (Fig. 1F). Podocyte injury and upregulated TRPC6 expression were also observed in high glucose (HG)-treated podocytes, detected by qPCR (Fig. 1G) and Western blot (Fig. 1H), respectively. These findings suggest that TRPC6 expression increases significantly in injured podocytes in DN.Table 1Baseline indicators of mice (x¯ ± s)Indicatorsdb/m (n = 6)db/db (n = 6)t valuep valueKW/BW (mg/g)12.51 ± 2.619.31 ± 1.062.7780.020FBG (mmol/L)5.32 ± 0.4117.54 ± 2.2912.8360.000ACR (mg/mg)0.24 ± 0.121.09 ± 0.414.8860.001TG (mmol/L)1.50 ± 0.293.25 ± 0.2211.6960.000TC (mmol/L)2.91 ± 0.445.41 ± 0.866.3620.000LDL-C (mmol/L)0.77 ± 0.901.23 ± 0.156.5900.000Scr (μmol/L)13.06 ± 0.8013.40 ± 1.510.4890.636BUN (mmol/L)8.40 ± 1.038.16 ± 0.910.4350.673Abbreviations: ACR, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio; BUN, serum urea nitrogen; FBG, fasting blood glucose; KW/BW, kidney weight/body weight; LDL-C, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol; Scr, serum creatinine; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglycerides.

Given the crucial role of miRNAs in the progression of kidney diseases, we hypothesized that specific miRNAs might mediate dysregulated TRPC6 expression. We predicted the putative miRNAs containing the binding sites of Trpc6 that contribute to the podocyte injury using five online databases: TargetScan, miRDB, miRanda, DIANA-TarBase, and PicTar. Overlap analysis revealed that miR-26a-5p contains a highly conserved consequence targeting the Trpc6 3′-UTR (Fig. 2A). We also observed that levels of miR-26a-5p in kidney tissue were markedly decreased (Fig. 2B), negatively correlated with Trpc6 mRNA levels (Fig. 2C). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the decreased miR-26a-5p was located in the podocytes of glomeruli (Fig. 2D). We then measured expression levels of miR-26a-5p in podocytes exposed to HG. As expected, miR-26a-5p levels decreased significantly (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the in vivo finding, there is a negative correlation between miR-26a-5p and Trpc6 mRNA levels in HG-treated podocytes (Fig. 2F). The luciferase reporter assay showed that the activity of luciferase reporters was markedly reduced by miR-26a-5p mimic compared with mimic-NC. Furthermore, the activity of Trpc6 3′-UTR-mut luciferase reporter was not affected by the miR-26a-5p mimic, suggesting that miR-26a-5p directly interacts with 3′-UTR of Trpc6 mRNA. (Fig. 2G). These findings suggest that miR-26a-5p is involved in podocyte injury by targeting Trpc6 mRNA directly. To determine the role of miR-26a-5p in podocyte injury and progression of DN in vivo, miR-26a-5p agomir or negative control was administered via the tail vein of db/db mice. We first confirmed transfection efficiency (Fig. 3A). The level of albuminuria was markedly decreased in miR-26a-5p agomir-treated mice (Fig. 3B). Histologic analysis revealed that glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial expansion were significantly blunted in miR-26a-5p agomir-treated mice compared with agomir NC-treated mice (Fig. 3C). TEM revealed that polysaccharide aggregation and foot process fusion were partially relieved in miR-26a-5p agomir-transfected db/db mice (Fig. 3D). Podocyte injury was markedly alleviated, as demonstrated by nephrin and podocin expression levels (Fig. 3E). TRPC6 expression was decreased in this group (Fig. 3, F and G). In an in vitro experiment, podocytes were transfected with miR-26a-5p mimic to overexpress miR-26a-5p before intervention with HG (Fig. 3H). As expected, the expression of TRPC6 was markedly decreased in podocytes with miR-26a-5p mimic treatment, combined with the increased nephrin and podocin expression (Fig. 3I). These findings suggest that miR-26a-5p overexpression mitigated podocyte injury by inhibiting TRPC6. To explore the potential mechanism of the dysregulated miR-26a-5p/TRPC6 pathway, high-throughput sequencing for lncRNAs of the kidney tissue of db/db mice was used (Fig. 4, A and B). Among the top lncRNAs, the specific lncRNAs for miR-26a-5p interaction were predicted by the StarBase database. A significant increase in lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) was found, and it was selected for further study. To confirm the lncRNA profile, we measured expression levels of SNHG5 via FISH and qPCR. FISH revealed that SNHG5 expression was significantly increased, primarily in podocyte cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). We found that SNHG5 expression was upregulated in the kidney of db/db mice using qPCR (Fig. 4D), positively correlated with the albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) (Fig. 4E). Dramatically increased SNHG5 expression was observed in HG-treated podocytes compared with normal glucose (NG)-treated and high mannitol (HM)-treated podocytes (Fig. 4F). These findings suggest that increased SNHG5 expression may be associated with podocyte injury in DN. Next, we sought to understand how SNHG5 promotes podocytes injury. Based on bioinformatics analysis, miR-26a-5p was predicted to contain appropriate binding sites for SNHG5 (Fig. 5A), a critical negative regulator of the TRPC6 signaling pathway. We performed, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down to test whether there is a direct interaction between SNHG5 and miR-26a-5p in podocytes. Luciferase activity of SNHG5-wt reporter was significantly decreased with miR-26a-5p overexpression, whereas no significant change was observed in SNHG5-mut reporter expression (Fig. 5B). In RIP assays, SNHG5 levels were enriched in abundance by Ago2 antibody compared with control IgG (Fig. 5C). RNA pull-down analysis displayed a substantial enrichment of SNHG5 by miR-26a-5p compared with the control group (Fig. 5D). We found that miR-26a-5p levels were significantly increased in podocytes with SNHG5 knockdown (Fig. 5E), combined with decreased TRPC6 expression (Fig. 5F). Podocyte injury was markedly abrogated in this group (Fig. 5G). These findings suggest that SNHG5 promotes podocyte injury by targeting miR-26a-5p in DN. To confirm the functional effects of SNHG5 in vivo, we suppressed SNHG5 function in podocytes with the SNHG5 shRNA by tail vein injection (n = 6 for each group). As expected, less albuminuria was found in db/db mice with SNHG5 knockdown (Fig. 6A). Meanwhile, histologic analysis revealed that glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial expansion were significantly attenuated in SNHG5 knockdown mice (Fig. 6B). TEM analysis revealed that foot process fusion and basement membrane thickening were markedly alleviated (Fig. 6C). Expression levels of nephrin and podocin were significantly increased (Fig. 6D). Levels of miR-26a-5p in db/db mice with SNHG5 knockdown were also increased (Fig. 6E) combined with decreased TRPC6 expression in podocytes (Fig. 6, F and G). These findings suggest that SNHG5 knockdown protects podocytes by modulating the miR-26a-5p/TRPC6 axis in DN. DN is a therapeutic challenge in clinical practice, partly because of its unclear pathogenesis. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that podocyte dysfunction is central to the underlying pathophysiology of DN (15Torban E. Braun F. Wanner N. Takano T. Goodyer P.R. Lennon R. et al.From podocyte biology to novel cures for glomerular disease.Kidney Int. 2019; 96: 850-861Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism of podocyte dysfunction in DN remains poorly understood. In the present study, we found that upregulated TRPC6 in injured podocytes plays an essential role in the occurrence of DN. Meanwhile, we determined miR-26a-5p as the regulator of TRPC6 in injured podocytes. Furthermore, the lncRNA SNHG5, which sponges miR-26a-5p, regulates the TRPC6 pathway. As a terminally differentiated cell type, podocytes participate in the formation of a filtration barrier, which is critical in maintaining the physiological function of the kidney. Several lines of evidence suggest that membrane structural and signal transduction proteins in podocytes help maintain homeostasis. Among them, TRPC6, which forms a signal transduction complex with nephrin and podocin on podocytes (16Reiser J. Polu K.R. Möller C.C. Kenlan P. Altintas M.M. Wei C. et al.TRPC6 is a glomerular slit diaphragm-associated channel required for normal renal function.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 739-744Google Scholar), is critical to podocyte injury susceptibility in kidney diseases (17Pablo J.L. Greka A. Charting a TRP to novel therapeutic destinations for kidney diseases.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2019; 40: 911-918Google Scholar). Studies showed that the TRPC6 channel might be a promising molecular target for developing nephroprotective agents. In the present study, we found that TRPC6 expression increased significantly in the kidney of db/db mice and HG-treated podocytes, consistent with a previous study showing that TRPC6 is upregulated in podocytes of several DM models (18Wang L. Chang J.H. Buckley A.F. Spurney R.F. Knockout of TRPC6 promotes insulin resistance and exacerbates glomerular injury in Akita mice.Kidney Int. 2019; 95: 321-332Google Scholar, 19Ilatovskaya D.V. Blass G. Palygin O. Levchenko V. Pavlov T.S. Grzybowski M.N. et al.A NOX4/TRPC6 pathway in podocyte calcium regulation and renal damage in diabetic kidney disease.J. Am. Soc.

Med. 2021; 218e20192373Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how TRPC6 mediates podocyte injury. The activation of the ion channel induces the influx of Ca2+, which causes cytoskeleton rearrangement and changes the activity of downstream molecules, including NFAT (4Ma R. Xu Y. Zhou H. Zhang D. Yao D. Song L. et al.Participation of the AngII/TRPC6/NFAT axis in the pathogenesis of podocyte injury in rats with type 2 diabetes.Mol. Med. Rep. 2019; 19: 2421-2430Google Scholar, 20Hu S. Han R. Chen L. Qin W. Xu X. Shi J. et al.Upregulated LRRC55 promotes BK channel activation and aggravates cell injury in podocytes.J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218e20192373Google Scholar, 21Polat O.K. Uno M. Maruyama T. Tran H.N. Imamura K. Wong C.F. et al.Contribution of coiled-coil assembly to Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent inactivation of TRPC6 channel and its impacts on FSGS-associated phenotypes.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2019; 30: 1587-1603Google Scholar). Other studies demonstrated that TRPC6 regulates the motility and detachment of podocytes by physical interaction with calpain, rather than depending on Ca2+ conductance (22Verheijden K. Sonneveld R. Bakker-van Bebber M. Wetzels J. van der Vlag J. Nijenhuis T. et al.The calcium-dependent protease calpain-1 links TRPC6 activity to podocyte injury.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2018; 29: 2099-2109Google Scholar, 23Farmer L.K. Rollason R. Whitcomb D.J. Ni L. Goodliff A. Lay A.C. et al.TRPC6 binds to and activates calpain, independent of its channel activity, and regulates podocyte cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and motility.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2019; 30: 1910-1924Google Scholar). This evidence enriches the understanding of how TRPC6 links to podocyte injury. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of dysregulated TRPC6 in podocytes remains largely unclear. Studies found that miRNAs, a class of small endogenous noncoding RNAs, are potent regulators of podocyte injury in DN development (24Trionfini P. Benigni A. MicroRNAs as master regulators of glomerular function in health and disease.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2017; 28: 1686-1696Google Scholar). For example, low levels of miR-25 were detected in peripheral blood from DM patients and in kidneys of animals with type 1 and 2 DM (25Liu Y. Li H. Liu J. Han P. Li X. Bai H. et al.Variations in MicroRNA-25 expression influence the severity of diabetic kidney disease.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2017; 28: 3627-3638Google Scholar), while miR-21 was upregulated in kidneys of streptozotocin-induced DM mice (26Lai J.Y. Luo J. Connor C. Jing X. Nair V. Ju W. et al.MicroRNA-21 in glomerular injury.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2015; 26: 805-816Google Scholar), both of which play essential roles in aggravating podocytes injury. We speculated that abnormal TRPC6 expression was regulated by specific miRNA in DN for these reasons. In the present study, we found that miR-26a-5p is a critical regulator of TRPC6 expression. The concept that miR-26a-5p is necessary for cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis has gained acceptance based on studies of several pathophysiological conditions (27Li C. Li Y. Lu Y. Niu Z. Zhao H. Peng Y. et al.miR-26 family and its target genes in tumorigenesis and development.Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2021; 157103124Google Scholar). Consistent with a recent study that transferred miR-26a-5p improves viability and suppresses the apoptosis of podocytes (28Duan Y. Luo Q. Wang Y. Ma Y. Chen F. Zhu X. et al.Adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles containing microRNA-26a-5p target TLR4 and protect against diabetic nephropathy.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 12868-12884Google Scholar), we found that overexpression of miR-26a-5p protected podocytes from structural disruption by alleviating the abnormal expression of TRPC6, characterized by the amelioration of foot process effacement and recovery of podocyte structural markers (nephrin and podocin). These findings suggest that miR-26a-5p is a critical regulator of podocyte injury by targeting TRPC6. Nevertheless, the precise regulatory pathways for these effects have not been described in the setting of DN. It is known that lncRNA participates in various pathophysiologic processes and functions. We hypothesized that specific lncRNAs precisely regulated the dysregulated miR-26a-5p/TRPC6 pathway. We performed high-throughput sequencing to identify these specific lncRNAs. Combined with in silico analysis, we identified an aberrantly overexpressed lncRNA SNHG5 that contains binding sites for miR-26a-5p. As expected, SNHG5 expression was markedly increased in podocytes under DN condition. Containing 524 base pairs, SNHG5 was first discovered in human B lymphoma cells by Tanaka (29Tanaka R. Satoh H. Moriyama M. Satoh K. Morishita Y. Yoshida S. et al.Intronic U50 small-nucleolar-RNA (snoRNA) host gene of no protein-coding potential is mapped at the chromosome breakpoint t(3;6)(q27;q15) of human B-cell lymphoma.Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 277-287Google Scholar). SNHG5 was involved in several tumor and nontumor diseases and is associated with clinical features, prognosis, drug sensitivity, and other factors regarding diagnosis and treatment (30Li Y.H. Hu Y.Q. Wang S.C. Li Y. Chen D.M. LncRNA SNHG5: a new budding star in human cancers.Gene. 2020; 749144724Google Scholar, 31Chi J.R. Yu Z.H. Liu B.W. Zhang D. Ge J.

Quentin S. et al.Deletion 6q drives T-cell leukemia progression by ribosome modulation.Cancer Discov. 2018; 8: 1614-1631Google Scholar). Recently, compelling evidence indicated that upregulated SNHG5 plays a vital role in neoplastic kidney disease (34Xiang W. Lv L. Zhou G. Wu W. Yuan J. Zhang C. et al.The lncRNA SNHG5-mediated miR-205-5p downregulation contributes to the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma by targeting ZEB1.Cancer Med. 2020; 9: 4251-4264Google Scholar, 35Li W.Z. Zou Y. Song Z.Y. Wei Z.W. Chen G. Cai Q.L. et al.Long non-coding RNA SNHG5 affects the invasion and apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma by regulating the miR-363-3p-Twist1 interaction.Am. J. Transl. Res. 2020; 12: 697-707Google Scholar). Regarding nonneoplastic kidney disease, a recent study indicated that SNHG5 expression was elevated in HK-2 cells treated with HG, accompanied with decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and enhanced inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress (36Cai Q. Wang C. Huang L. Wu C. Yan B. Chen T. et al.Long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) regulates renal tubular damage in diabetic nephropathy via targeting MiR-26a-5p.Horm. Metab. Res. 2021; 53: 818-824Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the potential effects of SNHG5 in podocytes remain to be explored. In the present study, we found that SNHG5 expression was markedly increased in DN. SNHG5 levels positively correlated with ACR of db/db mice. More interestingly, attenuated podocyte injury, accompanied by restored miR-26a-5p and decreased TRPC6 expression, was found in HG-treated podocytes after SNHG5 knockdown. Meanwhile, lower levels of albuminuria and alleviated foot process fusion were observed in db/db mice with SNHG5 knockdown. Mechanically, SNHG5 knockdown protected podocytes from injury by modulating the miR-26a-5p/TRPC6 axis in DN. These findings are the first evidence for the biological function of SNHG5 in podocytes under DN condition. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs, including lncRNAs, miRNAs, etc.) are essential mechanisms of epigenetics that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (37Liu S.J. Dang H.X. Lim D.A. Feng F.Y. Maher C.A. Long noncoding RNAs in cancer metastasis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2021; 21: 446-460Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence demonstrated that ncRNAs play critical roles in developing kidney diseases (9Guo C. Dong G. Liang X. Dong Z. Epigenetic regulation in AKI and kidney repair: mechanisms and therapeutic implications.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2019; 15: 220-239Google Scholar, 38Kato M. Natarajan R. Epigenetics and epigenomics in diabetic kidney disease and metabolic memory.Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2019; 15: 327-345Google Scholar). There is close crosstalk between lncRNAs and miRNAs. One of the most well-known mechanisms involves competing for endogenous RNA (39Qi X. Lin Y. Chen J. Shen B. Decoding competing endogenous RNA networks for cancer biomarker discovery.Brief Bioinform. 2020; 21: 441-457Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of lncRNA H19 protects the kidney against acute ischemic injury by sponging miR-30a-5p and stimulating proangiogenic signaling (40Haddad G. Kölling M. Wegmann U.A. Dettling A. Seeger H. Schmitt R. et al.Renal AAV2-mediated overexpression of long non-coding RNA H19 attenuates ischemic acute kidney injury through sponging of microRNA-30a-5p.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2021; 32: 323-341Google Scholar). Considering the essential role of ncRNAs, strategies for preventing or treating diseases have been proposed, including siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (41Chen Y. Li Z. Chen X. Zhang S. Long non-coding RNAs: from disease code to drug role.Acta Pharm. Sin. B. 2021; 11: 340-354Google Scholar, 42Levin A.A.

Cullis P.R. et al.The current landscape of nucleic acid therapeutics.Nat. Nanotechnol. 2021; 16: 630-643Google Scholar). In the present study, we also attempted to explore the potential therapeutic targets for podocyte injury via targeting ncRNA. In conclusion, we discovered a precise mechanism mediating podocyte injury in DN. Upregulated SNHG5 contributes to podocyte injury by targeting the miR-26a-5p/TRPC6 pathway (Fig. 7). These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of podocyte injury and the progression of DN. Interrupting this integrated SNHG5/miR-26a-5p/TRPC6 signaling cascade represents a promising therapeutic target for DN."

Serine protease inhibitors, or SERPINs, comprise a protein superfamily with over 30 members in humans, the majority of which display specific inhibitory activity toward a subset of serine proteases (1Sanrattana W. Maas C. de Maat S. SERPINs—from trap to treatment.Front. Med. 2019; 6: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Spence M.A. Mortimer M.D. Buckle A.M. Minh B.Q. Jackson C.J. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the serpin superfamily.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2021; 38: 2915-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Despite the highly specific interaction of most SERPINs with their target proteases, all SERPINs share a common structure that consists of a globular domain containing a central β-sheet (β-sheet A), with a reactive center loop (RCL) that extends above the core of the protein when the SERPIN is in its metastable active state. The RCL contains a sequence motif that mimics the primary recognition site for its unique set of target serine protease(s) (3Gettins P.G. Olson S.T. Exosite determinants of serpin specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When the serine protease encounters its target sequence in the RCL, proteolysis between the P1 and P1′ positions is initiated by the formation of an acyl intermediate. Inhibition of the target serine protease results when the RCL inserts into β-sheet A prior to hydrolysis of the acyl intermediate (4Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), with the resulting conformational changes rendering both the serine protease and SERPIN no longer functional. If the acyl-intermediate is hydrolyzed prior to insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A, the serine protease will remain active, whereas the proteolyzed RCL will render the cleaved SERPIN noninhibitory (1Sanrattana W. Maas C. de Maat S. SERPINs—from trap to treatment.Front. Med. 2019; 6: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Muhammad S. Day D.E. Kvassman J.O.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, SERPINE1) is a 379 amino acid member of the SERPIN superfamily composed of nine α-helices and three β-sheets. The canonical function of PAI-1 is to inhibit the serine protease urokinase-like plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (the primary proteolytic activators of the zymogen plasminogen to the serine protease plasmin. Plasmin is the key enzyme responsible for fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of fibrin clots. Although the major function of PAI-1 appears to be in hemostasis through regulation of the fibrinolytic pathway, other functional roles have been proposed (6Sillen M. Declerck P.J.

In vivo, PAI-1 circulates in an 1:1 complex with its cofactor vitronectin (7Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Pâques E.P.

PAI-1 is unique among the SERPIN protein superfamily in undergoing a spontaneous transition to a noninhibitory but more thermodynamically stable and latent conformation when, in the absence of a proteolytic event, an intramolecular rearrangement occurs in which the RCL spontaneously inserts into β-sheet A. The metastable PAI-1 active conformation exists in equilibrium with a prelatent state in which the RCL is hypothesized to be partially inserted into β-sheet A (24Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D.

Full insertion of the RCL is conformationally blocked by the Val157-loop between helix F and β-strand 3A; however, partial unfolding of helix F permits full insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A, whereas the return of helix F to the native state traps PAI-1 in its latent conformation (26Cazzolli G.

While the physiologic function of the PAI-1 latency transition is unknown, it may serve to clear plasma PAI-1 activity from circulation that is distal from a site of fibrinolytic activity (37Mayer E.J.

In a previous report, we used deep mutational scanning (DMS) to characterize the impact of PAI-1 missense variants on uPA inhibitory activity (43Huttinger Z.M. Haynes L.M. Yee A. Kretz C.A.

This study identified missense mutations in PAI-1 that are both tolerated and not tolerated with respect to uPA inhibition. In this study, we expand on these results by performing a deep mutational scan on PAI-1 latency to examine how mutations in PAI-1 modulate its transition into a latent nonfunctional state (43Huttinger Z.M. Haynes L.M. Yee A. Kretz C.A. Holding M.L. Siemieniak D.R. et al.Deep mutational scanning of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functional landscape.Sci.

We also now describe a novel approach to simultaneously measure the half-lives of multiple PAI-1 variants in a massively parallel fashion. Together, these data provide an empirical method to assess allosteric networks within PAI-1 that contribute to its latency transition. Our findings also complement the molecular dynamics simulations of Kihn et al. (48Kihn K. Marchiori E. Spagnolli G. Boldrini A. Terruzzi L. Lawrence D.A. et al.Long range allostery mediates the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by vitronectin.bioRxiv. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.19.500692Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The fraction of active phage displayed PAI-1 (phPAI-1) (43Huttinger Z.M. Haynes L.M. Yee A. Kretz C.A. Holding M.L. Siemieniak D.R. et al.Deep mutational scanning of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functional landscape.Sci.

Using this approach, the t1/2 of WT phPAI-1 was determined to be 2.1 h, consistent with published values for WT recombinant PAI-1 (rPAI-1) (29Li S.H. Gorlatova N.V. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S.

Santell L. Conversion of the active to latent plasminogen activator inhibitor from human endothelial cells.Blood. 1987; 70: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, immunoprecipitation by the N-terminal myc tag of phPAI-1 further confirmed that the loss of phPAI-1 functional activity is due to its transition to latency and not degradation or proteolysis (Fig. 1). When the previously characterized phPAI-1 mutant library (43Huttinger Z.M. Haynes L.M. Yee A. Kretz C.A. Holding M.L. Siemieniak D.R. et al.Deep mutational scanning of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functional landscape.Sci. Rep. 2021; 1118827Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) was analyzed over the same 48 h time course, the apparent aggregate t1/2 of the library was determined to be 11.2 h (Fig. 1). This prolonged t1/2 is likely explained by the presence within the library of multiple phage-carrying mutations that prolong the functional stability of PAI-1. We previously reported the construction of a phPAI-1 mutant library containing 8.04 × 106 independent clones with an average of 4.2 ± 1.8 missense mutations per fusion protein (43Huttinger Z.M. Haynes L.M. Yee A. Kretz C.A. Holding M.L. Siemieniak D.R. et al.Deep mutational scanning of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functional landscape.Sci. Rep. 2021; 1118827Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To assess the relative functional stability of phPAI-1 variants that retained inhibitory activity at 48 h, the phPAI-1 mutant library was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h before selection for complex formation with uPA (Data S1). Input and selected phage were analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS). Variants that were nonfunctional at 0 h (i.e., depleted following selection for complex formation without heat-induced latency) were removed from subsequent analyses as these variants were assumed to either have no inhibitory activity or an extremely short functional t1/2 (43Huttinger Z.M. Haynes L.M. Yee A. Kretz C.A. Holding M.L. Siemieniak D.R. et al.Deep mutational scanning of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 functional landscape.Sci. Rep. 2021; 1118827Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The relative functional stability scores for missense mutations compared with the WT amino acid at each position are illustrated in Figure 2. Of the 1988 missense mutations that were characterized for functional stability relative to WT PAI-1, 439 amino acid substitutions generated PAI-1 variants with increased functional stability. Conversely, 1549 amino acid substitutions resulted in PAI-1 variants that were functionally active yet less functionally stable than WT PAI-1. The missense mutations with the top 35 functional stability scores are listed in Table 1. Although PAI-1 mutations that increase or decrease the rate of uPA inhibition may contribute to relative functional stability scores, this effect should be negligible given the high uPA concentration compared with that of phPAI-1 in addition to the relatively long reaction time (30 min).Table 1Thirty-five most functionally stable PAI-1 variants relative to WTMutationFunctional stability scorepadjMassively parallel t1/2, hI91L3.732.27 × 10−188NDL169S3.676.25 × 10−29NDI91F3.47<10−2947.7F372V3.39<10−2946.1D222H3.225.14 × 10−136NDI91M3.205.51 × 10−165NDS331G2.97<10−2946.8D222Y2.954.76 × 10−293NDY241R2.942.66 × 10−26NDM45K2.82<10−2943.9G332S2.814.63 × 10−2426.2T333A2.74<10−2947.8Y221C2.725.47 × 10−240NDF372I2.72<10−2944.0G332D2.709.24 × 10−2257.0R271L2.673.20 × 10−2393.7K154I2.621.21 × 10−2663.3G332A2.622.48 × 10−124NDF372C2.578.19 × 10−123NDD222V2.561.54 × 10−263NDE378D2.457.76 × 10−2364.9G332R2.441.60 × 10−55NDT323I2.40<10−294NDL272R2.381.95 × 10−1933.4K176E2.381.26 × 10−2104.1D222N2.37<10−2942.0F372L2.34<10−2943.7T333S2.338.77 × 10−658.4Y241H2.31<10−2942.0V334G2.281.37 × 10−89NDS198C2.264.44 × 10−118NDG332V2.181.80 × 10−707.6W86L2.179.72 × 10−27413.1R271C2.164.50 × 10−2773.9L169H2.141.68 × 10−883.2Abbreviation: ND, not determined because of insufficient data.padj = adjusted p value as defined by Love et al.

Leveraging the power of DMS coupled with our phage display system, we developed an approach to accurately extract latency transition half-lives for individual missense PAI-1 mutations from the aggregate t1/2 data for the entire phPAI-1 mutational library. As described in more detail in the Experimental procedures section, uPA selection of the library was performed at multiple time points over a 48 h time course (Fig. 1), subjected to HTS, and these data were used to determine the half-lives of individual missense mutations. By this approach, we calculated the functional half-lives of 697 individual PAI-1 missense mutations (Fig. 3A and Data S2),"

Due to the rapid transmission of the disease and the lack of definitive treatment, countries have employed nonpharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the smart travel ban policy, which has been implemented for non-commercial vehicles in the intercity highways of Iran since November 21, 2020. The other goal was to suggest efficient COVID-19 forecasting tools and to examine the association of intercity travel patterns and COVID-19 trends in Iran. To this end, weekly confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 and the intercity traffic flow reported by loop detectors were aggregated at the country’s level. The Box-Jenkins methodology was employed to evaluate the policy’s effectiveness, using the interrupted time series analysis. The results indicated that the autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX) model outperformed the univariate ARIMA model in predicting the disease trends based on the MAPE criterion. The weekly intercity traffic and its lagged variables were entered as covariates in both models of the disease cases and deaths. The results indicated that the weekly intercity traffic increases the new weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths with a time lag of two and five weeks, respectively. Besides, the interrupted time series analysis indicated that the smart travel ban policy had decreased intercity travel by around 29%. Nonetheless, it had no significant direct effect on COVID-19 trends. This study suggests that the travel ban policy would not be efficient lonely unless it is coupled with active measures and adherence to health protocols by the people."
https://openalex.org/W4306816443,"Phytases, enzymes that degrade phytate present in feedstuffs, are widely added to the diets of monogastric animals. Many studies have correlated phytase addition with improved animal productivity and a subset of these have sought to correlate animal performance with phytase-mediated generation of inositol phosphates in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract or with release of inositol or of phosphate, the absorbable products of phytate degradation. Remarkably, the effect of dietary phytase on tissue inositol phosphates has not been studied. The objective of this study was to determine effect of phytase supplementation on liver and kidney myo-inositol and myo-inositol phosphates in broiler chickens. For this, methods were developed to measure inositol phosphates in chicken tissues. The study comprised wheat/soy-based diets containing one of three levels of phytase (0, 500 and 6,000 FTU/kg of modified E. coli 6-phytase). Diets were provided to broilers for 21 D and on day 21 digesta were collected from the gizzard and ileum. Liver and kidney tissue were harvested. Myo-inositol and inositol phosphates were measured in diet, digesta, liver and kidney. Gizzard and ileal content inositol was increased progressively, and total inositol phosphates reduced progressively, by phytase supplementation. The predominant higher inositol phosphates detected in tissues, D-and/or L-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, differed from those (D-and/or L-Ins(1,2,3,4)P4, D-and/or L-Ins(1,2,5,6)P4, Ins(1,2,3,4,6)P5, D-and/or L-Ins(1,2,3,4,5)P5 and D-and/or L-Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5) generated from phytate (InsP6) degradation by E. coli 6-phytase or endogenous feed phytase, suggesting tissue inositol phosphates are not the result of direct absorption. Kidney inositol phosphates were reduced progressively by phytase supplementation. These data suggest that tissue inositol phosphate concentrations can be influenced by dietary phytase inclusion rate and that such effects are tissue specific, though the consequences for physiology of such changes have yet to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W4306816517,"Despite well-documented health benefits from exercise, a study on national trends in achieving the recommended minutes of physical activity guidelines has not improved since the guidelines were published in 2008. Peer interactions have been identified as a critical factor for increasing a population’s physical activity. The objective of this study is for establishing criteria for social influences on physical activity for establishing criteria that lead to exercise persistence. A system of differential equations was developed that projects exercise trends over time. The system includes both social and non-social influences that impact changes in physical activity habits and establishes quantitative conditions that delineate population-wide persistence habits from domination of sedentary behavior. The model was generally designed with parameter values that can be estimated to data. Complete absence of social or peer influences resulted in long-term dominance of sedentary behavior and a decline of physically active populations. Social interactions between sedentary and moderately active populations were the most important social parameter that influenced low active populations to become and remain physically active. On the other hand, social interactions encouraging moderately active individuals to become sedentary drove exercise persistence to extinction. Communities should focus on increasing social interactions between sedentary and moderately active individuals to draw sedentary populations to become more active. Additionally, reducing opportunities for moderately active individuals to engage with sedentary individuals through sedentary social activities should be addressed."

The aim is to assess bone mineral density as a skeletal indicator of socioeconomic status including stature as a variable. We detected that socioeconomic status significantly affected bone mineral density and stature. Individuals of high status had higher bone mineral density (0.07 g/cm 2 , p = 0.003) and taller stature (1.85 cm, p = 0.017) than individuals from the parish population. We detected no significant relationship between young adult bone mineral density and socioeconomic status (p = 0.127 and 0.059 for females and males, respectively). For males, high young adult bone mineral density and stature varied concordantly in both status groups. In contrast, females of high status were significantly taller than females in the parish population (p = 0.011). Our findings indicate quite different conditions during growth and puberty for the two groups of females. The age-related pattern of bone variation also portrayed quite different trajectories for the two socioeconomic status groups of both sexes. We discuss sociocultural practices (living conditions during childhood and puberty, as well as nutritional and lifestyle factors in adult life), possibly explaining the differences in bone mineral density between the high-status and parish population groups. The observation of greater differences in bone mineral density and stature for females than males in the medieval society of Norway is also further discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4306831332,"The endothelial glycocalyx (EGX) contributes to the permeability barrier of vessels and regulates the coagulation cascade. EGX damage, which occurs in numerous disease states, including sepsis and trauma, results in endotheliopathy. While influenza and other viral infections are known to cause endothelial dysfunction, their effect on the EGX has not been described. We hypothesized that the H1N1 influenza virus would cause EGX degradation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to varying multiplicities of infection (MOI) of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus for 24 hours. A dose-dependent effect was examined by using an MOI of 5 (n = 541), 15 (n = 714), 30 (n = 596), and 60 (n = 653) and compared to a control (n = 607). Cells were fixed and stained with FITC-labelled wheat germ agglutinin to quantify EGX. There was no difference in EGX intensity after exposure to H1N1 at an MOI of 5 compared to control (6.20 vs. 6.56 Arbitrary Units (AU), p = 0.50). EGX intensity was decreased at an MOI of 15 compared to control (5.36 vs. 6.56 AU, p&lt;0.001). The degree of EGX degradation was worse at higher doses of the H1N1 virus; however, the decrease in EGX intensity was maximized at an MOI of 30. Injury at MOI of 60 was not worse than MOI of 30. (4.17 vs. 4.47 AU, p = 0.13). The H1N1 virus induces endothelial dysfunction by causing EGX degradation in a dose-dependent fashion. Further studies are needed to characterize the role of this EGX damage in causing clinically significant lung injury during acute viral infection."

Pregnant nulliparous women aged ≥ 18 years with a singleton pregnancy at a gestational age < 16 weeks of gestation with a lowest pulsatility index ≥ 1.7 or a bilateral protodiastolic notching for both uterine arteries on an ultrasound performed between 11+0 and 13+6 weeks by a certified sonographer were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 160 mg of low-dose aspirin or to placebo to be taken daily from inclusion to their 34th week of gestation. The main outcome was preeclampsia or a birthweight ≤ 5th percentile. Other outcomes included preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, preterm preeclampsia, preterm delivery before 34 weeks, mode of delivery, type of anesthesia, birthweight ≤ 5th percentile and perinatal death.The trial was interrupted due to recruiting difficulties. Between June 2012 and June 2016, 1104 women were randomized, two withdrew consent, and two had terminations of pregnancies. Preeclampsia or a birthweight ≤ 5th percentile occurred in 88 (16.0%) women in the low-dose aspirin group and in 79 (14.4%) in the placebo group (proportion difference 1.6 [-2.6; 5.9] p = 0.45). The two groups did not differ significantly for the secondary outcomes.Low-dose aspirin was not associated with a lower rate of either preeclampsia or birthweight ≤ 5th percentile in women identified by their first-trimester uterine artery Doppler as at high risk of preeclampsia.(NCT0172946)."
https://openalex.org/W4306833715,"Cancer is a major health problem in the U.S and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is known to increase the risk for the development of many cancers. Metformin, a first-line therapy for treating T2DM, is increasingly being used for its anticancer effects; however, the literature is limited on the effect of metformin dose on overall survival in patients with stage IV cancer. Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of diagnosis to the last known follow-up or death from any cause. Subjects who were alive on December 31, 2016 were censored. In this cohort study we examined the relationship between metformin dose and overall survival in persons with both T2DM and stage IV lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreas cancers. We used a retrospective study design with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the 2007–2016 of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare (SEER) dataset. Of the 7,725 patients, 2,981(38.5%) had been prescribed metformin. Patients who used metformin had significantly better overall survival in both unadjusted (Unadjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69–0.76; p &lt; 0.001) and adjusted models (adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81; p &lt; 0.001).

https://openalex.org/W4306320009,"Novel vaccination strategies are crucial to efficiently control tuberculosis, as proposed by the World Health Organization under its flagship program ""End TB Strategy."" However, the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), particularly in those coinfected with HIV-AIDS, constitutes a major impediment to achieving this goal. We report here a novel vaccination strategy that involves synthesizing a formulation of an immunodominant peptide derived from the Acr1 protein of Mtb. This nanoformulation in addition displayed on the surface a toll-like receptor-2 ligand to offer to target dendritic cells (DCs). Our results showed an efficient uptake of such a concoction by DCs in a predominantly toll-like receptor-2-dependent pathway. These DCs produced elevated levels of nitric oxide, proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and upregulated the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86. Animals injected with such a vaccine mounted a significantly higher response of effector and memory Th1 cells and Th17 cells. Furthermore, we noticed a reduction in the bacterial load in the lungs of animals challenged with aerosolized live Mtb. Therefore, our findings indicated that the described vaccine triggered protective anti-Mtb immunity to control the tuberculosis infection."

As a secondary analysis of a prior study investigating the safety, efficacy, and participants' perceptions of a novel airway clearance technique, specific cough technique (SCT) compared to forced expiration technique (FET), we aimed to evaluate whether the intervention was associated with changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).We conducted randomised, controlled individual trials with six adults (N-of-1 RCTs). Each trial included eight weeks of treatment, twice a week, using saline inhalation in horizontal positions, one with SCT and one with FET, in random order. Efficacy was measured by sputum wet weight (g) after each session. Perceived usefulness and preference were self-reported at the end of the study. Lung function was assessed at baseline and at the end of study. HRQoL was measured using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) at baseline (week 1) and at completion of the study (week 8). Individual HRQoL scores (0-100) were coded and analysed using CFQ-R Software Program, version 2.0.Patient-reported outcomes were completed by all subjects. Individual CFQ-R-Respiratory Symptoms Scores (CFQ-R-RSS) showed a positive change, meeting the minimal important difference (MID) ≥ 4 points in five participants and a negative change in one individual. A strong correlation (r = 0.94 (p<0.01) was found between total sputum weight (g) and the positive changes in CFQ-R-RSS, and between changes in lung function and CFQ-R-RSS (r = 0.84 (p = 0.04).The airway clearance intervention was associated with clinically meaningful changes in patient-reported symptoms on the CFQ-R in the majority of the participants. This finding warrants further investigation regarding treatment, duration and frequency. A long-term study may reveal beneficial effects on other clinically meaningful endpoints, such as pulmonary exacerbations, high-resolution computed tomography scores and HRQoL.The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, under the number NCT0 1266473."
https://openalex.org/W4306816502,"Non-invasive biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) supporting diagnosis and monitoring disease progression are urgently needed. The present study aimed to establish a bioinformatics pipeline capable of defining and validating NAFLD biomarker candidates based on paired hepatic global gene expression and plasma bioanalysis from individuals representing different stages of histologically confirmed NAFLD (no/mild, moderate, more advanced NAFLD). Liver secretome gene signatures were generated in a patient cohort of 26 severely obese individuals with the majority having no or mild fibrosis. To this end, global gene expression changes were compared between individuals with no/mild NAFLD and moderate/advanced NAFLD with subsequent filtering for candidate gene products with liver-selective expression and secretion. Four candidate genes, including LPA (lipoprotein A), IGFBP-1 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1), SERPINF2 (serpin family F member 2) and MAT1A (methionine adenosyltransferase 1A), were differentially expressed in moderate/advanced NAFLD, which was confirmed in three independent RNA sequencing datasets from large, publicly available NAFLD studies. The corresponding gene products were quantified in plasma samples but could not discriminate among different grades of NAFLD based on NAFLD activity score. Conclusion : We demonstrate a novel approach based on the liver transcriptome allowing for identification of secreted hepatic gene products as potential circulating diagnostic biomarkers of NAFLD. Using this approach in larger NAFLD patient cohorts may yield potential circulating biomarkers for NAFLD severity."
https://openalex.org/W4306816562,"Background Rapid diagnostics are vital for curving the transmission and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many commercially available antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 are recommended by the WHO, their diagnostic performance has not yet been assessed in Ethiopia. So far, the vast majority of studies assessing diagnostic accuracies of rapid antigen tests considered RT-PCR as a reference standard, which inevitably leads to bias when RT-PCR is not 100% sensitive and specific. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Panbio ™ jointly with the RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study was done from July to September 2021 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during the third wave of the pandemic involving two health centers and two hospitals. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of Panbio ™ and RT-PCR were obtained using Bayesian Latent-Class Models (BLCM). Results 438 COVID-19 presumptive clients were enrolled, 239 (54.6%) were females, of whom 196 (44.7%) had a positive RT-PCR and 158 (36.1%) were Panbio ™ positive. The Panbio ™ and RT-PCR had a sensitivity (95% CrI) of 99.6 (98.4–100) %, 89.3 (83.2–97.6) % and specificity (95% CrI) of 93.4 (82.3–100) %, and 99.1 (97.5–100) %, respectively. Most of the study participants, 318 (72.6%) exhibited COVID-19 symptoms; the most reported was cough 191 (43.6%). Conclusion As expected the RT-PCR performed very well with a near-perfect specificity and a high, but not perfect sensitivity. The diagnostic performance of Panbio ™ is coherent with the WHO established criteria of having a sensitivity ≥80% for Ag-RDTs. Both tests displayed high diagnostic accuracies in patients with and without symptoms. Hence, we recommend the use of the Panbio ™ for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in clinical settings for screening purposes."

Near-net-shape NiTi SMA foils of 2 meters in length and width of 30 mm have been successfully produced by a planar flow casting facility at CSIRO, opening possibilities of wider applications of SMA foils. The study also focuses on establishing a fully automated experimental system for the characterisation of their reversible actuation, significantly improving SMA foils adaptation into real applications. Artificial Intelligence involving Computer Vision and Machine Learning based methods were successfully employed in the development of the automation SMA characterization process. The study finds that an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Regression model based predictive system experimented with over 175,000 video samples could achieve 99% overall prediction accuracy. Generalisation capability of the proposed system makes a significant contribution towards the efficient optimisation of the material design to produce high quality 30 mm SMA foils."
https://openalex.org/W4306831634,"The ubiquitous existence of microbial communities marks the importance of understanding how species interact within the community to coexist and their spatial organization. We study a two-species mutualistic cross-feeding model through a stochastic cellular automaton on a square lattice using kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. Our model encapsulates the essential dynamic processes such as cell growth, and nutrient excretion, diffusion and uptake. Focusing on the interplay among nutrient diffusion and individual cell division, we discover three general classes of colony morphology: co-existing sectors, co-existing spirals, and engulfment. When the cross-feeding nutrient is widely available, either through high excretion or fast diffusion, a stable circular colony with alternating species sector emerges. When the consumer cells rely on being spatially close to the producers, we observe a stable spiral. We also see one species being engulfed by the other when species interfaces merge due to stochastic fluctuation. By tuning the diffusion rate and the growth rate, we are able to gain quantitative insights into the structures of the sectors and the spirals."
https://openalex.org/W4306832597,"Purpose Early confirmation or ruling out biliary atresia (BA) is essential for infants with delayed onset of jaundice. In the current practice, percutaneous liver biopsy and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) remain the golden standards for diagnosis. In Taiwan, the diagnostic methods are invasive and can only be performed in selective medical centers. However, referrals from primary physicians and local pediatricians are often delayed because of lacking clinical suspicions. Ultrasounds (US) are common screening tools in local hospitals and clinics, but the pediatric hepatobiliary US particularly requires well-trained imaging personnel. The meaningful comprehension of US is highly dependent on individual experience. For screening BA through human observation on US images, the reported sensitivity and specificity were achieved by pediatric radiologists, pediatric hepatobiliary experts, or pediatric surgeons. Therefore, this research developed a tool based on deep learning models for screening BA to assist pediatric US image reading by general physicians and pediatricians. Methods De-identified hepatobiliary US images of 180 patients from Taichung Veterans General Hospital were retrospectively collected under the approval of the Institutional Review Board. Herein, the top network models of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition and other network models commonly used for US image recognition were included for further study to classify US images as BA or non-BA. The performance of different network models was expressed by the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve. There were two methods proposed to solve disagreement by US image classification of a single patient. The first and second methods were the positive-dominance law and threshold law. During the study, the US images of three successive patients suspected to have BA were classified by the trained models. Results Among all included patients contributing US images, 41 patients were diagnosed with BA by surgical intervention and 139 patients were either healthy controls or had non-BA diagnoses. In this study, a total of 1,976 original US images were enrolled. Among them, 417 and 1,559 raw images were from patients with BA and without BA, respectively. Meanwhile, ShuffleNet achieved the highest accuracy of 90.56% using the same training parameters as compared with other network models. The sensitivity and specificity were 67.83% and 96.76%, respectively. In addition, the undesired false-negative prediction was prevented by applying positive-dominance law to interpret different images of a single patient with an acceptable false-positive rate, which was 13.64%. For the three consecutive patients with delayed obstructive jaundice with IOC confirmed diagnoses, ShuffleNet achieved accurate diagnoses in two patients. Conclusion The current study provides a screening tool for identifying possible BA by hepatobiliary US images. The method was not designed to replace liver biopsy or IOC, but to decrease human error for interpretations of US. By applying the positive-dominance law to ShuffleNet, the false-negative rate and the specificities were 0 and 86.36%, respectively. The trained deep learning models could aid physicians other than pediatric surgeons, pediatric gastroenterologists, or pediatric radiologists, to prevent misreading pediatric hepatobiliary US images. The current artificial intelligence (AI) tool is helpful for screening BA in the real world."
https://openalex.org/W4306833612,"First time migrants (juveniles hereafter) of many species migrate without specific knowledge of non-breeding locations, but experience may aid adults in timing and route decisions because they can migrate more efficiently to their previous non-breeding sites. Consequently, we expect a transition to more efficient migratory behaviour with age, but when and how this happens is little known. We used light-level geolocator data from Cyprus wheatears Oenanthe cypriaca to compare migration timing and route directness between juveniles and adults, and repeatability of their timing and non-breeding locations. We predicted that juveniles would depart and arrive later than adults for both autumn and spring migration; that duration of migration would be greater for juveniles; that routes taken by juveniles would be less direct than those for adults; and that autumn and spring departure timing, and non-breeding locations, would be more repeatable for adults between two years than for juveniles between their first and subsequent migration. We found that juveniles departed significantly later than adults in autumn but there was no difference in arrival timing, and although spring departure timings did not differ, juveniles arrived on the breeding grounds later than adults. Nevertheless, we found no significant age-related difference in the duration of migration in autumn or spring. Yet, juvenile migrations were less direct than those of adults in autumn, but not spring. We found evidence that spring departure timing and non-breeding locations were repeatable for adults but not juveniles. Our findings show that age-related changes in migratory behaviour begin to occur during the first annual cycle demonstrating the potential for early adaptation to environmental variability within an individual’s life."

Chromosomal aberrations with different irradiation dose rates were used to establish the biological dose curve and analyze the excess of the “dicentric + ring” caused by the dose rate at each dose point; DAPI-images and Metafer 4 were used to capture metaphase images and make further analysis. The data were collected in 2020, Dicentric + ring/100 Cells was 17.5–43.8, the average value was28.32 ± 6.98.

https://openalex.org/W4306404799,"During mammary development, the transdifferentiation of mammary preadipocytes is one of the important sources for lactating mammary epithelial cells (MECs). However, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms of dynamic regulation of transcriptome and genome-wide DNA methylation in the preadipocyte transdifferentiation process. Here, to gain more insight into these mechanisms, preadipocytes were isolated from adipose tissues from around the goat mammary gland (GM-preadipocytes). The GM-preadipocytes were cultured on Matrigel in conditioned media made from goat MECs to induce GM-preadipocyte-to-MEC transdifferentiation. The transdifferentiated GM-preadipocytes showed high abundance of keratin 18, which is a marker protein of MECs, and formed mammary acinar-like structures after 8 days of induction. Then, we performed transcriptome and DNA methylome profiling of the GM-preadipocytes and transdifferentiated GM-preadipocytes, respectively, and the differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated genes that play underlying roles in the process of transdifferentiation were obtained. Subsequently, we identified the candidate transcription factors in regulating the GM-preadipocyte-to-MEC transdifferentiation by transcription factor-binding motif enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated genes. Meanwhile, the secretory proteome of GM-preadipocytes cultured in conditioned media was also detected. By integrating the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and proteome, three candidate genes, four proteins, and several epigenetic regulatory axes were further identified, which are involved in regulation of the cell cycle, cell polarity establishment, cell adhesion, cell reprogramming, and adipocyte plasticity. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of preadipocyte transdifferentiation and mammary development."

We demonstrate that the ET FAD undergoes transformation to two different modified flavins by a sequence of protein-catalyzed reactions that occurs specifically in the ET site, when the enzyme is maintained at pH 9 in an amine-based buffer.

Variants retaining only the FAD shared with canonical ETFs demonstrated that this retains the 1e reactivity of canonical ETFs, while the second FAD is the seat of the 2e reactivity that is central to bifurcation (23Mohamed-Raseek N.

Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is understood that the FAD shared with canonical ETFs mediates 1e electron transfer (the 'ET' FAD, yellow in Fig. 1), whereas the FAD unique to Bf ETFs that resides in the base mediates bifurcation (the Bf FAD, green in Fig. 1). The earliest studies found that flavins released from MelETF included at least three different covalent forms: native FAD, 6-OH FAD, and 8-OH FAD (Scheme S1, (16Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21015-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). More recently, HsaETF has been found to accumulate 8-formyl flavin (8fF) (25Augustin P. Toplak M. Fuchs K. Gerstmann E.C. Prassl R. Winkler A. et al.Oxidation of the FAD cofactor to the 8-formyl-derivative in human electron-transferring flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2829-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), making sense of unexpected spectra observed for porcine ETF (26Lehman T.C. Thorpe C. A new form of mammalian electron transfer flavoprotein.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since HsaETF contains FAD only in the ET site, the implication is that the ET FAD is unusually susceptible to modification. We suspect that this may be related to the unusual degree to which the flavin ASQ state is stabilized by this site. A stable SQ state of the flavin is essential to bifurcating ETFs' activity, because it enables the ET flavin to perform 1e transfer. Electron transfer bifurcation ('bifurcation') in ETFs involves acceptance of a pair of electrons as hydride from NADH followed by transfer of one to a higher-E° acceptor and the other to a lower-E° acceptor, thereby generating a reductant that is more powerful than NADH. The lower-E° products, reduced ferredoxin or flavodoxin, both support critical reactions such as N2 fixation (27Herrmann G. Jayamani E. Mai G. Buckel W. Energy conservation via electron-transferring flavoprotein in anaerobic bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Bifurcation is thermodynamically allowed only because production of the low-E° product is coupled to favorable reduction of a high-E° carrier. However, the efficiency of bifurcation rests critically on a gate that allows only one of the two electrons to pass to high E°. Alternation of conformations has been proposed to enforce this (13Demmer J.K. Chowdhury N.P. Selmer T. Ermler U. Buckel W. The semiquinone swing in the bifurcating electron transferring flavoprotein/butyryl-coA dehydrogenase complex from Clostridium difficile.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but still requires that the ET flavin accept electrons only one at a time. This in turn requires that a semiquinone state be strongly stabilized, in contrast to the case for free flavin (28Mayhew S.G. The effects of pH and semiquinone formation on the oxidation-reduction potentials of flavin mononucleotide: a reappraisal.Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, if ET flavin's resting state in vivo is the ASQ state, then it will only have capacity to accept a single electron (29Yang K.Y. Swenson R.P. Modulation of the redox properties of the flavin cofactor through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the N(5) atom: role of alpha Ser254 in the electron-transfer flavoprotein from the methylotrophic bacterium W3A1.Biochem. 2007; 46: 2289-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Griffin K.J.

This would force the high-energy electron to pass to the low-E° acceptor instead, even in the absence of a conformational gate (31Schut G.J. Mohamed-Raseek N.R. Tokmina-Lukaszewska M. Mulder D.E. Nguyen D.M.N. Lipscomb G.L. et al.The catalytic mechanism of electron bifurcating electron transfer flavoproteins (ETFs) involves an intermediary complex with NAD+.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3271-3283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the unusual redox tuning of the ET flavin is central to Bf ETF's mechanism, motivating us to better understand this reactivity as a whole, including ET flavin's heightened tendency to covalent modification. Our exemplar of Bf ETFs is the ETF from the nitrogen-fixing phototroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris, RpaETF (32Pechter K.B. Gallagher L. Pyles H. Manoil C.S. Harwood C.S. Essential genome of the metabolically versatile alphaproteobacterium Rhodopseudomonas Palustris.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 198: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To compare this with a model canonical ETF that differs in as few respects as possible, the T94,97A variant was used. In this, both Thr-94 and Thr-97 of the smaller (B) subunit were replaced by Ala, thereby eliminating two hydrogen bonds that stabilize the flavin-proximate phosphate of FAD. T94,97A-RpaETF possesses AMP in place of the Bf flavin, similar to canonical ETFs, and its ET flavin displays the 1e redox reactivity with stable ASQ that typify canonical ETFs, with a relatively high oxidized/anionic semiquinone (OX/ASQ) reduction midpoint potential, E°OX/ASQ, of -7 mV (23Mohamed-Raseek N. Duan H.D. Mroginski M.A. Miller A.F. Spectroscopic, thermodynamic and computational evidence of the locations of the FADs in the nitrogen fixation-associated electron transfer flavoprotein.Chem. Sci. 2019; 10: 7762-7772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crucially, the Thr to Ala substitutions that weaken Bf FAD binding do so without directly perturbing the interface between subunits or the ET site, so effects on the ET flavin will be indirect only. Moreover, the Thr to Ala substitutions convert residue identities conserved among Bf ETFs to identities more common among canonical ETFs (33Garcia Costas A.M. Poudel S. Miller A.-F. Schut G.J. Ledbetter R.N. Fixen K. et al.Defining electron bifurcation in the electron transferring flavoprotein family.J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199: e00440-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, our T94,97A variant constitutes a model for canonical ETFs that is otherwise almost identical to the Bf RpaETF, facilitating direct comparison between the two types. Our RpaETF-derived canonical model duplicates the oxidation of the ET flavin 8-methyl to a formyl group found by (25Augustin P. Toplak M. Fuchs K. Gerstmann E.C. Prassl R. Winkler A. et al.Oxidation of the FAD cofactor to the 8-formyl-derivative in human electron-transferring flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2829-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but in extending our investigation to the Bf ETF containing two FADs, and anaerobic conditions more typical in-vivo, we demonstrate formation of a further modified flavin. We show that the special environment of the ET site potentiates the bound flavin for displacement of its 8-methyl by a fragment derived from our amine-based buffer. Tris buffer was found to stimulate modification of a flavin in another case (34Su D. Yuan H. Gadda G. A reversible, charge-induced intramolecular C4a-S-cysteinyl-flavin in choline oxidase variant S101C.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 6677-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) but this is the first instance we are aware of where portions of the buffer molecule become incorporated into the modified flavin product. The resulting species succeeds in explaining a perplexing signal observed near 726 nm (35Duan H.D. Mohamed-Raseek N. Miller A.F. Spectroscopic evidence for direct flavin-flavin contact in a bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 12618-12634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), in terms of a charge transfer complex suggesting conformational change within an ETF or association of two ETFs that brings their flavins together. Working at pH 8 in air, Augustin et al found that certain amino acid substitutions caused human ETF (HsaETF) to accumulate a modified flavin that they demonstrated to be 8fF (25Augustin P. Toplak M. Fuchs K. Gerstmann E.C. Prassl R. Winkler A. et al.Oxidation of the FAD cofactor to the 8-formyl-derivative in human electron-transferring flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2829-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Accumulation was slower at pH 7 and in the WT HsaETF. Similarly, we found that WT RpaETF did not accumulate significant 8fF at pH 8, but it gradually accumulated modified flavin at pH 9. Accumulation was accelerated in the T94,97A variant possessing only the ET flavin. Therefore, and because it is a simpler system, we began with T94,97A-RpaETF. Figure 2A shows the optical spectrum of T94,97A-RpaETF at the completion of purification and concentration in pH 9 buffer versus 24 h later. Spectra of material purified into pH 8 versus pH 9 revealed that at pH 9, changes occurred in the hour required for buffer exchange on a desalting column followed by concentration by ultrafiltration. However, samples prepared and held at pH 8 showed no change for days. Moreover purification steps prior to buffer exchange were always conducted at a lower pH. Thus, the pH 8 preparation can be taken to represent absence of modification (Fig. 2A). Spectra of flavins released from material purified into pH 9 demonstrate that the spectral changes reside in the flavin itself (Fig. 2B). Flavin released after purification at pH 9 displayed characteristics of 8fF including a blue-shifted band II (with λmax near 360 nm) and strength comparable to that of band I (near 450 nm) (25Augustin P. Toplak M. Fuchs K. Gerstmann E.C. Prassl R. Winkler A. et al.Oxidation of the FAD cofactor to the 8-formyl-derivative in human electron-transferring flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2829-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, blue trace). This contrasts with the weaker, longer-wavelength band II of authentic FAD near 374 nm. For flavin released from samples held at pH 9 for 24 h, a stronger-than-expected amplitude for band I with a shoulder at longer wavelengths suggested the presence of an additional modified FAD (vide infra), but the dominant spectral changes were suggestive of oxidation of the 8-methyl group to a formyl group (this C atom is denoted as C8M, Scheme S1). To test for 8fF, released cofactors were characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in anion mode (ES-). The mass spectrum of cofactor from T94,97A-RpaETF held at pH 9 displayed a prominent peak corresponding to authentic FAD at 784 m/z, accompanied by another strong peak at m/z = 822, as expected for 8fF complexed with a Na+ ion (Fig. S2). In contrast, only the m/z = 784 peak was found in the mass spectrum of flavins from WT-RpaETF purified at pH 8. This confirms oxidation of a methyl to a formyl group in the FAD in T94,97A-RpaETF. Two methyls are present in FAD, but the one at position 8 is much more reactive (36Mewies M. Basran J. Packman L.C. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Involvement of a flavin iminoquinone methide in the formation of 6-hydroxyflavin mononucleotide in trimethylamine dehydrogenase: a rationale for the existence of 8R-methyl and C6-linked covalent flavoproteins.Biochem. 1997; 36: 7162-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Walsh C. Flavin coenzymes: at the crossroads of biological redox Chemistry.Acc. Chem. Res. 1980; 13: 148-155Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid modification of the flavin of T94,97A-RpaETF at pH 9 is attributable primarily to formation of 8fF, as in HsaETF (25Augustin P. Toplak M. Fuchs K. Gerstmann E.C. Prassl R. Winkler A. et al.Oxidation of the FAD cofactor to the 8-formyl-derivative in human electron-transferring flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2829-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 8fF formation also explains the sharp feature that grew into T94,97A-RpaETF's optical spectrum at 432 nm, as well as the long-wavelength absorption extending beyond 700 nm (Fig. 2A). Both are attributable to 8fF in the ASQ state (25Augustin P. Toplak M. Fuchs K. Gerstmann E.C. Prassl R. Winkler A. et al.Oxidation of the FAD cofactor to the 8-formyl-derivative in human electron-transferring flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2829-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, bound 8fF's E°OX/ASQ appears sufficiently high that the ASQ can form even in air-equilibrated buffers, as in (2Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Davidson V.L. Unusual redox properties of electron-transfer flavoprotein from Methylophilus methylotrophus.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8582-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Upon release from the protein, the 8fF returned to the OX state, based on disappearance of both these features, indicating that the E°OX/ASQ is elevated by interactions in the ET site. This replicates the effect of the ET site on authentic FAD, which experiences greatly enhanced stabilization of the ASQ state when bound in the ET site (38Mohamed-Raseek N. Miller A.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20190-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, the flavin optical spectrum when bound differs from that when free, confirming that 8fF experiences a distinct environment when bound in the ET site. The fact that 8fF forms only when FAD is bound suggests that the peculiar environment provided by the ET site activates the flavin for modification. The fact that 8fF is formed in our T94,97A variant that only contains the ET flavin is consistent with modification of FAD in HsaETF that also lacks a Bf flavin (25Augustin P. Toplak M. Fuchs K. Gerstmann E.C. Prassl R. Winkler A. et al.Oxidation of the FAD cofactor to the 8-formyl-derivative in human electron-transferring flavoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2829-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, even in WT-RpaETF containing two FADs, modified flavin did not exceed half of the total after the content of modified FAD had ceased to change. Treatment with ADP confirmed that only the ET FAD was modified (42Mohamed-Raseek N. Flavin Modification and Redox Tuning in The Bifurcating Electron Transfer Flavoprotein From Rhodopseudomonas Palustris: Two Arginines With Different Roles. Ph. D., University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY2021Google Scholar). Presence of the second FAD nevertheless affected the pace of the process, as the rate of 8fF formation was faster in T94,97A-RpaETF than in Bf FAD-containing WT-RpaETF. This was also true for the R165H-RpaETF, another variant that also abrogates Bf FAD binding. These amino acid substitutions are all distant from the ET site, in a different domain and subunit of the protein (Fig. 1) (38Mohamed-Raseek N. Miller A.F.

Chem. 2022; 298 (in press): 101733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), so perhaps the presence of Bf FAD slows modification by favoring the closed conformation that seems less prone to ET flavin modification (25Augustin P.

Many studies have suggested that there are multiple regions generating different circadian periods within the SCN, but the exact localization of the regions has not been elucidated. In this study, using a transgenic rat carrying a destabilized luciferase reporter gene driven by a regulatory element of Per2 gene (Per2::dLuc), we investigated the regional variation of period lengths in horizontal slices of the SCN. We revealed a distinct caudal medial region (short period region, SPR) and a rostro-lateral region (long period region, LPR) that generate circadian rhythms with periods shorter than and longer than 24 hours, respectively. We also found that the core region of the SCN marked by dense VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) mRNA-expressing neurons covered a part of LPR, and that the shell region of the SCN contains both SPR and the rest of the LPR. Furthermore, we observed how synchronization is achieved between regions generating distinct circadian periods in the SCN. We found that the longer circadian rhythm of the rostral region appears to entrain the circadian rhythm in the caudal region. Our findings clarify the localization of regionality of circadian periods and the mechanism by which the integrated circadian rhythm is formed in the SCN."

Endophilin A2 (EndoA2) plays a role in nephrotic syndrome; however, its effect on renal fibrosis remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that EndoA2 protects against kidney interstitial fibrosis via the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling pathway. Mouse kidneys with fibrosis or kidney biopsy specimens from patients with fibrotic nephropathy had lower levels of EndoA2 protein expression than that in kidneys without fibrosis. In vivo overexpression of EndoA2 with the endophilin A2 transgene (EndoA2Tg) notably prevented renal fibrosis, decreased the protein expression of profibrotic molecules, suppressed tubular injury, and reduced apoptotic tubular cells in the obstructed kidney cortex of mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In vivo and in vitro overexpression of EndoA2 markedly inhibited UUO- or TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and tubular epithelial cells dedifferentiation. Furthermore, EndoA2 was co-immunoprecipitated with the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII), thus inhibiting the binding of the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI) to TβRII. These findings indicate that EndoA2 mitigates renal fibrosis, at least partially, via modulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling. Targeting EndoA2 may be a new potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of renal fibrosis."

Analogous comparisons of brand names using similarity in orthography (written forms with identical letters) were analyzed retrospectively. Tablets and capsules commercially available in Thailand and registered with the Bureau of Drug Administration, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 as ""dangerous drugs"" and ""specially controlled drugs"" for humans and animals were included in this study. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies and percentages, were used in this study. The analogous comparison of brand name orthography was scrutinized, and the results revealed 1,668 brand names, which were categorized into three genres as follows: 1) Single brand names from a single manufacturer having the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) with numerous registration numbers (1,049 names, 62.89% of the total similarity results) 2) Single brand names from different manufacturers having the same API and possessing several registration numbers (615 names, 36.87% of the total similarity results) 3) Single brand names from different manufacturers with diverse APIs (four brand names, 0.24% of the total similarity results). Analogous results revealed that numerous identical brand names could be derived from the same manufacturers, APIs, dosage strengths, or otherwise.

Moreover, larger teaching hospitals located in urban settings had higher COVID-19 mortality rates. Finally, counties with greater social vulnerability, specifically in terms of housing type and transportation, and those with high infection rates had the worst patient mortality rates.Higher staffing levels are associated with lower inpatient mortality rates for COVID-19 patients. More research is needed to determine appropriate staffing levels and how staffing levels interact with other factors such as teams, leadership, and culture to impact patient care during pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4306818214,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a reimagining of many aspects of higher education, including how instructors interact with their students and how they encourage student participation. Text-based chatting during synchronous remote instruction is a simple form of student-student and student-instructor interaction. The importance of student participation has been documented, as have clear disparities in participation between those well-represented and those under-represented in science disciplines. Thus, we conducted an investigation into who is texting, what students are texting, and how these texts align with course content. We focused on two sections of a large-enrollment, introductory biology class offered remotely during Fall 2020. Using an analysis of in-class chatting, in combination with student survey responses, we find that text-based chatting suggests not only a high level of student engagement, but a type of participation that is disproportionately favored by women. Given the multiple lines of evidence indicating that women typically under-participate in their science courses, any vehicle that counters this trend merits further exploration. We conclude with suggestions for further research, and ideas for carrying forward text-based chatting in the post-COVID-19, in-person classroom."
https://openalex.org/W4306818286,"We describe a new genus with a new species belonging to Araceae, from southern Ecuador. Vivaria calvasensis gen. et sp. nov. inhabits semi-arid inter- Andean mountains at altitudes ranging between 1100-1300 m a.s.l. The species belongs to the tribe Spathicarpae, which in Ecuador is represented by two other genera, Incarum and Croatellia, both typical for humid environments such as montane forests. This new genus is clearly supported by molecular evidence based on the matK gene, and morphological traits that separate it from the closely-related genera included in this tribe. The analyzed material was collected during several field campaigns carried out during four years in two populations from Loja province (Calvas and Macará), southern Ecuador, near the border with Peru."
https://openalex.org/W4306830717,"Mutualistic and commensal interactions can have significant positive impacts on animal fitness and survival. However, behavioural interactions between pelagic animals living in offshore oceanic environments are little studied. Parasites can negatively effect the fitness of their hosts by draining resources and diverting energy from growth, reproduction, and other bodily functions. Pelagic fishes are hosts to a diverse array of parasites, however their environment provides few options for removal. Here we provide records of scraping behaviour of several pelagic teleost species, a behaviour that is likely used for parasite removal. These records span three ocean basins and, to the best of our knowledge, include the first records of scraping interactions involving tunas, blue sharks, and mako sharks as well as the first records of intraspecific scraping. We found that scrapers preferred scraping their head, eyes, gill cover, and lateral surfaces, areas where parasites are commonly found and where damage would likely have a substantial impact on fitness. Scraper species varied in their scraping preferences with tunas scraping mostly on the posterior caudal margins of sharks and occasionally conspecifics, while rainbow runner scraped in more varied locations on both sharks and conspecifics. Lengths of scrapers and scrapees were positively correlated and fish scraping on sharks were larger than those scraping on conspecifics, suggesting that risk of predation may be a limiting factor. We show that pelagic teleosts prefer to scrape on sharks rather than conspecifics or other teleosts and suggest that this behaviour may have a positive impact on teleost fitness by reducing parasite loads. The decline of shark populations in the global ocean and the reduction in mean size of many species may limit these interactions, eroding possible fitness benefits associated with this behaviour, and consequently placing more pressure on already highly targeted and vulnerable species."
https://openalex.org/W4306831426,"Background Brazil occupies the fifth position in the ranking of the highest mortality rates due to RTI in the world. With the objective of promoting traffic safety and consequently reducing deaths, Brazil created the Life in Traffic Project (LTP). The main goal of LTP is reducing 50% of RTI deaths, by promoting interventions to tackle risk factors, such as driving under the influence of alcohol and excessive and/or inappropriate speed. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the magnitude of risky and protective factors for RTI in capitals participating in the LTP in Brazil. We estimated these factors according to sociodemographic (age group, sex, education, race and, type of road user). Methods A total of 5,922 car drivers and motorcyclists from 14 Brazilian capitals participating in the LTP were interviewed. Data collection was carried out in sobriety checkpoints at night and consisted of the administration of an interview and a breathalyzer test. Risky and protective behaviors associated with RTI were investigated. Covariates of the study were: age, sex, education, race and, type of road user. Poisson multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between variables of interest. Results The prevalence of individuals with positive blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 6.3% and who reported driving after drinking alcohol in the last 30 days was 9.1%. The others risky behaviors reported were: driving at excessive speed on roads of 50 km/h, using a cell phone for calls while driving, using a cell phone to send or read calls while driving, running a red light. Use of seatbelts and helmets showed prevalence above 96,0% Use of seatbelts showed prevalence of 98.6% among car drivers, and helmet use was described by 96.6% of motorcycle drivers. Most risky behaviors were more prevalent in younger age groups (except BAC measurement higher in older participants), in males (except for cell phone use), in participants with higher education level and without a driver’s license. Conclusion Excessive speed and driving under the influence of alcohol, defined as priorities within the LTP, need more consistent interventions, as they still have considerable prevalence in the cities investigated. The factors described such as cell phone usage and passing red traffic lights should also need to be prioritized as a focus on promoting traffic safety."
https://openalex.org/W4306831562,"Adequate infant nutrition is a critical cornerstone of population health, yet adherence to recommended breastfeeding practices is low in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. This study aims to describe local attitudes, experiences and beliefs related to nutrition in early infancy in Central Uganda.We conducted 5 focus group discussions and 12 key informant interviews to gather information on local attitudes, experiences and beliefs related to feeding in early infancy.Urban areas of Central Uganda.Parents and healthcare and public health professionals.Participants reported numerous concerns related to infant health including inadequate infant weight, premature birth, diarrhea, fever, gastrointestinal infection and malnutrition. Awareness of the infant health benefits of exclusive breastfeeding was prevalent but experienced as in balance with maternal factors that might lead to supplementation, including employment demands, physical appearance, pain, poverty and maternal health and malnutrition. Breastfeeding was highly valued, but use of unsafe breast milk supplements was common, including cow's milk, black tea, glucose water, fruit juice, millet, maize, rice, potatoes, soy, sorghum, egg yolk, fish and ghee. Expression of breast milk was viewed as not consonant with local culture.Participants were aware of the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding but described multiple barriers to achieving it. Supplementation with unsafe breastmilk supplements was considered to be more culturally consonant than milk expression and was reported to be the only affordable potential breast milk substitute for many families."

https://openalex.org/W4306832521,"Our eating behaviors are highly influenced by those of individuals surrounding us and the groups we belong to. The first goal of this experiment was to determine how social norms that encourage (pro-) vs. discourage (anti-) unhealthy eating influence people's intentions and motivations to eat unhealthily. Since these norms can be conveyed by one's group in a manner that either promotes group members' autonomy (i.e., collective autonomy support), or pressures them into eating certain foods (i.e., collective control), the experiment also tests which of these types of messages promotes the highest conformity to group norms. Hence, the second goal of this experiment was to investigate this synergetic effect of pro- vs anti-unhealthy eating norms and of collective autonomy support vs. collective control on participants' unhealthy eating intentions and their motivations for unhealthy eating. An experimental study (N = 341) using a 2 (eating norm: pro-unhealthy eating norm vs. anti-unhealthy eating norm) x 3 (type of group support: collective autonomy support vs. collective control vs. no support) design was conducted. Results showed that pro-unhealthy eating norms increased participants' intentions to eat salty and fatty food, but also their amotivation (i.e., lack of motivation) for unhealthy eating relative to anti-unhealthy eating norms. In addition, when pro-unhealthy eating was encouraged in a controlling (vs. in an autonomy supportive) manner, participants reported higher intentions to eat tofu tacos. Finally, when pro-unhealthy eating was promoted by supporting group members' autonomy, participants reported higher integrated regulation, i.e., a highly internalized motivation, for unhealthy eating. These results demonstrate that eating norms do not impact all types of unhealthy food consumption in the same manner, and that collective control may be motivating in uncertain contexts; furthermore, when individuals' autonomy is supported and promoted by other group members, they are more susceptible to integrate unhealthy eating in their life."
https://openalex.org/W4306833884,"Multiple models exist for the evaluation of human motor performance; some of these rely on the Index of Difficulty (ID), a measure to evaluate the difficulty associated to simple reaching tasks. Despite the numerous applications of the ID in reaching movements, the existing formulations are functions of the geometrical features of the task and do not consider the motor behaviour of subjects performing repetitive movements in interaction with the environment. Variability of movements, length of trajectories, subject-specific strength and skill, and required interaction with the environment are all factors that contribute to the motor difficulty experienced by a moving agent (e.g., human, robot) as it repeatedly interacts with the environment during a given task (e.g., target-reaching movement, locomotion, etc.). A novel concept of motor difficulty experienced by an agent executing repetitive end-effector movements is presented in this study. A stochastic ID formulation is proposed that captures the abovementioned factors and applies to general three-dimensional motor tasks. Natural motor variability, inherent in the proposed model, is representative of the flexibility in motor synergies for a given agent-environment interaction: the smaller the flexibility, the greater the experienced difficulty throughout the movement. The quantification of experienced motor difficulty is demonstrated for the case of young healthy subjects performing three-dimensional arm movements during which different objects are manipulated. Results show that subjects’ experienced motor difficulty is influenced by the type of object. In particular, a difference in motor difficulty is observed when manipulating objects with different grasp types. The proposed model can be employed as a novel tool to evaluate the motor performance of agents involved in repetitive movements, such as in pick and place and manipulation, with application in both industrial and rehabilitation contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4306833954,"Pattern discovery and subspace clustering play a central role in the biological domain, supporting for instance putative regulatory module discovery from omics data for both descriptive and predictive ends. In the presence of target variables (e.g. phenotypes), regulatory patterns should further satisfy delineate discriminative power properties, well-established in the presence of categorical outcomes, yet largely disregarded for numerical outcomes, such as risk profiles and quantitative phenotypes. DISA (Discriminative and Informative Subspace Assessment), a Python software package, is proposed to evaluate patterns in the presence of numerical outcomes using well-established measures together with a novel principle able to statistically assess the correlation gain of the subspace against the overall space. Results confirm the possibility to soundly extend discriminative criteria towards numerical outcomes without the drawbacks well-associated with discretization procedures. Results from four case studies confirm the validity and relevance of the proposed methods, further unveiling critical directions for research on biotechnology and biomedicine.
