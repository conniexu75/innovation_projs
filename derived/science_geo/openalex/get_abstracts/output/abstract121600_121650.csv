https://openalex.org/W2030570585,"Exposure of mammalian cells to ultraviolet (UV) light or high osmolarity strongly activates the c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (JNK) cascade, causing induction of many target genes. Exposure to UV light or osmotic shock induced clustering and internalization of cell surface receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1 (IL-1). Activation of the EGF and TNF receptors was also detected biochemically. Whereas activation of each receptor alone resulted in modest activation of JNK, coadministration of EGF, IL-1, and TNF resulted in a strong synergistic response equal to that caused by exposure to osmotic shock or UV light. Inhibition of clustering or receptor down-regulation attenuated both the osmotic shock and UV responses. Physical stresses may perturb the cell surface or alter receptor conformation, thereby subverting signaling pathways normally used by growth factors and cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2153303237,"Here it is reported that the incidence of mutators among isolates of pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica is high (over 1 percent). These findings counter the theory, founded on studies with laboratory-attenuated strains, that suggests mutators are rare among bacterial populations. Defects in methyl-directed mismatch repair underlie all mutator phenotypes described here. Of nine independently derived hypermutable strains, seven contained a defective mutS allele. Because these mutant alleles increase the mutation rate and enhance recombination among diverse species, these studies may help explain both the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance and the penetrance of virulence genes within the prokaryotic community."
https://openalex.org/W1999893655,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, affecting approximately 1 percent of the population over age 50. Recent studies have confirmed significant familial aggregation of PD and a large number of large multicase families have been documented. Genetic markers on chromosome 4q21-q23 were found to be linked to the PD phenotype in a large kindred with autosomal dominant PD, with a Zmax = 6.00 for marker D4S2380. This finding will facilitate identification of the gene and research on the pathogenesis of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2027360957,"Leptin mediates its effects on food intake through the hypothalamic form of its receptor OB-R. Variants of OB-R are found in other tissues, but their function is unknown. Here, an OB-R variant was found in human hepatic cells. Exposure of these cells to leptin, at concentrations comparable with those present in obese individuals, caused attenuation of several insulin-induced activities, including tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), association of the adapter molecule growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 with IRS-1, and down-regulation of gluconeogenesis. In contrast, leptin increased the activity of IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These in vitro studies raise the possibility that leptin modulates insulin activities in obese individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2156567033,"On the basis of synchronization of three carbon-14 (14C)-dated lacustrine sequences from Sweden with tree ring and ice core records, the absolute age of the Younger Dryas-Preboreal climatic shift was determined to be 11,450 to 11,390 +/- 80 years before the present. A 150-year-long cooling in the early Preboreal, associated with rising Delta14C values, is evident in all records and indicates an ocean ventilation change. This cooling is similar to earlier deglacial coolings, and box-model calculations suggest that they all may have been the result of increased freshwater forcing that inhibited the strength of the North Atlantic heat conveyor, although the Younger Dryas may have begun as an anomalous meltwater event."
https://openalex.org/W2064502505,"The microscopic mechanism of the matching effect in a superconductor, which manifested itself as the production of peaks or cusps in the critical current at specific values of the applied magnetic field, was investigated with Lorentz microscopy to allow direct observation of the behavior of vortices in a niobium thin film having a regular array of artificial defects. Vortices were observed to form regular and consequently rigid lattices at the matching magnetic field, at its multiples, and at its fractions. The dynamic observation furthermore revealed that vortices were most difficult to move at the matching field, whereas excess vortices moved easily."
https://openalex.org/W2048743675,"The glutamatergic neuromuscular synapse in Drosophila forms and differentiates into distinct boutons in the embryo and grows by sprouting new boutons throughout larval life. We demonstrate that two axons form ∼18 boutons on muscles 7 and 6 by hatching and grow to ∼180 boutons by third instar. We further show that, after synapse formation, the homophilic cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (Fas II) is localized both pre- and postsynaptically where it controls synapse stabilization. In FasII null mutants, synapse formation is normal, but boutons then retract during larval development. Synapse elimination and resulting lethality are rescued by transgenes that drive Fas II expression both pre- and postsynaptically; driving Fas II expression on either side alone is insufficient. Fas II can also control synaptic growth; various FasII alleles lead to either an increase or decrease in sprouting, depending upon the level of Fas II."
https://openalex.org/W2048772732,"Olfactory neurons transduce the binding of odorants into membrane depolarization. Two intracellular messengers, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), are thought to mediate this process, with cAMP generating responses to some odorants and IP3 mediating responses to others. cAMP causes membrane depolarization by activating a cation-selective cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channel. We created a mutant “knockout” mouse lacking functional olfactory CNG channels to assess the roles of different second messenger pathways in olfactory transduction. Using an electrophysiological assay, we find that excitatory responses to both cAMP- and IP3-producing odorants are undetectable in knockout mice. Our results provide direct evidence that the CNG channel subserves excitatory olfactory signal transduction, and further suggest that cAMP is the sole second messenger mediating this process."
https://openalex.org/W2025142458,"In vertebrate visual and olfactory systems, a cyclic nucleotide–gated channel couples receptor activation to electrical activity of the sensory neurons. The Caenorhabditis elegans tax-2 gene is required for some forms of olfaction, for chemosensation of salts, and for thermosensation. We show here that tax-2 encodes a predicted subunit of a cyclic nucleotide–gated channel that is expressed in olfactory, gustatory, and thermosensory neurons, implicating this channel in multiple sensory modalities. Some sensory neurons display axon outgrowth defects in tax-2 mutants. Thus, the channel has an unexpected role in sensory neuron development in addition to its role in sensation. Consistent with this proposed dual function, a Tax-2::GFP fusion protein is present both in sensory cilia and in sensory axons."
https://openalex.org/W2153954651,"Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene discs-large (dlg) lead to postsynaptic structural defects. Here, we report that mutations in dlg also result in larger synaptic currents at fly neuromuscular junctions. By selectively targeting DLG protein to either muscles or motorneurons using Gal-4 enhancer trap lines, we were able to rescue substantially the reduced postsynaptic structure in mutants. Rescue of the physiological defect was accomplished by presynaptic, but not postsynaptic targeting, consistent with our finding that miniature excitatory junctional currents were not changed in dlg mutants. These results suggest that DLG functions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic structure. We propose that DLG is an integral part of a mechanism by which changes in both neurotransmitter release and synapse structure are accomplished during development and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1997955557,"Increased neuronal activity (eag Shaker mutants) and cAMP concentration (dunce mutants) lead to increased synaptic structure and function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Here, we show that the increase in synaptic growth is accompanied by an approximately 50% decrease in synaptic levels of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (Fas II). This decrease in Fas II is both necessary and sufficient for presynaptic sprouting; FasII mutants that decrease Fas II levels by approximately 50% lead to sprouting similar to eag Shaker and dunce, while transgenes that maintain synaptic Fas II levels suppress sprouting in eag Shaker and dunce. However, FasII mutants that cause a 50% increase in bouton number do not alter synaptic strength; rather, evoked release from single boutons has a reduced quantal content, suggesting that the wild-type amount of release machinery is distributed throughout more boutons."
https://openalex.org/W2015651475,"N-type Ca2+ channels bind directly to the synaptic core complex of VAMP/synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25. Peptides containing the synaptic protein interaction (“synprint”) site caused dissociation of N-type Ca2+ channels from the synaptic core complex. Introduction of synprint peptides into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons reversibly inhibited synaptic transmission. Fast EPSPs due to synchronous transmitter release were inhibited, while late EPSPs arising from asynchronous release following a train of action potentials were increased and paired-pulse facilitation was increased. The corresponding peptides from L-type Ca2+ channels had no effect, and the N-type peptides had no effect on Ca2+ currents through N-type Ca2+ channels. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that binding of the synaptic core complex to presynaptic N-type Ca2+ channels is required for Ca2+ influx to elicit rapid, synchronous neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2047528119,"Formation of the C. elegans dauer larva is repressed by the chemosensory neurons ADF, ASI, and ASG. Mutant analysis has defined two parallel genetic pathways that control dauer formation. By killing neurons in these mutants, we show that mutations in one of these genetic pathways disrupt dauer repression by ADF, ASI, and ASG. One gene in this pathway is daf-7, which encodes a TGFβ-related protein. We find that daf-7::GFP fusions are expressed specifically in ASI and that expression is regulated by dauer-inducing sensory stimuli. We also show that a different chemosensory neuron, ASJ, functions in parallel to these neurons to induce dauer formation. Mutations in the second genetic pathway activate dauer formation in an ASJ-dependent manner. Thus, the genetic redundancy in this process is reflected at the neuronal level."
https://openalex.org/W1982515699,"Entry into anaphase and proteolysis of B-type cyclins depend on a complex containing the tetratricopeptide repeat proteins Cdc16p, Cdc23p, and Cdc27p. This particle, called the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome, functions as a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase. Two additional subunits of the budding yeast APC were identified: The largest subunit, encoded by the APC1 gene, is conserved between fungi and vertebrates and shows similarity to BIMEp from Aspergillus nidulans. A small heat-inducible subunit is encoded by the CDC26 gene. The yeast APC is a 36S particle that contains at least seven different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2029561250,"Dynamic regulation of ion channel interactions with the cytoskeleton mediates aspects of synaptic plasticity, yet mechanisms for this process are largely unknown. Here, we report that two inwardly rectifying K+ channels, Kir 2.1 and 2.3, bind to PSD-95, a cytoskeletal protein of postsynaptic densities that clusters NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent K+ channels. Kir 2.3 colocalizes with PSD-95 in neuronal populations in forebrain, and a PSD-95/Kir 2.3 complex occurs in hippocampus. Within the C-terminal tail of Kir 2.3, a serine residue critical for interaction with PSD-95, is also a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). Stimulation of PKA in intact cells causes rapid dissociation of the channel from PSD-95. This work identifies a physiological mechanism for regulating ion channel interactions with the postsynaptic density."
https://openalex.org/W2084552689,"Esherichia coli microcin B17 is a posttranslationally modified peptide that inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase. It contains four oxazole and four thiazole rings and is representative of a broad class of pharmaceutically important natural products with five-membered heterocycles derived from peptide precursors. An in vitro assay was developed to detect heterocycle formation, and an enzyme complex, microcin B17 synthase, was purified and found to contain three proteins, McbB, McbC, and McbD, that convert 14 residues into the eight mono- and bisheterocyclic moieties in vitro that confer antibiotic activity on mature microcin B17. These enzymatic reactions alter the peptide backbone connectivity. The propeptide region of premicrocin is the major recognition determinant for binding and downstream heterocycle formation by microcin B17 synthase. A general pathway for the enzymatic biosynthesis of these heterocycles is formulated."
https://openalex.org/W2056422983,"Increased cAMP (in dunce mutants) leads to an increase in the structure and function of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Synaptic Fasciclin II (Fas II) controls this structural plasticity, but does not alter synaptic function. Here, we show that CREB, the cAMP response element-binding protein, acts in parallel with Fas II to cause an increase in synaptic strength. Expression of the CREB repressor (dCREB2-b) in the dunce mutant blocks functional but not structural plasticity. Expression of the CREB activator (dCREB2-a) increases synaptic strength only in FasII mutants that increase bouton number. This CREB-mediated increase in synaptic strength is due to increased presynaptic transmitter release. Expression of dCREB2-a in a FasII mutant background genetically reconstitutes this cAMP-dependent plasticity. Thus, cAMP initiates parallel changes in CREB and Fas II to achieve long-term synaptic enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2081841874,"Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) is known to facilitate synaptic transmission. Using synapses established by hippocampal neurons in culture, we show that dialysis of PKA inhibitors in the presynaptic neuron blocks synaptic facilitation produced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, demonstrating a presynaptic locus of action. Using ruthenium red, a tool that is known to stimulate exocytosis independently of Ca2+ influx, but in a manner sensitive to tetanus toxin, we find that the secretory process is directly up-regulated under conditions where the number of functional terminals remains unchanged, as revealed by imaging of FM1-43, a vital indicator of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Taken together with our ultrastructural analysis that suggests no enhancement of docking, our data indicate that PKA causes synaptic facilitation by directly elevating the probability of exocytosis of individual vesicles in response to an invariant Ca2+ signal."
https://openalex.org/W2064637546,"The performance of amorphous organic photorefractive (PR) materials in applications such as optical data storage is generally limited by the concentration of active molecules (chromophores) that can be incorporated into the host without forming a crystalline material with poor optical quality. In polymeric PR systems described previously, performance has been limited by the necessity of devoting a large fraction of the material to inert polymer and plasticizing components in order to ensure compositional stability. A new class of organic PR materials composed of multifunctional glass-forming organic chromophores is described that have long-term stability and greatly improved PR properties."
https://openalex.org/W2027401480,"The initiation of anaphase and exit from mitosis require the activation of a proteolytic system that ubiquitinates and degrades cyclin B. The regulated component of this system is a large ubiquitin ligase complex, termed the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome. Purified Xenopus laevis APC was found to be composed of eight major subunits, at least four of which became phosphorylated in mitosis. In addition to CDC27, CDC16, and CDC23, APC contained a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans BIME, a protein essential for anaphase. Because mutation of bimE can bypass the interphase arrest induced by either nimA mutation or unreplicated DNA, it appears that ubiquitination catalyzed by APC may also negatively regulate entry into mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2134143263,"Recent work suggests a discernible human influence on climate. This finding is supported, with less restrictive assumptions than those used in earlier studies, by a 1961 through 1995 data set of radiosonde observations and by ensembles of coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations forced with changes in greenhouse gases, tropospheric sulfate aerosols, and stratospheric ozone. On balance, agreement between the simulations and observations is best for a combination of greenhouse gas, aerosol, and ozone forcing. The uncertainties remaining are due to imperfect knowledge of radiative forcing, natural climate variability, and errors in observations and model response."
https://openalex.org/W2018264391,"We used FM1-43 imaging and intracellular recordings of synaptic potentials to measure the time course of endocytosis in frog motor nerve terminals following tetanic nerve stimulation, and we used fura-2 imaging of intraterminal Ca2+ concentration to compare endocytic rate and [Ca2+]i. Following a 30 Hz tetanus, endocytosis declined exponentially with a time constant that depended on the duration of stimulation. The level of [Ca2+]i rose from a resting value of about 100 nM to more than 500 nM during 30 Hz stimulation, and rapidly declined to 200–250 nM after stimulation. [Ca2+]i returned to resting level with a time course that, like endocytosis, depended on the duration of tetanic stimulation. However, the rate of [Ca2+]i recovery was much slower than the rate of endocytosis, leading to the conclusion that endocytic rate is not determined solely by the instantaneous level of [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1966294098,"We have shown previously that the inactivation of the zinc finger gene Krox-20 affects hindbrain segmentation, resulting in the elimination of rhombomeres 3 and 5. We demonstrate here that Krox-20 homozygous mutant mice exhibit abnormally slow respiratory and jaw opening rhythms, indicating that a modification of hindbrain segmentation influences the function of neuronal networks after birth. Central neuronal networks that control respiratory frequency are made predominantly depressant by the elimination of a previously undescribed rhythm-promoting system. Recordings of rhythmic activity from the isolated hindbrain following progressive tissue transections indicate that the reorganization takes place in the caudal pontine reticular formation. The newborn (P0) Krox-20−/− mice, in which apneas are ten times longer than in wild-type animals, may be a valuable model for the study of life-threatening apneas during early infancy."
https://openalex.org/W2052599076,"Global Seismic Network data were used to image upper-mantle seismic discontinuities. Stacks of phases that precede the PP phase, thought to be underside reflections from the upper-mantle discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660 kilometers, show that the reflection from 410 kilometers is present, but the reflection from 660 kilometers is not observed. A continuous Lame's constant lambda and seismic parameter at the 660-kilometer discontinuity explain the missing underside P reflections and lead to a P-wave velocity jump of only 2 percent, whereas the S-wave velocity and density remain unchanged with respect to previous global models. The model deemphasizes the role of Lame's constant lambda with regard to the shear modulus and constrains the mineralogical composition across the discontinuity."
https://openalex.org/W2114347193,"We describe the extent to which presynaptic structures at the embryonic neuromuscular junction of Drosophila can form in mutants where development of postsynaptic somatic muscles is affected. Although twist mutant embryos lack mesoderm, motor axons still grow out of the CNS and form morphologically normal presynaptic active zones, independent of their target cells. In myoblast city mutant embryos, myoblasts do not fuse but form fully differentiated mononucleate muscles, which make functional neuromuscular synapses with correctly localized presynaptic active zones. Myoblasts also fail to fuse but still attract appropriate innervation in mef2 mutant embryos. However, these myoblasts fail to differentiate into muscles and presynaptic active zones fail to localize at neuromuscular contacts. Thus, the process of synapse formation can be genetically separated from the process of target recognition, revealing that localization of presynaptic active zones requires mef2-dependent muscle differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2063568457,"An approach is described to monitor directly at the level of individual residues the formation of structure during protein folding. A two-dimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum was recorded after the rapid initiation of the refolding of a protein labeled with nitrogen-15. The intensities and line shapes of the cross peaks in the spectrum reflected the kinetic time course of the folding events that occurred during the spectral accumulation. The method was used to demonstrate the cooperative nature of the acquisition of the native main chain fold of apo bovine α-lactalbumin. The general approach, however, should be applicable to the investigation of a wide range of chemical reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2085960960,"Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous birds from northeastern China, including many complete skeletons of Confuciusornis, provide evidence for a fundamental dichotomy in the class Aves that may antedate the temporal occurrence of the Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx. The abundance of Confuciusornis may provide evidence of avian social behavior. Jurassic skeletal remains of an ornithurine bird lend further support to the idea of an early separation of the line that gave rise to modern birds. Chaoyangia, an ornithurine bird from the Early Cretaceous of China, has premaxillary teeth."
https://openalex.org/W1992134937,"An evolutionary change in development was studied in two closely related ascidian species, one exhibiting a conventional tadpole larva and the other a modified tailless larva. Interspecific hybridization restores chordate features to the tailless larva. The zinc finger gene Manx is expressed in cells that generate chordate features in the tailed species but is down-regulated in the tailless species. Manx expression is restored in hybrid embryos. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment inhibited Manx expression and chordate features in hybrid embryos, which suggests that Manx is required for development of the chordate larval phenotype in ascidians."

Because of ubiquitous xenocrystic contamination, the data do not form isochrons but plot in wedge-shaped regions on an argon isotopic diagram. The upper boundary of the region is an isochron matching the 14C-derived age of the eruption. Such contamination-related patterns may be common in dating young materials by the single-crystal method. Argon dating by this method can help refine the time scale of physical and biological evolution over the past 100,000 years."
https://openalex.org/W1973746992,Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) and microscopy demonstrate that the ∼1400°C oxidation of levitated droplets of a natural Fe2+-bearing aluminosilicate (basalt) melt occurs by chemical diffusion of Fe2+ and Ca2+ to the free surface of the droplet; internal oxidation of the melt results from the required counterflux of electron holes. Diffusion of an oxygen species is not required. Oxidation causes the droplets to go subsolidus; magnetite (Fe3O4) forms at the oxidation-solidification front with a morphology suggestive of a Liesegang-band nucleation process.

https://openalex.org/W1986600731,"Although nitric oxide (NO) is produced by discrete groups of neurons in the brain, participation of NO in premotor structures directly involved in reflexively evoked, sensory-motor functions has not been demonstrated so far. We now show that NO is a physiological mediator in the generation of a specific motor response in alert behaving animals. In the oculomotor system, numerous neurons expressing nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are located in the prepositus hypoglossi, a nucleus involved in the control of horizontal eye movements. Unilateral inhibition of NOS within this nucleus results in severe ocular nystagmus with slow phases directed to the contralateral side. Accordingly, local increases of NO or cyclic GMP produced a nystagmus in the opposite direction. It is concluded that a balanced production of NO by prepositus hypoglossi neurons is a necessary condition for the normal performance of eye movements in alert animals."

https://openalex.org/W2042115587,"To understand better how synaptic signaling contributes to network activity, we analyzed the potential contribution of putative unitary postsynaptic currents (PSCs) to locomotor-related information received by spinal interneurons in neonatal rats. The average cyclic modulation of the whole-cell current in 13 neurons was quantified as the difference between the current integral (charge) during the first and second halves of the cyclic locomotor network output. Between 7.6 and 303 average unitary PSCs per second were needed to produce the cyclic modulation. This number is so low that very few (1–5) of the synapses contributing to the cyclic information need to be active simultaneously. This suggests that individual presynaptic cells in a central locomotor network can have a powerful influence on other neurons."
