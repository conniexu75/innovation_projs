https://openalex.org/W2569995699,"Next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the detection of rare genetic or somatic mutations and contributed to our understanding of disease progression and evolution. However, many next-generation sequencing technologies first rely on DNA amplification, via the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), as part of sample preparation workflows. Mistakes made during PCR appear in sequencing data and contribute to false mutations that can ultimately confound genetic analysis. In this report, a single-molecule sequencing assay was used to comprehensively catalog the different types of errors introduced during PCR, including polymerase misincorporation, structure-induced template-switching, PCR-mediated recombination and DNA damage. In addition to well-characterized polymerase base substitution errors, other sources of error were found to be equally prevalent. PCR-mediated recombination by Taq polymerase was observed at the single-molecule level, and surprisingly found to occur as frequently as polymerase base substitution errors, suggesting it may be an underappreciated source of error for multiplex amplification reactions. Inverted repeat structural elements in lacZ caused polymerase template-switching between the top and bottom strands during replication and the frequency of these events were measured for different polymerases. For very accurate polymerases, DNA damage introduced during temperature cycling, and not polymerase base substitution errors, appeared to be the major contributor toward mutations occurring in amplification products. In total, we analyzed PCR products at the single-molecule level and present here a more complete picture of the types of mistakes that occur during DNA amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2569050105,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for hematological malignancies. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse after allo-HSCT remain major impediments to the success of allo-HSCT. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) direct tumor cell recognition of adoptively transferred T cells. CD19 is an attractive CAR target, which is expressed in most B cell malignancies, as well as in healthy B cells. Clinical trials using autologous CD19-targeted T cells have shown remarkable promise in various B cell malignancies. However, the use of allogeneic CAR T cells poses a concern in that it may increase risk of the occurrence of GVHD, although this has not been reported in selected patients infused with donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells after allo-HSCT. To understand the mechanism whereby allogeneic CD19 CAR T cells may mediate anti-lymphoma activity without causing a significant increase in the incidence of GVHD, we studied donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells in allo-HSCT and lymphoma models in mice. We demonstrate that alloreactive T cells expressing CD28-costimulated CD19 CARs experience enhanced stimulation, resulting in the progressive loss of both their effector function and proliferative potential, clonal deletion, and significantly decreased occurrence of GVHD. Concurrently, the other CAR T cells that were present in bulk donor T cell populations retained their anti-lymphoma activity in accordance with the requirement that both the T cell receptor (TCR) and CAR be engaged to accelerate T cell exhaustion. In contrast, first-generation and 4-1BB-costimulated CAR T cells increased the occurrence of GVHD. These findings could explain the reduced risk of GVHD occurring with cumulative TCR and CAR signaling."

Excavations conducted at Bluefish Caves (Yukon Territory) from 1977 to 1987 yielded a series of radiocarbon dates that led archaeologists to propose that the initial dispersal of human groups into Eastern Beringia (Alaska and the Yukon Territory) occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This hypothesis proved highly controversial in the absence of other sites of similar age and concerns about the stratigraphy and anthropogenic signature of the bone assemblages that yielded the dates. The weight of the available archaeological evidence suggests that the first peopling of North America occurred ca. 14,000 cal BP (calibrated years Before Present), i.e., well after the LGM. Here, we report new AMS radiocarbon dates obtained on cut-marked bone samples identified during a comprehensive taphonomic analysis of the Bluefish Caves fauna. Our results demonstrate that humans occupied the site as early as 24,000 cal BP (19,650 ± 130 14C BP). In addition to proving that Bluefish Caves is the oldest known archaeological site in North America, the results offer archaeological support for the “Beringian standstill hypothesis”, which proposes that a genetically isolated human population persisted in Beringia during the LGM and dispersed from there to North and South America during the post-LGM period."
https://openalex.org/W2569369624,"Heritable thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), including Marfan syndrome (MFS), currently lack a cure, and causative mutations have been identified for only a fraction of affected families. Here we identify the metalloproteinase ADAMTS1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) as therapeutic targets in individuals with TAAD. We show that Adamts1 is a major mediator of vascular homeostasis, given that genetic haploinsufficiency of Adamts1 in mice causes TAAD similar to MFS. Aortic nitric oxide and Nos2 levels were higher in Adamts1-deficient mice and in a mouse model of MFS (hereafter referred to as MFS mice), and Nos2 inactivation protected both types of mice from aortic pathology. Pharmacological inhibition of Nos2 rapidly reversed aortic dilation and medial degeneration in young Adamts1-deficient mice and in young or old MFS mice. Patients with MFS showed elevated NOS2 and decreased ADAMTS1 protein levels in the aorta. These findings uncover a possible causative role for the ADAMTS1-NOS2 axis in human TAAD and warrant evaluation of NOS2 inhibitors for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2570782440,"Vision influences behavior, but ongoing behavior also modulates vision in animals ranging from insects to primates. The function and biophysical mechanisms of most such modulations remain unresolved. Here, we combine behavioral genetics, electrophysiology, and high-speed videography to advance a function for behavioral modulations of visual processing in Drosophila. We argue that a set of motion-sensitive visual neurons regulate gaze-stabilizing head movements. We describe how, during flight turns, Drosophila perform a set of head movements that require silencing their gaze-stability reflexes along the primary rotation axis of the turn. Consistent with this behavioral requirement, we find pervasive motor-related inputs to the visual neurons, which quantitatively silence their predicted visual responses to rotations around the relevant axis while preserving sensitivity around other axes. This work proposes a function for a behavioral modulation of visual processing and illustrates how the brain can remove one sensory signal from a circuit carrying multiple related signals."
https://openalex.org/W2570448273,"Episodic memory formation depends on information about a stimulus being integrated within a precise spatial and temporal context, a process dependent on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Investigations of putative functional interactions between these regions are complicated by multiple direct and indirect hippocampal-prefrontal connections. Here application of a pharmacogenetic deactivation technique enabled us to investigate the mnemonic contributions of two direct hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathways, one arising in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and the other in the intermediate CA1 (iCA1). While deactivation of either pathway impaired episodic memory, the resulting pattern of mnemonic deficits was different: deactivation of the dCA1→mPFC pathway selectively disrupted temporal order judgments while iCA1→mPFC pathway deactivation disrupted spatial memory. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected division of function among CA1 neurons that project directly to the mPFC. Such subnetworks may enable the distinctiveness of contextual information to be maintained in an episodic memory circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2571305783,"Chromosomal translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with various partner genes result in aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Despite similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. Pharmacologically inhibiting this pathway substantially delays progression, and it improves survival of murine leukemia through stabilizing wild-type MLL protein, which displaces the MLL chimera from some of its target genes and, therefore, relieves the cellular oncogenic addiction to MLL chimeras. Stabilization of MLL provides us with a paradigm in the development of therapies for aggressive MLL leukemia and perhaps for other cancers caused by translocations."
https://openalex.org/W2570064302,"Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived protein abundant in the circulation, is thought to be protective against atherosclerosis. However, it is not fully understood how the association of adiponectin with vascular cells and its antiatherogenic effect are connected. In this study, T-cadherin was essential for accumulation of adiponectin in the neointima and atherosclerotic plaque lesions, and the adiponectin–T-cadherin association protected against vascular injury. In the apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-KO) mice, adiponectin and T-cadherin colocalized on en-dothelial cells and synthetic smooth muscle cells in the aortic intima. Notably, aortic adiponectin protein disappeared in T-cadherin/ApoE double-knockout (Tcad/ApoE-DKO) mice with significant elevation of blood adiponectin concentration. Furthermore, in Tcad/ApoE-DKO mice, carotid artery ligation resulted in a significant increase of neointimal thickness compared with ApoE-KO mice. Finally, on a high-cholesterol diet, Tcad/ApoE-DKO mice increased atherosclerotic plaque formation, despite a 5-fold increase in plasma adiponectin level compared with that in ApoE-KO mice. In vitro, knockdown of T-cadherin from human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) with synthetic phenotype significantly reduced adiponectin accumulation on HASMCs and negated the inhibitory effect of adiponectin on proinflammatory change. Collective evidence showed that adiponectin accumulates in the vasculature via T-cadherin, and the adiponectin–T-cadherin association plays a protective role against neointimal and atheroscle-rotic plaque formations. —Fujishima, Y., Maeda, N., Matsuda, K., Masuda, S., Mori, T., Fukuda, S., Sekimoto, R., Yamaoka, M., Obata, Y., Kita, S., Nishizawa, H., Funahashi, T., Ranscht, B., Shimomura, I.

https://openalex.org/W2571085227,"Background There are currently two tests for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); TST and IGRA. However, it is still unclear that which one of these tests performs better in high TB-burden settings. Methods 1511 household contacts of pulmonary TB patients were enrolled to compare the performance of TST and IGRA for LTBI. At baseline all participant underwent testing for IGRA [QuantiFERON-TB® Gold In-tube (QFT-GIT) assay] and TST [2 tuberculin unit (TU), purified protein derivative (PPD), RT23, Staten Serum Institute (SSI), Copenhagen, Denmark]. All the household contacts were followed-up for two years for incident TB cases. Results Active TB was diagnosed in 76 household contacts at an incidence rate of 2.14 per 1000 person-years. Both, TST [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72–1.79, p = 0.57], as well as QFT-GIT assay (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 0.97–2.84, p = 0.06) results at baseline were not significantly associated with subsequent development of active TB among household contacts of pulmonary TB patients. Conclusion Neither TST nor IGRA predicted subsequent development of active TB among household contacts of pulmonary TB patients during follow-up. However, keeping in view the cost, and other logistics, TST remains the most preferred method for LTBI diagnosis in resource-limited, high TB-burden settings."
https://openalex.org/W2569828495,"Stroke is one of the most common and resource intensive diseases for society. Stroke in the working age population is increasing in different parts of the world. An incomplete return to work (RTW) after sick leave post stroke entails negative consequences for the affected person and an economical burden for society. The aim of this study was to explore the RTW rate and factors associated with RTW in a six-year follow up post stroke.Data from 174 persons 63 years or younger, with first ever stroke in 2009-2010 in Gothenburg were analyzed. Baseline characteristics were collected through medical records and the Swedish Health Insurance Office provided information on sick leave up to 6 years post stroke. Time-to-event was presented and cox regression as well as logistic regression were used to analyze risk factors for no-RTW.The RTW rate was 74.7%, at the end of follow up. Participants continued to RTW until just over 3 years post stroke. Dependency at discharge (in the modified Rankin Scale) and sick leave prior to the stroke were significant risk factors for no-RTW after 1 year with odds ratio 4.595 and 3.585, respectively. The same factors were significant in time-to-event within six years post stroke with hazard ratio 2.651 and 1.929, respectively.RTW after a stroke is incomplete, however RTW is possible over a longer period of time than previously thought. More severe disability at discharge from hospital and sick leave prior to the stroke were shown to be risk factors for no-RTW. This knowledge can contribute to more individualized vocational rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2571249160,"Hippocampal network activity is generated by a complex interplay between excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. Although much is known about the molecular properties of excitatory synapses on pyramidal cells, comparatively little is known about excitatory synapses on interneurons. Here we show that conditional deletion of the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 in parvalbumin interneurons causes a decrease in NMDA-receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents and an increase in presynaptic glutamate release probability by selectively impairing the inhibition of glutamate release by presynaptic Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors. As a result, the neuroligin-3 deletion altered network activity by reducing gamma oscillations and sharp wave ripples, changes associated with a decrease in extinction of contextual fear memories. These results demonstrate that neuroligin-3 specifies the properties of excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-containing interneurons by a retrograde trans-synaptic mechanism and suggest a molecular pathway whereby neuroligin-3 mutations contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2570858328,"A circadian clock governs most aspects of mammalian behavior. Although its properties are in part genetically determined, altered light-dark environment can change circadian period length through a mechanism requiring de novo DNA methylation. We show here that this mechanism is mediated not via cell-autonomous clock properties, but rather through altered networking within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the circadian ""master clock,"" which is DNA methylated in region-specific manner. DNA methylation is necessary to temporally reorganize circadian phasing among SCN neurons, which in turn changes the period length of the network as a whole. Interruption of neural communication by inhibiting neuronal firing or by physical cutting suppresses both SCN reorganization and period changes. Mathematical modeling suggests, and experiments confirm, that this SCN reorganization depends upon GABAergic signaling. Our results therefore show that basic circadian clock properties are governed by dynamic interactions among SCN neurons, with neuroadaptations in network function driven by the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2570987314,"Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and Circulating Tumor Microemboli (CTM) are Circulating Rare Cells (CRC) which herald tumor invasion and are expected to provide an opportunity to improve the management of cancer patients. An unsolved technical issue in the CTC field is how to obtain highly sensitive and unbiased collection of these fragile and heterogeneous cells, in both live and fixed form, for their molecular study when they are extremely rare, particularly at the beginning of the invasion process. We report on a new protocol to enrich from blood live CTC using ISET® (Isolation by SizE of Tumor/Trophoblastic Cells), an open system originally developed for marker-independent isolation of fixed tumor cells. We have assessed the impact of our new enrichment method on live tumor cells antigen expression, cytoskeleton structure, cell viability and ability to expand in culture. We have also explored the ISET® in vitro performance to collect intact fixed and live cancer cells by using spiking analyses with extremely low number of fluorescent cultured cells. We describe results consistently showing the feasibility of isolating fixed and live tumor cells with a Lower Limit of Detection (LLOD) of one cancer cell per 10 mL of blood and a sensitivity at LLOD ranging from 83 to 100%. This very high sensitivity threshold can be maintained when plasma is collected before tumor cells isolation. Finally, we have performed a comparative next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of tumor cells before and after isolation from blood and culture. We established the feasibility of NGS analysis of single live and fixed tumor cells enriched from blood by our system. This study provides new protocols for detection and characterization of CTC collected from blood at the very early steps of tumor invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1830411167,"Cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, is important for cardiovascular health, and perturbation of CL metabolism is implicated in cardiovascular disease. Although the role of CL in mitochondrial function, biogenesis, and genome stability has been studied, recent findings indicate that it is essential for functions apart from mitochondrial bioenergetics. In this study, we report that mitophagy is perturbed in CL-deficient yeast cells. Mutants of autophagy/mitophagy genes ATG8, ATG18, and ATG32 synthetically interact with CL synthase mutant crd1Δ. CL-deficient cells exhibited decreased GFP-tagged mitochondrial proteins inside the vacuole and decreased free GFP, consistent with decreased mitophagy. Both PKC and high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathways were shown previously to be required for mitophagy. Activation of both MAPKs was defective in CL-deficient cells. Deletion of HOG pathway genes SHO1, SSK1, STE50, and HOG1 exacerbated crd1Δ growth. 1 m sorbitol and 0.2 m NaCl, which induce the HOG pathway, rescued growth of the mutant. Activation of the MAPK Slt2p was defective in crd1Δ cells, and up-regulation of the PKC pathway by expression of the PKC1R398P gene, which encodes constitutively activated Pkc1p, rescued crd1Δ growth and mitophagy defects. These findings indicate that loss of CL impairs MAPK pathway activation, and decreased activation of the PKC pathway leads to defective mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2532691207,"Introduction The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is abundantly expressed in the ileum, where it exerts an enteroprotective role as a key regulator of intestinal innate immunity and homeostasis, as shown in pre-clinical models of inflammatory bowel disease. Since intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is characterized by hyperpermeability, bacterial translocation and inflammation, we aimed to investigate, for the first time, if the FXR-agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) could attenuate intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury. Material and Methods In a validated rat model of intestinal IRI (laparotomy + temporary mesenteric artery clamping), 3 conditions were tested (n = 16/group): laparotomy only (sham group); ischemia 60min+ reperfusion 60min + vehicle pretreatment (IR group); ischemia 60min + reperfusion 60min + OCA pretreatment (IR+OCA group). Vehicle or OCA (INT-747, 2*30mg/kg) was administered by gavage 24h and 4h prior to IRI. The following end-points were analyzed: 7-day survival; biomarkers of enterocyte viability (L-lactate, I-FABP); histology (morphologic injury to villi/crypts and villus length); intestinal permeability (Ussing chamber); endotoxin translocation (Lipopolysaccharide assay); cytokines (IL-6, IL-1-β, TNFα, IFN-γ IL-10, IL-13); apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3); and autophagy (LC3, p62). Results It was found that intestinal IRI was associated with high mortality (90%); loss of intestinal integrity (structurally and functionally); increased endotoxin translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production; and inhibition of autophagy. Conversely, OCA-pretreatment improved 7-day survival up to 50% which was associated with prevention of epithelial injury, preserved intestinal architecture and permeability. Additionally, FXR-agonism led to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release and alleviated autophagy inhibition. Conclusion Pretreatment with OCA, an FXR-agonist, improves survival in a rodent model of intestinal IRI, preserves the gut barrier function and suppresses inflammation. These results turn FXR into a promising target for various conditions associated with intestinal ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2568679089,"A large body of research shows that the Central Nervous System (CNS) integrates multisensory information. However, this strategy should only apply to multisensory signals that have a common cause; independent signals should be segregated. Causal Inference (CI) models account for this notion. Surprisingly, previous findings suggested that visual and inertial cues on heading of self-motion are integrated regardless of discrepancy. We hypothesized that CI does occur, but that characteristics of the motion profiles affect multisensory processing. Participants estimated heading of visual-inertial motion stimuli with several different motion profiles and a range of intersensory discrepancies. The results support the hypothesis that judgments of signal causality are included in the heading estimation process. Moreover, the data suggest a decreasing tolerance for discrepancies and an increasing reliance on visual cues for longer duration motions."
https://openalex.org/W2568917699,"ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice is an experimental model mouse for nocturia (NOC). Using the bladder mucosa obtained from ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice, we investigated the gene expression rhythms of mechanosensory cation channels such as transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) and Piezo1, and main ATP release pathways including vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) and Connexin26(Cx26), in addition to clock genes.Eight- to twelve-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (WT) and age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice, which were bred under 12-h light/dark conditions for 2 weeks, were used. Gene expression rhythms and transcriptional regulation mechanisms in clock genes, mechanosensor, Cx26 and VNUT were measured in the mouse bladder mucosa, collected every 4 hours from WT and ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice using quantitative RT-PCR, a Western blot analysis, and ChIP assays.WT mice showed circadian rhythms in clock genes as well as mechanosensor, Cx26 and VNUT. Their expression was low during the sleep phase. The results of ChIP assays showed Clock protein binding to the promotor regions and the transcriptional regulation of mechanosensor, Cx26 and VNUT. In contrast, all of these circadian expressions were disrupted in ClockΔ19/Δ19 mice. The gene expression of mechanosensor, Cx26 and VNUT was maintained at a higher level in spite of the sleep phase.Mechanosensor, Cx26 and VNUT expressed with circadian rhythm in the mouse bladder mucosa. The disruption of circadian rhythms in these genes, induced by the abnormalities in clock genes, may be factors contributing to NOC because of hypersensitivity to bladder wall extension."
https://openalex.org/W2570333629,"New methods to manipulate gene and cell state can be used to engineer cell functionality, simplify quality assessment, and enhance manufacturability. These strategies could help overcome unresolved cell therapy manufacturing challenges and complement frameworks to design quality into these complex cellular systems, ultimately increasing patient access to living therapeutics. New methods to manipulate gene and cell state can be used to engineer cell functionality, simplify quality assessment, and enhance manufacturability. These strategies could help overcome unresolved cell therapy manufacturing challenges and complement frameworks to design quality into these complex cellular systems, ultimately increasing patient access to living therapeutics. Cell therapies, in which patients are treated with living cells, are being developed to cure a wide range of devastating diseases. Treating patients with living cells whose functionality is determined by cellular properties sensitive to small environmental changes poses significant challenges for manufacturing these complex cell therapy products (CTPs). We recently discussed how the quality by design (QbD) framework could be applied to mitigate risk in the development of manufacturing solutions for CTPs (Lipsitz et al., 2016Lipsitz Y.Y. Timmins N.E. Zandstra P.W. Quality cell therapy manufacturing by design.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This framework can guide CTP manufacturing process development by increasing our understanding of the attributes critical for assuring product quality and safety and by identifying and controlling the sources of variability in those attributes. However, CTPs pose product and process development barriers that remain challenging, even in the face of rigorous implementation frameworks. These include ensuring robust product functionality, quantitative and rapid cell characterization, and cost-effective manufacturability. Typically, the main criteria for identifying and developing prospective CTPs has been phenotypic alignment with clinically relevant in vivo counterparts combined with simple and reliable access to the desired cells or some ability to grow or process the cells ex vivo. This bottom-up approach does not typically enable intentional targeting of specific unmet clinical needs, but rather encourages testing of readily available cells in a variety of potential clinical applications. Our field has spent too much time and effort looking for clinical applications for cells we happen to be able to grow. A top-down approach to defining desired product profiles (functionality, identity and purity, and manufacturability) required to treat a specific indication, and to implementing technologies to generate these a priori designed CTPs, should accelerate CTP impact and efficacy (Figure 1). The target product profile, a tool endorsed by the pharmaceutical industry and the US FDA for 10 years (see Web Resources), continues to be a strategic development tool for structuring process development. Although originally intended for pharmaceutical development, this tool should also serve as the basis for the design of high-quality, manufacturable synthetic CTPs. Protein manufacturers have engineered producer cell lines and proteins for enhanced protein yields by including switching mechanisms controlling key genes, adapting cells to minimal growth factor requirements, and engineering proteins for simplified downstream processing (Figure 2). In cell therapy, few of these solutions have been conceptually adapted, likely due to a lack of understanding of the fundamental biology governing behavior of therapeutic cells together with concern about the creation of “artificial” cells that do not fit current regulatory frameworks. In biopharma, cell engineering is at least one step removed from the product, as the engineered cell produces the therapeutic protein. However, in cell therapy, the engineered cell itself will directly interact with a patient, justifying additional safety considerations. Recent developments and clinical successes in cell engineering motivate re-examining this paradigm to accelerate CTP development. Herein we discuss progress, opportunities, and regulatory perspectives related to engineering new cell types with user-defined properties for enhanced therapeutic functionality, simplified quality assessment, and enhanced manufacturability. CTPs are most often designed for “homologous” use, to fulfill a similar function to what they do in vivo. Adding or enhancing the natural functionality of CTPs has emerged as an exciting opportunity to generate cells directed at an unmet clinical need. Recent clinical progress using chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) by several biotech companies including Kite Pharma, Novartis, and others highlights one example where engineering enhanced or novel functionality generates a CTP with intentionally designed function. Pioneering work in this area demonstrated that T cells can be engineered to express custom-designed receptors for targeted destruction of B cell cancers in relapsed, chemorefractory patients. Since that time, synthetic biology techniques have been employed to produce a wealth of next-generation CAR-Ts: co-stimulatory domains enhance the T cell signaling response to cancerous cells; combinatorial antigen recognition can generate more-tumor-selective cells; and drug-inducible on-off switches control the activity and growth of CAR-Ts (June et al., 2015June C.H. Riddell S.R. Schumacher T.N. Adoptive cellular therapy: a race to the finish line.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 280ps7Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Another CTP, mesenchymal stromal cells, whose immunomodulatory properties are under investigation for a wide range of conditions, have recently been engineered to enhance specific functionalities such as homing. Engineered cellular functionality can be built upon the properties of the starting cell type. Red blood cells are emerging as an effective substrate for building new functionality into cells since they can be engineered to express specific genes and persist in vivo, and as an enucleated cell type, their safety profile is less affected by integration of genes of interest (Shi et al., 2014Shi J. Kundrat L. Pishesha N. Bilate A. Theile C. Maruyama T. Dougan S.K. Ploegh H.L. Lodish H.F. Engineered red blood cells as carriers for systemic delivery of a wide array of functional probes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 10131-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Rubius Therapeutics and Kanyos Bio have begun to launch a red blood cell-based platform for metabolic, autoimmune, and oncology applications. enGene has taken a similarly inventive approach to type 1 diabetes therapy. By engineering the gut’s glucose-responsive K-cells to secrete insulin in addition to their normal hormone secretion, insulin can be produced in a cell type not targeted by the underlying pathology of this autoimmune disease (Cheung et al., 2000Cheung A.T. Dayanandan B. Lewis J.T. Korbutt G.S. Rajotte R.V. Bryer-Ash M. Boylan M.O. Wolfe M.M. Kieffer T.J. Glucose-dependent insulin release from genetically engineered K cells.Science. 2000; 290: 1959-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). One might even contemplate the full engineering of the insulin sensor-response system in otherwise naive cells. Creative selection of a starting cell type for modification can simplify or enhance the reverse engineering of unique functionality into a CTP. When using CTPs to treat disease, it is important to ensure that transplanted cells are resistant to the original disease, especially when the cause of the original disease is unknown or may be systemic. For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia are characterized by buildup of expanded repeat RNA transcripts in neurons and glia, which leads to neurodegeneration through a variety of possible mechanisms. It may therefore be beneficial to knock down SUPT4H1, which controls transcription of these repeats, in an engineered neural CTP to prevent disease recurrence in transplanted cells after delivering the therapy (Kramer et al., 2016Kramer N.J. Carlomagno Y. Zhang Y.-J. Almeida S. Cook C.N. Gendron T.F. Prudencio M. Van Blitterswijk M. Belzil V. Couthouis J. et al.Spt4 selectively regulates the expression of C9orf72 sense and antisense mutant transcripts.Science. 2016; 353: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). While the long-term safety and durability of response of such functionality-enhanced CTPs remains to be demonstrated, the wealth of possible engineering strategies promises innovative approaches to synthetic cell therapies. Cell engineering should also be implemented to simplify the complex characterization required to assess and ensure CTP safety and efficacy (collectively referred to as “quality”). Multiple analytic techniques are currently used to measure cellular identity, purity, and potency. However, synthetic biology tools offer the possibility of both measuring and controlling multiple cell state-determining factors simultaneously. “Classifier” systems have been described that can integrate measurements of multiple cellular factors to determine the current cell state and follow a preprogrammed action. These systems have enormous potential to simplify assessment of attributes indicative of cell quality because multiple, tunable inputs provide a reliable assessment of current state for which the synthetic network can respond with an appropriate, precise output. For example, fluorescent reporter outputs or readily measurable protein or metabolite secretion could give real-time tracking of cell state (identity), apoptosis switches could eliminate undesirable cell types (purity) (e.g., Xie et al., 2011Xie Z. Wroblewska L. Prochazka L. Weiss R. Benenson Y. Multi-input RNAi-based logic circuit for identification of specific cancer cells.Science. 2011; 333: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and synthetic lineage control networks could ensure functionality of differentiating cells (potency) (e.g., Saxena et al., 2016Saxena P. Heng B.C. Bai P. Folcher M. Zulewski H. Fussenegger M. A programmable synthetic lineage-control network that differentiates human IPSCs into glucose-sensitive insulin-secreting beta-like cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11247Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Early applications of this strategy in preclinical CTP development have demonstrated identification and purification of PSC-derived cardiomyocytes by miRNA expression (Miki et al., 2015Miki K. Endo K. Takahashi S. Funakoshi S. Takei I. Katayama S. Toyoda T. Kotaka M. Takaki T. Umeda M. et al.Efficient detection and purification of cell populations using synthetic microRNA switches.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Differentiated cell quality can also be enhanced by using synthetic biology approaches that bypass the complexity and variability in reagent activity inherent in cytokine-based directed differentiation. For example, by directly triggering Ngn3, Pdx1, and MafA in a controlled and predictable fashion, synthetic signaling cascades can generate functional insulin-secreting islet cells from a progenitor population (Saxena et al., 2016Saxena P.

Commun. 2016; 7: 11247Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Before designing synthetic networks, gene regulatory networks that govern a given fate will need to be better understood, including sources of perturbation of these networks. Advanced system understanding is the underlying concept behind QbD-based manufacturing; hence, progress toward synthetic biology-based quality assessment tools will inherently enhance the quality of the CTP. Cell engineering will complement QbD methods by generating reliable and timely readouts of the critical parameters which are correlated to cell quality. Quick access to cell-state sensors will accelerate the development of well-described design spaces quantifying the impact of varying systems parameters on product quality, thereby enabling a CTP manufacturer to adapt to changing conditions. Design space development of CTPs using statistical tools within the QbD framework based on the International Conference on Harmonization Guidance is described in Lipsitz et al., 2016Lipsitz Y.Y. Timmins N.E. Zandstra P.W. Quality cell therapy manufacturing by design.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar. In whatever way a synthetic cell is developed, its novel components must behave in a stable manner in vivo for decades of subsequent patient life. Strategies can incorporate elements to eliminate the system once the finished product has been produced or as a safety mechanism to eliminate the system should it stop functioning as planned. Although QbD methods can guide process designers through current manufacturing challenges, robustness, efficiency, and cost of manufacturing (“manufacturability”) of CTPs remains a key challenge (Lipsitz et al., 2016Lipsitz Y.Y. Timmins N.E. Zandstra P.W. Quality cell therapy manufacturing by design.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cell state and gene expression engineering tools can be used to create more manufacturable and therefore cost-effective products and should be incorporated into the QbD toolbox. For example, various gene and state manipulations can be implemented to enhance the efficiency with which the CTP can be produced. One emerging strategy to enhance manufacturability is to switch from patient-specific (autologous) CTPs to universal (allogeneic) products not requiring matching, making them amenable to the economic efficiencies inherent in large-scale manufacturing. Cellectis used TALEN technology to create a “universal donor” CAR-T by removing the cells’ αβ T cell receptor, thereby eliminating graft-versus-host reactions, in combination with incorporation of suicide switches and other edited elements. Similar strategies are employed by Universal Cells to engineer HLA expression to generate universal donor cell lines that can be used for many CTPs (June et al., 2015June C.H. Riddell S.R. Schumacher T.N. Adoptive cellular therapy: a race to the finish line.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 280ps7Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Analogous to selection of high-producing clones for antibody production, PSCs can and should be selected for high clonal survival and robust expansion. Aside from selecting clones, cell state conversion can be used to generate “high-producing” cells. Converting PSCs to states with faster growth rates, low intercellular adhesion, or independence from costly growth factors can result in a cell type with potentially high manufacturability. One such conversion is the generation of a developmentally earlier “naive” PSC state in which cells have preferential expansion properties: higher single cell cloning efficiency and faster growth rates, among other desirable properties (Hackett and Surani, 2014Hackett J.A. Surani M.A. Regulatory principles of pluripotency: from the ground state up.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 416-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our ability to balance efficient cell growth with efficient directed differentiation will be advanced by developing switching technologies to control key genes responsible for maintaining versus exiting different pluripotent states. In many differentiation schemes, PSC-derived cells are the only robust and reliable cell source. Cardiomyocytes, for example, do not divide in culture and typically can be generated only through a step-wise differentiation process. Recently, the cardiac progenitor state was stabilized with exogenous myc expression to create an artificial cell type that can be expanded in culture and differentiated directly to functional cardiomyocytes in a single step (Birket et al., 2015Birket M.J. Ribeiro M.C. Verkerk A.O. Ward D. Leitoguinho A.R. den Hartogh S.C. Orlova V.V. Devalla H.D. Schwach V. Bellin M. et al.Expansion and patterning of cardiovascular progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Strategies to bypass long and costly differentiations from the PSC state may prove to be valuable for other cell types depending on the trade off between stability, robustness, and proximity to the target cell type of both the artificial state and the PSC state. Designing a CTP using these or other artificial cell states could yield a therapy that is more cost effective due to improved suspension manufacturability. Adding a cell engineering step to a manufacturing process increases the amount of data and information that is required to support a national regulatory authority (NRA) submission for clinical trial and market authorization. The key requirement from NRAs is a demonstration that the overall risk profile of the product is acceptable (albeit based on legislation and regulation that differs in each jurisdiction). Health Canada, for example, has the authority under the Food and Drugs Act & Regulations to determine whether cell therapy clinical trials have an acceptable risk benefit profile, remain in the best interests of the subject, and are likely to achieve the objectives of the trial, while the onus remains on the sponsor (i.e., CTP manufacturer) to decide how to manufacture cells (see Web Resources). There is no law or regulation in Canada that prohibits manufacturing steps that are intended to make a health product more manufacturable or marketable without contributing to product safety or efficacy. Furthermore, it remains possible under the Canadian regulatory framework to introduce such a manufacturing step even if it could detract from safety or efficacy provided that the overall benefits continue to outweigh the risks. Health Canada, like other NRAs, is not predisposed to reject a cell engineering step: a positive overall risk-to-benefit profile remains the threshold for authorization acceptability. As with other aspects of CTP regulatory approval, proof must be demonstrated that cell engineering maintains or shifts the risk-to-benefit profile toward a positive assessment. In addition, a regulatory submission is best supported by a clear rationale for each manufacturing step. Particularly when cells have been engineered for simplified assessment or enhancement of quality, the resulting engineered CTPs would by design have safer quality profiles than their originating cells. The overall risk-benefit balance would be shifted to favor the cell engineering process as a result. For example, basic apoptosis switches are being incorporated into CTPs progressing toward the clinic, with more advanced apoptosis switches under development (Xie et al., 2011Xie Z. Wroblewska L. Prochazka L. Weiss R. Benenson Y. Multi-input RNAi-based logic circuit for identification of specific cancer cells.Science. 2011; 333: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), thereby directly reducing the risk profile of the therapeutic. In these systems, the presence of a small molecule induces activation of an engineered caspase protein, triggering apoptosis of the transplanted cells. Internationally, a trend has emerged in which NRAs employ risk-based categorization of cell therapy products which discriminate between “minimally manipulated” and “substantially manipulated” CTPs. Frameworks for minimally manipulated CTPs typically require “registration” (i.e., attestation from the registrant or third-party certification) regarding adherence to minimal safe processing standards, which represents a low regulatory burden. In contrast, “substantially manipulated” CTPs are required to undergo full pre-market review and authorization before market access is granted. The US FDA has adopted a policy that exempts minimally manipulated cell therapy products that are re-administered to the patient during the “same surgical procedure” (see Web Resources) while the European Medicines Association has an analogous “hospital exemption” (see Web Resources). Both of these policies reflect a decision to reduce regulatory burdens provided that certain criteria are met. Japan has taken this risk-based approach further by categorizing outsourced cell therapy manufacturing into three categories based on risk level. Relative uncertainty in medium- and long-term effects of cell engineering can be expected to result in increased regulatory scrutiny as novel cell technologies emerge, but the risk level associated with these technologies can be expected to diminish to some extent as they become better characterized through pharmacology and toxicity studies as well as stability data. Notably, novel gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 and others which allow insertion into safe harbor sites and control of copy number may eventually require less stringent regulatory oversight than the viral random integration strategies to gene editing used previously. In spite of these regulatory hurdles, we are fortunate to build upon the safety characterization already performed for the first wave of engineered CTPs. These early forays into cell engineering are allowing NRAs to identify and distinguish between safety concerns inherent to the biology and those inherent to the novelty of the therapy. Time will tell whether our field manages to characterize and de-risk these approaches sufficiently for regulators to approve their use under less stringent hospital-based approval or registration frameworks. All therapeutics exist on a spectrum of complexity and “realness” (Figure 2). Drugs, antibodies, and proteins have all progressed from isolation of naturally occurring molecules to deliberate production of specific therapeutics to artificially engineering custom-designed functions. Similarly, cell therapies have begun the process of increasing in complexity from minimally manipulated therapies to those with engineered functionality and cell state. As artificial cell types move forward, we have the opportunity to simplify many of the challenges associated with their production by including enhancements and modifications aimed not only at improving cell functionality but also at solving difficult challenges inherent in cell therapy manufacturing. Early pioneers are starting to show that synthetic cells can be made to be better than naturally occurring cells, and have begun to answer regulators’ concerns regarding the safety of these approaches. Cell engineering strategies that support a strong QbD approach by facilitating assessment of the quality of cells would directly enhance product safety and efficacy. The QbD approach is one with which both regulators and big pharma are already experienced and comfortable—key stakeholders as CTPs enter the mainstream of drug development. These and related strategies to improve manufacturing consistency will require earlier resource investments, but may lead to reduced downstream efforts and increased probabilities of product success. “Frontloading” the burden of manufacturing to early process development can add value to a CTP, especially at academic institutions, where clinical translation is a challenge. By carefully characterizing and applying our toolbox of bioprocess-enhancing strategies, we will develop the next generation of CTPs whose manufacturability is less hampered by the complexities of cell therapy systems. Ultimately, enhancing functionality, quality, and manufacturability will make cell therapies more reliable and affordable, allowing greater patient access to these revolutionary therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2571393656,"Visualization of neurons is indispensable for the investigation of neuronal circuits in the central nervous system. Virus vectors have been widely used for labeling particular subsets of neurons, and the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector has gained popularity as a tool for gene transfer. Here, we developed a single AAV vector Tet-Off platform, AAV-SynTetOff, to improve the gene-transduction efficiency, specifically in neurons. The platform is composed of regulator and response elements in a single AAV genome. After infection of Neuro-2a cells with the AAV-SynTetOff vector, the transduction efficiency of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was increased by approximately 2- and 15-fold relative to the conventional AAV vector with the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or human synapsin I (SYN) promoter, respectively. We then injected the AAV vectors into the mouse neostriatum. GFP expression in the neostriatal neurons infected with the AAV-SynTetOff vector was approximately 40-times higher than that with the CMV or SYN promoter. By adding a membrane-targeting signal to GFP, the axon fibers of neostriatal neurons were clearly visualized. In contrast, by attaching somatodendritic membrane-targeting signals to GFP, axon fiber labeling was mostly suppressed. Furthermore, we prepared the AAV-SynTetOff vector, which simultaneously expressed somatodendritic membrane-targeted GFP and membrane-targeted red fluorescent protein (RFP). After injection of the vector into the neostriatum, the cell bodies and dendrites of neostriatal neurons were labeled with both GFP and RFP, whereas the axons in the projection sites were labeled only with RFP. Finally, we applied this vector to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-positive (VIP+) neocortical neurons, one of the subclasses of inhibitory neurons in the neocortex, in layer 2/3 of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. The results revealed the differential distribution of the somatodendritic and axonal structures at the population level. The AAV-SynTetOff vector developed in the present study exhibits strong fluorescence labeling and has promising applications in neuronal imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2571466614,"No studies have analysed the acute effects of the FIFA 11+ and Harmoknee warm-up programmes on major physical performance measures. The aim of this study was to analyse the acute (post-exercise) effects of the FIFA 11+, Harmoknee and dynamic warm-up routines on several physical performance measures in amateur football players. A randomized, crossover and counterbalanced study design was used to address the purpose of this study. A total of sixteen amateur football players completed the following protocols in a randomized order on separate days: a) FIFA 11+; b) Harmoknee; and c) dynamic warm-up (DWU). In each experimental session, 19 physical performance measures (joint range of motion, hamstring to quadriceps [H/Q] strength ratios, dynamic postural control, 10 and 20 m sprint times, jump height and reactive strength index) were assessed. Measures were compared via a magnitude-based inference analysis. The results of this study showed no main effects between paired comparisons (FIFA 11+ vs. DWU, Harmoknee vs. DWU and Harmoknee vs. FIFA 11+) for joint range of motions, dynamic postural control, H/Q ratios, jumping height and reactive strength index measures. However, significant main effects (likely effects with a probability of >75–99%) were found for 10 (1.7%) and 20 (2.4%) m sprint times, demonstrating that both the FIFA 11+ and Harmoknee resulted in slower sprint times in comparison with the DWU. Therefore, neither the FIFA 11+ nor the Harmoknee routines appear to be preferable to dynamic warm-up routines currently performed by most football players prior to training sessions and matches."
https://openalex.org/W2568172488,"Background and Methodology There is a continuing need to express new insect control compounds in transgenic maize against western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (LeConte) (WCR). In this study three experiments were conducted to determine cross-resistance between the new insecticidal DvSnf7 dsRNA, and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry3Bb1; used to control WCR since 2003, with field-evolved resistance being reported. Laboratory susceptible and Cry3Bb1-resistant WCR were evaluated against DvSnf7 dsRNA in larval diet-incorporation bioassays. Additionally, the susceptibility of seven field and one field-derived WCR populations to DvSnf7 (and Cry3Bb1) was assessed in larval diet-overlay bioassays. Finally, beetle emergence of laboratory susceptible and Cry3Bb1-resistant WCR was evaluated with maize plants in the greenhouse expressing Cry3Bb1, Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1, or DvSnf7 dsRNA singly, or in combination. Principal Findings and Conclusions The Cry3Bb1-resistant colony had slight but significantly (2.7-fold; P<0.05) decreased susceptibility to DvSnf7 compared to the susceptible colony, but when repeated using a field-derived WCR population selected for reduced Cry3Bb1 susceptibility, there was no significant difference (P<0.05) in DvSnf7 susceptibility compared to that same susceptible population. Additionally, this 2.7-fold difference in susceptibility falls within the range of DvSnf7 susceptibility among the seven field populations tested. Additionally, there was no correlation between susceptibility to DvSnf7 and Cry3Bb1 for all populations evaluated. In greenhouse studies, there were no significant differences (P<0.05) between beetle emergence of susceptible and Cry3Bb1-resistant colonies on DvSnf7 and Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1, and between DvSnf7 and MON 87411 (DvSnf7 + Cry3Bb1) for the Cry3Bb1-resistant colony. These results demonstrate no cross-resistance between DvSnf7 and Cry3Bb1 against WCR. Therefore, pyramiding DvSnf7 with Bt proteins such as Cry3Bb1 and Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 will provide a valuable IRM tool against WCR that will increase the durability of these Bt proteins. These results also illustrate the importance of using appropriate bioassay methods when characterizing field-evolved resistant WCR populations."
https://openalex.org/W2570428832,"Recurrent lung infections and pneumonia are emerging as significant comorbidities in the HIV-infected population in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV infection has been reported to suppress nasal mucociliary clearance (MCC). Since the primary components driving nasal MCC and bronchial MCC are identical, it is possible that bronchial MCC is affected as well. Effective MCC requires optimal ciliary beating which depends on the maintenance of the airway surface liquid (ASL), a function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity and the integrity of the signaling mechanism that regulates ciliary beating and fluid secretion. Impairment of either component of the MCC apparatus can compromise its efficacy and promote microbial colonization. We demonstrate that primary bronchial epithelium expresses HIV receptor CD4 and co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and can be infected by both R5 and X4 tropic strains of HIV. We show that HIV Tat suppresses CFTR biogenesis and function in primary bronchial epithelial cells by a pathway involving TGF-β signaling. HIV infection also interferes with bronchial epithelial cell differentiation and suppresses ciliogenesis. These findings suggest that HIV infection suppresses tracheobronchial mucociliary clearance and this may predispose HIV-infected patients to recurrent lung infections, pneumonia and chronic bronchitis."
https://openalex.org/W2567985694,"Background Standard of care treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastasis consists of a cytotoxic chemotherapy in combination with a targeted agent. Clinical trials have guided the use of these combinatory therapies, but it remains unclear what the optimal combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy with a targeted agent are. Methods Using a genomic based approach, gene expression profiling was obtained from tumor samples of patient with colorectal cancer liver metastasis who received an oxaliplatin based therapy. Early passaged colorectal cancer liver metastasis cell lines and patient derived xenografts of colorectal cancer liver metastasis were then treated with oxaliplatin and a mTOR inhibitor. Results Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the mTOR pathway was activated in patients receiving oxaliplatin based therapy. Treatment of early passaged colorectal cancer lines and patient derived xenografts with oxaliplatin resulted in activation of the mTOR pathway. Combination therapy with oxaliplatin and a mTOR inhibitor resulted in a synergistic effect both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our findings suggest a genomic based approach can be used to identify optimal combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy with a targeted agent and that these observations can be validated both in vitro and in vivo using patient derived colorectal cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts prior to clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2568154558,"The flexible hydrophobic ligand binding pocket (LBP) of estrogen receptor α (ERα) allows the binding of a wide variety of endocrine disruptors. Upon ligand binding, the LBP reshapes around the contours of the ligand and stabilizes the complex by complementary hydrophobic interactions and specific hydrogen bonds with the ligand. Here we present a framework for quantitative analysis of the steric and electronic features of the human ERα-ligand complex using three dimensional (3D) protein-ligand interaction description combined with 3D-QSAR approach. An empirical hydrophobicity density field is applied to account for hydrophobic contacts of ligand within the LBP. The obtained 3D-QSAR model revealed that hydrophobic contacts primarily determine binding affinity and govern binding mode with hydrogen bonds. Several residues of the LBP appear to be quite flexible and adopt a spectrum of conformations in various ERα-ligand complexes, in particular His524. The 3D-QSAR was combined with molecular docking based on three receptor conformations to accommodate receptor flexibility. The model indicates that the dynamic character of the LBP allows accommodation and stable binding of structurally diverse ligands, and proper representation of the protein flexibility is critical for reasonable description of binding of the ligands. Our results provide a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of binding affinity and mode of ERα agonists and antagonists that may be applicable to other nuclear receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2571232914,"Deregulated expression of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GALNTs), which is responsible for the initial step of mucin-type O-glycosylation, could produce abnormal truncated O-glycans and thereby exert pivotal functions during malignant transformation. GALNT4 is one of the few isoforms preferring to catalyze partial GalNAc-glycosylated substrates and modify the sites not utilized by other known GALNTs. This study aims to evaluate the impact of GALNT4 expression on malignant transformation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization analysis were performed to assess GALNT4 and miR-9 level in clinical specimens, respectively. GALNT4 expression is markedly repressed in primary HCC tissues, and reduced expression of GALNT4 is significantly associated with adverse survival of patients with HCC. Functional investigations demonstrate that repressed GALNT4 could promote migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and stemness of HCC cells in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. The wild-type GALNT4 could modify O-linked glycosylation on EGFR and thus modulate the activity of EGFR. A luciferase activity assay further identified microRNA-9 (miR-9) as the crucial specific arbitrator for GALNT4 expression in HCC cells. Furthermore, restoring GALNT4 expression attenuates miR-9-mediated oncogenic functions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicates that the miR-9/GALNT4 expression signature yields promising prognostic significance to refine the risk stratification of patients with HCC. In conclusion, this study establishes the miR-9/GALNT4 axis as a potential adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic target for HCC patients."

Aims To analyze the impact of the COPD-Home IDM intervention on health related quality of life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the degree of patient activation during 24 months of follow-up and to assess the association between these outcomes. Methods A single center, prospective, open, controlled clinical study. Changes in The St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the Hospital anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) and the patient activation measure (PAM) scores were compared between the patients in the integrated care group (ICG) and the usual care group (UCG) 6, 12 and 24 months after enrolment. Results The questionnaire response rate was 80–96%. There were no statistically significant differences in the change of the SGRQ scores between the groups during follow up. After 12 months of follow-up there was a trend towards a reduction in the mean HADS–A score in the ICG compared to the UCG. The HADS-D scores remained stable in the ICG compared with an increasing trend in the UCG. Clinically significant difference in the PAM score was achieved only in the ICG, 6.7 (CI95% 0.7 to 7.5) compared to 3.6 (CI95% -1.4 to 8.6) in the UCG. In a logistic regression model a higher HADS-D score and current smoking significantly increased the odds for a low PAM score. Conclusion The COPD–Home IDM intervention did not result in any statistically significant changes in mean SGRQ, HADS-A, HADS- D or PAM scores during the 24 months of follow-up.

Lacrimal gland function has been shown to decrease with aging, a known potent risk factor for dry eye. We have previously found that orally administrated royal jelly (RJ) restored tear secretion in a rat model of dry eye.We examined the effects of RJ oral administration on dry eye in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Forty-three Japanese patients aged 20-60 years with subjective dry eye symptoms were randomized to an RJ group (1200 mg/tablet, six tablets daily) or a placebo group for 8 weeks. Keratoconjunctival epithelial damage, tear film break-up time, tear secretion volume, meibum grade, biochemical data, and subjective dry eye symptoms based on a questionnaire were investigated at baseline, and at 4 and 8 weeks after intervention. Adverse events were reported via medical interviews. In the RJ group, tear volume significantly increased after intervention (p = 0.0009). In particular, patients with a baseline Schirmer value of ≤10 mm showed a significant increase compared with baseline volume (p = 0.0005) and volume in the placebo group (p = 0.0051). No adverse events were reported. We also investigated the effect of RJ (300 mg/kg per day) administration using a mouse model of dry eye. Orally repeated administration of RJ preserved tear secretion, potentially through direct activation of the secretory function of the lacrimal glands.Our results suggest that RJ improves tear volume in patients with dry eye.Registered NO. the University Hospital Medical Information Network in Japan (UMIN000014446)."
https://openalex.org/W2570050431,"Study Objectives Sleep reduction after stroke is linked to poor recovery in patients. Conversely, a neuroprotective effect is observed in animals subjected to acute sleep deprivation (SD) before ischemia. This neuroprotection is associated with an increase of the sleep, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin/hypocretin (OX) systems. This study aims to 1) assess the relationship between sleep and recovery; 2) test the association between MCH and OX systems with the pathological mechanisms of stroke. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to four experimental groups: (i) SD_IS: SD performed before ischemia; (ii) IS: ischemia; (iii) SD_Sham: SD performed before sham surgery; (iv) Sham: sham surgery. EEG and EMG were recorded. The time-course of the MCH and OX gene expression was measured at 4, 12, 24 hours and 3, 4, 7 days following ischemic surgery by qRT-PCR. Results A reduction of infarct volume was observed in the SD_IS group, which correlated with an increase of REM sleep observed during the acute phase of stroke. Conversely, the IS group showed a reduction of REM sleep. Furthermore, ischemia induces an increase of MCH and OX systems during the acute phase of stroke, although, both systems were still increased for a long period of time only in the SD_IS group. Conclusions Our data indicates that REM sleep may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of SD pre-ischemia, and that both MCH and OX systems were increased during the acute phase of stroke. Future studies should assess the role of REM sleep as a prognostic marker, and test MCH and OXA agonists as new treatment options in the acute phase of stroke."

As part of the study to develop an effective mobile app to increase health screening uptake in men, we conducted a needs assessment to find out what do men want from a health screening mobile app. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 31 men from a banking institution in Kuala Lumpur. The participants were purposely sampled according to their job position, age, ethnicity and screening status. The recruitment was stopped once data saturation was achieved. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic approach. Three themes emerged from the analysis and they were: content, feature and dissemination. In terms of the content, men wanted the app to provide information regarding health screening and functions that can assess their health; which must be personalized to them and are trustable. The app must have user-friendly features in terms of information delivery, ease of use, attention allocation and social connectivity. For dissemination, men proposed that advertisements, recommendations by health professionals, providing incentive and integrating the app as into existing systems may help to increase the dissemination of the app. This study identified important factors that need to be considered when developing a mobile app to improve health screening uptake. Future studies on mobile app development should elicit users' preference and need in terms of its content, features and dissemination strategies to improve the acceptability and the chance of successful implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2569266581,"Introduction Sleep disturbance is very common in menopausal women and poor sleep quality has been linked to systemic inflammation. However, the impact of poor sleep quality on health outcomes of menopausal women remains unclear. This study evaluated the relationships between sleep quality and inflammation in menopausal women. Participants and design This cross-sectional study enrolled 281 healthy women aged 45 to 60 years. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure quality of sleep. Multiplex assays were used to measure the levels of 9 cytokines in morning fasting plasma samples. Other variables measured in this study included clinical characteristics and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Setting The study was performed at a medical center. Results The 281 participants comprised 79 (28%) perimenopausal women and 202 (72%) postmenopausal women. Global PSQI scores were positively correlated with plasma hs-CRP levels (P = 0.012) and were marginally associated with interferon gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP10), interleukin 6 (IL6), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1β) levels. After adjusting for age, body mass index, menopause duration, and follicle stimulating hormone, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that high PSQI scores and sleep efficiency < 65% were associated with elevated plasma levels of hs-CRP, IP10, and IL6. In addition, sleep duration < 5 hours was associated with high hs-CRP levels. Conclusion Our data show that poor sleep quality and low sleep efficiency are associated with elevated levels of circulating inflammatory factors IP10, IL6 and hs-CRP and that short sleep duration is associated with high levels of hs-CRP in menopausal women. These findings provide novel evidence that poor sleep quality is linked to low-grade systemic inflammation in menopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2570203573,"Over the last four decades the HIV pandemic and advances in medical treatments that also cause immunosuppression have produced an ever-growing cohort of individuals susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. Of these, AIDS patients are particularly vulnerable to infection by the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. Most commonly found in the environment in purine-rich bird guano, C. neoformans experiences a drastic change in nutrient availability during host infection, ultimately disseminating to colonize the purine-poor central nervous system. Investigating the consequences of this challenge, we have characterized C. neoformans GMP synthase, the second enzyme in the guanylate branch of de novo purine biosynthesis. We show that in the absence of GMP synthase, C. neoformans becomes a guanine auxotroph, the production of key virulence factors is compromised, and the ability to infect nematodes and mice is abolished. Activity assays performed using recombinant protein unveiled differences in substrate binding between the C. neoformans and human enzymes, with structural insights into these kinetic differences acquired via homology modeling. Collectively, these data highlight the potential of GMP synthase to be exploited in the development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of disseminated, life-threatening fungal infections.

Investigating the consequences of this challenge, we have characterized C. neoformans GMP synthase, the second enzyme in the guanylate branch of de novo purine biosynthesis. We show that in the absence of GMP synthase, C. neoformans becomes a guanine auxotroph, the production of key virulence factors is compromised, and the ability to infect nematodes and mice is abolished. Activity assays performed using recombinant protein unveiled differences in substrate binding between the C. neoformans and human enzymes, with structural insights into these kinetic differences acquired via homology modeling. Collectively, these data highlight the potential of GMP synthase to be exploited in the development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of disseminated, life-threatening fungal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2570774111,"The YAP and TAZ transcriptional coactivators promote oncogenic transformation. Elevated YAP/TAZ activity has been documented in human tumors. YAP and TAZ are negatively regulated by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. The activity and stability of several Hippo pathway components, including YAP/TAZ, is regulated by ubiquitin mediated protein turnover and several ubiquitin ligase complexes have been implicated in human cancer. However, little is known about the deubiquitylating enzymes that counteract these ubiquitin ligases in regulation of the Hippo pathway. Here we identify the DUB3 family deubiquitylating enzymes as regulators of Hippo pathway activity. We provide evidence that DUB3 proteins regulate YAP/TAZ activity by controlling the stability of the E3 ligase ITCH, the LATS kinases and the AMOT family proteins. As a novel Hippo pathway regulator, DUB3 has the potential to act a tumor suppressor by limiting YAP activity."

Bulk water monitoring and a KIWA monitor (with glass media) were used to offline monitor biofilm development on pipe wall surfaces. Results indicated that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and metal concentrations on coupons increased with time. However, bacterial diversities decreased. There was a positive correlation between increase of ATP and metal deposition on pipe surfaces of stainless steel and HDPE and no correlation was observed on concrete and glass surfaces. The shared bacterial diversity between bulk water and MRD was less than 20% and the diversity shared between the MRD and KIWA monitor was only 10%. The bacterial diversity on biofilm of plumbing material of MRD however, did not show a significant difference suggesting a lack of influence from plumbing material during early stage of biofilm development."
https://openalex.org/W2569598223,"Increasing evidence indicates that the white (w) gene in Drosophila possesses extra-retinal functions in addition to its classical role in eye pigmentation. We have previously shown that w+ promotes fast and consistent locomotor recovery from anoxia, but how w+ modulates locomotor recovery is largely unknown. Here we show that in the absence of w+, several PDE mutants, especially cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific PDE mutants, display wildtype-like fast locomotor recovery from anoxia, and that during the night time, locomotor recovery was light-sensitive in white-eyed mutant w1118, and light-insensitive in PDE mutants under w1118 background. Data indicate the involvement of cGMP in the modulation of recovery timing and presumably, light-evoked cGMP fluctuation is associated with light sensitivity of locomotor recovery. This was further supported by the observations that w-RNAi-induced delay of locomotor recovery was completely eliminated by upregulation of cGMP through multiple approaches, including PDE mutation, simultaneous overexpression of an atypical soluble guanylyl cyclase Gyc88E, or sildenafil feeding. Lastly, prolonged sildenafil feeding promoted fast locomotor recovery from anoxia in w1118. Taken together, these data suggest that a White-cGMP interaction modulates the timing of locomotor recovery from anoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2569994242,"Several plants, fungi, algae, and certain bacteria produce mannitol, a polyol derived from fructose. Mannitol has multiple industrial applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and medical industries, being mainly used as a non-metabolizable sweetener in foods. Many heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria synthesize mannitol when an alternative electron acceptor such as fructose is present in the medium. In previous work, we reported the ability of Lactobacillus reuteri CRL 1101 to efficiently produce mannitol from sugarcane molasses as carbon source at constant pH of 5.0; the activity of the enzyme mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (MDH) responsible for the fructose conversion into mannitol being highest during the log cell growth phase. Here, a detailed assessment of the MDH activity and relative expression of the mdh gene during the growth of L. reuteri CRL 1101 in the presence of fructose is presented. It was observed that MDH was markedly induced by the presence of fructose. A direct correlation between the maximum MDH enzyme activity and a high level of mdh transcript expression during the log-phase of cells grown in a fructose-containing chemically defined medium was detected. Furthermore, two proteomic approaches (2DE and shotgun proteomics) applied in this study confirmed the inducible expression of MDH in L. reuteri. A global study of the effect of fructose on activity, mdh gene, and protein expressions of MDH in L. reuteri is thus for the first time presented. This work represents a deep insight into the polyol formation by a Lactobacillus strain with biotechnological potential in the nutraceutics and pharmaceutical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2570088983,"Pneumococcus resists β-lactams by expressing variants of its target enzymes, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), with many amino acid substitutions. Up to 10% of the sequence can be modified. These altered PBPs have a much reduced reactivity with the drugs but retain their physiological activity of cross-linking the peptidoglycan, the major constituent of the bacterial cell wall. However, because β-lactams are chemical and structural mimics of the natural substrate, resistance mediated by altered PBPs raises the following paradox: how PBPs that react poorly with the drugs maintain a sufficient level of activity with the physiological substrate. This question is addressed for the first time in this study, which compares the peptidoglycan cross-linking activity of PBP2b from susceptible and resistant strains with their inhibition by different β-lactams. Unexpectedly, the enzymatic activity of the variants did not correlate with their antibiotic reactivity.

Unexpectedly, the enzymatic activity of the variants did not correlate with their antibiotic reactivity. This finding indicates that some of the numerous amino acid substitutions were selected to restore a viable level of enzymatic activity by a compensatory molecular mechanism. Penicillin and other β-lactams are arguably the most important drugs ever, having had a global impact on human health in seven decades of continuous use to fend off bacterial infection (1Kardos N. Demain A.L. Penicillin: the medicine with the greatest impact on therapeutic outcomes.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 92: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). β-Lactams hamper formation of the peptidoglycan, which is the main constituent of the bacterial cell wall. Peptidoglycan is a giant polymer encasing the cell and consists of chains of tandemly repeated disaccharides cross-linked by peptide bridges. This cross-linking results from a transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by enzymes that are inhibited by β-lactams, which are mimics of the donor dipeptide of the transpeptidation reaction. The enzymes responsible for the peptidoglycan assembly are called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). 2The abbreviations used are: PBPpenicillin-binding proteinMICminimal inhibitory concentrationPDBProtein Data Bank. They all have a penicillin-binding domain that generally catalyzes the transpeptidation but can also act as a carboxypeptidase or endopeptidase in some cases (2Sauvage E. Kerff F. Terrak M.

Some PBPs have an additional transglycosylase domain that catalyze the elongation of the glycan strands. The bifunctional transpeptidase and transglycosylase PBPs constitute the class A, whereas the monofunctional transpeptidase PBPs are of class B. penicillin-binding protein minimal inhibitory concentration Protein Data Bank. Resistance to antibiotics is recognized as a major threat to human health (3Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAntibiotic resistance threats in the United States, 2013. CDC, Atlanta, Georgia2015Google Scholar). Resistance to β-lactams, which are the most widely used antimicrobials, is particularly worrisome. A case in point is that of pneumococcus, a major human pathogen that causes otitis, pneumonia, and meningitis and that is estimated to cause over 1.5 million deaths per year (4World Health OrganizationPneumococcal vaccines.Weekly Epidemiol. Record. 2003; 78: 110-119Google Scholar). Pneumococcus and related oral streptococci resist β-lactams by expression of altered PBPs (5Zapun A. Contreras-Martel C. Vernet T. Penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactam resistance.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) encoded by mosaic genes that result from multiple events of homologous recombination with genes from close species combined with additional point mutations (6Hakenbeck R. Balmelle N. Weber B. Gardès C. Keck W. de Saizieu A. Mosaic genes and mosaic chromosomes: intra- and interspecies genomic variation of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism of β-lactam resistance operates in Neisseria species (7Zapun A. Morlot C. Taha M.K. Resistance to β-lactams in Neisseria ssp. due to chromosomally encoded penicillin-binding proteins.Antibiotics. 2016; 5: E35Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mosaic PBPs from resistant strains typically harbor tens of amino acid substitutions amounting to more than 10% of the primary sequence in some instances (5Zapun A. Contreras-Martel C. Vernet T. Penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactam resistance.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Of the six PBPs in Streptococcus pneumoniae, three are commonly altered in β-lactam resistant strains: the two monofunctional transpeptidase PBP2b and PBP2x and the bifunctional PBP1a (5Zapun A. Contreras-Martel C. Vernet T. Penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactam resistance.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for the diminution of the reactivity with the drugs have been investigated biochemically and structurally to various degrees for the three PBPs. For PBPs from a β-lactam-susceptible strain, the common source has been the laboratory strain R6, which has a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) below 0.016 μg/ml for penicillin and cefotaxime. The most thoroughly characterized PBPs from resistant pneumococcus are from the highly resistant strain 5204 isolated in France in 1999, with MICs of 6 μg/ml for penicillin and 12 μg/ml for cefotaxime (8Chesnel L. Carapito R. Croizé J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A.

Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The monofunctional transpeptidase PBP2x is the most studied of these PBPs. The role of important amino acid substitutions within the active site of PBP2x has been established by kinetics and structural studies. For example, a mutation two residues downstream of the active site serine found in highly resistant strains was shown to change the orientation of the hydroxyl group of the serine, thereby diminishing its reactivity with β-lactams (9Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croizé J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. The structural modifications induced by the M339F substitution in PBP2x from Streptococcus pneumoniae further decreases the susceptibility to β-lactams of resistant strains.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44448-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two other substitutions common in resistant strains were shown to destabilize the structure of a loop that lines the active site (10Carapito R. Chesnel L. Vernet T. Zapun A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 1771-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A comprehensive study of all the substitutions in the transpeptidase domain of PBP2x from the highly resistant strain 5204 determined that only 6 of the 41 substitutions are important for reducing the reactivity with β-lactams (10Carapito R. Chesnel L. Vernet T. Zapun A. Pneumococcal β-lactam resistance due to a conformational change in penicillin-binding protein 2x.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1771-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The other monofunctional class B PBP2b has not been as extensively studied, although the crystal structure has been solved for the variants from the susceptible laboratory strain R6 and the clinical resistant strain 5204 (11Contreras-Martel C. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Martins Ados S. Kotnik M. Dessen A. PBP active site flexibility as the key mechanism for β-lactam resistance in pneumococci.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Like in PBP2x, a loop forming one side or “lip” of the active site is flexible in the variant from the resistant strain. Sequence comparison identified the T446A substitution within the active site as critical for resistance, and an early biochemical study demonstrated that this mutation severely reduces the reactivity with β-lactams, although no reaction kinetics could be measured (12Pagliero E. Chesnel L. Hopkins J. Croizé J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M.

Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 1848-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Likewise, the crystal structure of the transpeptidase domain of the class A PBP1a was solved for the susceptible strain R6 and the resistant strain 5204 (13Contreras-Martel C. Job V. Di Guilmi A.M. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Dessen A. Crystal structure of penicillin-binding protein 1a (PBP1a) reveals a mutational hotspot implicated in β-lactam resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae.J. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4886-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A mutation adjacent to the active site serine was found to modify its orientation, and the loop forming a lip of the active site was destabilized as in PBP2x and PBP2b by a stretch of four substitutions (14Job V. Carapito R. Vernet T. Dessen A. Zapun A. Common alterations in PBP1a from resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae decrease its reactivity toward β-lactams: structural insights.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4886-4894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). β-Lactams owe their tremendous medical success to their structural likeness to the terminal dipeptide d-Ala–d-Ala of the donor stem peptide in the transpeptidation reaction (15Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Mechanism of action of penicillins: a proposal based on their structural similarity to acyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The carbonyl of the β-lactam ring that is attacked by the nucleophilic active site serine is analogous to the carbonyl of the peptide bond that links the two terminal d-alanine residues of the peptidoglycan stem peptide. Because of the similarity between the drugs and physiological substrate, we are facing the following paradox: PBP alterations that affect reaction with β-lactams, as briefly presented above, would be expected to impact negatively on their transpeptidase enzymatic function. To solve this paradox, compensatory mechanisms likely mitigate this problem. Compensation could take place at the cellular level to cope with the effectively reduced enzymatic activity of the PBPs in resistant strains. Alternatively, compensation could occur at the molecular level of the PBPs themselves if the consequences of some substitutions are different on the reactivity with the β-lactams and the transpeptidase activity. The two types of compensatory mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and could operate together. Investigating cellular mechanisms that could compensate for lower PBP activity is very difficult because the cascade of events that occur in the pneumococcus following β-lactam challenge remains largely mysterious (16Engel H. Mika M. Denapaite D. Hakenbeck R. Mühlemann K. Heller M. Hathaway L.J. Hilty M.

Demonstrating the existence of compensatory mechanism to maintain the enzymatic activity of mosaic PBPs of S. pneumoniae was not possible until recently because there was no assay to evaluate the transpeptidase activity in vitro. This hurdle was removed because the proper peptidoglycan precursor is now available. The nature of the stem pentapeptide of the membrane-linked precursor (lipid II) varies slightly in different bacterial species. In the pneumococcus, the second residue is a γ-d-iso-glutamine. The discovery of the amido transferase enzyme (MurT/GatD) that modifies the second residue γ-d-glutamate into γ-d-iso-glutamine (19Figueiredo T.A. Sobral R.G. Ludovice A.M. Almeida J.M. Bui N.K.

To investigate the paradox raised by PBP-based resistance and the structural similarity between β-lactams and the natural substrate of PBPs, we present here a comparison of four variants of PBP2b, (i) from the susceptible laboratory strain R6, (ii) from the clinical resistant strain 5204 (11Contreras-Martel C. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Martins Ados S. Kotnik M. Dessen A. PBP active site flexibility as the key mechanism for β-lactam resistance in pneumococci.J. Mol.

Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 1848-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), (iii) a hybrid form with the N terminus from strain 5204 and the C terminus of strain R6, and (iv) the T446A point mutant (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). 5204-PBP2b carries 56 substitutions, of which 43 are within the transpeptidase domain. Hybrid-PBP2b carries 28 substitutions, including 15 in the transpeptidase domain, and requires further presentation. The hybrid form was not designed but results from the transformation of the R6 strain with the pbp2b gene from strain 5204 and selection with piperacillin. S. pneumoniae is naturally competent and readily recombines foreign homologous DNA. An allele conferring a resistance can therefore easily be introduced and selected, provided that flanking regions are provided to allow recombination. With PBP2b, however, the whole gene could not be introduced because recombination repeatedly occurred within the coding region, resulting in a gene with the 5′-region from the resistant strain and the 3′-region retained from the susceptible strain (12Pagliero E. Chesnel L. Hopkins J. Croizé J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M.

Characterization of the resulting Hybrid-PBP2B might shed light on this incomplete incorporation of the 5204-pbp2b allele in the R6 strain. The T446A substitution, which is found in both 5204- and Hybrid-PBP2b, is the most commonly found in resistant strains and can confer some resistance alone (12Pagliero E. Chesnel L. Hopkins J.

The model was constructed by combining the X-ray structures of R6- and 5204-PBP2b (PDB entries 2WAF and 2WAD). The positions of the active site residues and substitutions are shown by spheres. The color scheme is as in Fig. 1. Therefore, the substitutions shown in blue are present in 5204-PBP2b and absent in Hybrid-PBP2b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the first time, both the in vitro transpeptidase activity and the reactivity with a panel of β-lactams were evaluated for a set of PBPs. We uncovered a new level of complexity because the impacts of substitutions on the transpeptidase activity and reactivity with β-lactams are not fully correlated, revealing that some substitutions have compensatory effects that restore enzymatic activity. We also discovered that variants of PBP2b can display β-lactamase activity that may contribute to the resistance to some β-lactams. To meaningfully compare their transpeptidase activity, it was necessary to use equivalent amounts of the PBP2b variants. Impurities from Triton X-100 and traces of oxidized DTT prevented the accurate determination of the concentrations of the detergent-solubilized full-length proteins from their UV absorbance. Instead, protein amounts were determined in-gel after electrophoresis by quantifying the fluorescence of Bocillin-labeled PBP2b. The truncated soluble forms of PBP2b were used as standards because their concentrations could be determined from their UV absorbance. Care was taken to use a concentration of Bocillin FL and reaction time sufficient to completely label even the variants with lowest β-lactam reactivity. That this was achieved was shown by the fact that the ratio of fluorescence to subsequent Coomassie-staining was similar for all proteins. Because Bocillin binding implies a functional active site, this observation suggests that the proportion of active enzyme was the same in all cases. Peptidoglycan assembly was monitored using the polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic assay used previously and presented by a scheme in Fig. 3 (21Zapun A. Philippe J. Abrahams K.A. Signor L. Roper D.I. Breukink E. Vernet T. In vitro reconstitution of peptidoglycan assembly from the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The lipid II peptidoglycan precursor migrates at the front, glycan chains of various length migrate as a smear within the gel, whereas high molecular mass cross-linked peptidoglycan, the product of transpeptidation, remains at the top of the gel. A small amount of dansylated precursor (10%) is incorporated to allow in-gel fluorescence imaging under UV transillumination. The amount of fluorescent precursor is kept to a minimum as it cannot function as acceptor in the transpeptidation because the dansyl group is attached to the lysine side chain that normally takes part in the reaction. PBP2b is a monofunctional transpeptidase that does not cross-link lipid II stem peptides but requires polymerized glycan chains as substrate. Therefore, the S370A-PBP1a point mutant, which is devoid of transpeptidase activity but retains a functional transglycosylase domain, was included to synthesize glycan chains from lipid II. The transpeptidase activity of the PBP2b variants was assessed by comparing the amount of fluorescence present at the top of the electrophoretic gel (Fig. 4). In the end point experiment shown in Fig. 4A, R6-PBP2b produced more cross-linked peptidoglycan after 16 h of reaction than Hybrid-PBP2b, followed by 5204- and T446A-PBP2b. The PBP2b variants were present in the same amount as checked by SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein mixtures after reaction with Bocillin and subsequent staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 4B). Note that S370A-PBP1a did not react with Bocillin, as expected from the absence of the active site serine. This crude assay does not measure the actual amount of peptide cross-links resulting from transpeptidation but only the overall amount of cross-linked peptidoglycan. Nevertheless, assuming a uniform density of cross-links and considering the amount of cross-linked peptidoglycan after 16 h of reaction, the relative activity of the PBP2b variants can be ranked as follows: R6 (100) > Hybrid (22 ± 3) > 5204 (11 ± 2) > T446A (9 ± 2). The numbers represent the amount of cross-linked peptidoglycan relative to that formed by R6-PBP2b. The error is the standard error to the mean of five independent experiments. Although the difference between the amount of cross-linked peptidoglycan produced by 5204- and T446A-PBP2b is small, the latter was smaller in all five experiments. A one-tailed paired t test of the data gave a p value of 0.035, indicating that the small difference is significant. A time course is shown in Fig. 4C. The transpeptidase activity of all PBP2b variants were inhibited with 1 mm penicillin G. The T446A mutant is the least active, despite having a single substitution that is also present in Hybrid- and 5204-PBP2b. This observation implies that some of the substitutions found in the latter sequences are compensatory and increase the transpeptidase activity that is severely impacted by the T446A mutation. Most interestingly, Hybrid-PBP2b, which is a laboratory selected chimeric sequence, has a better enzymatic activity than its parental clinical strain. It is easier to produce and manipulate soluble proteins than detergent-solubilized membrane proteins. Because we aimed to characterize the acylation of PBP2b by several β-lactams, it was highly desirable to use a truncated soluble form of the proteins in the absence of detergent. However, to ensure the relevance of such measurements, we first compared the reactivity of some detergent-solubilized full-length and soluble truncated PBP2bs with Bocillin FL monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). The reaction of PBPs with β-lactams can be described kinetically with the three-step model (23Ghuysen J.M. Frère J.M. Leyh-Bouille M. Nguyen-Distèche M. Coyette J. Active-site-serine d-alanyl-d-alanine-cleaving-peptidase-catalysed acyl-transfer reactions. Procedures for studying the penicillin-binding proteins of bacterial plasma membranes.Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Equation 1). A non-covalent complex PBP·βL is formed between the enzyme and the inhibitor (βL), with the dissociation constant KD, from which acylation proceeds to form the covalent complex PBP-βL with the rate k2. PBP-βL is finally hydrolyzed with the rate k3 to regenerate the enzyme and an inactivated product P. The rate described by k3 is usually negligible on the time scale of a bacterial generation. The second order rate constant k2/KD is the efficiency of acylation, which allows calculation of the overall acylation rate at a given concentration of antibiotic. Note that the inhibitory potency of a particular β-lactam for a PBP is given by the c50, which is the antibiotic concentration resulting in the inhibition of half the PBP molecules at steady state (i.e. when the acylation and deacylation reactions proceed at the same rate). The value of c50 is equal to the ratio k3/(k2/KD). PBP+βL⇄KD−1PBP·βL→k2PBP-βL→k3PBP+P(Eq. 1) Purified recombinant PBP2b variants were incubated with various concentration of Bocillin FL (a fluorescently labeled penicillin V) in large excess. After various time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of a denaturing solution (0.2% SDS final) and heating at 100 °C. Samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which allowed the separation of PBP2b-bound Bocillin from the free form (Fig. 5A). We checked that the inactivation procedure was effective by adding 1 mm Bocillin FL to the denaturing solution. Minimal labeling of PBP2b occurred in this way (Fig. 5A, sample Ctl). The in-gel fluorescence of PBP2b-bound Bocillin was quantified and normalized with respect to the amount of PBP2b in each sample, as quantified after subsequent Coomassie staining. The second order rate constant k2/KD was obtained from global fitting of the time course data at the different drug concentrations using a second order reaction model described in Equation 2 (Fig. 5B). With R6-PBP2b, which is highly reactive, using low drug concentrations in the same range as that of the protein was necessary to measure sufficiently slow reactions. For this reason, we fitted the data without making the usual first order approximation that is appropriate when the drug concentration is in large excess and can be considered constant. PBP+βL→(k2/KD)βLPBP-βL(Eq. 2) The acylation efficiency of R6-PBP2b by Bocillin FL was found in the range of 104 m−1 s−1, which is similar to values reported with PBP3 from Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24Shapiro A.B. Gu R.F. Gao N. Livchak S. Thresher J. Continuous fluorescence anisotropy-based assay of BOCILLIN FL penicillin reaction with penicillin binding protein 3.Anal. Biochem. 2013; 439: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reaction with 5204-PBP2b was ∼200-fold slower, whereas it was reduced 1000-fold with Hybrid-PBP2b. It is surprising that Hybrid-PBP2b is even less reactive with Bocillin than 5204-PBP2b, despite the fact that it exhibits a better transpeptidase activity. No difference of reactivity with Bocillin was found between the full-length and truncated proteins (Fig. 5C). It was assumed to be true of all β-lactams and further kinetic data were obtained with the soluble forms only. In contrast to the other monofunctional PBP2x, the reaction of PBP2b with β-lactams has not been characterized in details, because of the absence of modification of the optical spectra upon acylation by the drugs (12Pagliero E. Chesnel L. Hopkins J. Croizé J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M. Biochemical characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2b and its implication in β-lactam resistance.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 1848-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To palliate this lack of data, we measured the acylation efficiency by several β-lactams by monitoring the chromogenic reaction with nitrocefin. The absorbance spectrum of nitrocefin changes upon opening of the β-lactam ring, and the reactions were followed by the rise in absorbance at 490 nm. With nitrocefin alone, the data collected at different drug concentrations could be globally fitted to a second order reaction model to extract the acylation efficiency k2/KD (Equation 3). PBP+NCF→(k2/KD)NCFPBP-NCF(Eq. 3) With R6-, Hybrid-, and T446A-PBP2b, no further degradation of nitrocefin was detected, and reactions reached the expected stoichiometric plateau, unlike what had been observed in a study of Staphylococcus aureus PBP2a (25Graves-Woodward K. Pratt R.F. Reaction of soluble penicillin-binding protein 2a of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with β-lactams and acyclic substrates: kinetics in homogeneous solution.Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2570386267,"The oleaginous yeast Debaryomyces hansenii is a good model to understand molecular mechanisms involved in halotolerance because of its impressive ability to survive under a wide range of salt concentrations. Several cellular adaptations are implicated in this response, including the presence of a cyanide-insensitive ubiquinol oxidase (Aox). This protein, which is present in several taxonomical orders, has been related to different stress responses. However, little is known about its role in mitochondria during transitions from low to high saline environments. In this report, we analyze the effects of Aox in shifts from low to high salt concentrations in the culture media. At early stages of a salt insult, we observed that this protein prevents the overflow of electrons on the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus, decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, in the presence of high osmolite concentrations, Aox activity is able to sustain a stable membrane potential when coupled to complex I, despite a compromised cytochrome pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that under high osmolarity conditions Aox plays a critical role regulating mitochondrial physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2568870750,"The goal of the study was to compare the effectiveness of different suicide prevention measures implemented on bridges and other high structures in Switzerland. A national survey identified all jumping hotspots that have been secured in Switzerland; of the 15 that could be included in this study, 11 were secured by vertical barriers and 4 were secured by low-hanging horizontal safety nets. The study made an overall and individual pre-post analysis by using Mantel-Haenszel Tests, regression methods and calculating rate ratios. Barriers and safety nets were both effective, with mean suicide reduction of 68.7% (barriers) and 77.1% (safety nets), respectively. Measures that do not secure the whole hotspot and still allow jumps of 15 meters or more were less effective. Further, the analyses revealed that barriers of at least 2.3 m in height and safety-nets fixed significantly below pedestrian level deterred suicidal jumps. Secured bridgeheads and inbound angle barriers seemed to enhance the effectiveness of the measure. Findings can help to plan and improve the effectiveness of future suicide prevention measures on high structures."
https://openalex.org/W2569160855,"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a national media campaign to promote oral health and periodontal knowledge among adults after a three-month follow-up. Methods We conducted a population-based study of adults aged 18 to 50 years using a stratified multi-stage sampling method in Tehran, Iran in 2011. The campaign included an animation clip about periodontal health and disease telecast on national TV for ten consecutive days. We used an instrument to assess the effect of the campaign at baseline, immediately after the campaign and after a three-month follow-up. A total of 543 participants responded at baseline and immediately after the intervention, and 294 were interviewed at the three-month follow-up assessment (response rate: 54.1%). We assessed each participant’s periodontal knowledge score, calculated as a sum of correct answers, and the change in their score following the campaign. We then used a five-item questionnaire to evaluate the participants’ opinion of the success of the campaign. We used descriptive statistics and generalised estimating equations (GEE) analysis to conduct the statistical analysis. Results The mean score for knowledge improvement from baseline to immediate post-intervention evaluation was higher among those who saw the campaign (0.61) than among those who did not (0.29); the corresponding figures from immediate evaluation to three-month follow-up were -0.17 and 0.15, respectively. Adjusting for baseline values, the GEE analysis demonstrated that improvement in the mean score of post-campaign knowledge associated significantly with age, education and seeing the campaign. Significant interaction between the time since seeing the campaign and whether the participant saw it (p < 0.001) revealed that the mean difference in the knowledge score between the groups who did and did not see the campaign was 0.4 at the immediate evaluation and -0.04 at the three-month follow-up. The participants received the campaign well in terms of being appealing (91.4%), worth bearing in mind (83.4%) and containing valuable information (80.3%). Conclusions Our findings indicate that a population-based media campaign promoting oral health and periodontal knowledge among adults had a positive short-term impact, although the effect seemed to plateau after three months."

The aim of this study was determine the exposure of synanthropic mammals to two types of tick-borne pathogens in Panama, spotted fever group Rickettsia (SFGR) and Borrelia relapsing fever (RF) spirochetes. One hundred and thirty-one wild mammals were evaluated, including two gray foxes, two crab-eating foxes (from zoos), four coyotes, 62 opossum and 63 spiny rats captured close to rural towns. To evaluate exposure to SFGR, serum samples from the animals were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using Rickettsia rickettsii and Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii antigen. Immunoblotting was performed using Borrelia turicatae protein lysates and rGlpQ, to assess infection caused by RF spirochetes. One coyote (25%) and 27 (43%) opossums showed seroreactivity to SFGR. Of these opossums, 11 were seroreactive to C. R. amblyommii. Serological reactivity was not detected to B. turicatae in mammal samples. These findings may reflect a potential role of both mammals in the ecology of tick-borne pathogens in Panama."
https://openalex.org/W2569172367,"Chymotrypsin-like elastases (CELAs) are pancreatic serine proteinases that digest dietary proteins. CELAs are typically expressed in multiple isoforms that can vary among different species. The human pancreas does not express CELA1 but secretes two CELA3 isoforms, CELA3A and CELA3B. The reasons for the CELA3 duplication and the substrate preferences of the duplicated isoforms are unclear. Here, we tested whether CELA3A and CELA3B evolved unique substrate specificities to compensate for the loss of CELA1. We constructed a phage library displaying variants of the substrate-like Schistocerca gregaria proteinase inhibitor 2 (SGPI-2) to select reversible high affinity inhibitors of human CELA3A, CELA3B, and porcine CELA1. Based on the reactive loop sequences of the phage display-selected inhibitors, we recombinantly expressed and purified 12 SGPI-2 variants and determined their binding affinities. We found that the primary specificity of CELA3A, CELA3B, and CELA1 was similar; all preferred aliphatic side chains at the so-called P1 position, the amino acid residue located directly N-terminal to the scissile peptide bond. P1 Met was an interesting exception that was preferred by CELA1 but weakly recognized by the CELA3 isoforms. The extended substrate specificity of CELA3A and CELA3B was comparable, whereas CELA1 exhibited unique interactions at several subsites. These observations indicated that the CELA1 and CELA3 paralogs have some different but also overlapping specificities and that the duplicated CELA3A and CELA3B isoforms did not evolve distinct substrate preferences. Thus, increased gene dosage rather than specificity divergence of the CELA3 isoforms may compensate for the loss of CELA1 digestive activity in the human pancreas.

Thus, increased gene dosage rather than specificity divergence of the CELA3 isoforms may compensate for the loss of CELA1 digestive activity in the human pancreas. Digestive serine proteinases are secreted by the pancreas and include trypsins, chymotrypsins, and elastases, which cleave dietary protein substrates with unique substrate specificities primarily determined by the P1 amino acid forming the scissile peptide bond (Schechter and Berger nomenclature of interactions between proteinases and their substrates (1Schechter I. Berger A. On the size of the active site in proteinases. I. Papain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4759) Google Scholar)). Pancreatic elastases were recently renamed chymotrypsin-like elastases to avoid confusion with the homologous neutrophil elastase. Digestive enzymes are typically expressed in multiple isoforms, and the number and properties of these isoenzymes can vary significantly among the different vertebrate species making clear assignment of orthology challenging at best. The advent of the genomic era facilitated the comprehensive identification and annotation of digestive enzyme isoforms; however, functional studies have been slow to keep up with the omics revolution, and the physiological significance of digestive proteinase diversity has remained relatively poorly understood even in humans. Elastases were first defined by their ability to solubilize insoluble elastin by Hungarian scientists Baló and Banga in 1949 (2Baló J. Banga I. Elastase and elastase-inhibitor.Nature. 1949; 164: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), who demonstrated the presence of such elastolytic activity in pancreatic homogenates of the pig (3Baló J. Banga I. The elastolytic activity of pancreatic extracts.Biochem. J. 1950; 46: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequent purification of porcine elastase 1 (CELA1) allowed unambiguous assignment of the elastolytic activity to this serine proteinase (4Lamy F. Craig C.P. Tauber S.

CELA1 was shown to adsorb to the surface of elastin because of its basic character and then to cleave elastin at multiple Ala-Ala and Ala-Gly peptide bonds (7Gertler A.

Finally, X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the specificity pocket of porcine CELA1 was restricted at the mouth by Val-216 (chymotrypsin numbering) and partially occluded at the bottom by Thr-226, which explained the characteristic P1 preference and the exclusion of aromatic side chains (16Shotton D.M.

The chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity was consistent with the presence of Gly-216 and Ser-226 in the specificity pocket of CELA2. Cloning of the human cDNA resulted in the identification of two highly similar genes, named CELA2A and CELA2B, indicating recent gene duplication (27Kawashima I. Tani T. Shimoda K. Takiguchi Y.

Although expressed at the mRNA level, the CELA2B protein has never been isolated or detected.

Silencing of the archetypal CELA1 in the human pancreas and duplication of the CELA3 genes raise the intriguing possibility that these two evolutionary events are linked, and CELA3A or CELA3B might serve as a surrogate for CELA1 with respect to substrate specificity. Therefore, in this study we characterized the substrate specificity of human CELA3A and CELA3B and compared it with pig CELA1 using phage display-selected proteinase inhibitor variants that bind in a substrate-like manner. To analyze the substrate specificity of CELA3A and CELA3B, we performed directed evolution of the Schistocerca gregaria proteinase inhibitor 2 (SGPI-2) that binds in a substrate-like manner to its cognate proteinases. To compare the characteristics of the CELA3 substrate-binding sites to those of the CELA1 paralog, we also evolved variants against porcine CELA1. The pig enzyme served as a surrogate model for the evolutionarily silenced human ortholog (17Tani T. Kawashima I. Furukawa H. Ohmine T. Takiguchi Y.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that wild-type SGPI-2 bound to CELA3A and CELA3B with low but measurable affinity (KD ∼2 and ∼0.3 μm, respectively) (49Szabó A. Héja D. Szakács D. Zboray K. Kékesi K.A.

For this study, we constructed an M13 bacteriophage library displaying SGPI-2 variants on the p8 coat protein where we fully randomized the P4, P2, P1, P1′, P2′, and P4′ positions in the reactive loop while keeping the structurally important P3 and P3′ Cys residues intact (Fig. 1). Selection of tight-binding phage clones from the library containing 3 × 108 variants was performed against CELA3A and CELA3B, and in a separate experiment a library of 7.5 × 108 variants was selected against CELA1. Three rounds of panning were performed. Clones from the third selection cycle were tested for target binding by phage ELISA, and binders were sequenced. The enrichment after the third panning was 3500-fold on CELA3A, 1100-fold on CELA3B, and 3500-fold on CELA1. DNA sequencing of selected phages revealed 34 and 49 unique phage clones against CELA3A and CELA3B, respectively (Table 1). To visualize the sequence patterns in the reactive loop of the inhibitors, we generated codon-normalized sequence logos (Fig. 2). The logos indicated similar binding loop sequences selected against the two elastases, with some small but notable differences. Somewhat surprisingly, Ala was not the preferred amino acid at the P1 position where longer side-chain aliphatic residues (Ile, Leu, Met, Val) were primarily selected. CELA3A preferred a P1 Ile over Leu, but Met was excluded, whereas a P1 Leu over Ile was preferred by CELA3B, and Met was also allowed. The striking dominance of Thr at the P2 position in all logos does not represent elastase-specific selection, but rather it is the result of hydrogen bonding interactions of the Thr side chain with the core of the protein that are important for stabilizing the canonical conformation of the proteinase binding loop. At the P1′ position Met was selected overwhelmingly against both elastases. Arg also occurred in this position with a higher frequency in the CELA3B logo. Compared with P1′, a somewhat weaker conservation emerged at the P2′ position, where CELA3A and CELA3B showed preference for Leu and Tyr, respectively. Furthermore, a P2′ Glu was also selected more frequently against CELA3A than CELA3B. Finally, at position P4′ CELA3A displayed preference for His, but no clear amino acid conservation was apparent at this position for CELA3B. Similarly, only a low level of selection was observed at position P4 with some preference for Tyr and Ala by both elastases.TABLE 1Amino acid sequence of the reactive loop of SGPI-2 variants selected by phage display against human CELA3A (34 clones), CELA3B (49 clones), and pig CELA1 (59 clones)CELA3ACELA3BCELA1ACTAMLCHACTAQLCYSCTLMACWACTAMYCAACTMLYCGACTLMACHACTLMACASCTLMLCHACTARWCAACTMLYCGACTLMLCAACTLMLCEWCTLMACDACTARWCGACTMLYCQACTLMLCFACTLMLCGWCTLMLCDACTIMWCNACTMLYCSACTLMLCHACTLMLCNYCTAMYCFACTIRYCQACTMMYCAACTLMLCHACTMELCWYCTARACAACTLIWCGACTMMYCGACTLMLCHACTMLLCAYCTIKLCHACTLMACHACTMMYCWACTVMLCHACTMLPCGYCTIRLCYACTLMFCHACTMRFCGHCTIMACHACTVMLCVYCTLMACVACTLMWCGACTMRLCVHCTLMLCHACTVMYCPYCTLMACYACTLMYCGACTMRLCYHCTLMLCYACSIRYCEYCTLRECFACTLMYCLACTMRWCAHCTLMLCYFCTAMECGYCTLRFCAACTLRFCPACTMRWCDLCTIMLCHFCTARFCHYCTLRYCQACTLRWCAACTMRWCDLCTIMLCHFCTLMWCWYCTVMLCSACTLRWCGACTMRWCDLCTIMLCHHCTIRLCHYCTVRWCWACTLLYCGACTMRWCGLCTIRLCWHCTLRWCYACTLLYCGACTMRWCGLCTLMACHLCTIMLCHACTMAYCAACTMRWCSLCTLMACHLCTIRHCEACTMIWCGACTMRYCDLCTLMLCYLCTLMACAACTMIWCGACTMRYCGLCTVMLCWLCTLMACYACTMLFCQACTMRYCGWCTIAECHLCTLMLCAACTMLFCYACTMRYCGWCTLMLCDLCTLMLCHACTMLLCVACTMRYCVWCTVMLCHLCTLMLCMACTMLPCAACTMRYCSWCTVMYCPLCTLMLCSACTMLPCFGCTMLYCGYCTAMLCWLCTLMSCHACTMLPCHYCTLRWCDYCTIMACHLCTLRHCHACTMLPCIYCTIMLCHLCTLRYCPACTMLPCSYCTIRECHLCTLRYCWACTMLWCGYCTIRLCHLCTMRYCHACTMLWCGYCTLMLCHLCTVMLCMACTMLWCGYCTVMACHLCTVMLCNACTMLWCNYCTVMACYLCTVRACYACTMLWCVYCTVMLCHMCTLMLCDACTMLYCAYCTVMLCHMCTLMYCSACTMLYCG Open table in a new tab The sequence logo (Fig. 2C) representing 59 unique binding clones (Table 1) revealed a narrower specificity of CELA1 at several binding loop positions. Most notably, in sharp contrast with the more permissive S4 subsite of human CELA3 proteinases, Ala was almost exclusively selected by pig CELA1 at P4. Moreover, the S1 binding pocket of the CELA1 enzyme strongly preferred a P1 Met, although this residue was rare or even absent among CELA3 binders. On the primed side of the scissile bond amino acids Met, Arg, and Leu were selected with similar frequency at the P1′ position, although both CELA3 enzymes preferred Met. CELA1 showed an overwhelming preference for aromatic side chains at P2′, but the human CELA3 enzymes either preferred or at least readily tolerated the presence of aliphatic residues at this position. Finally, the P4′ side chain seemed to have the least impact on the interaction of the inhibitor and the CELA1 enzyme. On the basis of the selected sequence patterns, we produced recombinant SGPI-2 variants. To generate a meaningful set of inhibitors while keeping their number manageable, we focused on the CELA3 selected patterns. We designed 12 variants (Table 2) to test the roles of the P4, P1, P1′, P2′, and P4′ positions in determining inhibitory affinity and selectivity. The variants were named SGPI-2 E1 through E12. Variants E1–E6 had the common P4–P4′ reactive loop sequence, Tyr-Cys-Thr-(Xaa)-Met-Leu-Cys-His, where the highlighted Xaa (P1) residue was varied by incorporating Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Ala, and Ser. Although not selected from our library, Ser was included among the tested P1 residues because cleavage after Ser by CELA3B was reported previously (43Sziegoleit A. Linder D. Schlüter M. Ogawa M.

Stroke event was identified during 2000-2013 follow-up period. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of stroke associated with COPDe were calculated. In a nested cohort study (Study 2) of 261686 new-diagnosed stroke patients in 2000-2009, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of adverse events after stroke in patients with COPDe.Patients with COPDe had increased stroke incidence, with an adjusted HR of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.03-1.59). In the Study 2, COPDe were associated with post-stroke mortality (OR, 1.34, 95% CI 1.20-1.52), epilepsy (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, (1.22-1.67), and pneumonia (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.39-1.62).

Differences between our rehabilitation patients and Dutch reference values were analyzed (t-tests). Effects of patient characteristics, diagnosis and movement intensity on scores on the subscales of the RAND-36 were analyzed using block wise multiple regression analyses.In total 1223 patients (39%) returned the questionnaire. HRQoL was significantly poorer in the rehabilitation patients compared to Dutch reference values on all subscales (p<0.001) except for health change (p = 0.197). Longer time between questionnaire and last treatment was associated with a smaller health change (p = 0.035). Higher age negatively affected physical functioning (p<0.001), social functioning (p = 0.004) and health change (p = 0.001). Diagnosis affected outcomes on all subscales except role limitations physical, and mental health (p ranged <0.001 to 0.643). Higher movement intensity was associated with better outcomes on all subscales except for mental health (p ranged <0.001 to 0.190).HRQoL is poorer in rehabilitation patients compared to Dutch reference values. Physical components of HRQoL are affected by diagnosis. In rehabilitation patients an association between movement intensity and HRQoL was found.

https://openalex.org/W2570832243,"Butterflies of the South Asian and Australian genus Delias possess striking colours on the ventral wings that are presumed to serve as warning signals to predators. However, this has not been shown empirically. Here we experimentally tested whether the colours of one member of this diverse genus, Delias hyparete, function as aposematic signals. We constructed artificial paper models with either a faithful colour representation of D. hyparete, or with all of its colours converted to grey scale. We also produced models where single colours were left intact, while others were converted to grey-scale or removed entirely. We placed all model types simultaneously in the field, attached to a live mealworm, and measured relative attack rates at three separate field sites. Faithful models of D. hyparete, suffered the least amount of attacks, followed by grey-scale models with unaltered red patches, and by grey-scale models with unaltered yellow patches. We conclude that red and yellow colours function as warning signals. By mapping dorsal and ventral colouration onto a phylogeny of Delias, we observed that yellow and red colours appear almost exclusively on the ventral wing surfaces, and that basal lineages have mostly yellow, white, and black wings, whereas derived lineages contain red colour in addition to the other colours. Red appears to be, thus, a novel adaptive trait in this lineage of butterflies."

The phiC725A genome sequence shows similarity to F116, a P. aeruginosa podovirus capable of generalized transduction. Likewise, phiC725A is a podovirus with long tail fibers. PhiC725A was able to lysogenize two additional P. aeruginosa strains in which it was maintained both as a prophage and in an episomal state. Investigation by deep sequencing showed that bacterial DNA carried inside phage particles originated predominantly from a 700-800kb region, immediately flanking the attL prophage insertion site, whether the phages were induced from a lysogen or recovered after infection. This indicates that during productive replication, recombination of phage genomes with the bacterial chromosome at the att site occurs occasionally, allowing packaging of adjacent bacterial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2568232918,"Background Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) reduces ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Premenopausal RRSO is hypothesized to increase fracture risk more than natural menopause. Elevated bone turnover markers (BTMs) might predict fracture risk. We investigated BTM levels after RRSO and aimed to identify clinical characteristics associated with elevated BTMs. Methods Osteocalcin (OC), procollagen type I N-terminal peptide (PINP) and serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen (sCTx) were measured in 210 women ≥ 2 years after RRSO before age 53. BTM Z-scores were calculated using an existing reference cohort of age-matched women. Clinical characteristics were assessed by questionnaire. Results BTMs after RRSO were higher than age-matched reference values: median Z-scores OC 0.11, p = 0.003; PINP 0.84, p < 0.001; sCTx 0.53, p < 0.001 (compared to Z = 0). After excluding women with recent fractures or BTM interfering medication, Z-scores increased to 0.34, 1.14 and 0.88, respectively. Z-scores for OC and PINP were inversely correlated to age at RRSO. No correlation was found with fracture incidence or history of breast cancer. Conclusions Five years after RRSO, BTMs were higher than age-matched reference values. Since elevated BTMs might predict higher fracture risk, prospective studies are required to evaluate the clinical implications of this finding."
https://openalex.org/W2569346395,"Cognitive dysfunction in depression has recently been given more attention and legitimacy as a core symptom of the disorder. However, animal investigations of depression-related cognitive deficits have generally focused on emotional or spatial memory processing. Additionally, the relationship between the cognitive and affective disturbances that are present in depression remains obscure. Interestingly, sleep disruption is one aspect of depression that can be related both to cognition and affect, and may serve as a link between the two. Previous studies have correlated sleep disruption with negative mood and impaired cognition. The present study investigated whether a long photoperiod-induced depressive phenotype showed cognitive deficits, as measured by novel object recognition, and displayed a cognitive vulnerability to an acute period of total sleep deprivation. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a long photoperiod (21L:3D) or a normal photoperiod (12L:12D) condition. Our results indicate that our long photoperiod exposed animals showed behaviors in the forced swim test consistent with a depressive phenotype, and showed significant deficits in novel object recognition. Three hours of total sleep deprivation, however, did not significantly change novel object recognition in either group, but the trends suggest that the long photoperiod and normal photoperiod groups had different cognitive responses to total sleep deprivation. Collectively, these results underline the extent of cognitive dysfunction present in depression, and suggest that altered sleep plays a role in generating both the affective and cognitive symptoms of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2569562652,"Background Cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer among Peruvian women. Female sex workers (FSW) in Peru are at elevated risk for HPV infection, and receive annual Papanicolaou screening. The objective of this study was to identify barriers to follow-up for abnormal Pap smears among FSW in Peru. Methods 97 FSW attending the Alberto Barton Health Center in Lima were surveyed regarding their STI screening history. 17 women with a history of an abnormal Pap smear were interviewed about their experiences regarding follow-up care. Results Of the 27 HPV-positive women, only 8 (30%) received follow-up treatment. Of the 19 women who did not receive follow-up, 7 (37%) had not been informed of their abnormal result. Qualitative interviews revealed that the major barrier to follow-up was lack of knowledge about HPV and potential health consequences of an abnormal Pap smear. Conclusion HPV infection is highly prevalent in Peruvian FSW, yet only 30% of FSW with abnormal Pap smears receive follow-up care. The predominant barriers to follow-up were lack of standardization in recording and communicating results and insufficient FSW knowledge regarding health consequences of HPV infection. Standardization of record-keeping and distribution of educational pamphlets have been implemented to improve follow-up for HPV."
https://openalex.org/W2571182058,"Rhacophoridae, a family of morphologically cryptic frogs, with many genetically distinct evolutionary lineages, is understudied with respect to skeletal morphology, life history traits and skeletal ontogeny. Here we analyze two species each from two sister lineages, Taruga and Polypedates, and compare their postembryonic skeletal ontogeny, larval chondrocrania and adult osteology in the context of a well-resolved phylogeny. We further compare these ontogenetic traits with the direct-developing Pseudophilautus silus. For each species, we differentially stained a nearly complete developmental series of tadpoles from early postembryonic stages through metamorphosis to determine the intraspecific and interspecific differences of cranial and postcranial bones. Chondrocrania of the four species differ in 1) size; 2) presence/absence of anterolateral and posterior process; and 3) shape of the suprarostral cartilages. Interspecific variation of ossification sequences is limited during early stages, but conspicuous during later development. Early cranial ossification is typical of other anuran larvae, where the frontoparietal, exoccipital and parasphenoid ossify first. The ossification sequences of the cranial bones vary considerably within the four species. Both species of Taruga show a faster cranial ossification rate than Polypedates. Seven cranial bones form when larvae near metamorphic climax. Ossification of all 18 cranial bones is initiated by larval Gosner stage 46 in T. eques. However, some cranial bone formation is not initiated until after metamorphosis in the other three species. Postcranial sequence does not vary significantly. The comparison of adult osteology highlights two characters, which have not been previously recorded: presence/absence of the parieto-squamosal plates and bifurcated base of the omosternum. This study will provide a starting point for comparative analyses of rhacophorid skeletal ontogeny and facilitate the study of the evolution of ontogenetic repatterning associated with the life history variation in the family."
https://openalex.org/W2569841177,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is increasingly replacing thermodilution pulmonary artery catheters to assess hemodynamics in patients at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity. However, one of the drawbacks of TEE compared to pulmonary artery catheters is the inability to measure real time stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) continuously. The aim of the present proof of concept study was to validate a novel method of SV estimation, based on pulse wave velocity (PWV) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.This is a retrospective observational study. We measured pulse transit time by superimposing the radial arterial waveform onto the continuous wave Doppler waveform of the left ventricular outflow tract, and calculated SV (SVPWV) using the transformed Bramwell-Hill equation. The SV measured by TEE (SVTEE) was used as a reference.A total of 190 paired SV were measured from 28 patients. A strong correlation was observed between SVPWV and SVTEE with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71. A mean difference between the two (bias) was 3.70 ml with the limits of agreement ranging from -20.33 to 27.73 ml and a percentage error of 27.4% based on a Bland-Altman analysis. The concordance rate of two methods was 85.0% based on a four-quadrant plot. The angular concordance rate was 85.9% with radial limits of agreement (the radial sector that contained 95% of the data points) of ± 41.5 degrees based on a polar plot.PWV based SV estimation yields reasonable agreement with SV measured by TEE. Further studies are required to assess its utility in different clinical situations."
