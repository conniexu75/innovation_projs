https://openalex.org/W4295921704,"Changes in gut microbiota have been associated with several diseases. Here, the International Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Study (iMSMS) studied the gut microbiome of 576 MS patients (36% untreated) and genetically unrelated household healthy controls (1,152 total subjects). We observed a significantly increased proportion of Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Hungatella hathewayi, and Eisenbergiella tayi and decreased Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia species. The phytate degradation pathway was over-represented in untreated MS, while pyruvate-producing carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly reduced. Microbiome composition, function, and derived metabolites also differed in response to disease-modifying treatments. The therapeutic activity of interferon-β may in part be associated with upregulation of short-chain fatty acid transporters. Distinct microbial networks were observed in untreated MS and healthy controls. These results strongly support specific gut microbiome associations with MS risk, course and progression, and functional changes in response to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4295921799,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to treat multiple psychiatric and neurological conditions by manipulating activity in particular brain networks and circuits, but individual responses are highly variable. In clinical settings, TMS coil placement is typically based on either group average functional maps or scalp heuristics. Here, we found that this approach can inadvertently target different functional networks in depressed patients due to variability in their functional brain organization. More precise TMS targeting should be feasible by accounting for each patient’s unique functional neuroanatomy. To this end, we developed a targeting approach, termed targeted functional network stimulation (TANS). The TANS approach improved stimulation specificity in silico in 8 highly sampled patients with depression and 6 healthy individuals and in vivo when targeting somatomotor functional networks representing the upper and lower limbs. Code for implementing TANS and an example dataset are provided as a resource."
https://openalex.org/W4295959779,"Integrins are validated drug targets with six approved therapeutics. However, small-molecule inhibitors to three integrins failed in late-stage clinical trials for chronic indications. Such unfavorable outcomes may in part be caused by partial agonism, i.e., the stabilization of the high-affinity, extended-open integrin conformation. Here, we show that the failed, small-molecule inhibitors of integrins αIIbβ3 and α4β1 stabilize the high-affinity conformation. Furthermore, we discovered a simple chemical feature present in multiple αIIbβ3 antagonists that stabilizes integrins in their bent-closed conformation. Closing inhibitors contain a polar nitrogen atom that stabilizes, via hydrogen bonds, a water molecule that intervenes between a serine residue and the metal in the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). Expulsion of this water is a requisite for transition to the open conformation. This change in metal coordination is general to integrins, suggesting broad applicability of the drug-design principle to the integrin family, as validated with a distantly related integrin, α4β1."
https://openalex.org/W3098847016,"Sentiment quantification is the task of training, by means of supervised learning, estimators of the relative frequency (also called ""prevalence"") of sentiment-related classes (such as Positive, Neutral, Negative) in a sample of unlabelled texts. This task is especially important when these texts are tweets, since the final goal of most sentiment classification efforts carried out on Twitter data is actually quantification (and not the classification of individual tweets). It is well-known that solving quantification by means of ""classify and count"" (i.e., by classifying all unlabelled items by means of a standard classifier and counting the items that have been assigned to a given class) is less than optimal in terms of accuracy, and that more accurate quantification methods exist. Gao and Sebastiani 2016 carried out a systematic comparison of quantification methods on the task of tweet sentiment quantification. In hindsight, we observe that the experimentation carried out in that work was weak, and that the reliability of the conclusions that were drawn from the results is thus questionable. We here re-evaluate those quantification methods (plus a few more modern ones) on exactly the same datasets, this time following a now consolidated and robust experimental protocol (which also involves simulating the presence, in the test data, of class prevalence values very different from those of the training set). This experimental protocol (even without counting the newly added methods) involves a number of experiments 5,775 times larger than that of the original study. Due to the above-mentioned presence, in the test data, of samples characterised by class prevalence values very different from those of the training set, the results of our experiments are dramatically different from those obtained by Gao and Sebastiani, and provide a different, much more solid understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment quantification methods."
https://openalex.org/W4295948280,"Computational analysis of cellular activity has developed largely independently of modern transcriptomic cell typology, but integrating these approaches may be essential for full insight into cellular-level mechanisms underlying brain function and dysfunction. Applying this approach to the habenula (a structure with diverse, intermingled molecular, anatomical, and computational features), we identified encoding of reward-predictive cues and reward outcomes in distinct genetically defined neural populations, including TH+ cells and Tac1+ cells. Data from genetically targeted recordings were used to train an optimized nonlinear dynamical systems model and revealed activity dynamics consistent with a line attractor. High-density, cell-type-specific electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbation provided supporting evidence for this model. Reverse-engineering predicted how Tac1+ cells might integrate reward history, which was complemented by in vivo experimentation. This integrated approach describes a process by which data-driven computational models of population activity can generate and frame actionable hypotheses for cell-type-specific investigation in biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W4295961056,"The current dogma of RNA-mediated innate immunity is that sensing of immunostimulatory RNA ligands is sufficient for the activation of intracellular sensors and induction of interferon (IFN) responses. Here, we report that actin cytoskeleton disturbance primes RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) activation. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement induced by virus infection or commonly used reagents to intracellularly deliver RNA triggers the relocalization of PPP1R12C, a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), from filamentous actin to cytoplasmic RLRs. This allows dephosphorylation-mediated RLR priming and, together with the RNA agonist, induces effective RLR downstream signaling. Genetic ablation of PPP1R12C impairs antiviral responses and enhances susceptibility to infection with several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, picornavirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Our work identifies actin cytoskeleton disturbance as a priming signal for RLR-mediated innate immunity, which may open avenues for antiviral or adjuvant design."
https://openalex.org/W4296028038,"RNA-seq is a high-throughput sequencing technology widely used for gene transcript discovery and quantification under different biological or biomedical conditions. A fundamental research question in most RNA-seq experiments is the identification of differentially expressed genes among experimental conditions or sample groups. Numerous statistical methods for RNA-seq differential analysis have been proposed since the emergence of the RNA-seq assay. To evaluate popular differential analysis methods used in the open source R and Bioconductor packages, we conducted multiple simulation studies to compare the performance of eight RNA-seq differential analysis methods used in RNA-seq data analysis (edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2, baySeq, EBSeq, NOISeq, SAMSeq, Voom). The comparisons were across different scenarios with either equal or unequal library sizes, different distribution assumptions and sample sizes. We measured performance using false discovery rate (FDR) control, power, and stability. No significant differences were observed for FDR control, power, or stability across methods, whether with equal or unequal library sizes. For RNA-seq count data with negative binomial distribution, when sample size is 3 in each group, EBSeq performed better than the other methods as indicated by FDR control, power, and stability. When sample sizes increase to 6 or 12 in each group, DESeq2 performed slightly better than other methods. All methods have improved performance when sample size increases to 12 in each group except DESeq. For RNA-seq count data with log-normal distribution, both DESeq and DESeq2 methods performed better than other methods in terms of FDR control, power, and stability across all sample sizes. Real RNA-seq experimental data were also used to compare the total number of discoveries and stability of discoveries for each method. For RNA-seq data analysis, the EBSeq method is recommended for studies with sample size as small as 3 in each group, and the DESeq2 method is recommended for sample size of 6 or higher in each group when the data follow the negative binomial distribution. Both DESeq and DESeq2 methods are recommended when the data follow the log-normal distribution."
https://openalex.org/W4296028809,"Nowadays, fungal infections increase, and the demand of novel antifungal agents is constantly rising. In the present study, silver, titanium dioxide, cobalt (II) hydroxide and cobalt (II,III) oxide nanomaterials have been synthesized from Spirulina platensis extract. The synthesis mechanism has been studied using GCMS and FTIR thus confirming the involvement of secondary metabolites, mainly amines. The obtained products have been analysed using XRD, SEM, TGA and zeta potential techniques. The findings revealed average crystallite size of 15.22 nm with 9.72 nm for oval-shaped silver nanoparticles increasing to 26.01 nm and 24.86 nm after calcination and 4.81 nm for spherical-shaped titanium dioxide nanoparticles which decreased to 4.62 nm after calcination. Nanoflake shape has been observed for cobalt hydroxide nanomaterials and for cobalt (II, III) oxide with crystallite size of 3.52 nm and 13.28 nm, respectively. Silver nanoparticles showed the best thermal and water dispersion stability of all the prepared structures. Once subjected to three different Candida species (C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei) silver nanoparticles and cobalt (II) hydroxide nanomaterials showed strong antifungal activity at 50 μg/mL with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. After light exposition, MIC values for nanomaterials decreased (to 12.5 μg/mL) for C. krusei and increased (100 μg/mL) for C. albicans and C. glabrata."
https://openalex.org/W4295947630,"Rodents explore their environment through coordinated orofacial motor actions, including whisking. Whisking can free-run via an oscillator of inhibitory neurons in the medulla and can be paced by breathing. Yet, the mechanics of the whisking oscillator and its interaction with breathing remain to be understood. We formulate and solve a hierarchical model of the whisking circuit. The first whisk within a breathing cycle is generated by inhalation, which resets a vibrissa oscillator circuit, while subsequent whisks are derived from the oscillator circuit. Our model posits, consistent with experiment, that there are two subpopulations of oscillator neurons. Stronger connections between the subpopulations support rhythmicity, while connections within each subpopulation induce variable spike timing that enhances the dynamic range of rhythm generation. Calculated cycle-to-cycle changes in whisking are consistent with experiment. Our model provides a computational framework to support longstanding observations of concurrent autonomous and driven rhythmic motor actions that comprise behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4296026191,"Garden pea ( Pisum sativum L.) is a self-pollinated plant species which played an important role for the foundation of modern genetics. Genetic diversity among 56 garden pea genotypes was assessed using 12 morphological descriptors, 19 quantitative traits and 8 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Eight morphological descriptors were found polymorphic, and highest Shannon diversity index was recorded for pod curvature (1.18). Mahalanobis D 2 illustrating genetic divergence arranged 56 genotypes into six clusters, with the highest inter-cluster distance between clusters IV and VI (18.09). The average values of Na (number of alleles), Ne (effective number of alleles), I (Shannon’s Information index), PIC (polymorphism information content), Ho (observed heterozygosity) and He (expected heterozygosity) were 3.13, 1.85, 0.71, 0.36, 0.002 and 0.41, respectively. Pair wise genetic distance among all pairs of the genotypes varied from 0.33 to 1.00 with an average of 0.76. Based on genetic distance, the genotypes were classified into two main clusters (A and B) by cluster analysis, whereas structure analysis divided the genotypes into four sub-populations. The SSR makers indicated that present of genetic variability among the studied genotypes. When, we compared the groups formed by agro-morphological and molecular data, no genotypes were observed, indicating that both stages of characterization are crucial for a better understanding of the genetic variability. Hybridization between genetically diverse genotypes can be exploited to expend the genetic variability and introduce new traits in the pea breeding program."
https://openalex.org/W4295959591,"Fibrosis is the final path of nearly every form of chronic disease, regardless of the pathogenesis. Upon chronic injury, activated, fibrogenic fibroblasts deposit excess extracellular matrix, and severe tissue fibrosis can occur in virtually any organ. However, antifibrotic therapies that target fibrogenic cells, while sparing homeostatic fibroblasts in healthy tissues, are limited. We tested whether specific immunization against endogenous proteins, strongly expressed in fibrogenic cells but highly restricted in quiescent fibroblasts, can elicit an antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell response to ameliorate organ fibrosis. In silico epitope prediction revealed that activation of the genes Adam12 and Gli1 in profibrotic cells and the resulting “self-peptides” can be exploited for T cell vaccines to ablate fibrogenic cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccination approach to mount CD8+ T cell responses that reduce fibroblasts and fibrosis in the liver and lungs in mice. These results provide proof of principle for vaccination-based immunotherapies to treat fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4296029856,"Genetic and environmental manipulations, such as dietary restriction, can improve both health span and lifespan in a wide range of organisms, including humans. Changes in nutrient intake trigger often overlapping metabolic pathways that can generate distinct or even opposite outputs depending on several factors, such as when dietary restriction occurs in the lifecycle of the organism or the nature of the changes in nutrients. Due to the complexity of metabolic pathways and the diversity in outputs, the underlying mechanisms regulating diet-associated pro-longevity are not yet well understood. Adult reproductive diapause (ARD) in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is a dietary restriction model that is associated with lengthened lifespan and reproductive potential. To explore the metabolic pathways regulating ARD in greater depth, we performed a candidate-based genetic screen analyzing select nutrient-sensing pathways to determine their contribution to the regulation of ARD. Focusing on the three phases of ARD (initiation, maintenance, and recovery), we found that ARD initiation is regulated by fatty acid metabolism, sirtuins, AMPK, and the O-linked N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) pathway. Although ARD maintenance was not significantly influenced by the nutrient sensors in our screen, we found that ARD recovery was modulated by energy sensing, stress response, insulin-like signaling, and the TOR pathway. Further investigation of downstream targets of NHR-49 suggest the transcription factor influences ARD initiation through the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. Consistent with these findings, our analysis revealed a change in levels of neutral lipids associated with ARD entry defects. Our findings identify conserved genetic pathways required for ARD entry and recovery and uncover genetic interactions that provide insight into the role of OGT and OGA."
https://openalex.org/W4296031147,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a transformative effect on individuals across the world, including those in healthcare. Transformative learning is an educational theory in which an individual's worldview is fundamentally altered through conscious reflection (Cognitive Rational), insights (Extrarational), or social reform (Social Critique). We utilized transformative learning theory to characterize the experiences of medical trainees during the pandemic.We used the Transformative Learning Survey in September and October 2020 to evaluate the processes and outcomes of transformative learning in health professions students and housestaff at an academic medical center during the pandemic. We analyzed survey scores for three process domains and four outcome subdomains. We inductively coded the survey's two open-ended questions and performed qualitative and mixed-methods analyses.The most prominent TL outcome was Self-Awareness, Acting Differently was intermediate, and Openness and Worldview Shifts were lowest. Cognitive Rational and Social Critique processes were more prominent than Extrarational processes. Students were more likely than housestaff to undergo transformative learning through the Social Critique process (p = 0.025), in particular the sub-processes of Social Action (p = 0.023) and Ideology Critique (p = 0.010). Qualitative analysis via the aggregation of codes identified four responses to the pandemic: negative change, positive change, existential change, or no change. Negative changes (67.7%) were most common, with students reporting more of these changes than housestaff (74.8% vs 53.6%; p < 0.01). Only 8.4% of reported changes could be defined as transformative.Through the theoretical lens of transformative learning, our study provides insight into the lives of learners during the pandemic. Our finding that medical students were more likely to use Social Critique processes has multiple parallels in the literature. If leaders in academic medicine desire to create enlightened change agents through transformative learning, such education must continue throughout graduate medical education and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4296031318,"The objective of this study was to optimize the organic selenium (Se) requirements of intensively reared silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). A total of n = 300 juveniles silver carp 11.40±0.52 cm long, and average weighing 25.28±0.18 grams were randomly assigned to 15 aquaria (20 fish/100L aquaria) and subjected to five different dietary Se levels in a completely randomized design. The diets were pelleted supplemented with exogenous Se methionine @ 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 mg/kg of the diet. The fourteen days of aquaria acclimatization was given to fish and then an 84-day feeding trial was conducted. The group supplemented with 0.9 mg/kg Se had greater feed intake, gain in length, body weight %, and specific growth rate with a better feed conversion ratio as compared to those fed on the rest of the dietary levels or control (P<0.05). The deposition of Se was greater in the liver, and kidneys of the fishes fed on diets containing 0.9 and 1.2 mg Se levels than in the rest of the treatments (P<0.05). However, dietary Se levels had no effects on the bioaccumulation of Se in muscle tissues (P>0.05). The proximate analysis showed that dry matter, crude protein, and fat contents of meat were not changed (P>0.05) by dietary treatments. Similarly, values of TBARS, RBCs, Hb, and blood glucose contents were similar (P>0.05) across the treatments. However, the concentration of WBCs, HCT, and MCHC was greater in those groups fed on 0.9 and 1.2 Se levels than in those fed on 0.6, 0.3, and 0.0 Se levels respectively (P<0.05). The activities of ALT, AST, and ALP were lowered in the 0.9 mg Se supplemented fishes compared with the rest of the treatments (P<0.05). The SOD, catalases, and GPx levels for muscle, liver, and whole body were greater (P<0.05) in the Se-supplemented groups than in the control. These outcomes indicated that up to 0.9 mg/kg inclusion of methionine-based Se in the diet of juvenile silver carp improved the growth performance, feed conversion ratio, organs Se enrichment, and antioxidant status without any compromise on meat quality."
https://openalex.org/W4296037078,"High-resolution population mapping is of high relevance for developing and implementing tailored actions in several fields: From decision making in crisis management to urban planning. Earth Observation has considerably contributed to the development of methods for disaggregating population figures with higher resolution data into fine-grained population maps. However, which method is most suitable on the basis of the available data, and how the spatial units and accuracy metrics affect the validation process is not fully known. We aim to provide recommendations to researches that attempt to produce high-resolution population maps using remote sensing and geospatial information in heterogeneous urban landscapes. For this purpose, we performed a comprehensive experimental research on population disaggregation methods with thirty-six different scenarios. We combined five different top-down methods (from basic to complex, i.e., binary and categorical dasymetric, statistical, and binary and categorical hybrid approaches) on different subsets of data with diverse resolutions and degrees of availability (poor, average and rich). Then, the resulting population maps were systematically validated with a two-fold approach using six accuracy metrics. We found that when only using remotely sensed data the combination of statistical and dasymetric methods provide better results, while highly-resolved data require simpler methods. Besides, the use of at least three relative accuracy metrics is highly encouraged since the validation depends on level and method. We also analysed the behaviour of relative errors and how they are affected by the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. We hope that our recommendations save additional efforts and time in future population mapping."
https://openalex.org/W4295960241,"Lysosomal amino acid efflux by proton-driven transporters is essential for lysosomal homeostasis, amino acid recycling, mTOR signaling, and maintaining lysosomal pH. To unravel the mechanisms of these transporters, we focus on cystinosin, a prototypical lysosomal amino acid transporter that exports cystine to the cytosol, where its reduction to cysteine supplies this limiting amino acid for diverse fundamental processes and controlling nutrient adaptation. Cystinosin mutations cause cystinosis, a devastating lysosomal storage disease. Here, we present structures of human cystinosin in lumen-open, cytosol-open, and cystine-bound states, which uncover the cystine recognition mechanism and capture the key conformational states of the transport cycle. Our structures, along with functional studies and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopic investigations, reveal the molecular basis for the transporter's conformational transitions and protonation switch, show conformation-dependent Ragulator-Rag complex engagement, and demonstrate an unexpected activation mechanism. These findings provide molecular insights into lysosomal amino acid efflux and a potential therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4296025768,"Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) has been widely explored for its ability to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), however, mostly under the assumption that the human head is homogenous. In addition to CBF, knowledge of extracerebral layers, such as skull thickness, can be informative and crucial for patient with brain complications such as traumatic brain injuries. To bridge the gap, this study explored the feasibility of simultaneously extracting skull thickness and flow in the cortex layer using DCS. We validated a two-layer analytical model that assumed the skull as top layer with a finite thickness and the brain cortex as bottom layer with semi-infinite geometry. The model fitted for thickness of the top layer and flow of the bottom layer, while assumed other parameters as constant. The accuracy of the two-layer model was tested against the conventional single-layer model using measurements from custom made two-layer phantoms mimicking skull and brain. We found that the fitted top layer thickness at each source detector (SD) distance is correlated with the expected thickness. For the fitted bottom layer flow, the two-layer model fits relatively consistent flow across all top layer thicknesses. In comparison, the conventional one-layer model increasingly underestimates the bottom layer flow as top layer thickness increases. The overall accuracy of estimating first layer thickness and flow depends on the SD distance in relationship to first layer thickness. Lastly, we quantified the influence of uncertainties in the optical properties of each layer. We found that uncertainties in the optical properties only mildly influence the fitted thickness and flow. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously extracting of layer thickness and flow using a two-layer DCS model. Findings from this work may introduce a robust and cost-effective approach towards simultaneous bedside assessment of skull thickness and cerebral blood flow."
https://openalex.org/W4296034406,"The complex relationship between incarceration and cancer survival has not been thoroughly evaluated. We assessed whether cancer diagnosis during incarceration or the immediate post-release period is associated with higher rates of mortality compared with those never incarcerated.We conducted a population-based study using a statewide linkage of tumor registry and correctional system movement data for Connecticut adult residents diagnosed with invasive cancer from 2005 through 2016. The independent variable was place of cancer diagnosis: during incarceration, within 12 months post-release, and never incarcerated. The dependent variables were five-year cancer-related and overall survival rates.Of the 216,540 adults diagnosed with invasive cancer during the study period, 239 (0.11%) people were diagnosed during incarceration, 479 (0.22%) within 12 months following release, and the remaining were never incarcerated. After accounting for demographics and cancer characteristics, including stage of diagnosis, the risk for cancer-related death at five years was significantly higher among those diagnosed while incarcerated (AHR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.12-1.73) and those recently released (AHR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.57-2.10) compared to the never-incarcerated group. The risk for all-cause mortality was also higher for those diagnosed with cancer while incarcerated (AHR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.63-2.26) and those recently released (AHR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.94-2.45).There is a higher risk of cancer mortality among individuals diagnosed with cancer during incarceration and in the first-year post-release, which is not fully explained by stage of diagnosis. Cancer prevention and treatment efforts should target people who experience incarceration and identify why incarceration is associated with worse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4296035233,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a veterinary and human pathogen and is an agent of bioterrorism concern. Currently, RVFV treatment is limited to supportive care, so new drugs to control RVFV infection are urgently needed. RVFV is a member of the order Bunyavirales , whose replication depends on the enzymatic activity of the viral L protein. Screening for RVFV inhibitors among compounds with divalent cation-coordinating motifs similar to known viral nuclease inhibitors identified 47 novel RVFV inhibitors with selective indexes from 1.1–103 and 50% effective concentrations of 1.2–56 μM in Vero cells, primarily α-Hydroxytropolones and N-Hydroxypyridinediones. Inhibitor activity and selective index was validated in the human cell line A549. To evaluate specificity, select compounds were tested against a second Bunyavirus, La Crosse Virus (LACV), and the flavivirus Zika (ZIKV). These data indicate that the α-Hydroxytropolone and N-Hydroxypyridinedione chemotypes should be investigated in the future to determine their mechanism(s) of action allowing further development as therapeutics for RVFV and LACV, and these chemotypes should be evaluated for activity against related pathogens, including Hantaan virus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus."

The main objective of this investigation was to approach, for the first time, the study of genetic variants in several polygenic profiles and their role in elite endurance and professional football performance by comparing the allelic and genotypic frequencies to the non-athlete population. In this study, genotypic and allelic frequencies were determined in 452 subjects: 292 professional athletes (160 elite endurance athletes and 132 professional football players) and 160 non-athlete subjects. Genotyping of polymorphisms in liver metabolisers (CYP2D6, GSTM1, GSTP and GSTT), iron metabolism and energy efficiency (HFE, AMPD1 and PGC1a), cardiorespiratory fitness (ACE, NOS3, ADRA2A, ADRB2 and BDKRB2) and muscle injuries (ACE, ACTN3, AMPD1, CKM and MLCK) was performed by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Single Nucleotide Primer Extension (PCR-SNPE). The combination of the polymorphisms for the ""optimal"" polygenic profile was quantified using the genotype score (GS) and total genotype score (TGS). Statistical differences were found in the genetic distributions between professional athletes and the non-athlete population in liver metabolism, iron metabolism and energy efficiency, and muscle injuries (p<0.001). The binary logistic regression model showed a favourable OR (odds ratio) of being a professional athlete against a non-athlete in liver metabolism (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.28-3.01; p = 0.002), iron metabolism and energy efficiency (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.42-3.43; p < 0.001), and muscle injuries (OR: 2.70; 95% CI: 1.75-4.16; p < 0.001) in the polymorphisms studied.

https://openalex.org/W4295948234,"Bacteria encode reverse transcriptases (RTs) of unknown function that are closely related to group II intron-encoded RTs. We found that a Pseudomonas aeruginosa group II intron-like RT (G2L4 RT) with YIDD instead of YADD at its active site functions in DNA repair in its native host and when expressed in Escherichia coli. G2L4 RT has biochemical activities strikingly similar to those of human DNA repair polymerase θ and uses them for translesion DNA synthesis and double-strand break repair (DSBR) via microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). We also found that a group II intron RT can function similarly in DNA repair, with reciprocal active-site substitutions showing isoleucine favors MMEJ and alanine favors primer extension in both enzymes. These DNA repair functions utilize conserved structural features of non-LTR-retroelement RTs, including human LINE-1 and other eukaryotic non-LTR-retrotransposon RTs, suggesting such enzymes may have inherent ability to function in DSBR in a wide range of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W4296026614,"COVID-19 has caused negative emotional responses in patients, with significant mental health consequences for the infected population. The need for an in-depth analysis of the emotional state of COVID-19 patients is imperative. This study employed semi-structured interviews and the text mining method to investigate features in lived experience narratives of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls with respect to five basic emotions. The aim was to identify differences in emotional status between the two matched groups of participants. The results indicate generally higher complexity and more expressive emotional language in healthy controls than in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, narratives of fear, happiness, and sadness by COVID-19 patients were significantly shorter as compared to healthy controls. Regarding lexical features, COVID-19 patients used more emotional words, in particular words of fear, disgust, and happiness, as opposed to those used by healthy controls. Emotional disorder symptoms of COVID-19 patients at the lexical level tended to focus on the emotions of fear and disgust. They narrated more in relation to self or family while healthy controls mainly talked about others. Our automatic emotional discourse analysis potentially distinguishes clinical status of COVID-19 patients versus healthy controls, and can thus be used to predict mental health disorder symptoms in COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W4296027176,"A novel Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) combined Fuzzy-Twin Support Vector Machine Model with deep learning mechanism is devised in this research study to forecast the solar Photovoltaic (PV) output power in day ahead basis. The raw data from the solar PV farms are highly fluctuating and to extract the useful stable components VMD is employed. A novel Fuzzy–Twin Support Vector Machine (FTSVM) model developed acts as the forecasting model for predicting the solar PV output power for the considered solar farms. The twin support vector machine (SVM) model formulates two separating hyperplanes for predicting the output power and in this research study a fuzzy based membership function identifies most suitable two SVM prediction hyperplanes handling the uncertainties of solar farm data. For the developed, new VMD-FTSVM prediction technique, their optimal parameters for the training process are evaluated with the classic Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithm. The solar PV output power is predicted using the novel VMD-FTSVM model and during the process multi-kernel functions are utilized to devise the two fuzzy based hyperplanes that accurately performs the prediction operation. Deep learning (DL) based training of the FTSVM model is adopted so that the deep auto-encoder and decoder module enhances the accuracy rate.

Results prove that the proposed model outperforms the existing model in terms of the performance metrics evaluated and the forecasted PV Power."
https://openalex.org/W4296037361,"Background A re-emergence of COVID-19 occurred in the northeast of China in early 2021. Different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions, from mass testing to city-level lockdown, were implemented to contain the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Our study is aimed to evaluate the impact of multi-level control measures on the second-wave SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the most affected cities in China. Methods Five cities with over 100 reported COVID-19 cases within one month from Dec 2020 to Feb 2021 were included in our analysis. We fitted the exponential growth model to estimate basic reproduction number ( R 0 ), and used a Bayesian approach to assess the dynamics of the time-varying reproduction number ( R t ). We fitted linear regression lines on R t estimates for comparing the decline rates of R t across cities, and the slopes were tested by analysis of covariance. The effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) was quantified by relative R t reduction and statistically compared by analysis of variance. Results A total of 2,609 COVID-19 cases were analyzed in this study. We estimated that R 0 all exceeded 1, with the highest value of 3.63 (1.36, 8.53) in Haerbin and the lowest value of 2.45 (1.44, 3.98) in Shijiazhuang. Downward trends of R t were found in all cities, and the starting time of R t &lt; 1 was around the 12th day of the first local COVID-19 cases. Statistical tests on regression slopes of R t and effect of NPIs both showed no significant difference across five cities ( P = 0.126 and 0.157). Conclusion Timely implemented NPIs could control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with low-intensity measures for places where population immunity has not been established."
https://openalex.org/W4296164166,"Recent studies suggest that ultra-high dose rates of proton radiation (>40 Gy/s; FLASH) confer less toxicity to exposed healthy tissue and reduce cognitive decline compared with conventional radiation dose rates (~1 Gy/s), but further preclinical data are required to demonstrate this sparing effect. In this study, postnatal day 11 (P11) rats were treated with whole brain irradiation with protons at a total dose of 0, 5, or 8 Gy, comparing a conventional dose rate of 1 Gy/s vs. a FLASH dose rate of 100 Gy/s. Beginning on P64, rats were tested for locomotor activity, acoustic and tactile startle responses (ASR, TSR) with or without prepulses, novel object recognition (NOR; 4-object version), striatal dependent egocentric learning ([configuration A] Cincinnati water maze (CWM-A)), prefrontal dependent working memory (radial water maze (RWM)), hippocampal dependent spatial learning (Morris water maze (MWM)), amygdala dependent conditioned freezing, and the mirror image CWM [configuration B (CWM-B)]. All groups had deficits in the CWM-A procedure. Weight reductions, decreased center ambulation in the open-field, increased latency on day-1 of RWM, and deficits in CWM-B were observed in all irradiated groups, except the 5 Gy FLASH group. ASR and TSR were reduced in the 8 Gy FLASH group and day-2 latencies in the RWM were increased in the FLASH groups compared with controls. There were no effects on prepulse trials of ASR or TSR, NOR, MWM, or conditioned freezing. The results suggest striatal and prefrontal cortex are sensitive regions at P11 to proton irradiation, with reduced toxicity from FLASH at 5 Gy."
https://openalex.org/W4296025726,"In Ghana, many persons with physical disabilities are members of populations who face health disparities including physical, structural, knowledge, attitudinal and financial barriers to various health care services compared to those without disabilities. However, there is limited evidence on how to improve access to primary health care services for persons with physical disabilities. This study aimed to understand persons with physical disabilities’ experiences and health care providers’ perspectives for improving access to primary health care for persons with disabilities in rural Ghana. We used a qualitative approach and interviewed 33 persons with physical disabilities and health care providers, and thematically analysed data from in-depth interviews. We identified 4 major themes. According to the participants, health care could be more accessible by: i) Making it more affordable; ii) Increasing the availability of providers and services; iii) Providing more education about system navigation; and iv) Improving access to disability friendly health facilities and equipment. Participants’ recommendations were nested in the areas of policy and practice modifications. Policy makers need to consider supporting persons with physical disabilities who cannot afford non-medical services (i.e., cost of transportation). In terms of practice, the provision of education and training related to physical disability issues should be extended to both clinical and nonclinical health workers for better client centered care. There is an urgent need for policy makers and relevant key stakeholders to include persons with physical disabilities in designing and implementing policies and programs to ensure that they are meeting their needs."
https://openalex.org/W4296028416,"The objective was to analyze the clinical characteristics and pathological characteristics of sural biopsy in nitrous oxide (N2O) -induced peripheral neuropathy.We recruited 18 patients with N2O abuse-induced neurological disorders and reported their demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and nerve conduction studies. Seven patients underwent sural nerve biopsy pathologic examination.All 18 patients had polyneuropathy, the nerve conduction results showed significant reductions in motor and sensory amplitudes, slowing of conduction velocities, and prolongation of latencies in most tested nerves compared to the controls. Toluidine blue staining of semi-thin sections of sural nerve biopsy showed decreased myelinated nerve fiber density, increased thin myelinated nerve fiber density, and axonal regeneration. Electron microscopy showed axonal degeneration and nerve regeneration.The main manifestations of peripheral nerve damage caused by the abuse of N2O are lower limb weakness and distal sensory disorder. The nerve conduction study results demonstrated that mixed axonal and demyelinating neuropathy was the most common type of neuropathy. Sural biopsy showed the main pathological change was chronic axonal degeneration."

Comprehensive explorations of the caregiver experiences in this area are also lacking.To describe the experiences of being treated for drug-resistant tuberculosis of children and their caregivers.This was a qualitative study done using focus group discussions (FGDs) among three different groups of participants: 1) health care providers involved in the care of children being treated for DR-TB (including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists)-herein referred to as providers; 2) household caregivers of children being treated for DR-TB-herein referred to as caregivers; and 3) children who were being treated for DR-TB-herein referred to as children. The population was a convenience sample and included children hospitalized between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020, ages 0-14 years old, as well as their caregivers and providers. Focus group transcripts and notes were analysed using a thematic network analysis based in grounded theory The analysis was iterative and the coding system developed focused on ""stressful experiences"" as well as ways to address them along the diagnostic and treatment journey. This paper follows the COREQ guidelines.16 children between the ages 7 and 14 years participated in 5 FGDs, 30 caregivers participated in 7 FGDs, and 12 providers participated in 3 FDGs. Data from the children and the caregivers were the focus of this analysis, although some themes were informed by the discussions with the providers as well. In general, it was reported that for a child diagnosed with DR-TB, there is a lived experience of stress that impacts their physical, mental, and social well-being. These pediatric patients and their families therefore develop strategies for coping with these disruptions to their lives. In general, there were major disruptive experiences that resulted from the process around receiving a diagnosis of DR-TB and second distinct set of stressful experiences that occurred during the treatment of DR-TB once the diagnosis had been made. These stresses occur in the physical, mental, and social realms, and families develop multiple strategies to cope with them, demonstrating resilience in the face of this disease.Addressing the stresses experienced by children and their caregivers through child-friendly DR-TB testing, treatment, and counseling is not only essential for ending TB but also for enacting a human-rights based approach to child health in general. Children with DR-TB are a vulnerable population, and they have often been the last to benefit from advances in general pediatric care and in DR-TB care more specifically."

T . forsythia shares a distant genetic linkage to Bacteroidetes thetaiotaomicron and may therefore produce analogous polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) which enable complex carbohydrate degradation, import, and use, although this capacity has yet to be demonstrated. Chondroitin sulfate A is a linear, sulfated carbohydrate linked to periodontal disease as the principal species of glycosaminoglycan appended on the surface of cortical bone of teeth and in supporting dental ligaments. Through genomic comparisons with B . thetaiotaomicron , a new PUL-like operon (Bfo2285-Bfo2295, and Bfo3043) was identified in T . forsythia and the crystal structure of two proteins from this PUL-like operon, Bfo2290 and Bfo2294, were reported using X-ray crystallography. Enzyme kinetics for Bfo2290 were reported using a pH-dependent assay and suggested a K m of 0.75 mg/ml ± 0.60 mg/ml, K cat of 3.74 min -1 ± 0.88 min -1 , and V max of 7.48 μM/min ± 1.76 μM/min with partially degraded chondroitin sulfate A. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis was used to show the processive degradation of chondroitin sulfate A by the proteins encoded in T . forsythia PUL-like operon, and revealed Bfo2291 and Bfo2290 to be an endolytic chondroitin sulfate A lyase and exolytic ΔDi-4S chondroitin sulfate A sulfatase, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4296031309,"Deficits in spatial navigation in three-dimensional space are prevalent in various neurological disorders and are a sensitive cognitive marker for prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, but are also associated with non-pathological aging. However, standard neuropsychological tests used in clinical settings lack ecological validity to adequately assess spatial navigation. Experimental paradigms, on the other hand, are often too difficult for seniors or patients with cognitive or motor impairments since most require operating a human interface device (HID) or use complex episodic memory tasks. Here, we introduce an intuitive navigation assessment, which is conceptualized using cognitive models of spatial navigation and designed to account for the limited technical experience and diverging impairments of elderly participants and neurological patients. The brief computer paradigm uses videos of hallways filmed with eye tracking glasses, without employing an episodic memory task or requiring participants to operate a HID. Proof of concept data from 34 healthy, middle-aged and elderly participants (56–78 years) provide evidence for the assessment’s feasibility and construct validity as a navigation paradigm. Test performance showed normal distribution and was sensitive to age and education, which needs to be considered when investigating the assessment’s psychometric properties in larger samples and clinical populations. Correlations of the navigation assessment with other neuropsychological tests confirmed its dependence on visuospatial skills rather than visual episodic memory, with age driving the association with working memory. The novel paradigm is suitable for a differentiated investigation of spatial navigation in elderly individuals and promising for experimental research in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W4296034223,"We propose a stacked convolutional neural network incorporating a novel and efficient pyramid residual attention (PRA) module for the task of automatic segmentation of dermoscopic images. Precise segmentation is a significant and challenging step for computer-aided diagnosis technology in skin lesion diagnosis and treatment. The proposed PRA has the following characteristics: First, we concentrate on three widely used modules in the PRA. The purpose of the pyramid structure is to extract the feature information of the lesion area at different scales, the residual means is aimed to ensure the efficiency of model training, and the attention mechanism is used to screen effective features maps. Thanks to the PRA, our network can still obtain precise boundary information that distinguishes healthy skin from diseased areas for the blurred lesion areas. Secondly, the proposed PRA can increase the segmentation ability of a single module for lesion regions through efficient stacking. The third, we incorporate the idea of encoder-decoder into the architecture of the overall network. Compared with the traditional networks, we divide the segmentation procedure into three levels and construct the pyramid residual attention network (PRAN). The shallow layer mainly processes spatial information, the middle layer refines both spatial and semantic information, and the deep layer intensively learns semantic information. The basic module of PRAN is PRA, which is enough to ensure the efficiency of the three-layer architecture network. We extensively evaluate our method on ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that PRAN can obtain better segmentation performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning models under the same experiment environment conditions."

Approximately 14% of low-income PLWH report housing instability or temporary housing, and up to 70% report being unemployed. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of an intervention to improve housing and employment for PLWH in the Midwest. Participants (N = 87) were recruited from the Kansas City metropolitan area to participate in a one-year intervention to improve housing and employment. All individuals were living with HIV and were not stably housed, fully employed, nor fully engaged in HIV medical care. A series of generalized estimating equations were conducted using client-level longitudinal data to examine how housing, employment, viral load, and retention in care changed over time. Housing improved from baseline to follow-up, with more individuals reporting having stable housing (OR = 23.5; p < 0.001). Employment also improved from baseline to follow-up, with more individuals reporting full-time employment (OR = 1.9; p < 0.001). Viral suppression improved from baseline to follow-up, with more individuals being virally suppressed (OR = 1.6; p < 0.05). Retention in care did not change significantly from baseline to follow-up (OR = 0.820; p = 0.370). Client navigation seems to be a promising intervention to improve housing and employment for PLWH in the Midwest. Additional research is needed on the impact of service coordination on client-level outcomes. Future studies should be conducted on the scalability of client navigation interventions to improve the lives of low-income, underserved PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W4296039108,"To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 570 million cases and over 6 million deaths worldwide. Predominant clinical testing methods, though invaluable, may create an inaccurate depiction of COVID-19 prevalence due to inadequate access, testing, or most recently under-reporting because of at-home testing. These concerns have created a need for unbiased, community-level surveillance. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been used for previous public health threats, and more recently has been established as a complementary method of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Here we describe the application of wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in two university campus communities located in rural Lincoln Parish, Louisiana. This cost-effective approach is especially well suited to rural areas where limited access to testing may worsen the spread of COVID-19 and quickly exhaust the capacity of local healthcare systems. Our work demonstrates that local universities can leverage scientific resources to advance public health equity in rural areas and enhance their community involvement."
https://openalex.org/W4296039486,"To build a full picture of previous studies on the origins of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), this paper exploits an active learning-based approach to screen scholarly articles about the origins of SARS-CoV-2 from many scientific publications. In more detail, six seed articles were utilized to manually curate 170 relevant articles and 300 nonrelevant articles. Then, an active learning-based approach with three query strategies and three base classifiers is trained to screen the articles about the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Extensive experimental results show that our active learning-based approach outperforms traditional counterparts, and the uncertain sampling query strategy performs best among the three strategies. By manually checking the top 1,000 articles of each base classifier, we ultimately screened 715 unique scholarly articles to create a publicly available peer-reviewed literature corpus, COVID-Origin . This indicates that our approach for screening articles about the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W4296027046,"Haloclavidae Verrill, 1899 is a family of burrowing sea anemones grouped within the superfamily Actinioidea (Rafinesque, 1815). Currently, it includes 30 species in 10 genera. Characters given for this family in descriptions of its taxa have not been consistent, with numerous exceptions to the expectations of the familial diagnosis. Previous phylogenetic analyses have shown that Haloclavidae is potentially a polyphyletic group, but resolution of relationships of the few representatives of Haloclavidae included in analyses has been problematic. Here we address questions of monophyly and affinity of Haloclavidae using three mitochondrial and two nuclear markers. We assess the monophyly of Haloclavidae in the context of all major lineages of Actiniaria Hertwig, 1882, emphasizing diversity of superfamily Actinioidea. We use parsimony-based character optimization to interpret the distribution of key traits in the superfamily. We find that Haloclavidae is not monophyletic and propose two new families, Peachiidae fam. nov. and Harenactidae fam. nov., while also retaining some species in the family Haloclavidae, so that taxonomy better reflects relationships and diversity of the group. In addition, we redescribe a species within the newly created Peachiidae, Peachia chilensis Carlgren, 1931. We use recent larval samples obtained in Antofagasta, Chile, and the histological slides from the original description to redescribe P. chilensis, to provide a complete account of cnidae, external, and internal morphology. Finally, we compare P. chilensis to other burrowing anemones found in Chile and provide an understanding of the genus Peachia that reflects recent phylogenetic perspective on diversity of anemones previously assigned to family Haloclavidae."
https://openalex.org/W4296027401,"A vehicular network offers diverse beneficial services related to video streaming in different types of setups, including rural and urban. Some of the recent issues in vehicular communication include prospect of leveraging machine learning and blockchain for privacy and security enhancement, and resource allocation for video streaming coupled with integration of 6G networks for high data rate. Considering the extreme mobility and dynamic structure of vehicular networks and the high data rates of video streams, a unitary route may not support the required quality of a video stream. To achieve load balancing, connectivity among vehicles, path diversity, and low delay, the multipath transmission with a delay-tolerant network ( DTN ) concept based on a node disjoint algorithm is considered. In this proposed study, video frames are categorized in accordance with priority and forwarded via two graded paths. The first path carries the video reference frame, which is the most important frame for video decoding. The second path carries neighboring frames during video transmission. For the efficient selection of an optimal relay vehicle, a communication cost function is introduced into the existing DTN . This communication cost function is based on three key enhancement parameters: link stability rate, accessible bandwidth estimation, and transmission delay. The improvement in this study, is the integration of store-carry-forward strategy to the existing multipath data forwarding strategy. On the basis of the simulation outcomes, the proposed multipath video data communication in a vehicular DTN (MVDTN) scheme can enhance video data delivery in terms of packet loss ratio, end-to-end delay, structural similarity index measure, and peak signal-to-noise ratio. Considering the aforementioned metrics, our proposed schemes outperform the baseline schemes, namely, road-based multi-metrics forwarder selection evaluation for multipath video streaming and quality of service-aware multipath video streaming for an urban vehicular ad hoc network by using ant colony optimization."

The K-SF-42 is a new short form of the Arizona Life History Battery. We obtained empirical evidence that the original seven-factor structure could be applied to the Japanese translated version of K-SF-42 (K-SF-42-J). We also observed good internal consistency of the seven scales of K-SF-42-J. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis findings suggest that the K-SF-42-J can be used in both sexes and diverse age groups. The K-SF-42-J scales showed similar correlates as the English original, with higher scores of other life history strategy measurement, trait emotional intelligence, well-being, and cultural and social resources in childhood. Use of the K-SF-42-J will allow researchers with Japanese speaking samples to integrate their findings with the existing life history strategy research literature.

Although previous studies have evaluated clinical factors related to surveillance failure, none have focused specifically on US blind spots.This study included 1,289 patients who underwent 6 months intervals surveillance using US and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and were eventually diagnosed with single-nodular HCC. Patients were divided into US-detected group (n = 1,062) and US-missed group (HCC detected only by AFP ≥ 20ng/mL; n = 227). Blind spots consisted of four locations: hepatic dome, caudate lobe or around the inferior vena cava, <1 cm beneath the ribs, and the surface of the left lateral segment. Both groups were compared by HCC location, proportional distribution, treatment method, and overall survival.A higher proportion of HCCs were located within blind spots in the US-missed group than in the US-detected group (64.3% vs. 44.6%, P < 0.001). HCC ≥ 2 cm detected in blind spots was higher than in non-blind areas (60.3% vs. 47.1%, P = 0.001). Blind spot HCCs were more treated with surgery, whereas those located in a non-blind area were more treated with local ablation. Patients with an HCC located within a blind spot in the US-detected group had better overall survival than the same in the US-missed group (P = 0.008).Using the current surveillance test, blind spots affected the initially detected HCC tumor size, applicability of the treatment modality, and overall survival. Physicians should pay attention to US blind spots when performing US-based HCC surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W4296028969,"Adaptive radiations offer an excellent opportunity to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics of gut microbiota and host niche specialization. In a laboratory common garden, we compared the gut microbiota of two novel derived trophic specialist pupfishes, a scale-eater and a molluscivore, to closely related and distant outgroup generalist populations, spanning both rapid trophic evolution within 10 kya and stable generalist diets persisting over 11 Mya. We predicted an adaptive and highly divergent microbiome composition in the trophic specialists reflecting their rapid rates of craniofacial and behavioral diversification. We sequenced 16S rRNA amplicons of gut microbiomes from lab-reared adult pupfishes raised under identical conditions and fed the same high protein diet. In contrast to our predictions, gut microbiota largely reflected phylogenetic distance among species, rather than generalist or specialist life history, in support of phylosymbiosis. However, we did find significant enrichment of Burkholderiaceae bacteria in replicated lab-reared scale-eater populations. These bacteria sometimes digest collagen, the major component of fish scales, supporting an adaptive shift. We also found some enrichment of Rhodobacteraceae and Planctomycetia in lab-reared molluscivore populations, but these bacteria target cellulose. Overall phylogenetic conservation of microbiome composition contrasts with predictions of adaptive radiation theory and observations of rapid diversification in all other trophic traits in these hosts, including craniofacial morphology, foraging behavior, aggression, and gene expression, suggesting that the functional role of these minor shifts in microbiota will be important for understanding the role of the microbiome in trophic diversification."

Materials and methods Personal information was collected using a questionnaire, and a venous blood sample was drawn at the end of a work shift from the bakers and from a control group. The average wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index was measured in the workplaces of both the bakers and the controls. Results This cross-sectional study involved 137 bakers working in 20 bakeries and 107 controls who were comparable in terms of likely confounding factors. Hemoglobin and platelet values were abnormal among the bakers and statistically significantly different to the control group (P = 0.026, and P = 0.016 respectively). The average WBGT index in the bakeries was 37.4°C, while the average WBGT in the workplaces of the controls was 25.5°C, (P&lt;0.0001). Conclusions The changes in the bakers’ hematological parameters were found to be associated with exposure to high environmental heat at bakeries, as measured by the WBGT index. Preventive measures should be introduced to reduce the adverse effect of heat exposure among bakers and directed toward the worker–equipment–environment triad."
https://openalex.org/W4296036357,"In an error-prone development process, the ability to localize faults is a crucial one. Generally speaking, detecting and repairing errant behavior at an early stage of the development cycle considerably reduces costs and development time. The debugging of the Verilog program takes much time to read the waveform and capture the signal, and in many cases, problem-solving relies heavily on experienced developers. Most existing Verilog fault localization methods utilize the static analysis method to find faults. However, using static analysis methods exclusively may result in some types of faults being inevitably ignored. The use of dynamic analysis could help resolve this issue. Accordingly, in this work, we propose a new fault localization approach for Verilog, named Detraque. After obtaining dynamic execution through test cases, Detraque traces these executions to localize faults; subsequently, it can determine the likelihood of any Verilog statement being faulty and sort the statements in descending order by suspicion score. Through conducting empirical research on real Verilog programs with 61 faulty versions, Detraque can achieve an EXAM score of 18.3%. Thus, Detraque is verified as able to improve Verilog fault localization effectiveness when used as a supplement to static analysis methods."

https://openalex.org/W4296038729,"Objective To explore the moderating effects of sociodemographic and work-related variables on levels of burnout and mental health among medical residents. Method A cross-sectional online survey was administered at the beginning of the second wave of COVID-19 at different public teaching hospitals where medical residents practiced in Mexico City. A total of 201 medical residents of different years completed the survey. Results Different univariate inferential analyses on the level of burnout and mental health indices showed significant differences between sex, marital status, previous reports of physical illness or psychological conditions, and residency ranking. However, the effect sizes of those differences were of low to medium size. A predictive path analysis revealed that the three stages of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and achievement dissatisfaction) negatively affect psychological wellbeing and positively affect psychological distress. Finally, even though sociodemographic variables showed some significant variation, the effect sizes were small and did not moderate the direct effect of burnout on mental health indices. Conclusions Medical residents deling with every day medical situations, will be exposed to stressors that might increase the probability to experience emotional exhaustion. This would negatively affect levels of wellbeing and positively affect distress, despite their sociodemographic characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4296077713,"Purpose Accurate evaluation of the cup-to-disc ratio is crucial for optometrists and may be influenced by their clinical experience. The study’s objective was to compare the thresholds for discriminating vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR) between years 2, 3, and 4 clinical optometry trainees. Methods One hundred fundus photos with various VCDR sizes were selected from a clinic database. The median VCDR (0.43) photo was assigned as the standard, while the other 99 were assigned as the test photos. The participant’s task was to discriminate using a 2-alternate-forced-choice paradigm whether the test photos’ VCDR were larger or smaller than the standard VCDR. Data were fit with a Weibull function, and three discrimination thresholds were determined: the point of subjective equality (PSE), the range of VCDR uncertainty, and the ability to judge VCDR that was 0.1 unit larger than the standard photo. Results Year 4 trainees had better VCDR discrimination thresholds. However, the difference between the three participant groups was not statistically different for all measurements (PSE: F(2,27) = 0.43, p = 0.657; VCDR uncertainty range: F(2,27) = 0.12, p = 0.887), and thresholds for correctly discriminating VCDR 0.1 larger than the standard photo’s VCDR: F(2,27) = 0.69, p = 0.512). Conclusion Although Year 4 optometry trainees performed slightly better at estimating VCDR than their Year 3 and Year 2 peers, the number of years of clinical experiences did not significantly affect their VCDR discrimination thresholds when 2-dimensional fundus photos were used as stimuli."

Descriptive study was conducted at Shegaw Motta General Hospital and Motta Health Centre. The data were collected from June-20 to July-20, 2021 G.C. Fifteen essential medicines from both health facilities' tracer drug lists were reviewed. The frequency and percentage of availability and stick-out duration were calculated, and the results were briefly described in the text and displayed in tables. The average availability of essential medicines on the day of the survey was 80% and 93.3% in Shegaw Motta general hospital and Motta health center, respectively. Besides, 60% and 20% of the essential medicines were stocked out at least once in the last six months (before the data collection period) in the hospital and health center, respectively. The average stock-out duration in the last six months period (before the data collection period) was 38.8 days (ranges from 10 days to 157 days) in the hospital and 11.2 days in the health center. Ferrous salt + folic acid 150mg + 0.5mg and Medroxy Progesterone injection were the medicines with the longest stock-out duration in Shegaw Motta general hospital and Motta health center, respectively.The average availability of essential medicines was fairly high both in the hospital and health center.

https://openalex.org/W4296078127,"Though previous work has examined infant attention across a variety of tasks, less is known about the individual saccades and fixations that make up each bout of attention, and how individual differences in saccade and fixation patterns (i.e., scanning efficiency) change with development, scene content and perceptual load. To address this, infants between the ages of 5 and 11 months were assessed longitudinally (Experiment 1) and cross-sectionally (Experiment 2). Scanning efficiency (fixation duration, saccade rate, saccade amplitude, and saccade velocity) was assessed while infants viewed six quasi-naturalistic scenes that varied in content (social or non-social) and scene complexity (3, 6 or 9 people/objects). Results from Experiment 1 revealed moderate to strong stability of individual differences in saccade rate, mean fixation duration, and saccade amplitude, and both experiments revealed 5-month-old infants to make larger, faster, and more frequent saccades than older infants. Scanning efficiency was assessed as the relation between fixation duration and saccade amplitude, and results revealed 11-month-olds to have high scanning efficiency across all scenes. However, scanning efficiency also varied with scene content, such that all infants showing higher scanning efficiency when viewing social scenes, and more complex scenes. These results suggest both developmental and stimulus-dependent changes in scanning efficiency, and further highlight the use of saccade and fixation metrics as a sensitive indicator of cognitive processing."
https://openalex.org/W4296161402,"This study aimed to investigate the visibility of colors in congenitally color vision defect people using general and fluorescent colors in an environment simulating sunset to examine the standards for high-visibility safety clothing for general users. Twenty participants with normal trichromats, seven protanopes, and five deuteranopes were included, with mean ages (± standard deviation) of 21.0±1.0, 46,7±16.1, and 56.6±6.9 years, respectively. Dyed fabrics were used to evaluate visibility. We evaluated brightness and conspicuousness sensitivity by combining red, yellow-red, yellow, green, red-purple, blue, white, black, fluorescent yellow, and fluorescent orange. For brightness sensitivity, the combination of fluorescent yellow and white/yellow stripes was highly visible and significantly different from all other samples (p &lt; 0.05). For conspicuousness sensitivity, the combinations of black/fluorescent yellow, black/yellow, black/white, black/yellow-red, and white/red-purple stripes were highly visible and significantly different from all the other samples (p &lt; 0.05). Yellow light is most visible and even better when fluorescent. They are based on specific spectral sensitivity, and yellow is the most visible, even for congenitally colorblind individuals. Furthermore, with regard to color combinations, it was found that the contrast between two distinct light or dark colors, such as black, yellow, black, and white, is perceived to be equally noticeable by congenital color vision defect individuals. This suggests the possible further applications of safety clothing."
https://openalex.org/W4296164168,"Galactinol synthase (GolS) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs), which serve as storage and transport sugars, signal transducers, compatible solutes and antioxidants in higher plants. The present work aimed to assess the potential functions of citrus GolS in mechanisms of stress response and tolerance. By homology searches, eight GolS genes were found in the genomes of Citrus sinensis and C. clementina. Phylogenetic analysis showed that there is a GolS ortholog in C. clementina for each C. sinensis GolS, which have evolved differently from those of Arabidopsis thaliana. Transcriptional analysis indicated that most C. sinensis GolS (CsGolS) genes show a low-level tissue-specific and stress-inducible expression in response to drought and salt stress treatments, as well as to 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' infection. CsGolS6 overexpression resulted in improved tobacco tolerance to drought and salt stresses, contributing to an increased mesophyll cell expansion, photosynthesis and plant growth. Primary metabolite profiling revealed no significant changes in endogenous galactinol, but different extents of reduction of raffinose in the transgenic plants. On the other hand, a significant increase in the levels of metabolites with antioxidant properties, such as ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, alfa-tocopherol and spermidine, was observed in the transgenic plants. These results bring evidence that CsGolS6 is a potential candidate for improving stress tolerance in citrus and other plants."
