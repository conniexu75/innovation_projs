https://openalex.org/W1990460541,"Formation of uridine-5'-phosphate from uridine and inorganic phosphate in aqueous solution is effected by the following condensing agents: cyanogen, cyanoformamide, cyanate, cyanamide, thioformate, ethylisocyanide, and a watersoluble carbodiimide. The yields are always small, even when a large excess of condensing agent is used. The cyclization of uridine-3'-(2')-phosphate occurs under the same conditions but in much greater yield."

https://openalex.org/W2041149974,"Charge-mosaic membranes are prepared by embedding a single layer of alternating cation and anion exchange beads in silicone resin. Membranes made in an identical manner but containing only one type of exchanger serve as controls. The mosaic membranes are 50 to 100 times more permeable to potassium chloride than the controls; and furthermore they give rise to net volume flow from concentrated to dilute solutions of potassium chloride in the absence of a pressure gradient (""negative osmosis""), whereas the controls exhibit normal osmotic behavior. The negative reflection coefficients of the mosaics suggest potential applications in desalination."

https://openalex.org/W2035809424,"Delayed-type cutaneous hypersensitivity to sheep erythrocytes was induced in rats by intradermal injection of the antigen mixed with Freund's adjuvant; hypersensitivity was sustained by weekly injections. Either passive immunization with rat antiserum to sheep erythrocytes or intravenous injection of sheep erythrocytes partially suppressed induction of hypersensitivity; these procedures used together specifically and completely suppressed induction of hypersensitivity. Complete suppression was sustained by antigen given intravenously before each weekly injection of the mixture of antigen and adjuvant. These findings provide the rational basis of a simple method for prolonging survival of allografts with only the biological agents, antigen and antibody, of the immunological response."

https://openalex.org/W2080260941,"How great a genetic load can a population tolerate ? This subject has recently been discussed by several authors1–5. We believe that a most important point can be stated briefly: because most organisms produce far more offspring than are necessary to maintain a constant population density, and because population densities remain, very roughly, constant, many individuals die before they are mature; it does not matter whether they die of starvation, accidents or from genetic ailments; the population can still maintain itself. It is not so much that there is a genetic load which might threaten the species, but that there is an ecological load, resulting from density regulation, which because it must, as Darwin noted, produce natural selection, gives rise to the apparent genetic load. A population will be able to tolerate what seems to us a considerable genetic load, without being, on that account, in any danger of extinction. The genetic load is, for the most part, merely an expression of the fact that not all genotypes are equally viable when the population becomes crowded. Many individuals have to die in the process of density regulation, and if those which die differ genetically from those which survive, we will observe a “genetic load”. This is the crux of the Malthus—Darwin concept of selection. This does not of course apply to genetic conditions which are markedly disabling at all population densities; there must be a decided limit (although a fairly high one, for the dead individuals simply leave more food or space for others, which otherwise would die) to the number of these which a population can contain. We suggest the term “loaded” for this last kind of selection."

The degree of lobulo-alveolar differentiation is increased if estradiol, progesterone, and aldosterone are also included in the culture media."
https://openalex.org/W2063676468,"Explants of C3H-mouse and rat R3230AC mammary carcinomas were cultured on chemically defined medium for study of the effects of the hormonal environment on synthesis of DNA. Synthesis in the more slowly proliferating C3H carcinoma cells is stimulated by insulin and inhibited by estrogenic hormones as in normal mammary epithelial cells. Rat R3230AC mammary carcinoma cells can initiate synthesis of DNA independently of insulin or estrogenic hormones. Autonomous growth with respect to these hormonal controls correlates with rapid proliferation, but it is not an essential characteristic of the neoplastic mammary cell."

The results of chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis of this fragment and of the intact RNA itself indicate that the fragment has the composition (10 Cp, 4 Up), and that the RNA has the terminal sequence -GP(9 Cp, 4 Up) CpA. These conclusions are supported by the results of an application of the sedimentation-equilibrium method in which the molecular weight of the Qbeta fragment was compared with that of the corresponding fragment from f2 phage RNA for which the terminal sequence, -GpUpUpApCpCpApCpCpCpA had previously been determined."
https://openalex.org/W2001677400,"THERE is an extensive literature on the photochemical reactions involved in the production of smog, which is reviewed in refs. 1. and 2. Early investigations of this problem3–5 revealed that at extremely low concentrations the oxidative constituents could damage the leaves of certain plants, and that differences in the leaf damage of plants at specified stages in their development could be used to characterize various types of smog oxidants6–8 Went9 contrasts the vulnerability of the photosynthetic cells in a leaf, which must operate by gaseous diffusion in very low carbon dioxide gradients between the free air and the cell contents, with the relatively protected position of the corresponding cells in the human respiratory system. He points out the advantages of exploiting the sensitivity of plant cells to give warning that the tolerance levels in pollution are being exceeded."

Although it is known that cyanide in the body is chiefly detoxified to thiocyanate and that smokers show higher serum thiocyanate concentrations than non-smokers4, no study of serum thiocyanate concentrations in those affected by tobacco amblyopia has been reported."

https://openalex.org/W2022529538,"Goldfish were trained to press a lever on a 10:1 fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement. They were extinguished under three conditions. Responding was followed by (i) solenoid noise and water delivery formerly associated with food reinforcement, (ii) solenoid noise only, or (iii) nothing. The number of extinction responses was largest in condition 1, less in condition 2, and smallest in condition 3, thus providing evidence for conditioned reinforcement in goldfish."

https://openalex.org/W2090874975,"WE agree with Glooschenko and Curl, in the preceding communication, that species which produce autospores may have a mechanism of cell division different from those species like diatoms and dinoflagellates, which always form two cells. We believe, however, that cell division is always triggered only after growth and maturation of the cells. We chose autotrophic species and cultured them in a simple mineral medium, so that for growth and maturation they needed a light period. Full maturation—replication of DNA—can, as we saw, take place in the dark. After this period of DNA replication the autospores are formed, but they do not grow in the dark. They accumulate and start growing synchronously in the next light period."
