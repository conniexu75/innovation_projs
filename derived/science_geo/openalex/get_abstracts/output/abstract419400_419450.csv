These cells come in many flavors, as determined by differences in gene expression, cell surface phenotype and specific function. Schulz et al. (p. 86 , published online 22 March) investigated whether adult macrophages all share a common developmental origin. Immune cells, including most macrophages, are widely thought to arise from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which require the transcription factor Myb for their development. Analysis of Myb-deficient mice revealed that a population of yolk-sac–derived, tissue-resident macrophages was able to develop and persist in adult mice in the absence of HSCs. Importantly, yolk sac–derived macrophages also contributed substantially to the tissue macrophage pool even when HSCs were present."

Here, we show that in germ-free (GF) mice, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells accumulate in the colonic lamina propria and lung, resulting in increased morbidity in models of IBD and allergic asthma as compared with that of specific pathogen-free mice. This was associated with increased intestinal and pulmonary expression of the chemokine ligand CXCL16, which was associated with increased mucosal iNKT cells. Colonization of neonatal-but not adult-GF mice with a conventional microbiota protected the animals from mucosal iNKT accumulation and related pathology. These results indicate that age-sensitive contact with commensal microbes is critical for establishing mucosal iNKT cell tolerance to later environmental exposures."

Several studies have used ablation strategies to demonstrate that certain neuronal populations in the brain are needed for memory expression, but whether a particular ensemble is sufficient to elicit a behavioural outcome from a particular memory has remained unexplored. Now, Susumu Tonegawa and colleagues use optogenetics to demonstrate that a particular, targeted memory 'engram', or group of cells, that was active during fear-learning is sufficient to drive freezing behaviour in mice during subsequent reactivations. A specific memory is thought to be encoded by a sparse population of neurons1,2. These neurons can be tagged during learning for subsequent identification3 and manipulation4,5,6. Moreover, their ablation or inactivation results in reduced memory expression, suggesting their necessity in mnemonic processes. However, the question of sufficiency remains: it is unclear whether it is possible to elicit the behavioural output of a specific memory by directly activating a population of neurons that was active during learning. Here we show in mice that optogenetic reactivation of hippocampal neurons activated during fear conditioning is sufficient to induce freezing behaviour. We labelled a population of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated during fear learning with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)7,8 and later optically reactivated these neurons in a different context. The mice showed increased freezing only upon light stimulation, indicating light-induced fear memory recall. This freezing was not detected in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing ChR2 in a similar proportion of cells, nor in fear-conditioned mice with cells labelled by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead of ChR2. Finally, activation of cells labelled in a context not associated with fear did not evoke freezing in mice that were previously fear conditioned in a different context, suggesting that light-induced fear memory recall is context specific. Together, our findings indicate that activating a sparse but specific ensemble of hippocampal neurons that contribute to a memory engram is sufficient for the recall of that memory. Moreover, our experimental approach offers a general method of mapping cellular populations bearing memory engrams."

An article placed in the cloak therefore vanishes from view, creating no shadow or reflection. Such devices have been demonstrated, but only for a particular band of frequencies. Confirming theoretical work that predicts such cloaking should be possible down to zero frequency, Gömöry et al. (p. 1466 ) designed a cloak for a dc magnetic field. With a composite design of ferromagnetic and superconducting material, together with a relatively simple structure, the device could potentially find immediate application."
https://openalex.org/W1974332185,"Bonded at the Source Asymmetric catalysis is a relatively mature field in the laboratory, with a diverse array of techniques available for the selective transformation of organic compounds. However, scaling up these techniques for industrial application remains challenging, in part because many catalysts act best on reagents that have been expensively modified, although this process often generates copious waste. Zbieg et al. (p. 324 , published online 22 March) combat this challenge with a ruthenium-based catalyst that couples an unmodified bulk commodity feedstock (butadiene) with alcohols, forming carbon-carbon bonds to generate complex products with high selectivity."

https://openalex.org/W2053477349,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an altered immune response, resulting in chronic increased inflammatory cytokine production with a prominent role of TNF-α. TNF-α signals are mediated by two receptors: TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Signaling through TNFR2 is associated with neuroprotection, whereas signaling through TNFR1 is generally proinflammatory and proapoptotic. Here, we have identified a TNF-α-induced proinflammatory agent, lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) via gene array in murine primary cortical neurons. Further investigation showed that Lcn2 protein production and secretion were activated solely upon TNFR1 stimulation when primary murine neurons, astrocytes, and microglia were treated with TNFR1 and TNFR2 agonistic antibodies. Lcn2 was found to be significantly decreased in CSF of human patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD and increased in brain regions associated with AD pathology in human postmortem brain tissue. Mechanistic studies in cultures of primary cortical neurons showed that Lcn2 sensitizes nerve cells to β-amyloid toxicity. Moreover, Lcn2 silences a TNFR2-mediated protective neuronal signaling cascade in neurons, pivotal for TNF-α-mediated neuroprotection. The present study introduces Lcn2 as a molecular actor in neuroinflammation in early clinical stages of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2164816766,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a reversible enzyme that catalyzes the NADP(+)-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate (ICT) to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and the NADPH/CO(2)-dependent reductive carboxylation of αKG to ICT. Reductive carboxylation by IDH1 was potently inhibited by NADP(+) and, to a lesser extent, by ICT. IDH1 and IDH2 with cancer-associated mutations at the active site arginines were unable to carry out the reductive carboxylation of αKG. These mutants were also defective in ICT decarboxylation and converted αKG to 2-hydroxyglutarate using NADPH. These mutant proteins were thus defective in both of the normal reactions of IDH. Biochemical analysis of heterodimers between wild-type and mutant IDH1 subunits showed that the mutant subunit did not inactivate reductive carboxylation by the wild-type subunit. Cells expressing the mutant IDH are thus deficient in their capacity for reductive carboxylation and may be compromised in their ability to produce acetyl-CoA under hypoxia or when mitochondrial function is otherwise impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2088689184,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in post-transcriptional fashion, and emerging studies support their importance in regulating many biological processes, including myogenic differentiation and muscle development. miR-29 is a promoting factor during myogenesis but its full spectrum of impact on muscle cells has yet to be explored. Here we describe an analysis of miR-29 affected transcriptome in C2C12 muscle cells using a high throughput RNA-sequencing platform. The results reveal that miR-29 not only functions to promote myogenic differentiation but also suppresses the transdifferentiation of myoblasts into myofibroblasts. miR-29 inhibits the fibrogenic differentiation through down-regulating both extracellular matrix genes and cell adhesion genes. We further demonstrate that miR-29 is under negative regulation by TGF-beta (TGF-β)–Smad3 signaling via dual mechanisms of both inhibiting MyoD binding and enhancing Yin Yang 1 (YY1)-recruited Polycomb association. Together, these results identify miR-29 as a pleiotropic molecule in both myogenic and fibrogenic differentiation of muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077397459,"Small cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCCC) is very rare, and due to the long time period required to recruit sufficient numbers of patients, there is a paucity of information regarding the prognostic factors associated with survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been used as cancer-related biomarkers in a variety of tumor types, and the objective of this study was to determine whether microRNA expression profiles can predict clinical outcome in SCCC.Forty-four patients with SCCC who underwent radical hysterectomy between January 2000 and October 2009 were enrolled. Using the GeneCopoeia All-in-One™ Customized Human qPCR Primer Array, the expression profiles of 30 miRNAs associated with tumor metastasis was obtained from the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples of all 44 patients. Seven miRNAs, has-let-7c, has-miR-10b, has-miR-100, has-miR-125b, has-miR-143, has-miR-145 and has-miR-199a-5p were significantly down-regulated in advanced stage SCCC patients (FIGO IB2-IV) compared to early stage SCCC patients (FIGOIB1). Among, downregulation of six miRNAs, has-let-7c, has-miR-100, has-miR-125b, has-miR-143, has-miR-145 and has-miR-199a-5p were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and reduced survival in SCCC. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed that SCCC patients with low expression of has-miR-100 (P = 0.019) and has-miR-125b (P = 0.020) projected a significant tendency towards poorer prognosis.This study demonstrates that downregulation of 7 miRNA associated with advanced stage, 6 miRNAs with metastasis and 2 with poor prognosis in SCCC. Functional analysis of these miRNAs may enhance our understanding of SCCC, as altered expression of specific miRNAs may regulate the metastatic pathway and provide novel targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1964416229,"In the early immune response to Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (iRBC), Natural Killer (NK) cells are activated, which suggests an important role in innate anti-parasitic immunity. However, it is not well understood whether NK cells directly recognize iRBC or whether stimulation of NK cells depends mainly on activating signals from accessory cells through cell-to-cell contact or soluble factors. In the present study, we investigated the influence of membrane-bound host Heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 in triggering cytotoxicity of NK cells from malaria-naïve donors or the cell line NK92 against iRBC. Hsp70 and HLA-E membrane expression on iRBC and potential activatory NK cell receptors (NKG2C, CD94) were assessed by flow cytometry and immunoblot. Upon contact with iRBC, Granzyme B (GzmB) production and release was initiated by unstimulated and Hsp70-peptide (TKD) pre-stimulated NK cells, as determined by Western blot, RT-PCR and ELISPOT analysis. Eryptosis of iRBC was determined by Annexin V-staining. Our results suggest that presence of Hsp70 and absence of HLA-E on the membrane of iRBC prompt the infected host cells to become targets for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as evidenced by impaired parasite development. Contact of iRBC with NK cells induced release of GzmB. We propose that following GzmB uptake, iRBC undergo eryptosis via a perforin-independent, GzmB-mediated mechanism. Since NK activity toward iRBC could be specifically enhanced by TKD peptide and abrogated to baseline levels by blocking Hsp70 exposure, we propose TKD as an innovative immunostimulatory agent to be tested as an adjunct to anti-parasitic treatments in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2084951510,"Topological band insulators have recently been discovered in spin-orbit coupled two and three dimensional systems. In this work, we theoretically predict a class of topological Mott insulators where interaction effects play a dominant role. In actinide elements, simple rocksalt compounds formed by Pu and Am lie on the boundary of metal to insulator transition. We show that interaction drives a quantum phase transition to a topological Mott insulator phase with a single Dirac cone on the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2032979718,"Coordination of the onset of flowering with developmental status and seasonal cues is critical for reproductive success in plants. Molecular genetic studies on Arabidopsis mutants that have alterations in flowering time have identified a wide array of genes that belong to distinct genetic flowering pathways. The flowering time genes are regulated through versatile molecular and biochemical mechanisms, such as controlled RNA metabolism and chromatin modifications. Recent studies have shown that a group of AT-hook DNA-binding motif-containing proteins plays a role in plant developmental processes and stress responses. Here, we demonstrate that the AT-hook protein AHL22 (AT-hook motif nuclear localized 22) regulates flowering time by modifying FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) chromatin in Arabidopsis. AHL22 binds to a stretch of the AT-rich sequence in the FT locus. It interacts with a subset of histone deacetylases. An Arabidopsis mutant overexpressing the AHL22 gene (OE-AHL22) exhibited delayed flowering, and FT transcription was significantly reduced in the mutant. Consistent with the delayed flowering and FT suppression in the OE-AHL22 mutant, histone 3 (H3) acetylation was reduced and H3 lysine 9 dimethylation was elevated in the FT chromatin. We propose that AHL22 acts as a chromatin remodeling factor that modifies the architecture of FT chromatin by modulating both H3 acetylation and methylation.

The timing of flowering initiation is regulated through coordinated interactions of developmental programs, such as gibberellic acid, and seasonal cues, including photoperiod, exposure to prolonged low temperature (vernalization), and ambient temperature (1Amasino R.

Expression of flowering time genes is modulated through various molecular and biochemical mechanisms in addition to the ordinary gene transcriptional regulation. Examples include controlled RNA metabolism, which is governed primarily by RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, and epigenetic regulation, which is mediated mainly by histone modifications and DNA methylation (4Simpson G.G.

MiR172 induces degradation of gene transcripts encoding a small group of APETALA2 (AP2)-like transcription factors that act as floral repressors (5Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Bartel B. MicroRNAS and their regulatory roles in plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 19-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Expression of flowering time genes is also regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that include post-translational modifications of histone and nonhistone proteins. Regulation of flowering initiation by histone modifications has been studied extensively in FLC chromatin. Molecular characterization of FLC repressors and activators in recent years has shown that at least three regulatory systems, vernalization, FRIGIDA (FRI), and autonomous pathway components, regulate FLC activity by modifying the FLC chromatin. It is known that specific lysine (K) residues in the N-terminal region of H3 are either methylated or acetylated (6He Y. Control of the transition to flowering by chromatin modifications.Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 554-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). H3 trimethylation at Lys-4 and acetylation are associated with active FLC expression. In contrast, H3 deacetylation and methylation at Lys-9 and Lys-27 repress the FLC expression (6He Y. Control of the transition to flowering by chromatin modifications.Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 554-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

The matrix attachment region (MAR), which is also called the scaffold attachment region, is a stretch of AT-rich DNA sequence (ATR) that guides binding of genomic DNA to the nuclear matrix (10Rudd S.

Therefore, MAR acts as a structural determinant of chromatin organization and recruits multiple MAR-binding factors that facilitate remodeling of the chromatin structure in regulating gene expression (12Wang T.Y.

One example is the AT-hook motif nuclear localized 22 (AHL22) protein that belongs to the AHL family consisting of 29 members in Arabidopsis (22Fujimoto S. Matsunaga S. Yonemura M. Uchiyama S. Azuma T. Fukui K. Identification of a novel plant MAR DNA-binding protein localized on chromosomal surfaces.Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 56: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the AHL22 gene delays flowering, and FT expression is reduced in the transgenic plants (19Xiao C. Chen F. Yu X. Lin C. Fu Y.F.

In contrast, silencing of four AHL genes (AHL22, AHL18, AHL27, and AHL29) promotes flowering, suggesting that the AHL22 gene, and some other AHL genes as well, act as a floral repressors, possibly by modulating FT expression. Here, we show that the AHL22 protein binds to an ATR sequence element within the FT locus, which has previously been predicted as a intragenic MAR (10Rudd S. Frisch M. Grote K. Meyers B.C. Mayer K.

H3 acetylation was significantly reduced in the AHL22-overexpressing OE-AHL22 mutant. We also found that H3K9 dimethylation in the FT chromatin was elevated in the mutant, suggesting that AHL22 may also interact with histone methyltransferases. Our observations indicate that the FT chromatin is coordinately regulated through H3 acetylation and methylation during floral transition. Arabidopsis thaliana lines used were in Columbia (Col-0) background. Arabidopsis plants were grown in a controlled culture room at 23 °C under long days (LDs, 16-h light/8-h dark). To produce transgenic plants overexpressing Arabidopsis genes, the gene sequences were subcloned into the binary pB2GW7 vector under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S-promoter (Invitrogen).

The presence of a single T-DNA insertion event in the OE-AHL22 mutant was verified by genomic Southern blot analysis using the 35S-enhancer sequence as probe. The flanking genomic sequences of the T-DNA insertion site were determined by a plasmid rescue method (15Weigel D. Ahn J.H. Blázquez M.A. Borevitz J.O. Christensen S.K. Fankhauser C. Ferrándiz C.

Activation tagging in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Transcript levels were examined by either Southern blot hybridization of semi-quantitative RT-PCR products or by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). RNA sample preparations, PCR conditions, and data processing have been described previously (23Kim Y.S. Kim S.G. Park J.E. Park H.Y. Lim M.H. Chua N.H. Park C.M. A membrane-bound NAC transcription factor regulates cell division in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3132-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR was carried out in 96-well blocks with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR System using the SYBR Green I master mix in a volume of 20 μl. The two-step thermal cycling profile used was denaturation for 15 s at 94 °C and extension for 1 min at 68 °C. The comparative ΔΔCT method was used to evaluate the relative quantities of each amplified product in the samples. The threshold cycle (CT) was automatically determined for each reaction by the system set with default parameters. The specificity of amplifications was determined by melt curve analysis of the amplified products using the standard method installed in the system. The eIF4A (eukaryotic initiation factor 4A) gene (At3g13920) was included in the reactions as internal control for normalizing the variations in the cDNA amounts used. The RT-PCR and qRT-PCR primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. Plants were grown in soil under LDs until flowering. Flowering times were determined by counting the number of rosette leaves at bolting. Fifteen to 20 plants were counted and averaged for each measurement. Binding of AHL22 to FT DNA was examined using recombinant the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-AHL22 fusion protein essentially as described previously (24Parviz F. Hall D.D. Markwardt D.D. Heideman W. Transcriptional regulation of CLN3 expression by glucose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but with some modifications. The recombinant MBP-AHL22 fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21-codon Plus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After induction for 5 h at room temperature, E. coli cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm PMSF. The cells were lysed by French press (8500 psi, three times). The cell lysates were sonicated for 30 s twice and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use. For purification of the fusion protein, 1 ml of cell lysates was mixed with amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed 3 times with fresh lysis buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The air-dried membrane blot was immersed in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.00, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride) and gently shaken for 10 min at 4 °C. Renaturation of the bound proteins and MAR-binding assays were carried out as described previously (24Parviz F. Hall D.D. Markwardt D.D. Heideman W. Transcriptional regulation of CLN3 expression by glucose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4508-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ChIP assays were performed as described previously (25Yang S.D. Seo P.J. Yoon H.K. Park C.M. The Arabidopsis NAC transcription factor VNI2 integrates abscisic acid signals into leaf senescence via the COR/RD genes.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 2155-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using 2-week-old plants grown under LDs on ½ × Murashige & Skoog (MS)-agar plates (hereafter, referred to as MS-agar plates). Briefly, rosette leaves were vacuum-infiltrated with 1% formaldehyde for cross-linking and ground in liquid nitrogen after quenching the cross-linking process. Chromatin preparations were sonicated into 0.5–1-kb fragments. Specific antibodies against MYC (catalog number 05-419), H3Ac (catalog number 06-599), H3K9me2 (catalog number 07-212), and H3K27me3 (catalog number 07-449) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were added to the chromatin solution, which was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose beads. The precipitates were eluted from the beads. Cross-links were reversed, and residual proteins were removed by incubation with proteinase K. DNA was recovered using the QIAquick spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantitative PCR was used to determine the amounts of genomic DNA enriched in the chromatin samples. The primers were designed to amplify DNA fragments of 100–200 bp (supplemental Table S1). EMSAs were carried out as described previously (25Yang S.D. Seo P.J. Yoon H.K. Park C.M. The Arabidopsis NAC transcription factor VNI2 integrates abscisic acid signals into leaf senescence via the COR/RD genes.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 2155-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using recombinant MBP-AHL22 fusion protein. Double-stranded DNA fragments were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The radiolabeled DNA fragments were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μg of the MBP-AHL22 fusion protein in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol) supplemented with 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) in the presence or absence of competitor DNA fragments. The reaction mixtures were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried on Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray films. A full-size AHL22 cDNA was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-coding sequence in the p2FGW7 vector (Invitrogen), and the fusion construct was transformed into Col-0 plants. Lateral roots were subject to fluorescence microscopy. For bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, a full-size AHL22 cDNA was fused in-frame to either the 5′ end of a DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal half of EYFP in the pSATN-nEYFP-C1 vector (E3081) or to the 3′ end of a DNA sequence encoding the C-terminal half of EYFP in the pSATN-cEYFP-C1 vector (E3082). The pSAT vectors were kindly provided by Stanton Gelvin (Purdue University). The expression constructs were cotransformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts by a polyethylene glycol-calcium transfection method (26Yoo S.D. Cho Y.H. Sheen J. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. A versatile cell system for transient gene expression analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3223) Google Scholar). YFP signals were analyzed 14–18 h after transfection by fluorescence microscopy using the Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Yena, Germany). HDAC cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into the pGBKT7 vector, which contains the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter upstream of the multiple cloning sequence. [35S]-Labeled HDAC proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription/translation using the TnT SP6 wheat germ extract-coupled system (Promega, Madison, WI). The MBP-mAHL22 gene fusion was subcloned into the pMAL-c2X E. coli expression vector, and recombinant MBP-mAHL22 protein was prepared as described with the recombinant MBP-AHL22 protein above. In vitro pulldown assays were carried out as described previously (27Hong S.Y. Kim O.K. Kim S.G. Yang M.S. Park C.M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 1659-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using 5 μl of 35S-labeled HDAC polypeptides and 5 μg of MBP alone or MBP fusion proteins. A promoter region consisting of a ∼2-kbp sequence upstream of the transcription start site of the AHL22 gene was transcriptionally fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS)-coding sequence, and the pAHL22-GUS fusion was transformed into Col-0 plants. The pFT-GUS construct has been described previously (28Takada S. Goto K. Terminal flower2, an Arabidopsis homolog of heterochromatin protein1, counteracts the activation of flowering locus T by constans in the vascular tissues of leaves to regulate flowering time.Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2856-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Plant sample processing and histochemical detection of GUS activities were carried out as described previously (25Yang S.D. Seo P.J. Yoon H.K. Park C.M. The Arabidopsis NAC transcription factor VNI2 integrates abscisic acid signals into leaf senescence via the COR/RD genes.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 2155-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The AHL22-overexpressing OE-AHL22 mutant exhibited delayed flowering with small, curled rosette leaves (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1A). It was also featured by having short siliques and altered floral structure (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). We mapped the site of T-DNA insertion by a plasmid rescue method (15Weigel D. Ahn J.H. Blázquez M.A. Borevitz J.O. Christensen S.K. Fankhauser C. Ferrándiz C. Kardailsky I. Malancharuvil E.J. Neff M.M. Nguyen J.T. Sato S. Wang Z.Y. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Harrison M.J. Lamb C.J. Yanofsky M.F. Chory J. Activation tagging in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). It was found that the T-DNA element was inserted adjacent to the At2g45430 locus in the mutant (Fig. 1B). Genomic Southern blot hybridization confirmed that there was a single T-DNA insertion event in the mutant (supplemental Fig. S2A). Gene expression assays showed that the At2g45430 gene was activated significantly in the mutant (supplemental Fig. S2B), suggesting that activation of the At2g45430 gene correlates with the OE-AHL22 phenotypes. To examine the co-relationship, the At2g45430 gene was overexpressed driven by the CaMV 35S-promoter in Col-0 plants. The resulting 35S:AHL22 transgenic plants recapitulated the OE-AHL22 phenotypes (Fig. 1A), indicating that the At2g45430 activation underlies the OE-AHL22 phenotypes. The At2g45430 gene has previously been named AT-hook motif nuclear localized 22 (AHL22) (19Xiao C. Chen F. Yu X. Lin C. Fu Y.F.

Two AHL22-deficient mutants, ahl22-1 and ahl22-2, were isolated from the T-DNA insertion pool deposited in the ABRC. The knock-out mutants did not show discernible phenotypes (Fig. 1A), possibly because of extensive functional redundancy between AHL22 and other AHL genes (19Xiao C. Chen F. Yu X. Lin C. Fu Y.F.

https://openalex.org/W2046524892,"Recent developments in the field of optical super-resolution techniques allow both a 10-fold increase in resolution as well as an increased ability to quantify the number of labeled molecules visualized in the fluorescence measurement. By using photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and an experimental approach based on the systematic comparison with a nonclustering peptide as a negative control, we found that the prototypical G protein-coupled receptor β2-adrenergic receptor is partially preassociated in nanoscale-sized clusters only in the cardiomyocytes, such as H9C2 cells, but not in other cell lines, such as HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO). The addition of the agonist for very short times or the addition of the inverse agonist did not significantly affect the organization of receptor assembly. To investigate the mechanism governing cluster formation, we altered plasma membrane properties with cholesterol removal and actin microfilament disruption. Although cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes and it is supposed to be enriched in the lipid rafts, its sequestration and removal did not affect receptor clustering, whereas the inhibition of actin polymerization did decrease the number of clusters. Our findings are therefore consistent with a model in which β2 receptor clustering is influenced by the actin cytoskeleton, but it does not rely on lipid raft integrity, thus ruling out the possibility that cell type-specific β2 receptor clustering is associated with the raft."
https://openalex.org/W2158493725,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have been proposed as novel treatments for intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that when MSCs are co-cultured with nucleus pulposus (NP) cells with direct cell-cell contact, they differentiate along the NP lineage and simultaneously stimulate the degenerate NP cell population to regain a normal (non-degenerate) phenotype, an effect which requires cell-cell communication. However, the mechanisms by which NP cells and MSCs interact in this system are currently unclear. Thus, in this study we investigated a range of potential mechanisms for exchange of cellular components or information that may direct these changes, including cell fusion, gap-junctional communication and exchange of membrane components by direct transfer or via microvesicle formation. Flow cytometry of fluorescently labeled MSCs and NP cells revealed evidence of some cell fusion and formation of gapjunctions, although at the three timepoints studied these phenomena were detectable only in a small proportion of cells. While these mechanisms may play a role in cell-cell communication, the data suggests they are not the predominant mechanism of interaction. However, flow cytometry of fluorescently dual-labeled cells showed that extensive bi-directional transfer of membrane components is operational during direct co-culture of MSCs and NP cells. Furthermore, there was also evidence for secretion and internalization of membrane-bound microvesicles by both cell types. Thus, this study highlights bi-directional intercellular transfer of membrane components as a possible mechanism of cellular communication between MSC and NP cells."

The goal of this study was to demonstrate whether the use of CPAP produces significant changes in the heart rate or in the heart rate variability of patients with OSA in the first night of treatment and whether gender and obesity play a role in these differences.Single-center transversal study including patients with severe OSA corrected with CPAP. Only patients with total correction after CPAP were included. Patients underwent two sleep studies on consecutive nights: the first night a basal study, and the second with CPAP. We also analyzed the heart rate changes and their relationship with CPAP treatment, sleep stages, sex and body mass index. Twenty-minute segments of the ECG were selected from the sleep periods of REM, no-REM and awake. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were studied by comparing the R-R interval in the different conditions. We also compared samples from the basal study and CPAP nights.39 patients (15 females, 24 males) were studied. The mean age was 50.67 years old, the mean AHI was 48.54, and mean body mass index was 33.41 kg/m(2) (31.83 males, 35.95 females). Our results showed that HRV (SDNN) decreased after the use of CPAP during the first night of treatment, especially in non-REM sleep. Gender and obesity did not have any influence on our results.These findings support that cardiac variability improves as an acute effect, independently of gender or weight, in the first night of CPAP use in severe OSA patients, supporting the idea of continuous use and emphasizing that noncompliance of CPAP treatment should be avoided even if it is just once."
https://openalex.org/W2097113131,"Lactate is shuttled between organs, as demonstrated in the Cori cycle. Although the brain releases lactate at rest, during physical exercise there is a cerebral uptake of lactate. Here, we evaluated the cerebral lactate uptake and release in hypoxia, during exercise and when the two interventions were combined. We measured cerebral lactate turnover via a tracer dilution method ([1-(13)C]lactate), using arterial to right internal jugular venous differences in 9 healthy individuals (5 males and 4 females), at rest and during 30 min of submaximal exercise in normoxia and hypoxia (F(i)o(2) 10%, arterial oxygen saturation 72 ± 10%, mean ± sd). Whole-body lactate turnover increased 3.5-fold and 9-fold at two workloads in normoxia and 18-fold during exercise in hypoxia. Although middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity increased during exercise in hypoxia, calculated cerebral mitochondrial oxygen tension decreased by 13 mmHg (P<0.001). At the same time, cerebral lactate release increased from 0.15 ± 0.1 to 0.8 ± 0.6 mmol min(-1) (P<0.05), corresponding to ∼10% of cerebral energy consumption. Concurrently, cerebral lactate uptake was 1.0 ± 0.9 mmol min(-1) (P<0.05), of which 57 ± 9% was oxidized, demonstrating that lactate oxidation may account for up to ∼33% of the energy substrate used by the brain. These results support the existence of a cell-cell lactate shuttle that may involve neurons and astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1991507999,"Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with progressive impairment of right ventricular function, reduced exercise capacity and a poor prognosis. Little is known about the prevalence, clinical manifestation and impact of atrial fibrillation (AF) on cardiac function in PH. Methods In a four year single-centre retrospective analysis 225 patients with confirmed PH of various origins were enrolled to investigate the prevalence of AF, and to assess the clinical manifestation, 6-minute walk distance, NT-proBNP levels, echocardiographic parameters and hemodynamics obtained by right heart catheterization in PH with AF. Results AF was prevalent in 31.1%. In patients with PH and AF, parameters of clinical deterioration (NYHA/WHO functional class, 6-minute walk distance, NT-proBNP levels) and renal function were significantly compromised compared to patients with PH and sinus rhythm (SR). In the total PH cohort and in PH not related to left heart disease occurrence of AF was associated with an increase of right atrial pressure (RAP) and right atrial dilatation. While no direct association was found between pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and AF in these patients, right ventricular function was reduced in AF, indicating more advanced disease. In PH due to left heart failure the prevalence of AF was particularly high (57.7% vs. 23.1% in other forms of PH). In this subgroup, left atrial dilatation, increase of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PAP and RAP were more pronounced in AF than in SR, suggesting that more marked backward failure led to AF in this setting. Conclusion PH is associated with increased prevalence of AF. Occurrence of AF in PH indicates clinical deterioration and more advanced disease."
https://openalex.org/W2087877601,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Recent studies demonstrate that fetal programming of PKCε gene repression results in ischemia-sensitive phenotype in the heart. The present study tests the hypothesis that increased norepinephrine causes epigenetic repression of PKCε gene in the heart via Nox1-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Prolonged norepinephrine treatment increased ROS production in fetal rat hearts and embryonic ventricular myocyte H9c2 cells via a selective increase in Nox1 expression. Norepinephrine-induced ROS resulted in an increase in PKCε promoter methylation at Egr-1 and Sp-1 binding sites, leading to PKCε gene repression. N-acetylcysteine, diphenyleneiodonium, and apocynin blocked norepinephrine-induced ROS production and the promoter methylation, and also restored PKCε mRNA and protein to control levels in vivo in fetal hearts and in vitro in embryonic myocyte cells. Accordingly, norepinephrine-induced ROS production, promoter methylation, and PKCε gene repression were completely abrogated by knockdown of Nox1 in cardiomyocytes. These findings provide evidence of a novel interaction between elevated norepinephrine and epigenetic repression of PKCε gene in the heart mediated by Nox1-dependent oxidative stress and suggest new insights of molecular mechanisms linking the heightened sympathetic activity to aberrant cardioprotection and increased ischemic vulnerability in the heart.—Xiong, F., Xiao, D., Zhang, L.

https://openalex.org/W2071991954,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are critical binding partners for extracellular tranglutaminase-2 (TG2), a multifunctional protein involved in tissue remodeling events related to organ fibrosis and cancer progression. We previously showed that TG2 has a strong affinity for heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin and reported that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 acts as a receptor for TG2 via its HS chains in two ways: by increasing TG2-cell surface trafficking/externalization and by mediating RGD-independent cell adhesion to fibronectin-TG2 matrix during wound healing. Here we have investigated the molecular basis of this interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that either mutation of basic RRWK (262-265) or KQKRK (598-602) clusters, forming accessible heparin binding sequences on the TG2 three-dimensional structure, led to an almost complete reduction of heparin binding, indicating that both clusters contribute to form a single binding surface. Mutation of residues Arg(19) and Arg(28) also led to a significant reduction in heparin binding, suggesting their involvement. Our findings indicate that the heparin binding sites on TG2 mainly comprise two clusters of basic amino acids, which are distant in the linear sequence but brought into spatial proximity in the folded ""closed"" protein, forming a high affinity heparin binding site. Molecular modeling showed that the identified site can make contact with a single heparin-derived pentasaccharide. The TG2-heparin binding mutants supported only weak RGD-independent cell adhesion compared with wild type TG2 or mutants with retained heparin binding, and both heparin binding clusters were critical for TG2-mediated cell adhesion. These findings significantly advance our knowledge of how HS/heparin influences the adhesive function of TG2."
https://openalex.org/W2144356907,"Asthma is a respiratory tract disorder characterized by airway hyper-reactivity and chronic inflammation. Allergic asthma is associated with the production of allergen-specific IgE and expansion of allergen-specific T-cell populations. Progression of allergic inflammation is driven by T-helper type 2 (Th2) mediators and is associated with alterations in the levels of lipid mediators.Responses of the respiratory system to birch allergen provocation in allergic asthmatics were investigated. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins were quantified in the bronchoalveolar lumen to provide a measure of shifts in lipid mediators associated with allergen challenge in allergic asthmatics.Eighty-seven lipid mediators representing the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic pathways were screened via LC-MS/MS following off-line extraction of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Multivariate statistics using OPLS were employed to interrogate acquired oxylipin data in combination with immunological markers.Thirty-two oxylipins were quantified, with baseline asthmatics possessing a different oxylipin profile relative to healthy individuals that became more distinct following allergen provocation. The most prominent differences included 15-LOX-derived ω-3 and ω-6 oxylipins. Shared-and-Unique-Structures (SUS)-plot modeling showed a correlation (R(2) = 0.7) between OPLS models for baseline asthmatics (R(2)Y[cum] = 0.87, Q(2)[cum] = 0.51) and allergen-provoked asthmatics (R(2)Y[cum] = 0.95, Q(2)[cum] = 0.73), with the majority of quantified lipid mediators and cytokines contributing equally to both groups. Unique structures for allergen provocation included leukotrienes (LTB(4) and 6-trans-LTB(4)), CYP-derivatives of linoleic acid (epoxides/diols), and IL-10.Differences in asthmatic relative to healthy profiles suggest a role for 15-LOX products of both ω-6 and ω-3 origin in allergic inflammation. Prominent differences at baseline levels indicate that non-symptomatic asthmatics are subject to an underlying inflammatory condition not observed with other traditional mediators. Results suggest that oxylipin profiling may provide a sensitive means of characterizing low-level inflammation and that even individuals with mild disease display distinct phenotypic profiles, which may have clinical ramifications for disease."

https://openalex.org/W1971677166,"Prolonged demands on the attention system can cause a decay in performance over time known as the time-on-task effect. The inter-subject differences in the rate of this decline are large, and recent efforts have been made to understand the biological bases of these individual differences. In this study, we investigate the genetic correlates of the time-on-task effect, as well as its accompanying changes in subjective fatigue and mood. N = 332 subjects performed a 20-minute test of sustained attention (the Psychomotor Vigilance Test) and rated their subjective states before and after the test. We observed substantial time-on-task effects on average, and large inter-individual differences in the rate of these declines. The 10-repeat allele of the variable number of tandem repeats marker (VNTR) in the dopamine transporter gene and the Met allele of the catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism were associated with greater vulnerability to time-on-task. Separately, the exon III DRD4 48 bp VNTR of the dopamine receptor gene DRD4 was associated with subjective decreases in energy. No polymorphisms were associated with task-induced changes in mood. We posit that the dopamine transporter and COMT genes exert their effects by increasing dopaminergic tone, which may induce long-term changes in the prefrontal cortex, an important mediator of sustained attention. Thus, these alleles may affect performance particularly when sustained dopamine release is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2051441772,"Plant roots and leaves can be colonized by human pathogenic bacteria, and accordingly some of the largest outbreaks of foodborne illness have been associated with salad leaves contaminated by E. coli O157. Integrated disease management strategies often exploit cultivar resistance to provide a level of protection from economically important plant pathogens; however, there is limited evidence of whether the genotype of the plant can also influence the extent of E. coli O157 colonization. To determine cultivar-specific effects on colonization by E. coli O157, we used 12 different cultivars of lettuce inoculated with a chromosomally lux-marked strain of E. coli O157:H7. Lettuce seedlings grown gnotobiotically in vitro did exhibit a differential cultivar-specific response to E. coli O157 colonization, although importantly there was no relationship between metabolic activity (measured as bioluminescence) and cell numbers. Metabolic activity was highest and lowest on the cultivars Vaila-winter gem and Dazzle respectively, and much higher in endophytic and tightly bound cells than in epiphytic and loosely bound cells. The cultivar effect was also evident in the rhizosphere of plants grown in compost, which suggests that cultivar-specific root exudate influences E. coli O157 activity. However, the influence of cultivar in the rhizosphere was the opposite to that in the phyllosphere, and the higher number and activity of E. coli O157 cells in the rhizosphere may be a consequence of them not being able to gain entry to the plant as effectively. If metabolic activity in the phyllosphere corresponds to a more prepared state of infectivity during human consumption, leaf internalization of E. coli O157 may pose more of a public health risk than leaf surface contamination alone."
https://openalex.org/W2092626708,"Foundation species, such as kelp, exert disproportionately strong community effects and persist, in part, by dominating taxa that inhibit their regeneration. Human activities which benefit their competitors, however, may reduce stability of communities, increasing the probability of phase-shifts. We tested whether a foundation species (kelp) would continue to inhibit a key competitor (turf-forming algae) under moderately increased local (nutrient) and near-future forecasted global pollution (CO2). Our results reveal that in the absence of kelp, local and global pollutants combined to cause the greatest cover and mass of turfs, a synergistic response whereby turfs increased more than would be predicted by adding the independent effects of treatments (kelp absence, elevated nutrients, forecasted CO2). The positive effects of nutrient and CO2 enrichment on turfs were, however, inhibited by the presence of kelp, indicating the competitive effect of kelp was stronger than synergistic effects of moderate enrichment of local and global pollutants. Quantification of physicochemical parameters within experimental mesocosms suggests turf inhibition was likely due to an effect of kelp on physical (i.e. shading) rather than chemical conditions. Such results indicate that while forecasted climates may increase the probability of phase-shifts, maintenance of intact populations of foundation species could enable the continued strength of interactions and persistence of communities."
https://openalex.org/W2139661475,"IgE binding to its high affinity receptor FcϵRI on mast cells and basophils is a key step in the mechanism of allergic disease and a target for therapeutic intervention. Early indications that IgE adopts a bent structure in solution have been confirmed by recent x-ray crystallographic studies of IgEFc, which further showed that the bend, contrary to expectation, is enhanced in the crystal structure of the complex with receptor. To investigate the structure of IgEFc and its conformational changes that accompany receptor binding in solution, we created a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor using biologically encoded fluorescent proteins fused to the N- and C-terminal IgEFc domains (Cϵ2 and Cϵ4, respectively) together with the theoretical basis for quantitating its behavior. This revealed not only that the IgEFc exists in a bent conformation in solution but also that the bend is indeed enhanced upon FcϵRI binding. No change in the degree of bending was seen upon binding to the B cell receptor for IgE, CD23 (FcϵRII), but in contrast, binding of the anti-IgE therapeutic antibody omalizumab decreases the extent of the bend, implying a conformational change that opposes FcϵRI engagement. HomoFRET measurements further revealed that the (Cϵ2)2 and (Cϵ4)2 domain pairs behave as rigid units flanking the conformational change in the Cϵ3 domains. Finally, modeling of the accessible conformations of the two Fab arms in FcϵRI-bound IgE revealed a mutual exclusion not seen in IgG and Fab orientations relative to the membrane that may predispose receptor-bound IgE to cross-linking by allergens. IgE binding to its high affinity receptor FcϵRI on mast cells and basophils is a key step in the mechanism of allergic disease and a target for therapeutic intervention. Early indications that IgE adopts a bent structure in solution have been confirmed by recent x-ray crystallographic studies of IgEFc, which further showed that the bend, contrary to expectation, is enhanced in the crystal structure of the complex with receptor. To investigate the structure of IgEFc and its conformational changes that accompany receptor binding in solution, we created a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor using biologically encoded fluorescent proteins fused to the N- and C-terminal IgEFc domains (Cϵ2 and Cϵ4, respectively) together with the theoretical basis for quantitating its behavior.

The incidence of allergic disease is on the increase world-wide, and this includes a range of conditions from seasonal hay fever to asthma and fatal anaphylactic shock triggered by allergens such as peanuts. The key mediator between the allergen and the cells of the immune system is the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE) (1.Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. IgE in allergy and asthma today.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). In contrast to the comparatively high levels of the other immunoglobulin isotypes (∼2 mg/ml for IgA and 13 mg/ml for IgG), IgE is only found at low levels (∼50–200 ng/ml) in serum. Nevertheless, IgE binds with high affinity (Ka ∼ 1010 m−1) through its Fc region to the receptor FcϵRI expressed on the surface of mast cells and basophils, and this high affinity and long lifetime of receptor-bound IgE in tissue (dissociation t½ ∼14 days) (2.Wank S.A.

Blank U. Metzger H. Kinet J. Expression of high affinity binding of human immunoglobulin E by transfected cells.Science. 1989; 244: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) accounts for the allergic sensitization and rapid activation of these cells upon allergen binding. Degranulation of these cells and the release of inflammatory mediators, triggered by often innocuous allergens, leads to the physiological responses associated with allergic reactions (1.Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. IgE in allergy and asthma today.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 4.Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Beavil A.J. Beavil R.L. McCloskey N. Coker H.A.

High affinity IgE receptor on eosinophils is involved in defense against parasites.Nature. 1994; 367: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In IgG, the two Fab (antigen binding) arms are connected to the Fc (a dimer of Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains) by a disulfide-linked hinge region. IgE, however, has the (Cϵ2)2 domain pair in place of the hinge, and thus IgEFc comprises six domains (a dimer of Cϵ2, Cϵ3, and Cϵ4, disulfide-linked between the Cϵ2 domains). The crystal structure of IgEFc revealed the (Cϵ2)2 domain pair bent back against the Cϵ3 domains and even contacted one of the Cϵ4 domains (6.Wan T. Beavil R.L. Fabiane S.M. Beavil A.J. Sohi M.K.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This structure was even more acutely bent than that proposed in an earlier FRET study with a chimeric IgE (7.Zheng Y. Shopes B.

Conformations of IgE bound to its receptor FcϵRI and in solution.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9125-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or an x-ray and neutron scattering study of IgEFc in solution (8.Beavil A.J.

Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although an “unbending” of the IgEFc was proposed to allow engagement of the Cϵ2 domains with FcϵRI (4.Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Beavil A.J. Beavil R.L. McCloskey N. Coker H.A. Fear D. Smurthwaite L. The biology of IgE and the basis of allergic disease.Annu. Rev.

To discover whether the conformations and conformational changes seen in the crystal structures occur in solution, we generated an IgEFc biosensor to monitor conformational change in this region of the molecule. Previous solution-based fluorescence depolarization studies of human and murine IgE provided evidence only of flexibility of the Fabs relative to Fc (11.Oi V.T. Vuong T.M. Hardy R. Reidler J.

A nanosecond fluorescence depolarization study on the segmental flexibility of receptor-bound immunoglobulin E.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4607-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); this was also observed by electron microscopy (14.Roux K.H. Strelets L. Brekke O.H. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. Comparisons of the ability of human IgG3 hinge mutants, IgM, IgE, and IgA2, to form small immune complexes. A role for flexibility and geometry.J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4083-4090PubMed Google Scholar). FRET studies using recombinant mouse chimeric IgE (with Cϵ4 replaced by Cγ3 of IgG) did reveal a small change in energy transfer on binding to rat FcϵRI (7.Zheng Y. Shopes B. Holowka D. Baird B. Conformations of IgE bound to its receptor FcϵRI and in solution.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9125-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15.Zheng Y. Shopes B. Holowka D. Baird B. Dynamic conformations compared for IgE and IgG1 in solution and bound to receptors.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7446-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the donor fluorophore was placed in the Fab antigen binding site rather than in Fc, making it difficult to distinguish between movements within Fc from those of the Fabs relative to Fc. We report here a conformational change within human IgEFc monitored by FRET between biologically encoded probes attached to the N and C termini of the molecule. Both hetero- and homo-energy transfer were measured using a combination of steady-state and excited-state decay techniques. These measurements were made in the presence and absence of soluble forms of the “high affinity” mast cell receptor FcϵRIα and the “low affinity” B cell receptor CD23 (FcϵRII) as well as the Fab of the therapeutic anti-IgE antibody omalizumab (XolairTM). The results reveal not only that IgEFc is bent in solution but also that the bend is enhanced upon binding to FcϵRIα. CD23 binding has no effect upon the bend, whereas the anti-IgE omalizumab causes an unbending. Finally, we modeled the disposition of the Fabs relative to FcϵRI-bound IgEFc and discovered a significant difference compared with receptor-bound IgG, which may have important implications for cross-linking of receptor-bound IgE and the activation of mast cells and basophils by allergens. cDNA sources were as follows: pRY 24 (16.Young R.J.

For expression, the cDNAs were inserted into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). In total, four vectors were made: eGFP-IgEFc, an IgEFc labeled N-terminally with eGFP; mRFP-IgEFc, an IgEFc labeled N-terminally with mRFP; mRFP-IgEFc-eGFP, a dual labeled IgEFc with mRFP at the N terminus and eGFP at the C terminus; IgEFc-eGFP, an IgEFc C-terminally labeled with eGFP (see supplemental Fig. S1).

The surface was exposed to protein for ∼8 min before remaining reactive esters were blocked using 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8, for 2 min. All experiments were carried out and analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spectra were collected using a Spex Fluoromax (Jobin-Yvon) fluorimeter with polarizers set to vertical on excitation and magic angle (54.7°) on emission, to remove any polarization bias in the collected data. Measurements were made in a 50-μl fluorescence cuvette maintained at 20 °C in a thermostated cell holder with concentration-matched (200 nm) samples. Comparisons were made on the basis of acceptor mRFP fluorescence at 610 nm (monochromator bandwidth of 2 nm) with excitation wavelengths from 350 to 600 nm (bandwidth 2 nm). All spectra were corrected for the intensity of the source. Relevant spectra were also corrected for bleed-through of emission seen at 610 nm as a result of excitation of eGFP (always minimal); this was detected using IgEFc constructs labeled with eGFP alone. FRET efficiency (E) was calculated according to Lakowicz (27.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc, 2006Crossref Scopus (17915) Google Scholar) based on the published extinction coefficient (ϵ) for the acceptor, mRFP, at the peak excitation wavelength for the eGFP donor (ϵA(λDex)) and the extinction coefficient for eGFP at the same wavelength (ϵD(λDex)) (24.Peter M.

The polarizer settings were the same as for the steady-state measurements. Sample preparation was identical to that used for steady-state measurements, with all experiments carried out in a 50-μl fluorescence cuvette at 20 °C maintained in a thermostated holder.

Together with the biexponential decay kinetics, this precludes an entirely unambiguous measurement of the separation between the donor and acceptor fluorophores as the photophysical decay cannot be definitively modeled. Instead, the true average lifetimes (̄τ) were calculated using Equation 2, where αn were the relative amplitudes (normalized such that ∑nαn = 1), and τn are the lifetimes for the nth exponential. τ¯=α1τ12+α2τ22α1τ1+α2τ2(Eq. 2) For the purpose of calculating FRET efficiencies, the excitation-weighted average lifetime (〈τ〉) was calculated using Equation 3. 〈τ〉=α1τ1+α2τ2(Eq. 3) The lifetime FRET efficiency (Eτ) was calculated using Equation 4 where 〈τDA〉 and 〈τ0D〉 are the excitation-weighted average lifetimes for the biosensor and control experiment where the acceptor was not on the same protein as the donor, respectively. Eτ=1−〈τDA〉〈τ0D〉(Eq. 4) Fluorescence anisotropy (r) measurements of eGFP-labeled IgEFc samples were made using the same Spex Fluoromax used for intensity FRET measurements. HomoFRET measurements were made according to a method adapted from Squire et al. (33.Squire A. Verveer P.J. Rocks O. Bastiaens P.I. Red-edge anisotropy microscopy enables dynamic imaging of homo-FRET between green fluorescent proteins in cells.J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); briefly, the emission monochromator was set at 560 nm (bandwidth 2 nm), and excitation was either performed at 488 nm (bandwidth 2 nm) and 514 nm (bandwidth 2 nm) or by carrying out an excitation scan from 470 to 510 nm (bandwidth 2 nm). Emission anisotropies (r) were then calculated according to Equation 5 using the orthogonally polarized emission intensities IVV and IVH taken with vertically polarized excitation together with polarized emission intensities IHV and IHH taken with horizontally polarized excitation to correct for instrumental polarization bias (G factor; Equation 6). r=IVV−GIVHIVV−2GIVH(Eq. 5) G=IHVIHH(Eq. 6) Anisotropy decay measurements were made using the same instrument used for the lifetime measurements.

Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar)). Although eGFP and mRFP show strong structural and sequence similarity in the barrel domains, the excited-state dipole transition moment vector geometry for mRFP is considerably less well defined relative to that in eGFP (36.Wan S. Liu S. Zhao G. Chen M. Han K. Sun M. Photoabsorption of green and red fluorescent protein chromophore anions in vacuo.Biophys. Chem. 2007; 129: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because this was a prerequisite for the use of the models in the calculation of theoretical FRET efficiencies (see below), eGFP was used in the model in place of mRFP. The models were constructed by fusing eGFP N- and C-terminally to the IgEFc (PDB code 1O0V) via rotational linker residues using the program FPMOD (37.Pham E. Chiang J. Li I. Shum W. Truong K. A computational tool for designing FRET protein biosensors by rigid-body sampling of their conformational space.Structure. 2007; 15: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to create a model of eGFP-IgEFc-eGFP simulating its genetically encoded form. The GFP units were allowed to move over 5 days computational time, and 1300 models with no clashes were generated. The procedure was repeated to produce 1300 models using the extended IgE (theoretical) model PDB 1IGE (38.Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. A model of the Fc of immunoglobulin E.Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Inter-probe distances (R) for FRET biosensors are often related to FRET efficiency (E) using Equation 8. E=kT1τ0D+kT=(R0R)61+(R0R)6(Eq. 8) where kT is the rate constant for transfer, whereas R0 is the separation between the donor and the acceptor for which E = 50%, also known as the Förster distance, in the definition of which the orientation factor (κ2) is commonly assigned its dynamic random average value of 2/3. However, this expression is inadequate for the IgEFc biosensor, in which there are two acceptors for each donor (the sum of the rate constants to each acceptor replaces the single rate constant in Equation 8) and where averaging over the full multiplicity of conformers in the population exhibiting a wide range of probe separations and orientations is necessary. Similarly, the time-dependent depolarization due to rotation coupled with homoFRET between the two eGFP moieties in each of the conformers of the C-terminal construct and of the separate N-terminal construct is given by Equation 9. r(t)=r0(1−dT2e−2kTt+1+dT2)e−tϕ(Eq. 9) where dT is the transfer depolarization factor (dT = 32cos2θT − ½), θT being the angle between the relevant transition moment vectors of the two eGFP fluorophores in excited-state exchange, kT is the one-way homoFRET transfer rate constant, and φ is the apparent rotational correlation time. Taking into account the substitution of r0 for its limiting value of 2/5 as well as the addition of the overall multiplier representing the rotational decay e−t/φ, Equation 9 (above) is essentially equivalent to Equation 16 of Ref. 39.Gautier I.

Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report that the expression levels of SUMO-modified substrates as well as the components of the sumoylation machinery are temporally and spatially regulated in the developing rat brain. Interestingly, while the overall sumoylation is decreasing during brain development, there are progressively more SUMO substrates localized at synapses. This increase is correlated with a differential redistribution of the sumoylation machinery into dendritic spines during neuronal maturation. Conclusions/Significance Overall, our data clearly demonstrate that the sumoylation process is developmentally regulated in the brain with high levels of nuclear sumoylation early in the development suggesting a role for this post-translational modification during the synaptogenesis period and a redistribution of the SUMO system towards dendritic spines at a later developmental stage to modulate synaptic protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1982640569,"Focal adhesion (FA) formation and disassembly play an essential role in adherence and migration of endothelial cells. These processes are highly regulated and involve various signaling molecules that are not yet completely identified. Lnk [Src homology 2-B3 (SH2B3)] belongs to a family of SH2-containing proteins with important adaptor functions. In this study, we showed that Lnk distribution follows that of vinculin, localizing Lnk in FAs. Inhibition of Lnk by RNA interference resulted in decreased spreading, whereas sustained expression dramatically increases the number of focal and cell-matrix adhesions. We demonstrated that Lnk expression impairs FA turnover and cell migration and regulates β1-integrin-mediated signaling via Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation. Moreover, the α-parvin protein was identified as one of the molecular targets of Lnk responsible for impaired FA dynamics and cell migration. Finally, we established the ILK protein as a new molecular partner for Lnk and proposed a model in which Lnk regulates α-parvin expression through its interaction with ILK. Collectively, our results underline the adaptor Lnk as a novel and effective key regulator of integrin-mediated signaling controlling endothelial cell adhesion and migration.—Devallière, J., Chatelais, M., Fitau, J., Gérard, N., Hulin, P., Velazquez, L., Turner, C.

https://openalex.org/W2053470661,"Elevated ocean temperatures and agrochemical pollution individually threaten inshore coral reefs, but these pressures are likely to occur simultaneously. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the combined effects of elevated temperature and the photosystem II (PSII) inhibiting herbicide diuron on several types of symbiotic algae (diatom, dinoflagellate or rhodophyte) of benthic foraminifera in hospite. Diuron was shown to evoke a direct effect on photosynthetic efficiency (reduced effective PSII quantum yield ΔF/F'(m)), while elevated temperatures (>30 °C, only 2 °C above current average summer temperatures) were observed to impact photosynthesis more indirectly by causing reductions in maximum PSII quantum yield (F(v)/F(m)), interpreted as photodamage. Additionally, elevated temperatures were shown to cause bleaching through loss of chlorophyll a in foraminifera hosting either diatoms or dinoflagellates. A significant linear correlation was found between reduced F(v)/F(m) and loss of chlorophyll a. In most cases, symbionts within foraminifera proved more sensitive to thermal stress in the presence of diuron (≥ 1 µg L(-1)). The mixture toxicity model of Independent Action (IA) described the combined effects of temperature and diuron on the photosystem of species hosting diatoms or dinoflagellates convincingly and in agreement with probabilistic statistics, so a response additive joint action can be assumed. We thus demonstrate that improving water quality can improve resilience of symbiotic phototrophs to projected increases in ocean temperatures. As IA described the observed combined effects from elevated temperature and diuron stress it may therefore be employed for prediction of untested mixtures and for assessing the efficacy of management measures."
https://openalex.org/W2079517866,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (Stat5b) is a critical node in the signaling network downstream of external (cytokines or growth factors) or internal (oncogenic tyrosine kinases) stimuli. Maximum transcriptional activation of Stat5b requires both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation. Although the mechanisms governing tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat5b have been extensively studied, the role of serine phosphorylation remains to be fully elucidated. Using mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies, we identified Ser-193 as a novel site of cytokine-induced phosphorylation within human Stat5b. Stat5b Ser(P)-193 was detected in activated primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or lymphoid cell lines in response to several γ common (γc) cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Kinetic and spatial analysis indicated that Stat5b Ser-193 phosphorylation was rapid and transient and occurred in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell prior to Stat5b translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, inducible Stat5b Ser-193 phosphorylation was sensitive to inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) induced phosphorylation of Ser-193. Reconstitution assays in HEK293 cells in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis, EMSA, and reporter assays indicated that Ser(P)-193 is required for maximal Stat5b transcriptional activity. Indeed, Stat5b Ser-193 was found constitutively phosphorylated in several lymphoid tumor cell lines as well as primary leukemia and lymphoma patient tumor cells. Taken together, IL-2 family cytokines tightly control Stat5b Ser-193 phosphorylation through a rapamycin-sensitive mechanism. Furthermore, constitutive Ser-193 phosphorylation is associated with Stat5b proto-oncogenic activity and therefore may serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating hematopoietic malignancies."

Thrb(PV/PV) mice have a severely impaired pituitary-thyroid axis and elevated thyroid hormone levels due to a dominant-negative mutant T(3) receptor (TRβ(PV)) that cannot bind T(3) and interferes with the actions of wild-type TR. Thrb(PV/PV) mice have accelerated skeletal development due to unknown mechanisms. We performed microarray studies in primary osteoblasts from wild-type mice and Thrb(PV/PV) mice. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling in Thrb(PV/PV) mice was confirmed by in situ hybridization analysis of Wnt target gene expression in bone during postnatal growth. By contrast, T(3) treatment inhibited Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells, suggesting that T(3) inhibits the Wnt pathway by facilitating proteasomal degradation of β-catenin and preventing its accumulation in the nucleus. Activation of the Wnt pathway in Thrb(PV/PV) mice, however, results from a gain of function for TRβ(PV) that stabilizes β-catenin despite the presence of increased thyroid hormone levels. These studies demonstrate novel interactions between T(3) and Wnt signaling pathways in the regulation of skeletal development and bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2061988258,"RhoA is a member of the Rho family small GTPases that are implicated in various cell functions including proliferation and survival. However, the physiological role of RhoA in vivo remains largely unknown. Here, we deleted RhoA in the B cell and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations in RhoAflox/flox mice with CD19 and Mx promoter-driven Cre expression, respectively. Deletion of RhoA by CD19Cre/+ significantly blocked B cell development in spleen, leading to a marked reduction in the number of transitional, marginal zone, and follicular B cells. Surprisingly, neither B cell proliferation in response to either LPS or B cell receptor (BCR) engagement nor B cell survival rate in vivo was affected by RhoA deletion. Furthermore, RhoA−/− B cells, like control cells, were rescued from apoptosis by BCR crosslinking in vitro. In contrast, RhoA deficiency led to a defect in B cell activating factor (BAFF)-mediated B cell survival that was associated with a dampened expression of BAFF receptor and a loss of BAFF-mediated Akt activation. Finally, HSC deletion of RhoA by Mx-Cre severely reduced proB/preB and immature B cell populations in bone marrow while common lymphoid progenitors were increased, indicating that RhoA is also required for B cell progenitor/precursor differentiation. Taken together, our results uncover an important role for RhoA at multiple stages of B cell development."

The x-ray structure of the recombinant four-domain fragment Fn(III)7B89 reveals a tightly associated, extended head-to-tail dimer, which is stabilized via pair-wise shape and charge complementarity. A tendency toward ED-B-dependent dimer formation in solution was supported by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. When amending the model with the known three-dimensional structure of the Fn(III)10 domain, its RGD loop as well as the adhesion synergy region in Fn(III)9-10 become displayed on the same face of the dimer; this should allow simultaneous binding of at least two integrins and, thus, receptor clustering on the cell surface and intracellular signaling. Insertion of ED-B appears to stabilize overall head-to-tail dimerization of two separate Fn chains, which, together with alternating homodimer formation via disulfide bridges at the C-terminal Fn tail, should lead to the known macromolecular fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W2066178598,"Plant Snf1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1) related protein kinase (SnRK), a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases, has been implicated as a crucial upstream regulator of ABA and osmotic signaling as in many other signaling cascades. In this paper, we have isolated a novel plant specific ABA activated calcium independent protein kinase (GsAPK) from a highly salt tolerant plant, Glycine soja (50109), which is a member of the SnRK2 family. Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion protein indicated that GsAPK is localized in the plasma membrane. We found that autophosphorylation and Myelin Basis Protein phosphorylation activity of GsAPK is only activated by ABA and the kinase activity also was observed when calcium was replaced by EGTA, suggesting its independence of calcium in enzyme activity. We also found that cold, salinity, drought, and ABA stress alter GsAPK gene transcripts and heterogonous overexpression of GsAPK in Arabidopsis alters plant tolerance to high salinity and ABA stress. In summary, we demonstrated that GsAPK is a Glycine soja ABA activated calcium independent SnRK-type kinase presumably involved in ABA mediated stress signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1980130854,"microRNAs are generally understood to regulate gene expression through binding to target sequences within 3'-UTRs of mRNAs. Therefore, computational prediction of target sites is usually restricted to these gene regions. Recent experimental studies though have suggested that microRNAs may alternatively modulate gene expression by interacting with promoters. A database of potential microRNA target sites in promoters would stimulate research in this field leading to more understanding of complex microRNA regulatory mechanism.We developed a database hosting predicted microRNA target sites located within human promoter sequences and their associated genomic features, called microPIR (microRNA-Promoter Interaction Resource). microRNA seed sequences were used to identify perfect complementary matching sequences in the human promoters and the potential target sites were predicted using the RNAhybrid program. >15 million target sites were identified which are located within 5000 bp upstream of all human genes, on both sense and antisense strands. The experimentally confirmed argonaute (AGO) binding sites and EST expression data including the sequence conservation across vertebrate species of each predicted target are presented for researchers to appraise the quality of predicted target sites. The microPIR database integrates various annotated genomic sequence databases, e.g. repetitive elements, transcription factor binding sites, CpG islands, and SNPs, offering users the facility to extensively explore relationships among target sites and other genomic features. Furthermore, functional information of target genes including gene ontologies, KEGG pathways, and OMIM associations are provided. The built-in genome browser of microPIR provides a comprehensive view of multidimensional genomic data. Finally, microPIR incorporates a PCR primer design module to facilitate experimental validation.The proposed microPIR database is a useful integrated resource of microRNA-promoter target interactions for experimental microRNA researchers and computational biologists to study the microRNA regulation through gene promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1968409575,"Background Chronic diseases have become the leading causes of mortality in China and related behavioral risk factors (BRFs) changed dramatically in past decades. We aimed to examine the prevalence, co-variations, clustering and the independent correlates of five BRFs at the national level. Methodology/Principal Findings We used data from the 2007 China Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance, in which multistage clustering sampling was adopted to collect a nationally representative sample of 49,247 Chinese aged 15 to 69 years. We estimated the prevalence and clustering (mean number of BRFs) of five BRFs: tobacco use, excessive alcohol drinking, insufficient intake of vegetable and fruit, physical inactivity, and overweight or obesity. We conducted binary logistic regression models to examine the co-variations among five BRFs with adjustment of demographic and socioeconomic factors, chronic conditions and other BRFs. Ordinal logistic regression was constructed to investigate the independent associations between each covariate and the clustering of BRFs within individuals. Overall, 57.0% of Chinese population had at least two BRFs and the mean number of BRFs is 1.80 (95% confidence interval: 1.78–1.83). Eight of the ten pairs of bivariate associations between the five BRFs were found statistically significant. Chinese with older age, being a male, living in rural areas, having lower education level and lower yearly household income experienced increased likelihood of having more BRFs. Conclusions/Significance Current BRFs place the majority of Chinese aged 15 to 69 years at risk for the future development of chronic disease, which calls for urgent public health programs to reduce these risk factors. Prominent correlations between BRFs imply that a combined package of interventions targeting multiple BRFs might be appropriate. These interventions should target elder population, men, and rural residents, especially those with lower SES."
https://openalex.org/W2103848930,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most potent neurotrophic factor in the peripheral taste system during embryonic development. It is also expressed in adult taste buds. There is a lack of understanding of the role of BDNF in the adult taste system. To address this, we generated novel transgenic mice in which transgene expression was driven by an α-gustducin promoter coupling BDNF expression to the postnatal expression of gustducin in taste cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly stronger BDNF labeling in taste cells of high BDNF-expressing mouse lines compared with controls. We show that taste buds in these mice are significantly larger and have a larger number of taste cells compared with controls. To examine whether innervation was affected in Gust-BDNF mice, we used antibodies to neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and ATP receptor P2X3. The total density of general innervation and specifically the gustatory innervation was markedly increased in high BDNF-expressing mice compared with controls. TrkB and NCAM gene expression in laser capture microdissected taste epithelia were significantly up-regulated in these mice. Up-regulation of TrkB transcripts in taste buds and elevated taste cell-specific TrkB phosphorylation in response to increased BDNF levels indicate that BDNF controls the expression and activation of its high affinity receptor in taste cells. This demonstrates a direct taste cell function for BDNF. BDNF also orchestrates and maintains taste bud innervation. We propose that the Gust-BDNF transgenic mouse models can be employed to further dissect the specific roles of BDNF in the adult taste system."

Recently, analysis of 13,023 genes in breast and colorectal cancers identified OBSCN as one of the most frequently mutated genes, implicating it in cancer formation. Herein we studied the expression profile of obscurins in breast, colon, and skin cancer cell lines and their involvement in cell survival. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated significant reduction of obscurin proteins [corrected] in cancer cells, resulting from decreased mRNA levels and/or the presence of mutant transcripts. In normal epithelium, obscurins localize in cytoplasmic puncta, the cell membrane, and the nucleus. Accordingly, subcellular fractionation demonstrated the presence of 2 novel nuclear isoforms of ∼110 and ∼120 kDa. Nontumorigenic MCF10A breast epithelial cells stably transduced with shRNAs targeting giant obscurins exhibited increased viability (∼30%) and reduced apoptosis (∼20%) following exposure to the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Quantitative RT-PCR further indicated that the antiapoptotic genes BAG4 and HAX1 were up-regulated (1.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively), whereas initiator caspase-9 and death caspase-3 transcripts were down-regulated (0.8- and 0.6-fold, respectively). Our findings are the first to pinpoint critical roles for obscurins in cancer development by contributing to the regulation of cell survival."

Certain hAT transposons are active and have been developed as incisive genetic tools. Active vertebrate elements are rarely discovered; however, Tgf2 transposon was recently discovered in goldfish (Carassius auratus). Here, we found that the endogenous Tgf2 element can transpose in goldfish genome. Seven different goldfish mRNA transcripts, encoding three lengths of Tgf2 transposase, were identified. Tgf2 transposase mRNA was detected in goldfish embryos, mainly in epithelial cells; levels were high in ovaries and mature eggs and in all adult tissues tested. Endogenous Tgf2 transposase mRNA is active in mature eggs and can mediate high rates of transposition (> 30%) when injected with donor plasmids harboring a Tgf2 cis-element. When donor plasmid was coinjected with capped Tgf2 transposase mRNA, the insertion rate reached >90% at 1 yr. Nonautonomous copies of the Tgf2 transposon with large-fragment deletions and low levels of point mutations were also detected in common goldfish. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the taxonomic distribution of Tgf2 in goldfish is not due to vertical inheritance.

https://openalex.org/W1981795687,"Cisplatin is one of the most widely used and effective anticancer drugs against solid tumors including cerebellar tumor of the childhood, Medulloblastoma. However, cancer cells often develop resistance to cisplatin, which limits therapeutic effectiveness of this otherwise effective genotoxic drug. In this study, we demonstrate that human medulloblastoma cell lines develop acute resistance to cisplatin in the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI182,780. This unexpected finding involves a switch from the G2/M to G1 checkpoint accompanied by decrease in ATM/Chk2 and increase in ATR/Chk1 phosphorylation. We have previously reported that ERβ, which is highly expressed in medulloblastomas, translocates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) to the nucleus, and that nuclear IRS-1 binds to Rad51 and attenuates homologous recombination directed DNA repair (HRR). Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of ICI182,780, cisplatin-treated medulloblastoma cells show recruitment of Rad51 to the sites of damaged DNA and increase in HRR activity. This enhanced DNA repair during the S phase preserved also clonogenic potential of medulloblastoma cells treated with cisplatin. In conclusion, inhibition of ERβ considered as a supplemental anticancer therapy, has been found to interfere with cisplatin–induced cytotoxicity in human medulloblastoma cell lines."

It has not been established, however, which of the many GTPase regulators in the cell link these signaling molecules in the dendrite. In axons, the bifunctional guanine exchange factor, Trio, is an essential link between the Abl tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and Rho GTPases, particularly Rac, allowing these systems to act coordinately to control actin organization. In dendritic morphogenesis, however, Abl and Rac have contrary rather than reinforcing effects, raising the question of whether Trio is involved, and if so, whether it acts through Rac, Rho or both. We now find that Trio is expressed in sensory neurons of the Drosophila embryo and regulates their dendritic arborization. trio mutants display a reduction in dendritic branching and increase in average branch length, whereas over-expression of trio has the opposite effect. We further show that it is the Rac GEF domain of Trio, and not its Rho GEF domain that is primarily responsible for the dendritic function of Trio. Thus, Trio shapes the complexity of dendritic arbors and does so in a way that mimics the effects of its target, Rac."

Clinically, CF is characterized by multisystem involvement; however, it is the airway involvement that is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality (1.Boucher R.C.

Molecular mechanisms of CFTR chloride channel dysfunction in cystic fibrosis.Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), which in turn interferes with proper airway hydration. Because chloride secretion and sodium absorption are responsible for the proper airway hydration, inadequate chloride secretion leads to sodium hyperabsorption. This sodium hyperabsorption, mediated by ENaC, is believed to result from CFTR mutations changing the ability of the protein to regulate sodium transport. The role of ENaC was further supported in mice that exhibited CF-like symptoms when the β-subunit of ENaC was overexpressed (5.Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C.

In our recent work, we documented the close association between WT CFTR and ENaC subunits, showing with both co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and FRET that there is an interaction between these proteins (6.Berdiev B.K.

In this study, we investigated the association of ENaC subunits with the mutated variant of CFTR, ΔF508-CFTR. We found that all three ENaC subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated with ΔF508-CFTR. The results of our FRET findings, on the other hand, did not place ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC subunits in close proximity to each other. However, both chemical and low temperature rescue of ΔF508-CFTR led to an observable FRET signal, placing these two proteins in sufficiently close proximity to each other for a direct association to take a place. Our biochemical findings using co-IP are suggestive of an overall association between mutated CFTR and ENaC subunits. In contrast, our FRET findings suggest that the ΔF508 mutation disrupts the close association of CFTR and ENaC, leading to excessive ENaC activity. Cell culture and maintenance were performed as described previously (6.Berdiev B.K. Cormet-Boyaka E. Tousson A. Qadri Y.J. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Hong J.S. Gonzales P.A. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J.

Wang, University of Alabama at Birmingham) were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively; Invitrogen). Trypsin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) was used to subculture the cells a day before the transient transfection. The cells were seeded on coverslips (0.13–0.17 mm thick; Fisher) coated with 1:10 diluted poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 ratio was 0.2 μg/1 μl) was incubated with 100 μl of Opti-MEM® I (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 5 min. In a separate Eppendorf tube, 0.2 μg of each DNA construct was incubated with 100 μl of Opti-MEM® I (Invitrogen). Following the 5-min incubation time, the diluted DNA constructs and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were combined together and incubated for another 20 min. Then the transfection solution was added to the cells in Opti-MEM® I (without fetal bovine serum and antibiotics). After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator, the transfection solution was changed to the regular growth medium without antibiotics. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde (prepared from 20% EM Grade solution, Electron Microscopy Services, Hatfield, PA). After fixation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted on glass microscope slides (Fisher) using 0.2% (w/v) n-propyl gallate (Sigma) in 9:1 glycerol/PBS (v/v). The same protocol was used to transfect the cells for co-IP experiments; the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 ratio was 1 μg/2.5 μl. Generation of fluorophore-tagged CFTR and ENaC cDNAs was described previously (6.Berdiev B.K. Cormet-Boyaka E. Tousson A. Qadri Y.J. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Hong J.S. Gonzales P.A. Fuller C.M.

To generate the CFTR construct tagged at its N terminus with the enhanced cyan or yellow fluorescent protein (ECFP-CFTR or EYFP-CFTR, respectively), the EGFP was exchanged with ECFP or EYFP following NheI/XhoI (New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) or Promega (Madison, WI)) digestion and ligation (6.Berdiev B.K.

Gonzales (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). HEK293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of ECFP-CFTR construct. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Pierce) complemented with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), non-soluble material was discarded. 100 μg of total cell lysate was subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen), followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad) that was probed with 1:10,000 diluted polyclonal Ab against the second nucleotide binding domain of CFTR (kind gift of Dr. J. Hong, University of Alabama at Birmingham Cystic Fibrosis Research Center). Detection was accomplished using a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Dako) and chemiluminescence. Western blot analysis of tagged ENaC constructs was as described previously (6.Berdiev B.K. Cormet-Boyaka E. Tousson A. Qadri Y.J. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Hong J.S. Gonzales P.A. Fuller C.M.

ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC co-IP experiments were performed following a protocol described previously (11.Cormet-Boyaka E. Di A. Chang S.Y. Naren A.P. Tousson A. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. CFTR chloride channels are regulated by a SNAP-23/syntaxin 1A complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12477-12482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HEK293T cells were transfected with CFTR and appropriate combinations of ENaC subunits and incubated for 48 h. The cells then were lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the non-soluble material was discarded. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h with 1 μg of carboxyl-terminal CFTR monoclonal Ab clone 24–1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) cross-linked to A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Then the beads were pelleted and rinsed three times in PBS with 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated CFTR and bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the samples were processed for Western blotting using Abs raised against ENaC and CFTR (R&D Systems). A combination of surface biotinylation and co-IP (12.Holman D. Henley J.M. A novel method for monitoring the cell surface expression of heteromeric protein complexes in dispersed neurons and acute hippocampal slices.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 160: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used to identify changes in surface expression following low temperature rescue. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with ΔF508-CFTR and all three ENaC subunits (one of the three subunits in αβγ-ENaC was tagged with EYFP-α-EYFP-βγ, β-EYFP-αγ, and γ-EYFP-αβ). The cells were incubated at 27 °C for 48 h after an initial 24-h incubation at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 and incubated with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce; 1.5 mg/ml in ice-cold PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice with freshly prepared quenching solution (50 mm glycine in PBS) and lysed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were homogenized by passing fifty times through a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged (13,200 rpm, 30 min at 4 °C). Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation of CFTR was done by adding 4 μg of anti-mouse CFTR antibody to 2000 μg of protein cell lysate overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with lysis buffer, Protein G beads (100 μl; Pierce) were added to the antibody-lysate complex and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were collected after centrifuging the lysates at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with lysis buffer. After removing residual buffer, bead-IP-CFTR interactions were disrupted by incubating the beads with 150 μl of 1% SDS for 2 h at 37 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 450 μl of lysis buffer. After washing three times with lysis buffer, streptavidin beads (100 μl; Pierce) were added to the samples and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were collected as described above. After removing residual buffer, samples were heated at 95 °C for 6 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8) and subjected to SDS-PAGE over 10% separating gels. Following transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), with Tween 20 (0.1%; Bio-Rad) (TBS-T) at room temperature and probed with mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Abgent, San Diego, CA) at 1:2000 in 5% BSA in TBS-T overnight at 4 °C. For FRET measurements, an acceptor photobleaching technique was utilized as described previously (7.Meltzer R.H. Kapoor N. Qadri Y.J. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer from cyan to yellow fluorescent protein detected by acceptor photobleaching using confocal microscopy and a single laser.J. Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, an upright DMRXE Leica Confocal Scanning System (Exton, PA) TCS SP2 with an argon laser, ×100 1.4 numerical aperture plan apochromatic oil immersion objective was used for imaging. ECFP and EYFP fluorescence were excited with 458- and 514-nm laser light, respectively; a dual dichroic (DD458/514) was used in the excitation path. The emissions for ECFP and EYFP were collected using 465–505-nm and 525–600-nm band pass windows, respectively. Fixed samples were imaged within 3 days. We noticed an increase in background fluorescence if fixed samples were processed after a longer period (more than 7–10 days) of storage. The regions of interest in cells expressing both fluorophores were photobleached using 514-nm laser light to 30% of original intensity. ECFP and EYFP images were taken both before and after acceptor photobleaching. FRET efficiency (E) was calculated using Leica software, E = Dpost − Dpre/Dpost, where Dpre and Dpost are ECFP emission before and after regional photobleaching, respectively. HEK293T cells seeded on glass bottom dishes (In Vitro Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) were transfected with appropriate constructs (see “Transient Transfection”). FLIM measurements were carried out on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY) equipped with Becker & Hickl GmbH (Berlin, Germany) time domain FLIM system. The excitation source was a 405-nm picosecond pulsed diode laser with a 50-MHz repetition rate and a pulse width of around 70 ps integrated into the Zeiss confocal system. The fluorescence decay curves were analyzed using SPC Image software (Becker & Hickl). The apparent mean lifetime (Tm) of the donor was derived from double exponential fit of the decay curves. An apparent FRET efficiency (E) was calculated according to the equation, E = 1 − (TFRET/TECFP-CFTR). The difference between groups was calculated using Student's two-tailed test; the significance was set at p < 0.05. The imaging was carried out with HEK293T cells transfected with CFTR constructs at room temperature of 25 °C as described previously (14.Kapoor N. Lee W. Clark E. Bartoszewski R. McNicholas C.M.

Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C1246-C1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell growth medium was changed to a solution that contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose (pH 7.4) before the start of the imaging. The inverted IX81 Olympus microscope (Center Valley, PA) outfitted with differential interference contrast, wide field epifluorescence, and total internal reflection fluorescence illumination was used for imaging. Images were captured with a ×60 plan achromatic oil immersion TIRF microscope objective with a numerical aperture of 1.45 using a CoolSNAP-HQ-cooled, charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) controlled by Metamorph imaging software version 7.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The laser beam was brought to the correct angle for total internal reflection by focusing it on the outer edge of the objective's rear aperture. The light source was an argon laser (10 milliwatts at 488 nm, Melles Griot (Carlsbad, CA)). For epifluorescence visualization of EYFP and ECFP, we used standard fluorescein/FITC and ECFP filter sets; a xenon arc lamp (100 watts) was used as a light source. All images shown in the figures represent pseudocolored raw data with their pixel intensities without saturation and within the camera's dynamic range (0–4095). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the fusion of a 27-kDa fluorescent tag (ECFP or EYFP) to CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR did not affect our ability to immunoprecipitate or detect the protein (Fig. 1A) (6.Berdiev B.K.

https://openalex.org/W1986539920,"Most bacteria use the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for the synthesis of their essential isoprenoid precursors. The absence of the MEP pathway in humans makes it a promising new target for the development of much needed new and safe antimicrobial drugs. However, bacteria show a remarkable metabolic plasticity for isoprenoid production. For example, the NADPH-dependent production of MEP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate in the first committed step of the MEP pathway is catalyzed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) in most bacteria, whereas an unrelated DXR-like (DRL) protein was recently found to catalyze the same reaction in some organisms, including the emerging human and animal pathogens Bartonella and Brucella. Here, we report the x-ray crystal structures of the Brucella abortus DRL enzyme in its apo form and in complex with the broad-spectrum antibiotic fosmidomycin solved to 1.5 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. DRL is a dimer, with each polypeptide folding into three distinct domains starting with the NADPH-binding domain, in resemblance to the structure of bacterial DXR enzymes. Other than that, DRL and DXR show a low structural relationship, with a different disposition of the domains and a topologically unrelated C-terminal domain. In particular, the active site of DRL presents a unique arrangement, suggesting that the design of drugs that would selectively inhibit DRL-harboring pathogens without affecting beneficial or innocuous bacteria harboring DXR should be feasible. As a proof of concept, we identified two strong DXR inhibitors that have virtually no effect on DRL activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057255063,"RseA sequesters RpoE (σ(E)) to the inner membrane of Escherichia coli when envelope stress is low. Elevated envelope stress triggers RseA cleavage by the sequential action of two membrane proteases, DegS and RseP, releasing σ(E) to activate an envelope stress reducing pathway. Revertants of a ΔdegP ΔbamB strain, which fails to grow at 37°C due to high envelope stress, harbored mutations in the rseA and rpoE genes. Null and missense rseA mutations constitutively hyper-activated the σ(E) regulon and significantly reduced the major outer membrane protein (OMP) levels. In contrast, a novel rpoE allele, rpoE3, resulting from the partial duplication of the rpoE gene, increased σ(E) levels greater than that seen in the rseA mutant background but did not reduce OMP levels. A σ(E)-dependent RybB::LacZ construct showed only a weak activation of the σ(E) pathway by rpoE3. Despite this, rpoE3 fully reversed the growth and envelope vesiculation phenotypes of ΔdegP. Interestingly, rpoE3 also brought down the modestly activated Cpx envelope stress pathway in the ΔdegP strain to the wild type level, showing the complementary nature of the σ(E) and Cpx pathways. Through employing a labile mutant periplasmic protein, AcrA(L222Q), it was determined that the rpoE3 mutation overcomes the ΔdegP phenotypes, in part, by activating a σ(E)-dependent proteolytic pathway. Our data suggest that a reduction in the OMP levels is not intrinsic to the σ(E)-mediated mechanism of lowering envelope stress. They also suggest that under extreme envelope stress, a tight homeostasis loop between RseA and σ(E) may partly be responsible for cell death, and this loop can be broken by mutations that either lower RseA activity or increase σ(E) levels."
https://openalex.org/W1991649564,"The current study explored the correlation between speakers' Eysenck personality traits and speech spectrum parameters. Forty-six subjects completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. They were instructed to verbally answer the questions shown on a computer screen and their responses were recorded by the computer. Spectrum parameters of /sh/ and /i/ were analyzed by Praat voice software. Formant frequencies of the consonant /sh/ in lying responses were significantly lower than that in truthful responses, whereas no difference existed on the vowel /i/ speech spectrum. The second formant bandwidth of the consonant /sh/ speech spectrum was significantly correlated with the personality traits of Psychoticism, Extraversion, and Neuroticism, and the correlation differed between truthful and lying responses, whereas the first formant frequency of the vowel /i/ speech spectrum was negatively correlated with Neuroticism in both response types. The results suggest that personality characteristics may be conveyed through the human voice, although the extent to which these effects are due to physiological differences in the organs associated with speech or to a general Pygmalion effect is yet unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2028411439,"Intramembrane proteases of the Signal Peptide Peptidase (SPP) family play important roles in developmental, metabolic and signaling pathways. Although vertebrates have one SPP and four SPP-like (SPPL) genes, we found that insect genomes encode one Spp and one SppL. Characterization of the Drosophila sppL gene revealed that the predicted SppL protein is a highly conserved structural homolog of the vertebrate SPPL3 proteases, with a predicted nine-transmembrane topology, an active site containing aspartyl residues within a transmembrane region, and a carboxy-terminal PAL domain. SppL protein localized to both the Golgi and ER. Whereas spp is an essential gene that is required during early larval stages and whereas spp loss-of-function reduced the unfolded protein response (UPR), sppL loss of function had no apparent phenotype. This was unexpected given that genetic knockdown phenotypes in other organisms suggested significant roles for Spp-related proteases."
