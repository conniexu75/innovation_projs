https://openalex.org/W2966422607,"Patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants can significantly benefit from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however access to MRI is restricted in these patients because of safety concerns due to RF heating of the leads. Recently we introduced a patient-adjustable reconfigurable transmit coil for low-SAR imaging of DBS at 1.5T. A previous simulation study demonstrated a substantial reduction in the local SAR around single DBS leads in 9 unilateral lead models. This work reports the first experimental results of temperature measurement at the tips of bilateral DBS leads with realistic trajectories extracted from postoperative CT images of 10 patients (20 leads in total). A total of 200 measurements were performed to record temperature rise at the tips of the leads during 2 minutes of scanning with the coil rotated to cover all accessible rotation angles. In all patients, we were able to find an optimum coil rotation angle and reduced the heating of both left and right leads to a level below the heating produced by the body coil. An average heat reduction of 65% was achieved for bilateral leads. When considering each lead alone, an average heat reduction of 80% was achieved. Our results suggest that reconfigurable coil technology introduces a promising approach for imaging of patients with DBS implants."
https://openalex.org/W2966294143,"Background New developments, based on the concept of wearable soft-robotic devices, make it possible to support impaired hand function during the performance of daily activities and intensive task-specific training. The wearable soft-robotic ironHand glove is such a system that supports grip strength during the performance of daily activities and hand training exercises at home. Design This pilot randomized controlled clinical study explored the effect of prolonged use of the assistive ironHand glove during daily activities at home, in comparison to its use as a trainings tool at home, on functional performance of the hand. Methods In total, 91 older adults with self-perceived decline of hand function participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to a 4-weeks intervention of either assistive or therapeutic ironHand use, or control group (received no additional exercise or treatment). All participants performed a maximal pinch grip test, Box and Blocks test (BBT), Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) at baseline and after 4-weeks of intervention. Only participants of the assistive and therapeutic group completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) after the intervention period. Results Participants of the assistive and therapeutic group reported high scores on the SUS (mean = 73, SEM = 2). The therapeutic group showed improvements in unsupported handgrip strength (mean Δ = 3) and pinch strength (mean Δ = 0.5) after 4 weeks of ironHand use (p≤0.039). Scores on the BBT and JTHFT improved not only after 4 weeks of ironHand use (assistive and therapeutic), but also in the control group. Only handgrip strength improved more in the therapeutic group compared to the assistive and control group. No significant correlations were found between changes in performance and assistive or therapeutic ironHand use (p≥0.062). Conclusion This study showed that support of the wearable soft-robotic ironHand system either as assistive device or as training tool may be a promising way to counter functional hand function decline associated with ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2965534639,"Sirt1, a member of the sirtuin gene family, encodes the most conserved mammalian NAD+-dependent deacetylase enzyme responsible for removing acetyl groups from many proteins. The Sirt1 gene is known as a longevity gene whose knockout in mice leads to decreased lifespan relative to the wild type. This study aimed to explore phenotypic changes in zebrafish Sirt1-knockouts and to investigate the function of the Sirt1 gene. Targeted knockout of Sirt1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) was achieved using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. We created a 4-bp insertion-homozygote Sirt1-knockout zebrafish. Although there was no evident difference in appearance in the early stages of development, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species and in the extent of apoptosis in Sirt1-knockout zebrafish was observed. Sirt1 knockout caused inflammatory genes, including IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-α to be highly expressed. Additionally, the lack of Sirt1 caused chronic inflammation and intestinal atrophy, thereby increasing pro-apoptotic events, which ultimately reduced the lifespan of transgenic zebrafish. Overall, our data demonstrate that lack of Sirt1 caused a significantly increased generation of reactive oxygen species that resulted in chronic inflammation and regeneration. Continuous repetition of these events played an important role in accelerating aging, thereby decreasing lifespan. Our findings using the knockout zebrafish model confirmed the association of the Sirt1 gene to aging processes and lifespan. Furthermore, the Sirt1-knockout mutant zebrafish developed in our study will surely be a valuable model to explore the mechanism of chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2965419134,"Background Against a backdrop of more than four decades of war, conflict and insecurity, Afghanistan is recognised as suffering from endemic violence and children are exposed to multiple forms of violence, including at the family and school levels. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of school-based peace education and a community-based intervention to change harmful social norms and practices related to gender and the use of violence in conflict resolution, implemented in Afghanistan with the aim of reducing violence against and between children. Methods The evaluation consisted of a cross-sectional, interrupted time series design with three data collection points over 12 months. Data was collected from students in 11 secondary schools (seven girls’ and four boys’ schools) in Jawzjan province of Afghanistan, with a total of 361 boys and 373 girls sampled at endline. All children were interviewed with a questionnaire developed for the study. Key outcomes included children’s experience of peer violence (both perpetration and victimization) at school, corporal punishment both at home and at school, and observation of family violence. Other outcomes included children’s gender equitable attitudes, attitudes towards child punishment, depression and school performance. Results Between baseline and endline evaluation points, there were significant reductions in various forms of violence at the school level, including both boys’ and girls’ past month experience of peer violence victimization, peer violence perpetration, and corporal punishment by teachers. There were also significant reductions in boys’ and girls’ experience of corporal punishment at home and observation of family violence, with a particularly strong effect observed among girls. Both boys and girls had significantly more equitable gender attitudes and significantly less violence-supportive attitudes in relation to children’s punishment, and significantly fewer symptoms of depression. Girls’ school attendance was also significantly higher at endline. Discussion To our knowledge this is the first time that a peace education program has been evaluated in Afghanistan, with or without a community intervention to change harmful social norms and practices related to gender and the use of violence for conflict resolution. The evaluation suggests that the intervention may have led to a reduction in various forms of violence, including children’s peer violence, corporal punishment of children both at school and at home, and in children’s reports of domestic violence against women at the household level."
https://openalex.org/W2965769108,"Objective This study aimed to compare the levels of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and interleukin (IL)-1β across different clinical presentations of coronary artery disease and to evaluate the relationship between those biomarkers and the severity of coronary artery lesions in patients without kidney disease. Methods We examined 365 eligible patients who underwent coronary angiography. A total of 124 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, 117 stable angina pectoris (SAP) patients and 124 patients without atherosclerotic plaques were enrolled in the study. Plasma NGAL, MMP-9, hs-CRP, and IL-1β were measured in all patients using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. According to the SYNTAX score, the STEMI patients and SAP patients were divided into another set of 2 groups: a high score group (≥ 33, n = 29) and a low score group (<33, n = 212). The relationship between those biomarkers and the severity of coronary stenosis was examined by Spearman correlation analysis; the ability for NGAL to discriminate severe coronary stenosis was examined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; the influencing factors for the SYNTAX score were determined by logistic regression analysis. Results Plasma NGAL, MMP-9, and hs-CRP levels in STEMI patients were higher than in the SAP patients and control subjects (P<0.05, respectively), and plasma NGAL and hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in the SAP patients than in control subjects (P<0.05, respectively), while plasma IL-1β was similar among the 3 groups (P>0.05, respectively). The SYNTAX score was positively related to NGAL (r = 0.363, P<0.001), MMP-9 (r = 0.377, P<0.001), and hs-CRP (r = 0.163, P<0.011); the SYNTAX score was not related to IL-1β (r = -0.043, P = 0.510). Plasma NGAL was positively related to MMP-9 (r = 0.601, P<0.001) and IL-1β (r = 0.159, P = 0.014). The area under the ROC curve for NGAL discriminating severe coronary stenosis was 0.838 (95% CI: 0.752–0.923, P<0.001), which was greater than that for MMP-9 [0.818, (95% CI: 0.724–0.912, P<0.001)], IL-1β [0.485, (95% CI: 0.369–0.601, P = 0.791)], and hs-CRP [0.607, (95% CI: 0.492–0.722, P = 0.061)]. Multivariate regression analysis showed that plasma NGAL levels were independently related to high SYNTAX scores [OR = 1.109, (95% CI: 1.104–1.114), P<0.001]. Conclusion Plasma NGAL, MMP-9, and hs-CRP levels in STEMI patients were higher than those in the SAP patients and control subjects. NGAL had a better ability to discriminate severe coronary stenosis than MMP-9, IL-1β, and hs-CRP. NGAL may be a novel biomarker to aid in risk stratification in coronary heart disease patients."

Several K+ and Ca2+ channels have been shown to affect myogenesis, but little is known about roles of Cl− channels in the associated processes. Here, we report that the leucine-rich repeat containing family 8 (LRRC8)/volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) promotes mouse myoblast differentiation. All LRRC8 subunits of heteromeric VRAC were expressed during myotube formation of murine C2C12 myoblasts. Pharmacological VRAC inhibitors, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the essential VRAC subunit LRRC8A, or VRAC activity-suppressing overexpression of LRRC8A effectively reduced the expression of the myogenic transcription factor myogenin and suppressed myoblast fusion while not affecting myoblast proliferation. We found that inhibiting VRAC impairs plasma membrane hyperpolarization early during differentiation. At later times (more than 6 h after inducing differentiation), VRAC inhibition no longer suppressed myoblast differentiation, suggesting that VRAC acts upstream of K+ channel activation. Consequently, VRAC inhibition prevented the increase of intracellular steady-state Ca2+ levels that normally occurs during myogenesis. Our results may explain the mechanism for the thinning of skeletal muscle bundles observed in LRRC8A-deficient mice and highlight the importance of the LRRC8/VRAC anion channel in cell differentiation.

They exhibit high prenatal and postnatal lethality, growth retardation, curly hair, and defective developments in many organs.

In this study, we have investigated the role of VRAC in skeletal myogenesis using mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Our results indicate that VRAC contributes to hyperpolarization and intracellular Ca2+ signals, thereby promoting myoblast differentiation. To investigate a putative role of VRAC in myogenesis, we first examined the effects of various pharmacological VRAC inhibitors on myoblast fusion: carbenoxolone (CBX), an inhibitor of VRAC, pannexins, and gap junction–forming connexins (38Benfenati V.

We induced C2C12 cells to differentiate by reducing the serum in the growth medium from 10% FBS to 2% horse serum for 4 days in the presence of drugs at various concentrations. The VRAC inhibitors CBX, NPPB, and DCPIB significantly reduced C2C12 myoblast differentiation and fusion in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel inhibitor NFA did not show any effect (Fig. 1). Because the pharmacological data suggest a role for VRAC in myoblast differentiation/fusion, we next aimed at testing its involvement in this process on a molecular biological level. To this end, we first determined the expression of the VRAC subunits during myotube formation. Western blot analysis revealed that undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts expressed all five LRRC8 paralogues (Fig. 2, A and B). The amounts of LRRC8A and LRRC8D did not change during the first 4 days of cell differentiation. LRRC8B levels showed the tendency to decrease, whereas LRRC8E levels were strongly reduced already after 2 days of myoblast exposure to differentiation medium (Fig. 2A). LRRC8C protein seemed to decrease as well (Fig. 2B), but because the immunodetection was not unambiguous, we performed quantitative PCR, which revealed a significant decrease in Lrrc8c mRNA levels after 2 days of cell differentiation (Fig. 2C). Next, we silenced the expression of the essential VRAC subunit LRRC8A with two individual siRNAs in C2C12 cells, using a scrambled siRNA as control. Western blotting confirmed a robust knockdown of LRRC8A protein, with siRNA2 being more efficient than siRNA1 (Fig. 3A). Notably, siRNA-mediated LRRC8A knockdown did not affect proliferation of C2C12 cells, as shown by the unaffected dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 3B). Hence, we could assess the effect of LRRC8A knockdown on the differentiation and formation of myotubes. Starting 1 day after siRNA transfection, C2C12 cells were exposed to differentiation medium for 3 days. At the start of differentiation induction, the amount of LRRC8A protein was reduced by ∼40 and ∼70% in cells treated with siRNA1 and siRNA2, respectively, and decreased further during the observed time of differentiation (Fig. 4, A and B). Knockdown of LRRC8A significantly reduced the expression of myogenin, an essential myogenic transcription factor (Fig. 4, A, C, and E) and of myosin, another marker of myoblast terminal differentiation (Fig. 4, A and D and Fig. 5) compared with scrambled siRNA. Furthermore, myoblast fusion was drastically diminished by LRRC8A silencing (Fig. 5). Scrambled control for the siRNA did not affect C2C12 differentiation or fusion (data not shown) and the inhibitory effects of siRNA1 and siRNA2 on myoblast differentiation and fusion correlated with their knockdown efficiencies. Collectively, these results suggest that LRRC8A is dispensable for myoblast proliferation but critically involved in myogenic commitment.Figure 4LRRC8A knockdown impairs myoblast differentiation.

C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding LRRC8A fused to GFP (LRRC8A-GFP) or GFP alone. The next day, when expression of LRRC8A-GFP was already observable (Fig. 6A), the cells were induced to differentiate by serum withdrawal. 2 days later, more than 20% of GFP-expressing control cells were positive for the differentiation marker myosin, whereas this ratio was significantly lower with only ∼7% myosin-positive cells among the LRRC8A-GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 6A). This inhibition of C2C12 myoblast differentiation by LRRC8A overexpression corroborates the notion that the role for LRRC8A indeed lies in its requirement for VRAC activity. Consistently, DCPIB significantly reduced the myogenin mRNA (Myog) expression after 3 days of cell differentiation (Fig. 6B), in agreement with DCPIB impairing myoblast fusion (Fig. 1). Upon induct"
https://openalex.org/W2966068591,"Background The development of treatments for freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) requires experimental study set-ups in which FOG is likely to occur, and is amenable to therapeutic interventions. We explore whether the ‘Auditory Stroop Task’ (AST) can be used to increase cognitive load (and thereby elicit FOG), simultaneously with visual cues (as a therapeutic intervention for FOG). We additionally examined how these two contrasting effects might interact in affecting gait and FOG parameters. Objectives We investigated whether: (1) the ‘Auditory Stroop Task’ (AST) influences gait in healthy elderly and persons with PD who experience FOG, and increases the frequency of FOG events among PD patients; (2) the AST and visual cues interact; and (3) different versions of the AST exert different cognitive loads. Methods In ‘Experiment 1’, 19 healthy elderly subjects performed a walking task while performing a high and low load version of the AST. Walking with a random numbers task, and walking without cognitive load served as control conditions. In ‘Experiment 2’, 20 PD patients with FOG and 18 healthy controls performed a walking task with the AST, and no additional cognitive load as control condition. Both experiments were performed with and without visual cues. Velocity, cadence, stride length, and stride time were measured in all subjects. FOG severity was measured in patients. Results Compared to the control conditions, the AST negatively affected all gait parameters in both patients and controls. The AST did not increase the occurrence of FOG in patients. Visual cues reduced the decline in stride length induced by cognitive load in both groups. Both versions of the AST exerted similar effects on gait parameters in controls. Conclusions The AST is well-suited to simulate the effects of cognitive load on gait parameters, but not FOG severity, in gait experiments in persons with PD and FOG."

Antigen delivery systems to the skin by needle and syringe directly deposit the antigen into the epidermal-dermal compartment, one of the most immunocompetent sites due to the presence of professional antigen-presenting cells aimed at the induction of antigen-specific T cells. In this study, we analyzed the amount of ovalbumin as an antigen delivered to the skin by a microneedle. When ovalbumin protein as an antigen was delivered to the skin of mice using a dissolving microneedle, it induced an immune response through the enhanced proliferation and cytokines production by the splenocytes and lymph nodes. Also, it effectively increased the ovalbumin-specific CD8+ T cell and CD4+ T cell population and induced an ovalbumin-specific CTL response against the graft of ovalbumin-expressing EG7 tumor cells in the immunized mice. Also, we identified the inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of tumor formation in the context of the therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine, respectively through EG-7 tumor mouse model. Finally, these data show the potential of patches as attractive antigen delivery vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2966006321,"Following the treads of our previous works on the unveiling of bioactive peptides encrypted in plant proteins from diverse species, the present manuscript reports the occurrence of four proof-of-concept intragenic antimicrobial peptides in human proteins, named Hs IAPs. These IAPs were prospected using the software Kamal, synthesized by solid phase chemistry, and had their interactions with model phospholipid vesicles investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism. Their antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi was determined, along with their cytotoxicity towards erythrocytes. Our data demonstrates that Hs IAPs are capable to bind model membranes while attaining α-helical structure, and to inhibit the growth of microorganisms at concentrations as low as 1μM. Hs02, a novel sixteen residue long internal peptide (KWAVRIIRKFIKGFIS-NH2) derived from the unconventional myosin 1h protein, was further investigated in its capacity to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced release of TNF-α in murine macrophages. Hs02 presented potent anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting the release of TNF-α in LPS-primed cells at the lowest assayed concentration, 0.1 μM. A three-dimensional solution structure of Hs02 bound to DPC micelles was determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Our work exemplifies how the human genome can be mined for molecules with biotechnological potential in human health and demonstrates that IAPs are actual alternatives to antimicrobial peptides as pharmaceutical agents or in their many other putative applications."
https://openalex.org/W2964837003,"Among the cancer susceptibility genes, TP53 is one of the crucial genes involved in cell cycle regulations and, therefore, it greatly affects breast cancer initiation and progression. In addition, WRAP53—a natural antisense transcript—regulates TP53 transcription and, as a protein, modulates the normal cell cycle, which results in breast cancer susceptibility. In this study, we aimed to analyze a haplotype comprising four SNPs, including rs1042522, rs17878362, rs2287499, and rs2287498, which are located at 5′ regions of the TP53 and WRAP53 genes, in 118 patients and 110 healthy controls of the Iranian-Azeri population. In silico studies were conducted using the SIFT, Polyphen2, Fanthmm, RNAsnp, and SNP&GO online servers. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and D′ for each combination of the markers were calculated via the Haploview program. Our results showed that the GA1CC haplotype was the most frequent in the studied population. Additionally, no significant LD between any pairwise haplotypes was observed. The GA1CC and CA2GC haplotypes were significantly associated with breast cancer susceptibility. Moreover, the in silico analysis revealed the negative effects of rs2287499 and rs1042522 on WRAP53 and P53, respectively. In conclusion, the CA1GC haplotype was strongly identified as a breast cancer risk factor, and the GA1CC haplotype was assumed to be a protective factor against breast cancer risk. Hence, these markers may potentially be used as molecular prognostic and predictive biomarkers for breast cancer."

Cytokines are a large class of soluble proteins that dimerize transmembrane receptors into precise signaling topologies, but there is a need for alternative, engineerable ligand scaffolds that specifically recognize and stabilize these protein interactions. Recombinant antibodies can potentially serve as robust and versatile platforms for cytokine complex stabilization, and their specificity allows for tunable modulation of dimerization equilibrium. Here, we devised an evolutionary strategy to isolate monovalent antibody fragments that bridge together two different receptor subunits in a cytokine–receptor complex, precisely as the receptors are disposed in their natural signaling orientations. To do this, we screened a naive antibody library against a stabilized ligand–receptor ternary complex that acted as a “molecular cast” of the natural receptor dimer conformation. Our selections elicited “stapler” single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of antibodies that specifically engage the interleukin-4 receptor heterodimer. The 3.1 Å resolution crystal structure of one such stapler revealed that, as intended, this scFv recognizes a composite epitope between the two receptors as they are positioned in the complex. Extending our approach, we evolved a stapler scFv that specifically binds to and stabilizes the interface between the interleukin-2 cytokine and one of its receptor subunits, leading to a 15-fold enhancement in interaction affinity.

First, the short in vivo half-life (typically <5 min) of cytokines mandates frequent injection or continuous infusion. Second, cytokines are pleiotropic, often activating a wide range of cell types expressing shared receptors, which hinders efficacy and can lead to systemic toxicity. Finally, these ligands are difficult to re-engineer or modify without concerns about immunogenicity (18Donohue J.H. Rosenberg S.A. The fate of interleukin-2 after in vivo administration.J.

Here, we sought to develop an evolutionary strategy for the discovery of antibody-based constructs that simultaneously engage two interacting subunits within dimerized receptors, as they are disposed in their native signaling conformations induced by endogenous cytokines (Fig. 1A, right). Antibody Fab fragments or single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are widely known to recognize “composite” ligand surfaces, such as Fabs that bind across the interfaces between different subunits of a multimeric antigen. Yet it is not clear whether such composite interface-recognizing Fabs can be evolved to specifically recognize and bridge protein interfaces. We wished to isolate monovalent antibodies (which we term “staplers”) that bind to the composite dimer surface formed by the “stem region” of the receptors when complexed with their natural cytokine ligands (i.e. the “product complex”) (Fig. 1B). We used a soluble cytokine–receptor ECD complex to act as a “molecular cast” of the receptor dimer signaling conformation to isolate monovalent antibody fragments specific for the productive signaling complex, but not for the individual complex components. We hypothesized that the evolved antibodies would be specific for the “locked” receptor dimer stem region, binding to the receptor subunits in the geometry induced by the natural cytokine (Fig. 1A). We focused our stapler engineering efforts on the interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokine, a member of the family of common γ-chain (γc) cytokines, which are critical for lymphocyte homeostasis and have been used to treat diseases such as cancer, chronic infection, and autoimmune disorders (5Rochman Y. Spolski R. Leonard W.J. New insights into the regulation of T cells by γ(c) family cytokines.Nat. Rev.

IL-4 signals through either a type I heterodimeric receptor comprised of IL-4 receptor-α (IL-4Rα) and the γc subunit or a type II heterodimeric receptor comprised of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1 (3Wang X. Lupardus P. Laporte S.L. Garcia K.C. Structural biology of shared cytokine receptors.Annu. Rev.

The crystal structure of the type I IL-4 cytokine–receptor complex extracellular domains has been determined, revealing that the membrane-proximal domains of the receptor ECDs form a “stem region” of intimate receptor–receptor contact (Fig. S1) (34LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X. Heller N.M. Keegan A.D. Garcia K.C.

We targeted these stem regions to isolate monovalent antibody fragments that bridge the type I IL-4 receptor dimer by simultaneously binding to the membrane-proximal domains of IL-4Rα and γc. Crystallographic analysis showed that our evolved stapler indeed binds an interface spanning the two receptor subunits. We then extended our selection strategy to evolve scFvs that stabilize the interface between another γc cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and one of its receptor subunits. We showed that these scFvs enhance IL-2–receptor interaction and potentiate cytokine signaling in the context of an activity-impaired mutant. With this proof-of-concept demonstration for evolution of customized scFvs that recognize composite surfaces, our strategy could, in principle, enable discovery of stapler antibodies that modulate the activity of cytokines and other classes of natural ligands for a variety of therapeutic indications. To screen for IL-4 staplers, we selected a diverse (109 clones) yeast-displayed nonimmune human scFv library (35Feldhaus M.J. Siegel R.W. Opresko L.K. Coleman J.R. Feldhaus J.M.W. Yeung Y.A. Cochran J.R. Heinzelman P. Colby D. Swers J. Graff C. Wiley H.S. Wittrup K.D. Flow-cytometric isolation of human antibodies from a nonimmune Saccharomyces cerevisiae surface display library.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21 (12536217): 163-17010.1038/nbt785Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) against the type I IL-4 cytokine–receptor ternary complex (i.e. cytokine bound to two receptor subunits) through iterative rounds of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) (Fig. 1B). There were two critical considerations for the selection of stapler scFvs: 1) the stability of the cytokine–receptor complex selection reagent that served as the “molecular cast” of the signaling dimer and 2) the use of a multistep selection scheme to positively select against these stabilized complexes and negatively select against the individual subunits to enrich for scFvs that specifically bind to receptor dimers. To ensure stability of the target complex throughout the IL-4 stapler selections, we substituted the cytokine with an engineered variant of IL-4 (denoted “Super-4”) that has 3700-fold higher affinity for γc (36Junttila I.S. Creusot R.J. Moraga I. Bates D.L. Wong M.T. Alonso M.N. Suhoski M.M. Lupardus P. Meier-Schellersheim M. Engleman E.G. Utz P.J. Fathman C.G. Paul W.E. Garcia K.C. Redirecting cell-type specific cytokine responses with engineered interleukin-4 superkines.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8 (23103943): 990-99810.1038/nchembio.1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and used the stabilized Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc ternary complex as our positive selection reagent. For each round of selection, we carried out two steps of negative selection against 1) γc and 2) IL-4/IL-4Rα binary complex preceding a positive selection step against the Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc target complex (Fig. S2). This sequence was iterated over six rounds of selection, decreasing only the concentration of the target complex to increase stringency. Following selections, the library converged on three scFv clones denoted A2 (henceforth referred to as “IL-4 stapler”), A8, and A11 (Fig. S3). The yeast-displayed IL-4 stapler, A8, and A11 scFvs exhibited robust binding to the Super-4 ternary complex but not to any of the individual components or binary complex combinations thereof (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4). These scFvs were also specific for the Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc ternary complex and showed no reactivity with the IL-13/IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 or IL-2/IL-2Rβ/γc ternary complexes, indicating that receptor chain engagement occurred only in the context of the assembled IL-4Rα/γc heterodimer. On-yeast binding studies also revealed that IL-4 stapler bound weakly to the IL-4Rα chain and the Super-4/IL-4Rα binary complex, but binding was substantially enhanced in the presence of the full Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc ternary complex (Fig. 1C). Importantly, our engineered stapler scFvs did not bind to the type II IL-4 receptor complex composed of IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 and are thus highly specific for the IL-4Rα/γc type I IL-4 receptor heterodimer. This represents a major difference from endogenous IL-4, which cross-reacts with both type I and type II receptors and induces pleiotropic effects that have limited the utility of cytokine as a therapeutic to boost the type 2 helper T cell immune response (36Junttila I.S. Creusot R.J. Moraga I. Bates D.L. Wong M.T. Alonso M.N. Suhoski M.M. Lupardus P. Meier-Schellersheim M. Engleman E.G. Utz P.J. Fathman C.G. Paul W.E. Garcia K.C.

Biol. 2012; 8 (23103943): 990-99810.1038/nchembio.1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The binding and specificity of recombinantly expressed IL-4 stapler scFv to the Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc target complex was evaluated via surface plasmon resonance. Consistent with on-yeast studies, IL-4 stapler scFv showed no binding to either Super-4 or γc and bound the IL-4Rα subunit with weak affinity, but it interacted strongly with the full ternary complex (Fig. 1D). The equilibrium binding constant (KD) for the stapler/ternary complex interaction was found to be 880 nm, whereas IL-4 stapler/IL-4Rα interaction was >10-fold weaker (Fig. 1E and Fig. S5), confirming the selectivity of IL-4 stapler for the active signaling complex. The A8 and A11 scFvs also bound the Super-4 ternary complex, but with affinities in the micromolar range (Fig. S4). By contrast, the IL-4 cytokine binds the IL-4Rα subunit alone with ∼150 pm affinity (37Hage T. Sebald W. Reinemer P. Crystal structure of the interleukin-4/receptor α chain complex reveals a mosaic binding interface.Cell. 1999; 97 (10219247): 271-28110.1016/S0092-8674(00)80736-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To obtain structural evidence that the IL-4 stapler scFv recognizes a composite epitope formed by the conjunction of two receptor subunits (Fig. 1A), we reformatted the stapler scFv as a Fab fragment and determined the crystal structure of the Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc ternary complex bound to the stapler Fab to 3.1 Å resolution (Fig. 2A, Fig. S6, and Table 1). As selections and binding studies were performed in the presence of cytokine, we expected that the stapler would engage the membrane-proximal “stem regions” of the receptor subunits, distal from the site of cytokine engagement. The Fab heavy-chain (HC)/light-chain (LC) heterodimer axis coincides almost perfectly with the IL-4Rα/γc dimer interface. We also found close agreement between the orientation of the IL-4Rα and γc subunits in the presence of the stapler compared with the natural ternary complex. The receptor chains in the stapler-bound Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc ternary complex align closely with their conformations in the native IL-4 type I ternary complex (PDB code 3BPL, RMSD = 0.506 Å for IL-4Rα and RMSD = 0.643 Å for γc). Furthermore, fixing the IL-4Rα1 subunit in both structures, the γc subunit is rotated by just 5.3° in the presence of the stapler. By comparison, a diabody that homodimerizes the erythropoietin receptor but elicits only weak agonist activity induces a 151° relative rotation in the receptor subunits (31Moraga I. Wernig G.

The IL-4 stapler Fab interface with the receptor subunits is partitioned between the variable domains; whereas the IL-4Rα interface is dominated by contacts with the variable heavy (VH) chain, the γc interface principally comprises contacts with the variable light (VL) chain (Fig. 2B and Fig. S7). For both the VH and VL domains, all three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are implicated in receptor interactions. The more extensive Fab interface with IL-4Rα compared with γc rationalizes the weak affinity observed between IL-4 stapler and IL-4Rα alone (Fig. 2B and Fig. S7).Table 1Crystallographic statistics for Super-4/IL-4Rα/γc/IL-4 stapler Fab complexParametersValuesData collection Wavelength0.9999 Resolution range63.1–3.10 (3.22–3.10)aValues in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.

Open table in a new tab Given our success in engineering scFvs that recognize epitopes that span multiple cytokine receptor subunits, we attempted to extend the stapling concept to select for interface-bridging scFvs that stabilize interactions between cytokines and their cognate receptor subunits (Fig. 3A). In particular, we aimed to evolve a single-chain species that potentiates the interaction between the interleukin-2 (IL-2) cytokine and one of its receptor subunits. IL-2 signals through either a high-affinity (KD ≈ 10 pm) heterotrimeric receptor comprised of the IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and γc chains or an intermediate-affinity (KD ≈ 1 nm) heterodimeric receptor consisting of only the IL-2Rβ and γc chains (Fig. S8) (38Liao W.

These isoforms define several of the key characteristics of the different striated muscle fiber types, including maximum shortening velocity. We have previously used recombinant isoforms of the motor domains of seven different human myosin isoforms to define the actin·myosin cross-bridge cycle in solution. Here, we present data on an eighth isoform, the perinatal, which has not previously been characterized. The perinatal is distinct from the embryonic isoform, appearing to have features in common with the adult fast-muscle isoforms, including weak affinity of ADP for actin·myosin and fast ADP release. We go on to use a recently developed modeling approach, MUSICO, to explore how well the experimentally defined cross-bridge cycles for each isoform in solution can predict the characteristics of muscle fiber contraction, including duty ratio, shortening velocity, ATP economy, and load dependence of these parameters. The work shows that the parameters of the cross-bridge cycle predict many of the major characteristics of each muscle fiber type and raises the question of what sequence changes are responsible for these characteristics."

Here, we set out to provide a fast and sensitive method for the monitoring of AEG, BAMA, DAB and BMAA in surface waters. A procedure based on aqueous derivatization with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) was investigated for this purpose. Under optimized conditions, a small aqueous sample aliquot (5 mL) was spiked with BMAA-d3 internal standard, subjected to FMOC-Cl derivatization, centrifuged, and analyzed. The high-throughput instrumental method (10 min per sample) involved on-line pre-concentration and desalting coupled to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Chromatographic gradient and mobile phases were adjusted to obtain suitable separation of the 4 isomers. The method limits of detection were in the range of 2–5 ng L-1. In-matrix validation parameters including linearity range, accuracy, precision, and matrix effects were assessed. The method was applied to surface water samples (n = 82) collected at a large spatial scale in lakes and rivers in Canada. DAB was found in >70% of samples at variable concentrations (<3–1,900 ng L-1), the highest concentrations corresponding to lake samples in cyanobacterial bloom periods. BMAA was only reported (110 ng L-1) at one HAB-impacted location. This is one of the first studies to report on the profiles of AEG, BAMA, DAB, and BMAA in background and impacted surface waters."

Methods Development of the AWACAN tool followed 4 steps: 1) Item generation based on existing measures and relevant literature. 2) Refinement of items via assessment of content and face validity using cancer experts’ ratings and think aloud interviews with community participants in Uganda and South Africa. 3) Administration of the tool to community participants, university staff and cancer experts for assessment of validity using test-retest reliability (using Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) and adjusted Kappa coefficients), construct validity (comparing expert and community participant responses using t-tests) and internal reliability (using the Kuder-Richarson (KR-20) coefficient). 4) Translation of the final AWACAN tool into isiXhosa and Acholi. Results ICC scores indicated good test-retest reliability (≥ 0.7) for all breast cancer knowledge domains and cervical cancer risk factor and lay belief domains. Experts had higher knowledge of breast cancer risk factors (p < 0.001), and cervical cancer risk factors (p = 0.003) and symptoms (p = 0.001) than community participants, but similar knowledge of breast cancer symptoms (p = 0.066). Internal reliability for breast cancer risk factors, lay beliefs and symptom and cervical cancer symptom subscales was good with KR-20 values > 0.7, and lower (0.6) for the cervical cancer risk subscale. Conclusion The final AWACAN tool includes items on socio-demographic details; breast and cervical cancer symptom awareness, risk factor awareness, lay beliefs, anticipated help-seeking behaviour; and barriers to seeking care. The tools showed evidence of content, face, construct and internal validity and test-retrest reliability and are available for use in SSA in three languages."
https://openalex.org/W2964905843,"Introduction In the equine racehorse industry, reduced athletic performance due to joint injury and lameness has been extensively reviewed. Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are routinely used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injections of pharmaceutical agents require practice for precise needle placement and to minimize complications. Training on simulators or models is a viable alternative for developing these technical skills. The purpose of this study was to compare the qualitative ultrasonographic characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) printed models of equine cervical articular process joints to that of a dissected equine cervical spine (gold standard). Methods A randomized complete block design study was conducted in which a total of thirteen cervical articular process joint models were printed using several materials, printers, and printing technologies. Ultrasound video clips with the models immersed in water were recorded. Two board certified veterinary radiologists and three veterinary radiology residents reviewed the videos and responded to a survey assessing and comparing the ultrasonographic characteristics of the 3D printed models to those of the gold standard. Results Six 3D printed models had ultrasonographic characteristics similar to the gold standard. These six models were (material, printer, printing technology): nylon PA 12, EOS Formiga P100, selective laser sintering (P = 0.99); Onyx nylon with chopped carbon fiber, Markforged Onyx Two, fused deposition modeling (P = 0.48); polycarbonate, Ultimaker 3, fused deposition modeling (P = 0.28); gypsum, ProJet CJP 660 Pro, ColorJet Printing (P = 0.28); polylactic acid, Prusa I3, fused deposition modeling (P = 0.23); and high temperature V1 resin, Form 2, stereolithography (P = 0.22). Conclusion When assessed in water, it is possible to replicate the qualitative ultrasonographic characteristics of bone using three dimensional printed models made by combining different materials, printing technologies, and printers. However, not all models share similar qualitative ultrasonographic characteristics with bone. We suggest that the aforementioned six models be used as proxy for simulating bones or joints for use with ultrasound. In order to replicate the resistance and acoustic window provided by soft tissues, further work testing the ability of these models to withstand embedding in material such as ballistic gelatin is required."

Understanding the molecular-level dysfunction elicited by TF mutations is crucial to elucidate cardiac disease mechanisms. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–causing cardiac troponin T (cTnT) mutation Δ160Glu (Δ160E) is located in a putative “hinge” adjacent to an unstructured linker connecting domains TNT1 and TNT2. Currently, no high-resolution structure exists for this region, limiting significantly our ability to understand its role in myofilament activation and the molecular mechanism of mutation-induced dysfunction. Previous regulated in vitro motility data have indicated mutation-induced impairment of weak actomyosin interactions. We hypothesized that cTnT-Δ160E repositions the flexible linker, altering weak actomyosin electrostatic binding and acting as a biophysical trigger for impaired contractility and the observed remodeling. Using time-resolved FRET and an all-atom TF model, here we first defined the WT structure of the cTnT-linker region and then identified Δ160E mutation-induced positional changes. Our results suggest that the WT linker runs alongside the C terminus of tropomyosin. The Δ160E-induced structural changes moved the linker closer to the tropomyosin C terminus, an effect that was more pronounced in the presence of myosin subfragment (S1) heads, supporting previous findings. Our in silico model fully supported this result, indicating a mutation-induced decrease in linker flexibility. Our findings provide a framework for understanding basic pathogenic mechanisms that drive severe clinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotypes and for identifying structural targets for intervention that can be tested in silico and in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2964467121,"As the airline industry has become ever-more competitive and profitability more tenuous, airline service quality management has grown more important to airlines. Although many studies have focused on the evaluation of airline service quality, some common limitations need to be noted. First, traditional fuzzy logics were utilized to present linguistic variables as fuzzy numbers. However, precise quantification of lower and upper bounds with a single number is often difficult; thus, interval-valued fuzzy sets that represent the lower and upper bounds in the fuzzy number as an interval form should be applied instead. Second, while some studies have applied various multiple-criteria decision-making method [MCDM] and the service quality (SERVQUAL) method for evaluation of airline service quality, few have utilized grey relational analysis (GRA, a simple and data-driven MCDM method applicable to environments with incomplete information) and the service performance (SERVPERF), a performance-based measure that can resolve the ambiguity issue of the expectations construct in SERVQUAL. Third, extant studies dealing with the issue of weighting criteria in the evaluation of airline service quality have focused only on either subjective or objective weights, though weighting criteria based on a combined objective/subjective approach would be much better than those just considering the subjective approach. The present study endeavored to fill these literature gaps by developing, for evaluation of airline service quality, interval-valued fuzzy GRA with SERVPERF based on both subjective and objective weights. It contributes to the field by incorporating the 22 criteria from SERVPERF to effectively account for the various characteristics of airline service. Additionally, it is the first study to utilize interval-valued fuzzy GRA together with a novel technique that combines a subjective/objective weighting method for integration of objective decision-matrix-derived information with subjective decision-maker preferences. The supplemental empirical case study of airline service evaluation, further, provides researchers and practitioners with a means of better understanding the proposed approach in the practical perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W2964892149,"Autophagy plays multiple roles in host cells challenged with extracellular pathogens. Here, we aimed to explore whether autophagy inhibition could prevent bacterial infections. We first confirmed widely distinct patterns of autophagy responses in host cells infected with Staphylococcus aureus, as compared with Salmonella. Only infection with Staphylococcus produced strong accumulation of lipidated autophagy-related protein LC3B (LC3B-II). Infection with virulent Staphylococcus strains induced formation of p62-positive aggregates, suggestive of accumulated ubiquitinated targets. During Salmonella infection, bacteria remain enclosed by lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2)-positive lysosomes, whereas virulent Staphylococcus apparently exited from enlarged lysosomes and invaded the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, Staphylococcus appeared to escape from the lysosome without generation of membrane-damage signals as detected by galectin-3 recruitment. In contrast, Salmonella infection produced high levels of lysosomal damage, consistent with a downstream antibacterial xenophagy response. Finally, we studied the Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) regulatory complex, including the essential subunit autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13). Infection of cells with either Staphylococcus or Salmonella led to recruitment of ATG13 to sites of cytosolic bacterial cells to promote autophagosome formation. Of note, genetic targeting of ATG13 suppressed autophagy and the ability of Staphylococcus to infect and kill host cells. Two different ULK1 inhibitors also prevented Staphylococcus intracellular replication and host cell death. Interestingly, inhibition of the ULK1 pathway had the opposite effect on Salmonella, sensitizing cells to the infection. Our results suggest that ULK1 inhibitors may offer a potential strategy to impede cellular infection by S. aureus.

https://openalex.org/W2964925904,"Animal walking results from a complex interplay of central pattern generating networks (CPGs), local sensory signals expressing position, velocity and forces generated in the legs, and coordinating signals between neighboring legs. In particular, the CPGs control the activity of motoneuron (MN) pools which drive the muscles of the individual legs and are thereby responsible for the generation of rhythmic leg movements. The rhythmic activity of the CPGs as well as their connectivity can be modified by the aforementioned sensory signals. However, the precise nature of the interaction between the CPGs and these sensory signals has remained generally largely unknown. Experimental methods aiming at finding out details of these interactions often apply cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine in order to induce rhythmic activity in the CPGs. Using this general approach, we removed the influence of sensory signals and investigated the putative connections between CPGs controlling the upward/downward movement in the different legs of the stick insect. The experimental data, i.e. the measured MN activities, underwent connectivity analysis using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). This method can uncover the underlying coupling structure and strength between pairs of segmental CPGs. For the analysis we set up different coupling schemes (models) for DCM and compared them using Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Models with contralateral connections in each segment and ipsilateral connections on both sides, as well as the coupling from the meta- to the ipsilateral prothoracic ganglion were preferred by BMS to all other types of models tested. Moreover, the intrasegmental coupling strength in the mesothoracic ganglion was the strongest and most stable in all three ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2964951435,"Necrosis is a form of cell death that results in rupture of the plasma membrane and the release of cellular contents, and it can give rise to sterile inflammation in the retina and other tissues. The secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells contributes to retinal homeostasis as well as to pathological angiogenesis. We have now examined the effect of a necrotic cell lysate prepared from human RPE cells (NLR) on the release of VEGF by healthy RPE cells. We found that NLR markedly increased the release of VEGF from RPE cells and that this effect was attenuated by nintedanib, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, whereas it was unaffected by inhibitors of NF-κB signaling or of caspase-1. NLR also induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) in a manner sensitive to inhibition by nintedanib, although inhibitors of Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways did not affect NLR-induced VEGF secretion. In addition, nintedanib attenuated the development of choroidal neovascularization in mice. Our results have thus shown that a necrotic lysate of RPE cells induced VEGF secretion from healthy RPE cells and that this effect was mediated by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. They therefore suggest that VEGF secretion by healthy RPE cells is a potential therapeutic target for retinal diseases associated with sterile inflammation and pathological angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2965673477,"The conservation of tropical forests is recognized as one of the most important challenges for forestry, ecology and politics. Besides strict protection, the sustainable management of natural forests should be enhanced as a key part of the foundation for the maintenance of tropical rain forest ecosystems. Due to methodological reasons it has been complicated to attain reliable growth data to plan sustainable felling cycles and rotation periods. Tree ring analyses enable the estimation of growth rates over the entire life span of trees and their age as well as giving hints from forest dynamics in previous centuries. For tree ring analysis, stem disk samples were taken from three important commercial tree species (Cariniana micrantha, Caryocar villosum and Manilkara huberi) in the upland (terra firme) forests of the Precious Woods Amazon logging company near Itacoatiara, Brazil. Based on radiocarbon estimates of individual growth zones, the annual nature of tree rings was proven for the three species. Tree rings were measured and the results used together with height estimates to model diameter, height and volume growth. The age of the eldest tree, a C. micrantha, was 585 yrs with 165 cm in diameter. The species' diameter increments range from 0.20±0.12 cm yr-1 to 0.29±0.08 cm yr-1. At first sight, this is considerably lower than increments reported from other Amazonian or African timber species. Considering the respective wood density there is no significant difference in growth performance of dominant timber species across continents. The interpretation of lifetime tree ring curves indicate differences in shadow tolerance among species, the persistence of individuals in the understory for up to 150 years and natural stand dynamics without major disturbances. Management criteria should be adapted for the measured growth rates as they differed considerably from the Brazilian standards fixed by laws (felling cycle of 25-35 years and a common minimum logging diameter of 50 cm). Felling cycles should be increased to 32-51 years and minimum logging diameters to 63-123 cm depending on the species."
https://openalex.org/W2966620299,"The present retrospective study evaluated the progression of osteoarthritis in stifle joints based on the radiographic grade of osteoarthritis (OA) scored in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture. The aim of the study was to search for a correlation between the stage of radiographic osteoarthritis prior to surgery and the osteoarthritis progression occurring after the tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) procedure. It was hypothesized that the procedure carried out in dogs in the early stages of OA could reduce the OA changes. A total of 190 X-ray images obtained from the medical records of 38 dogs were evaluated. The radiographic signs of osteoarthritis of 38 stifle joints were scored from 0 to 3 in 10 specific anatomic locations. The radiographs were divided into 4 groups based on the global scores: A) no-OA, B) mild-OA, C) moderate-OA, D) severe-OA; they were assessed prior to surgery, and 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-operatively (T0, T1, T2, T3 and T6). There were no differences in osteoarthritis progression in Groups A and C at any time. Osteoarthritis changes from T0 to T6 were statistically significant in Group B. The OA changes in the anatomic locations were investigated. The most common anatomic sites for OA changes were the patella apex, the proximal and distal trochlear ridges, and the caudal aspect of the tibial plateau assessed before surgery. After surgery, the score increased in the first three locations in 10, 9 and 11 joints, respectively; instead, the progression of osteoarthritis in the caudal aspect of the tibial plateau occurred in 23 out of 38 stifle joints. The results indicated that the TTA procedure could be effective in slowing down the OA progression when carried out in the absence of or in the early stages of disease. Therefore, an early intervention may be suggested in clinical practice to obtain minimal or no progression 6 months postoperatively."

The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular profile in Swiss never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma and to correlate the mutation status with clinicopathologic and demographic patient characteristics and outcome. Methods One hundred thirty-eight never smokers diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma at the University Hospital Zurich between 2011–2018 were included in the study. Data from the electronic medical records were reviewed to characterize clinicopathologic and demographic features, molecular profile, treatment and outcome. Results The majority of patients were female (58.7%) with a median age at diagnosis of 64.5 years (range, 27.1–94.2 years). The most common mutations were EGFR (58.7%) followed by ALK (12.3%), TP53 (5.8%), MET (5.8%), KRAS (4.3%), ERBB2 (4.3%), PIK3CA (2.9%), BRAF (2.2%), ROS1 (1.4%), RET (1.4%), CTNNB1 (0.7%), PARP1 (0.7%), TET1 (0.7%) and PIK3CG (0.7%). Median overall survival (mOS) was 51.0 months (mo). Early clinical stage (p = 0.002) and treatment with targeted therapy (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.35–4.74, p = 0.004) were independently associated with longer mOS. Patients with oncogenic driver mutations had significantly longer mOS (52.2 mo) compared to patients without mutations (16.9 mo) (HR 3.38, 95% CI 1.52–7.55, p = 0.003). Besides, patients with EGFR mutated (57.8 mo) or ALK rearranged (59.9 mo) tumors had significantly longer mOS compared to the EGFR wildtype (35.0 mo), ALK wildtype (46.5 mo) and pan-negative (16.9 mo) cohorts (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.37–4.04, p = 0.002; HR 7.80, 95% CI 3.28–18.55, p < 0.001; HR 3.96, 95% CI 1.21–12.95, p = 0.023 and HR 34.78, 95% CI 3.48–34.65, p = 0.003). Conclusion Never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma display distinct clinicopathologic and molecular features and are characterized by a high incidence of targetable mutations. Never smokers with targetable mutations have significantly longer survival compared to patients without mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2964705795,"We investigated linear growth and weight attained among 772 children at 10–15 months of age in the first population-based birth cohort in the Brazilian Amazon. Sociodemographic, maternal and birth characteristics were collected in interviews soon after birth at baseline. Anthropometric evaluation was conducted at 10–15 months. Multiple linear regression models were fitted for length-for-age (LAZ) and body mass index (BMI)-for-age Z scores (BAZ), considering a hierarchical conceptual framework with determinants at distal, intermediate and proximal levels, with adjustment for the child’s sex and age. Mean LAZ and BAZ were 0.31 (SD: 1.13) and 0.35 (SD: 1.06), respectively. Overall, 2.2% of children were stunted and 6.6% overweight. Among socioeconomic factors, household wealth index was positively associated with LAZ (p for trend = 0.01), while children whose families received assistance from the Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer program were 0.16 Z score thinner (95% CI: -0.31, -0.00). Maternal height and BMI were positively associated with both LAZ and BAZ at 10–15 months of age (p for trend <0.001). Child’s size at birth was positively related with LAZ (p<0.001 for both birth weight and length). BAZ was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.44) higher, but 0.11 lower (95% CI: -0.21, -0.02), for each increase in 1 Z score of birth weight and length, respectively. Children with at least one reported malaria episode within the first year of life were 0.58 (95% CI: -1.05, -0.11) Z score shorter. Socioeconomic and intergenerational factors were consistently associated with LAZ and BAZ at 10–15 months of age. The occurrence of malaria was detrimental to linear growth. In a malaria endemic region, reduction of inequalities and disease burden over the first 1,000 days of life is essential for taking advantage of a critical window of opportunity that can redirect child growth trajectories toward better health and nutrition conditions in the long term."

We employ a negative binomial model to estimate effects of covariates on contact degree. We estimate the mean contact degree for asymptomatic Niakhar residents to be 16.5 (95% C.I. 14.3, 18.7) in the morning and 14.8 in the afternoon (95% C.I. 12.7, 16.9). We estimate that symptomatic people make 10% fewer contacts than asymptomatic people (95% C.I. 5%, 16%; p = 0.006), and those aged 0-5 make 33% fewer contacts than adults (95% C.I. 29%, 37%; p < 0.001). By explicitly modelling the partial rounding pattern observed in our data, we make inference for both the underlying (true) distribution of contacts as well as for the reported distribution. We created an estimator for homophily by compound (household) membership and estimate that 48% of contacts by symptomatic people are made to their own compound members in the morning (95% CI, 45%, 52%) and 60% in the afternoon/evening (95% CI, 56%, 64%). We did not find a significant effect of symptom status on compound homophily. We compare our findings to those from other countries and make design recommendations for future surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2966279533,"Men tend to dehydrate more than women after prolonged exercise, possibly due to lower water intake and higher perspiration rate. Women are prone to exercise-associated hyponatremia, primarily attributed to the higher water consumption causing hypervolemia. Since aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels in the kidney collecting duct (CD) principal cells (PCs) are involved in maintaining water balance, we investigated their role in sex-dependent water homeostasis in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Because CD intercalated cells (ICs) may also be involved in water balance, we also assessed the urine concentrating ability of V-ATPase B1 subunit-deficient (Atp6v1b1-/-) mice. Upon 12-hour water deprivation, urine osmolality increased by 59% in WT female mice and by only 28% in males. This difference was abolished in Atp6v1b1-/- mice, in which dehydration induced a ~30% increase in urine osmolarity in both sexes. AQP2 levels were highest in WT females; female Atp6v1b1-/- mice had substantially lower AQP2 expression than WT females, comparable to the low AQP2 levels seen in both Atp6v1b1-/- and WT males. After dehydration, AQP2 relocates towards the PC apical pole, especially in the inner stripe and inner medulla, and to a greater extent in WT females than in WT males. This apparent sex-dependent concentrating advantage was absent in Atp6v1b1-/- females, whose reduced AQP2 apical relocation was similar to WT males. Accordingly, female mice concentrate urine better than males upon dehydration due to increased AQP2 expression and mobilization. Moreover, our data support the involvement of ICs in water homeostasis, at least partly mediated by V-ATPase, in a sex-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2964776886,"Background Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of liver grafts donated after circulatory death (DCD) has shown promise in large animal and clinical trials. Following procurement, initial flush with a cold preservation solution is the standard of care. There is concern that initial cooling followed by warming may exacerbate liver injury, and the optimal initial flush temperature has yet to be identified. We hypothesize that avoidance of the initial cold flush will yield better quality liver grafts. Methods Twenty-four anaesthetized pigs were withdrawn from mechanical ventilation and allowed to arrest. After 60-minutes of warm ischemia to simulate a DCD procurement, livers were flushed with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) at 4°C, 25°C or 35°C (n = 4 per group). For comparison, an adenosine-lidocaine crystalloid solution (AD), shown to have benefit at warm temperatures in heart perfusions, was also used (n = 4 per group). During 12-hours of NMP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactate, transaminase levels, and histological injury were determined. Bile production and hemodynamics were monitored continuously. Results ATP levels recovered substantially following 1-hour of NMP reaching pre-ischemic levels by the end of NMP with no difference between groups. There was no difference in peak aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Portal vein resistance was lowest in the 4°C group reaching significance after 2 hours (0.13 CI -0.01,0.277, p = 0.025). Lactate levels recovered promptly with no difference between groups. Comparison to AD groups showed no statistical difference in the abovementioned parameters. On electron microscopy the HTK4°C group had the least edema with mean cell thickness of 2.92μm (p = 0.41) while also having the least sinusoidal dilatation with a mean diameter of 5.36μm (p = 0.04). For AD, the 25°C group had the lowest mean cell thickness at 3.14μm (p = 0.09). Conclusions Avoidance of the initial cold flush failed to demonstrate added benefit over standard 4°C HTK in this DCD model of liver perfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2965329631,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is featured by increased plasma very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). The extent to which plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels are elevated in NAFLD is unclear. We determined whether plasma ApoE is elevated in subjects with suspected NAFLD. Plasma ApoE and genotypes were determined in 6,762 participants of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) cohort. A Fatty Liver Index (FLI) ≥ 60 was used as a proxy of NAFLD. A total of 1,834 participants had a FLI ≥ 60, which coincided with increased triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, ApoB and ApoE (all P<0.001). In multivariable linear regression analysis, plasma ApoE levels were positively associated with an elevated FLI when taking account of ApoE genotypes and other clinical and laboratory covariates (fully adjusted model: β = 0.201, P<0.001). Stratified analysis for ApoE genotypes (ApoE ε3ε3 homozygotes, ApoE ε2 carriers, and ApoE ε3ε4 and ε4ε4 carriers combined), also showed positive associations of plasma ApoE levels with an elevated FLI in each group (all P<0.001). In conclusion, it is suggested that NAFLD is characterized by increased plasma ApoE levels, even when taking account of the various ApoE genotypes. Increased plasma ApoE may contribute to altered VLDL metabolism and to increased atherosclerosis susceptibility in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2964828987,"Objective To evaluate the effects of Process-Reengineering interventions on the Electronic Health Records (EHR) of a hospital over 7 years. Materials and methods Temporal Variability Assessment (TVA) based on probabilistic data quality assessment was applied to the historic monthly-batched admission data of Hospital La Fe Valencia, Spain from 2010 to 2016. Routine healthcare data with a complete EHR was expanded by processed variables such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results Four Process-Reengineering interventions were detected by quantifiable effects on the EHR: (1) the hospital relocation in 2011 involved progressive reduction of admissions during the next four months, (2) the hospital services re-configuration incremented the number of inter-services transfers, (3) the care-services re-distribution led to transfers between facilities (4) the assignment to the hospital of a new area with 80,000 patients in 2015 inspired the discharge to home for follow up and the update of the pre-surgery planned admissions protocol that produced a significant decrease of the patient length of stay. Discussion TVA provides an indicator of the effect of process re-engineering interventions on healthcare practice. Evaluating the effect of facilities’ relocation and increment of citizens (findings 1, 3–4), the impact of strategies (findings 2–3), and gradual changes in protocols (finding 4) may help on the hospital management by optimizing interventions based on their effect on EHRs or on data reuse. Conclusions The effects on hospitals EHR due to process re-engineering interventions can be evaluated using the TVA methodology. Being aware of conditioned variations in EHR is of the utmost importance for the reliable reuse of routine hospitalization data."
https://openalex.org/W2965420054,"Alternative splicing is a co-transcriptional mechanism that generates protein diversity by including or excluding exons in different combinations, thereby expanding the diversity of protein isoforms of a single gene. Abnormalities in this process can result in deleterious effects to human health, and several xenobiotics are known to interfere with splicing regulation through multiple mechanisms. These changes could lead to human diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, and developmental disorders. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an environmental contaminant generated as a byproduct of various industrial activities. Exposure to this dioxin has been linked to a wide range of pathologies through the alteration of multiple cellular processes. However, the effects of TCDD exposure on alternative splicing have not yet been studied. Here, we investigated whether a single po. dose of 5 μg/kg or 500 μg/kg TCDD influence hepatic alternative splicing in adult male C57BL/6Kou mouse. We identified several genes whose alternative splicing of precursor messenger RNAs was modified following TCDD exposure. In particular, we demonstrated that alternative splicing of Cyp1a1, Ahrr, and Actn1 was significantly altered after TCDD treatment. These findings show that the exposure to TCDD has an impact on alternative-splicing, and suggest a new avenue for understanding TCDD-mediated toxicity and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2965501013,"Bone remodeling is an essential physiological process in growth and healing. In modern systems deviations from normal bone physiology in the form of pathologies aid in the understanding of normal bone metabolism. Here we use external morphology and X-ray microtomography to diagnose and describe a metabolic bone disease in an amniote from the early Permian. The specimen consists of two fused tail vertebrae of a small varanopid from early Permian (289 million years old) cave deposits near Richards Spur, Oklahoma, USA. Inspection of the outer morphology reveals that the fusion encompasses the vertebral centra, zygopophyses and haemal arches, with the fusion zones distinctly swollen on the left side of the specimen. With visualization of its internal structure by microCT, this specimen is diagnosed as a complex metabolic bone disease. The radiological imaging suggests a pathologically high bone turnover rate, as shown by abnormal bone formation in some areas and increased bone resorption in others. This supports that the varanopid suffered from a metabolic bone disease similar to Paget's disease of bone as seen in humans today, which is linked to both genetic and viral factors. This finding extends the occurrence of Paget-like disease to the early Permian, and-provided a viral component was present-would also be by far the oldest evidence of viral infection in the fossil record."

This study aims to determine the prioritization of drug development in Indonesia through the evidence-based policymaking process in order to close the distance between stated policy goals and the realization of planned goals.A quantitative approach in the form of cross-sectional research using a structured survey was adopted and validated using a set of techniques involved in the calculation of a structural equation model. An independent samples t-test was used to test the significance of the differences between two views: pharmaceutical industries and the government of Indonesia.The study reveals that pharmaceutical industries and governments were highly consistent in their perceived challenges in facing the drug development. It also reveals drivers and weaknesses of drug development, including market opportunities, push-pull-regulatory pull factors and regulation, as priorities for improvement.Gap analysis based on a structural model was borne out to address gap challenges between policy and its implementation, with the use of evidence-based policymaking."
https://openalex.org/W2966518705,"Institution-centered accounts of generalized trust rely on the idea that law-breaking and state’s unfairness lower individuals’ propensity to trust fellow citizens because of a weaker confidence in the state. Despite the theoretical relevance attributed to this mediation mechanism, no empirical analysis in the literature has focused on examining its correlational validity. Using data from the European Social Survey (2010), the Quality of Government EU Regional data, and EUROSTAT, this paper assesses the intervening role of institutional trust on the relationship between crime rates, state’s fairness, and generalized trust. Results from a Multilevel SEM (MSEM) mediation analysis indicate that trust in institutions strongly mediates the relationship between violent crimes (i.e. homicide) and generalized trust but not the one between property crimes (i.e. vehicle thefts and robberies) and generalized trust. On the other hand, indicators of fairness (i.e. impartiality and corruption) are all mediated by institutional trust, though impartiality maintains a significant direct effect. Overall, findings support the institutional approach, confirming that the negative relationship between ineffective and unfair institutions and generalized trust passes mostly through people’s lost faith in the state."
https://openalex.org/W2965194175,"Karst collapse column is a serious geological disaster in China's coal mines. There are various karst collapse columns in coal mine areas, such as Huainan, Huaibei, Xingtai, Lu'an. And they have seriously affected mining safety and geological environment. The present research is focused on analyzing subsidence mechanism and dynamic collapse process. Based on mechanical analysis of thin plate theory, a detailed model of collapse column slipping and bending fracture is constructed to gather the critical conditions of the collapse column roof. The sensitivity parameters analysis shows that both the radius and roof thickness of cave have a great influence on the sliding instability and bending fracture. Meanwhile, the buried depth also affects bending failure. The discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) method is used to simulate and analyze the collapse process. The numerical results indicate that the stability of inverted funnel collapse column is dominated by the bending stress of roof strata. The movement of columnar collapse column is mainly caused by sliding instability. However, the funnel collapse column is relatively stable, and does not change in the same condition. The displacement field analysis shows that the collapse range of inverted funnel collapse column is obviously larger than that of columnar collapse column, in which its maximum displacement is approximately 1.5 times that of the columnar collapse column. There is no large area collapse on the upper part of the funnel collapse column, and the block system is relatively stable. The principal stress field analysis proves the above results."
https://openalex.org/W2965614839,"We present the first study to examine the year-round distribution, activity patterns, and habitat use of one of New Zealand’s most common seabirds, the fluttering shearwater (Puffinus gavia). Seven adults from Burgess Island, in the Hauraki Gulf, and one individual from Long Island, in the Marlborough Sounds, were successfully tracked with combined light-saltwater immersion loggers for one to three years. Our tracking data confirms that fluttering shearwaters employ different overwintering dispersal strategies, where three out of eight individuals, for at least one of the three years when they were being tracked, crossed the Tasman Sea to forage over coastal waters along eastern Tasmania and southeastern Australia. Resident birds stayed confined to waters of northern and central New Zealand year-round. Although birds frequently foraged over pelagic shelf waters, the majority of tracking locations were found over shallow waters close to the coast. All birds foraged predominantly in daylight and frequently visited the colony at night throughout the year. We found no significant inter-seasonal differences in the activity patterns, or between migratory and resident individuals. Although further studies of inter-colony variation in different age groups will be necessary, this study presents novel insights into year-round distribution, activity patterns and habitat use of the fluttering shearwater, which provide valuable baseline information for conservation as well as for further ecological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2966115183,"Babesia bovis establishes persistent infections of long duration in cattle, despite the development of effective anti-disease immunity. One mechanism used by the parasite to achieve persistence is rapid antigenic variation of the VESA1 cytoadhesion ligand through segmental gene conversion (SGC), a phenomenon thought to be a form of homologous recombination (HR). To begin investigation of the enzymatic basis for SGC we initially identified and knocked out the Bbrad51 gene encoding the B. bovis Rad51 ortholog. BbRad51 was found to be non-essential for in vitro growth of asexual-stage parasites. However, its loss resulted in hypersensitivity to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and an apparent defect in HR. This defect rendered attempts to complement the knockout phenotype by reinsertion of the Bbrad51 gene into the genome unsuccessful. To circumvent this difficulty, we constructed an artificial chromosome, BbACc3, into which the complete Bbrad51 locus was inserted, for expression of BbRad51 under regulation by autologous elements. Maintenance of BbACc3 makes use of centromeric sequences from chromosome 3 and telomeric ends from chromosome 1 of the B. bovis C9.1 line. A selection cassette employing human dihydrofolate reductase enables recovery of transformants by selection with pyrimethamine. We demonstrate that the BbACc3 platform is stably maintained once established, assembles nucleosomes to form native chromatin, and expands in telomere length over time. Significantly, the MMS-sensitivity phenotype observed in the absence of Bbrad51 was successfully complemented at essentially normal levels. We provide cautionary evidence, however, that in HR-competent parasites BbACc3 can recombine with native chromosomes, potentially resulting in crossover. We propose that, under certain circumstances this platform can provide a useful alternative for the genetic manipulation of this group of parasites, particularly when regulated gene expression under the control of autologous elements may be important."
https://openalex.org/W2965632911,"Pathogen-free stocks of vegetatively propagated plants are crucial in certified plant production. They require regular monitoring of the plant germplasm for pathogens, especially of the stocks maintained in the field. Here we tested pre-basic mother plants of Fragaria, Rubus and Ribes spp., and conserved accessions of the plant genetic resources of Rubus spp. maintained at research stations in Finland, for the presence of viruses using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -based diagnostics (VirusDetect). The advance of the method is that unrelated viruses can be detected simultaneously without resumptions of the viruses present. While no virus was detected in pre-basic mother plants of Fragaria and Ribes species, rubus yellow net virus (RYNV) was detected in pre-basic mother plants of Rubus. Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV), black raspberry necrosis virus (BRNV), raspberry vein chlorosis virus (RVCV) and RYNV were detected in the Rubus genetic resource collection. The L polymerase encoding sequence characterized from seven RVCV isolates showed considerable genetic variation. The data provide the first molecular biological evidence for the presence of RYNV in Finland. RYNV was not revealed in virus indexing by indicator plants, which suggests that it may be endogenously present in some raspberry cultivars. In addition, a putative new RYNV-like badnavirus was detected in Rubus spp. Blackcurrant reversion virus (BRV) and gooseberry vein banding associated virus (GVBaV) were detected in symptomatic Ribes plants grown in the field. Results were consistent with those obtained using PCR or reverse transcription PCR and suggest that the current virus indexing methods of pre-basic mother plants work as expected. Furthermore, many new viruses were identified in the collections of plant genetic resources not previously tested for viruses. In the future, siRNA-based diagnostics could be a useful supplement for the currently used virus detection methods in certified plant production and thus rationalize and simplify the current testing system."
https://openalex.org/W2966324149,"In the Baltic Sea redoxcline, lysogenic viruses infecting prokaryotes have rarely been detected using the commonly used inducing agent mitomycin C. However, it is well known that not all viruses are induceable by mitomycin C and growing evidence suggests that changes in trophic conditions may trigger the induction of lysogenic viruses. We hypothesized that using antibiotics to simulate a strong change in trophic conditions for antibiotica-resistant cells due to reduced competition for resources might lead to the induction of lysogenic viruses into the lytic cycle within these cells. This hypothesis was tested by incubating prokaryotes obtained throughout the Baltic Sea redoxcline in seawater with substantially reduced numbers of viruses. We used a mixture of the protein synthesis-inhibiting antibiotics streptomycin and erythromycin to induce the desired changes in trophic conditions for resistant cells and at the same time ensuring that no progeny viruses were formed in sensitive cells. No inducible lysogenic viruses could be detected in incubations amended with mitomycin C. Yet, the presence of streptomycin and erythromycin increased virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes by 56–930% compared to controls, resulting in the induction of lysogenic viruses equivalent to 2–14% of in situ prokaryotic abundance. The results indicate the existence of a previously unrecognized induction mechanism for lysogenic viruses in the Baltic Sea redoxcline, as the mode of action distinctly differs between the used antibiotics (no virus production within affected cells) and mitomycin C (lysogenic viruses are produced within affected cells). Obtaining accurate experimental data on levels of lysogeny in prokaryotic host cells remains challenging, as relying on mitomycin C alone may severely underestimate lysogeny."
https://openalex.org/W2964405579,"Short stress management interventions such as relaxation therapy have demonstrated preliminary effectiveness in reducing stress-related problems. A promising tool to strengthen the effectiveness of relaxation-based interventions is the use of verbal suggestions, as previous research provided evidence that verbal suggestions can induce positive outcome expectancies, facilitate adaptive responses to stress and improve health outcomes. The present experimental proof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the effects of a brief relaxation intervention and specifically the role of verbal suggestions on stress-related outcomes assessed by self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological data. 120 participants (mean age = 22.1 years) were randomized to one of four intervention conditions: a brief relaxation intervention plus verbal suggestions condition, a brief relaxation intervention only condition, a verbal suggestions only condition, and a control condition. Afterwards, participants were subjected to a psychosocial stress challenge to assess reactivity to a stressful event. Immediately after both relaxation interventions (with and without verbal suggestions), lower self-reported state anxiety was found compared to the control condition, but no differences were observed in response to the stressor. The verbal suggestions only condition did not impact state anxiety. No significant effects were found for verbal suggestion interventions on cortisol, alpha amylase, heart rate and skin conductance. This is the first study investigating the role of verbal suggestions in the effectiveness of a brief relaxation intervention. Although this experimental proof-of-concept study provides support for the effectiveness of a brief relaxation intervention in lowering state anxiety directly after the intervention, the effects did not impact the response to a subsequent stressor and we did not observe any evidence for the add-on effectiveness of verbal suggestions. The effectiveness of brief relaxation interventions on stress responses should be investigated further in future research by incorporating interventions that are tailored to the specific stress challenge and various types of verbal suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2964515312,"To evaluate the risk of developing optic neuropathy (ON) in patient with both non-surgery and surgery-indicated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) via the national health insurance research database in Taiwan.44,176 Patients with a diagnostic code of CRS was selected, which included 6,678 received functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) regarded as the surgery-indicated CRS. Each individual in the study group was matched to two non-CRS patients by age and gender. The outcome was set as the occurrence of ON according to the diagnostic codes occurred after the index date. Poisson regression was used to calculate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) and conditional Cox proportional model was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR). There were 131 and 144 events of ON occurred in the study group and the control group respectively during the follow-up period. The whole study group, whether received FESS or not, demonstrated both significant aRR and aHR compared to the control group after adjusting demographic data, prominent ocular diseases, and systemic co-morbidities. In addition, both the aRR and aHR were higher in CRS patient received FESS than those with CRS but without FESS management.The existence of CRS, especially the surgery-indicated CRS is a significant risk factor for the following ON using multivariable analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2965123643,"Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are constructed from Gene Expression Matrices (GEMs) in a bottom up approach where all gene pairs are tested for correlation within the context of the input sample set. This approach is computationally intensive for many current GEMs and may not be scalable to millions of samples. Further, traditional GCNs do not detect non-linear relationships missed by correlation tests and do not place genetic relationships in a gene expression intensity context. In this report, we propose EdgeScaping, which constructs and analyzes the pairwise gene intensity network in a holistic, top down approach where no edges are filtered. EdgeScaping uses a novel technique to convert traditional pairwise gene expression data to an image based format. This conversion not only performs feature compression, making our algorithm highly scalable, but it also allows for exploring non-linear relationships between genes by leveraging deep learning image analysis algorithms. Using the learned embedded feature space we implement a fast, efficient algorithm to cluster the entire space of gene expression relationships while retaining gene expression intensity. Since EdgeScaping does not eliminate conventionally noisy edges, it extends the identification of co-expression relationships beyond classically correlated edges to facilitate the discovery of novel or unusual expression patterns within the network. We applied EdgeScaping to a human tumor GEM to identify sets of genes that exhibit conventional and non-conventional interdependent non-linear behavior associated with brain specific tumor sub-types that would be eliminated in conventional bottom-up construction of GCNs. Edgescaping source code is available at https://github.com/bhusain/EdgeScaping under the MIT license."
https://openalex.org/W2965952814,"It is estimated that approximately 24% of the US population has at least one tattoo. However, tattoo ink ingredients include heavy metals (high atomic number Z) that are not regulated, which can cause skin reactions. This study investigates the dosimetric effects in surface dose due to high-Z elements in tattoo ink under electron beam irradiation. Four commercially available tattoo ink colors, black, red, yellow, and blue were chosen. The elemental composition of the tattoo ink samples was analyzed using X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). An ultrathin-window parallel plate ion chamber was used to measure the surface dose perturbation (ratio of ionizations with and without tattoo ink) for 6 - 20 MeV electron beams. The elemental concentration in the tattoo ink samples showed high-Z elements, with Z ranging from 11 to 92. The dose perturbation ranged from 1.4% up to 6% for the yellow ink for the 6 MeV electron beam, with similar values across the rest of the electron energies, whereas the black, red, and blue inks presented up to 3% dose perturbation for the same range of energies. Based on this initial study, we conclude that commercially available tattoo inks contain large amounts of high-Z metals that may contribute to dose perturbation. Therefore treatment of superficial lesions with electron beams in a tattooed area should be monitored for signs of early skin reaction during radiation therapy treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2966513425,"Glaesserella parasuis is the cause of Glӓsser's disease in pigs and is a significant contributor to post-weaning mortality in the swine industry. Prevention of G. parasuis disease relies primarily on bacterin vaccines, which have shown good homologous protection and variable heterologous protection. Bacterin production involves large scale growth of the bacteria and proteins produced during the proliferation phase of production become important antigens that stimulate the immune response. In order to evaluate genes activated during G. parasuis growth on different media substrates, the transcriptome of broth and agar grown G. parasuis strain 29755 were sequenced and compared. The transcription of most purported virulence genes were comparable between broth and agar grown G. parasuis; however, four virulence-associated genes, including ompA and vapD, had elevated expression under agar growth, while six virulence-associate genes had elevated expression during broth growth, including several protease genes. Additionally, there were metabolic shifts toward increased protein and lipid production and increased cellular division in broth grown G. parasuis. The results contribute to the understanding of how growth substrate alters gene transcription and protein expression, which may impact vaccine efficacy if immunogens important to the protective immune response are not produced under specific in vitro conditions. While the results of this work are unable to fully elucidate which growth medium presents a transcriptome more representative of in vivo samples or best suited for bacterin production, it forms a foundation that can be used for future comparisons and provides a better understanding of the metabolic differences in broth and agar grown bacteria."
