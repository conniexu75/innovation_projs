https://openalex.org/W2025624295,The enzymatic conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine had previously been shown to require a nonprotein cofactor. It has now been demonstrated by direct assay that the cofactor is present in phenylketonuric liver samples. The lack of a functional phenylalanine hydroxylating system in phenylketonuria is not due to the absence of the cofactor.

However, little attention has been paid to the biochemical changes which precede or accompany the anatomical changes. In the present paper, the author uses the biochemistry of vision as the point of departure for considering the parallel changes in biochemistry, anatomy, and ecology which are involved in vertebrate metamorphosis."

We have made preliminary observations on the distribution of antibodies in various mouse colonies and on the excretion of virus."

All species of a phylogenetic line of Saccharomyces are sexually agglutinative. Unisexuals of the latter species are believed to have from one to four sets of chromosomes, whereas bisexuals are believed to have from two to eight sets."

https://openalex.org/W2052986943,"As the great majority of phytopathogenic bacteria are extracellular parasites occupying chiefly the vessels and the intercellular spaces, and causing vascular diseases, soft-rots, spot diseases, etc., the ability to decompose the surrounding walls composed of pectin and cellulose is supposed to be an important factor controlling the destruction and/or enlargement of the tissues attacked. Although Husain and Kel-man1 reported the presence of cellulase in diseased tomato tissues infected by Pseudomonas solanacearum, our knowledge of the cellulolytic enzymes is poor in comparison with that in the field of pectolytic enzyme studies of plant pathogens."

The influence of these findings on the evaluation of the Sr(90) fallout hazard is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2064462605,"MYRBACK1,2 found that if baker's yeast was treated with ethyl acetate for 20 hr. at room, temperature and then thoroughly washed with water on the centrifuge a large proportion of its invertase activity remained in the insoluble fraction even when this was stored for several months at room temperature. It has long been known3 that only a small fraction of the total invertase can be removed from yeast cells by simple extraction procedures, some form of autolysis being needed to liberate the remainder. Myrback suggested that treatment with ethyl acetate removes from the cell the enzymes responsible for the autolytic release of the invertase, which therefore remains indefinitely in combination with insoluble cell structures."

The measurements were made in a lowbackground laboratory using a crystal detector coupled to a photomultiplier tube. The measurements were repeated over a four-month period. Data are tabulated. An attempt is made to correlate the findings with the milk consumption of the subjects, the location of the dairies supplying the milk, and the passage of the atomic cloud over Britain. (C.H.)"

Similar trends were shown in the rodent Reithrodontomys. The depression of metabolism of some tissues that was observed in these very small mammals may aid them in conserving energy during periods of inactivity."

https://openalex.org/W1564538966,"Layne and Marrian1 recently reported the isolation of 16β-hydroxyœstrone from the urine of pregnant women, and Brown, Fishman and Gallagher2 detected the same compound by reverse isotope dilution in the urine of a human subject after the administration of œstradiol-17β-1614-C. In the course of our own studies on the metabolism of œstrogens in vitro, 16β-hydroxyœstrone has been found after incubation of 16-oxoœstrone with normal human liver slices. In addition, five other phenolic steroids have been identified as metabolites of 16-oxoœstrone."

https://openalex.org/W1991961427,"IT is well known that dietary deficiencies can be seriously aggravated by the induction of a hyperthyroid state. Recently it has been shown1–3 that selenium significantly prolongs the survival-time of rats and prevents the onset of the liver necrosis which follows the ingestion of a diet containing yeast as the only source of protein. This protective effect of selenium resembles that shown by a number of apparently unrelated substances such as methionine, cystin, vitamin E, methylene blue and methylthiouracil, the mode of action of which is not understood. Unpublished observations, made in the course of a systematic investigation into the effects of various hormonal and nutritional stimuli on the course of liver necrosis, had suggested that it might be possible to distinguish between a true protective effect and a ‘non-specific’, indirect effect of the substances tested by the induction of a hyperthyroid state. Methyl -thiouracil, for example, which protects the euthyroid weanling rat against the onset of liver necrosis, was ineffective in litter-mates made hyperthyroid by the simultaneous addition of thyroid powder to the diet. A somewhat similar effect was seen if methylene blue was given, in contrast to the persistence of the protective effect obtained if vitamin E was used. In the light of these considerations it was thought of interest to see how the induction of a hyperthyroid state would affect the protective effect of selenium in dietary liver necrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2021050386,"CUCUMBER mosaic virus causes many important plant diseases and occurs as a group of strains differing in their host-range, symptoms produced, transmissibility and other properties. Few studies have been reported on the serological relationships among these strains, possibly because of their labile nature in vitro and their low concentration in the host plant. In crude host extracts the virus becomes non-infectious when stored for a few days or when diluted to approximately 10−3. The strain relationships have been studied previously by cross-protection tests. Although antisera to cucumber mosaic virus1,2 have been claimed, later attempts3 were unsuccessful. Antisera of low titre have been obtained to tomato aspermy4,5, a virus related to cucumber mosaic virus."

https://openalex.org/W1992508419,"SZENT-GYORGYI1 has demonstrated the importance of the ‘intracellular ionic atmosphere’ on the contraction of the cardiac muscle, and has suggested that adreno-cortical steroids may influence cellular activity by alterations in membrane permeability. It has also been shown by Selye and Renaud2 that the action of electrolytes on the heart is influenced by what is termed the ‘conditioning’ effect of hormones. Further, Holland3 has presented evidence to show that antiarrhythmic drugs act on the atria by depressing the transmembrane flux of sodium and potassium ions. In this connexion, it would be of interest to examine the effect of the steroid hormones on the action of the ions on the heart. It is well known that when the heart is kept in a medium containing sodium as the only ion it stops beating after some time. Later, when the medium is changed to Ringer solution, the beat recommences, presumably due to sodium extrusion. If a steroid hormone altered the permeability of the cell membrane, it would modify the action of sodium by interfering with sodium traffic across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2032333914,"CONVERSION of bacteria into L-forms involves changes in physiology as well as morphology. Comparing sensitivity to drugs of L-forms and bacteria, we are struck by the much higher resistance of the former to penicillin. Strains of L-forms of Proteus used in our laboratory are able to grow in the presence of 60,000 units penicillin/ml. On the other hand, they are more sensitive to streptomycin, chlortetracycline and chloramphenicol than are the bacterial forms. Tulasne and Minck1 found that stable L-forms of P. morganii were 8,000 times and unstable L-forms of P. vulgaris were 25,000 times more sensitive than the corresponding bacterial forms. Lederberg and St. Clair2 showed a fifty-fold decrease in resistance to streptomycin after converting Escherichia coli to the L-form. The authors suggest that “this can be viewed as the negation of the SR effect when the wall is stripped or a mutual reinforcement of penicillin and streptomycin in respect to another target”. They were inclined to accept the former interpretation. Horoszewicz and Horoszewicz3 noted the inhibitory action of streptomycin on the conversion of P. mirabilis to the L-form. In the presence of the antibiotic it was necessary to inoculate 1,800 times more bacteria to obtain the same number of L-colonies."
