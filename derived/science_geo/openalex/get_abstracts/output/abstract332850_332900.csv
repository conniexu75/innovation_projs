https://openalex.org/W2080088434,"Ophiopholis aculeata, a suspension feeding brittle star, is capable of removing artificial particles from seawater by some mechanism or mechanisms other than sieving; the animal can capture a finite proportion of particles in all size classes available from at least 30 to 360 micrometers in diameter. A marked shift in the size distribution of particles caught by the animal toward larger particle sizes agrees with predictions derived from aerosol filtration theory. Adhesion of particles to the tube feet is strongly dependent on the presence of fixed charged groups on the surface of the particles."
https://openalex.org/W2063936199,"Potamogeton nodosus tubers produce floating-type instead of submersed-type leaves when exposed to 10(-5) molar synthetic abscisic acid. Abscisic acid-induced leaves have stomata on upper leaf surfaces and higher width/length ratios than controls. These effects are wholly or partially overcome by simultaneous exposure to abscisic acid combined with gibberellic acid, kinetin, or benzyladenine."

These studies have been pursued in my laboratory at Cambridge and in that of Albert Eschenmoser at Zurich. They have been prosecuted on a very broad front, and in the limited time available here it will be possible to describe only a small portion. of the work. I have chosen to present those results which seem to us at present most surely destined to constitute established stages in the achievement of the specific objective of synthesizing vitamin B,2. To make this choice is not to derogate the interest and fascination of other portions of the investigation. Indeed, before embarking on today's story, I permit myself a parenthesis. The history of organic chemistry provides in abundance instances of the major role played by the study of natural products in revealing, extending, and shaping the fundamental bases of the science. Time and again the penetration of a new sector of the vast, often surprising and always beautiful panorama of natural products has led to new insights which could hardly have been achieved by more self-conscious fundamental investigations. This role of natural product studies is in no way diminished in our day, and it will certainly continue in the future; the proposition cannot be better illustrated than by my alluding to the fact that the principle of orbital symmetry conservation arose directly from our studies on vitamin B12 synthesis. But that story has been outlined in another place', and I shall have nothing further to say about it today. Let us commence by scrutinizing the structure of the vitamin B12 molecule (I). That intricate and fascinating array, revealed to us by the beautiful x-ray crystallographic studies of Dorothy Hodgkin, exhibits certain resemblances to other natural substances. Thus, like the blood pigment, haem, and the leaf pigment, chlorophyll, it contains a metal atom embedded within a macrocyclic nucleus containing four five-membered heterocyclic ringsâ€” A, B, C and D. But while in the blood and leaf pigments these five-membered rings are held together by single-carbon bridges, in the case of vitamin B12 two of them, rings A and D, are directly linked. Above all, the most striking contrast between vitamin B12 and its more simply constituted relatives, haem and chlorophyll, lies in the realm of stereochemistry. The porphyrin nucleus of the haem molecule is constituted entirely of trigonal carbon atoms and presents no points of stereochemical interest; the dihydroporphyrin, or chlorin, nucleus of chlorophyll presents only the relatively trivial stereochemical problem associated with the presence of two unsymmetrically substituted tetrahedral carbon atoms. In striking contrast, the periphery"

This isotope fractionation is related to observed mineralogic variations and compared with a theoretical heat-flow model.

Performance results now show that novice dictators can learn in a few hours to dictate with the speed and quality with which they write. However, they do not think they perform this well. Dictators with years of experience are from 0 to 25 percent faster than novices, depending upon the complexity of the letters. Planning time is about two-thirds of composition time, regardless of the method of composition."

https://openalex.org/W2090913649,"The Molokai Fracture Zone is one of the principal east-west (striking) fracture zones between California and the mid-Pacific. On the basis of bathymetry alone, it has been assumed that the zone ended abruptly east of the Hawaiian Islands. Use of correlation techniques between bathymetric features and their magnetic anomalies in the vicinity of the islands now show that structural elements of the zone cross the islands and continue westward for at least 130 kilometers. Recent volcanism and deep rift zones of the islands parallel the zone, suggesting structural correlation between the strike of the zone and the origin of recent volcanism in the islands."

https://openalex.org/W2063476695,"Organic compounds extracted from Michigan lakes and streams and added to algal cultures increase the growth rate of the green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardi) when iron is present. Two-dimensional paper chromatography has shown that the iron is complexed by organic fractions containing an amine group. When isolated from natural waters containing a concentration of over 0.3 part per million alkyl benzene sulfonate, these compounds do not show an iron-binding capacity. Separation of this sulfonate from the amine complexes restores the iron-binding capability. These findings suggest that detergents may influence the mobility of iron by reducing the number of binding sites, and in this way may have an important secondary effect upon the primary production of lakes and streams."
