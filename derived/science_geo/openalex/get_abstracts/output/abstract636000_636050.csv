https://openalex.org/W2961140339,"One-carbon metabolism plays a central role in a broad array of metabolic processes required for the survival and growth of tumor cells. However, the molecular basis of how one-carbon metabolism may influence RNA methylation and tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here we show MTHFD2, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in one-carbon metabolism, contributes to the progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) via a novel epitranscriptomic mechanism that involves HIF-2α. We found that expression of MTHFD2 was significantly elevated in human RCC tissues, and MTHFD2 knockdown strongly reduced xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, using an unbiased methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-Seq) approach, we found that MTHFD2 plays a critical role in controlling global N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation levels, including the m6A methylation of HIF-2α mRNA, which results in enhanced translation of HIF-2α. Enhanced HIF-2α translation, in turn, promotes the aerobic glycolysis, linking one-carbon metabolism to HIF-2α-dependent metabolic reprogramming through RNA methylation. Our findings also suggest that MTHFD2 and HIF-2α form a positive feedforward loop in RCC, promoting metabolic reprograming and tumor growth. Taken together, our results suggest that MTHFD2 links RNA methylation status to the metabolic state of tumor cells in RCC."

However, this collective action is precluded by the 'consensus gap' between scientific knowledge and public opinion. Here, we test the extent to which the iconic cities around the world are likely to shift in response to climate change. By analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we test if their climate in 2050 will resemble more closely to their own current climate conditions or to the current conditions of other cities in different bioclimatic regions. Even under an optimistic climate scenario (RCP 4.5), we found that 77% of future cities are very likely to experience a climate that is closer to that of another existing city than to its own current climate. In addition, 22% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. As a general trend, we found that all the cities tend to shift towards the sub-tropics, with cities from the Northern hemisphere shifting to warmer conditions, on average ~1000 km south (velocity ~20 km.year-1), and cities from the tropics shifting to drier conditions. We notably predict that Madrid's climate in 2050 will resemble Marrakech's climate today, Stockholm will resemble Budapest, London to Barcelona, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Tokyo to Changsha. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. The global assessment of city analogues can facilitate the understanding of climate change at a global level but also help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, which can facilitate effective decision-making in response to on-going climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2962012187,"Mutation in the GRN gene, encoding the progranulin (PGRN) protein, shows a dose-dependent disease correlation, wherein haploinsufficiency results in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and complete loss results in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Although the exact function of PGRN is unknown, it has been increasingly implicated in lysosomal physiology. Here we report that PGRN interacts with the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and is essential for proper GCase activity. GCase activity is significantly reduced in tissue lysates from PGRN-deficient mice. This is further evidence that reduced lysosomal hydrolase activity may be a pathological mechanism in cases of GRN-related FTLD and NCL."
https://openalex.org/W2960833836,"Current anti-angiogenic therapy for cancer is based mainly on inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. However, due to the transient and only modest benefit from such therapy, additional approaches are needed. Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been demonstrated to be involved in tumor angiogenesis and offers opportunities for a new therapeutic approach. However, effective miRNA-delivery systems are needed for such approaches to be successful. In this study, miRNA profiling of patient data sets, along with in vitro and in vivo experiments, revealed that miR-204-5p could promote angiogenesis in ovarian tumors through THBS1. By binding with scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SCARB1), reconstituted high-density lipoprotein–nanoparticles (rHDL–NPs) were effective in delivering miR-204-5p inhibitor (miR-204-5p-inh) to tumor sites to suppress tumor growth. These results offer a new understanding of miR-204-5p in regulating tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2959489473,"Background It is unclear whether sites that screen large numbers of patients for Hepatitis C Virus but achieve limited follow-up are more or less effective at having patients succeed through linkage and treatment than lower volume sites that have higher linkage percentages. The objective was to compare the rates of HCV identification, linkage to care, and treatment success between different study sites including the Emergency Department, 3 outpatient clinics with unique patients, and the inpatient setting at one medical center Methods This is a descriptive analysis of 2 years of data from a protocol that integrated HCV screening and treatment into clinical services throughout multiple departments in one medical center. The program used a best practice advisory to prompt testing at all sites, with different triggers for it to fire at each site, and one central navigation program that attempted to link all patients diagnosed with hepatitis C virus to outpatient care. Outcomes included volume of tests performed in each site, Antibody and RNA rates at each site, demographic data, navigation and linkage outcomes, and post-linkage treatment completion. Results 28,435 patients were screened across 5 clinical locations. RNA+ rates and absolute numbers linked to MD (linkage rates among all RNA+) were: ED 7.2% RNA+, 224 (22.6%) linked; Inpatient 14.8% RNA+, 27 (17.6%) linked, General Internal Medicine 3.9% RNA+, 269 (65.8%) linked, Infectious Diseases 4.0% RNA+, 34(70.8%) linked, Family Medicine 2.0% RNA+, 28 (75.7%) linked. Demographics, linkage barriers, and treatment initiation rates were different at all sites. Conclusion Among sites there were differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with HCV, as well as differences in the success linking patients to outpatient care. At this medical center, the ED screened the most patients, the inpatient area had the highest RNA positivity rate, the FM clinic had the highest linkage rate, GIM linked the most patients by absolute number, and GIM also had the highest number of patients start treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2961061032,"The topics of climate change and renewable energy are often linked in policy discussions and scientific analysis, but public opinion on these topics exhibits both overlap and divergence. Although renewable energy has potentially broader acceptance than anthropogenic climate change, it can also face differently-based opposition. Analyses of US and regional surveys, including time series of repeated surveys in New Hampshire (2010-2018) and northeast Oregon (2011-2018), explore the social bases and trends of public views on both issues. Political divisions are prominent, although somewhat greater regarding climate change due to substantive differences and more partisan opposition. Regarding climate change and to a lesser extent renewable energy, political divisions tends to widen with education. There also are robust age and temporal effects: younger adults more often prioritize renewable energy development, and agree with scientists on the reality of anthropogenic climate change (ACC). Across all age groups and both regional series, support for renewable energy and recognition of ACC have been gradually rising. Contrary to widespread speculation, these trends have not visibly responded to events such as the US hurricanes of 2012, 2017 or 2018. Together with age-cohort replacement and the potential for changes in age-group voting participation, however, the gradual trends suggest that public pressure for action on these issues could grow."
https://openalex.org/W2957434613,"There are large amounts of waste activated sludge (WAS) and kitchen waste (KW) produced every year in China. It has been confirmed that anaerobic co-digestion is an effective method to solve this problem. The targets of the present study were optimizing the digestive performances and clearing of the mechanism of bentonite addition by adding bentonite into digestive system. Group M (WAS: KW = 1:2, based on VS) presented higher cumulative methane yield (CMY), where the CMY increased from 19.8 to 36.3 mL/g VS with the bentonite dosage from 0 to 2 g/g VS. After bentonite addition, the lag phase of every digester presented an obvious decrease from 15.1 to 1.4 d. Furthermore, and the moderating effects on microbial community by bentonite. The addition of bentonite improved methane production, and it can also reduce the lag phase of methane production in co-digestion. What's more, bentonite addition increased the speed of pH recovery from 4.2–4.8 to normal level (7.0–8.0) and thus enhanced the system stability. The conclusion of this study can be used to guide practical engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2959485176,"Rural children are one of the populations that are most vulnerable to gastrointestinal parasite infections. Such diseases decrease the quality of life and result in growth and cognitive delays in the long term. This cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the frequency of intestinal parasite infections among rural schoolchildren in the municipality of Apulo, Colombia. A total of 97 stool samples from children aged between 5 and 15 years were collected and examined via direct light microscopy. Microscopic examination was repeated with sediments obtained using a fecal parasite concentrator, and the Kato–Katz test was performed. Frequency of intestinal parasite infection was 100%. Endolimax nana (77.35%), Blastocystis sp. (71.1%), Giardia intestinalis (39.1%), Entamoeba coli (25.7%), and the Entamoeba histolytica/dispar/moshkovskii complex (9.2%) were the most prevalent protozoa. Trichuris trichiura was the most prevalent helminth (12.3%), followed by Enterobius vermicularis (6.15%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (5.1%). Among the analyzed associated factors, consumption of untreated water increased the risk of acquiring pathogenic intestinal parasites. Finally, because G. intestinalis was the most prevalent pathogenic protozoan, molecular analysis was conducted to establish genetic assemblages and subassemblages of Giardia through sequence-based genotyping of the glutamate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, and beta-giardin genes. A total of 14 G. intestinalis-positive samples were genotyped, which revealed the presence of subassemblages AI (n = 1), AII (n = 7), BIII (n = 2), BIV (n = 2), and BIII/BIV (n = 1) as well as a mixed subassemblage AII + BIII (n = 1). Our results indicate that gastrointestinal parasite infections in the tested population were mainly caused by suboptimal water quality. Moreover, molecular typing of G. intestinalis suggested contamination of water by animal- and human-derived cysts."
https://openalex.org/W2961780322,"This study examined profiles of participation in extracurricular activities (ECAs) in 4th grade children (N = 27,121; Mean age = 9.20 years; SD = .54; 51% male) in British Columbia, Canada. Latent class analyses were used to establish activity profiles and determine class membership; ANCOVA was used to investigate differences in mental wellbeing (optimism, life satisfaction, self-concept) and perceived overall health between groups. Data came from a cross-sectional, population-level child self-report survey (i.e., the Middle Years Development Instrument) implemented with 4th grade children in public schools. We found four distinct ECA profiles: participation in “All Activities”, “No activities”, “Sports” (i.e., individual and team sports), and “Individual activities” (i.e., educational programs, arts/music, individual sports). Wellbeing and health scores were highest for children in the “All Activities” and the “Sports” clusters, and lowest for those in “No Activities” and the cluster reflecting individual activities (i.e., “Individual activities”). Results are discussed in the context of previous research, and with respect to practical relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2961020211,"Despite the existence of many clinical and molecular factors reported that contribute to survival in glioblastoma, prevailing studies fell into partial or local feature selection for survival analysis. We proposed a feature selection strategy including not only joint covariate detection but also its evaluations, and performed it on miRNA expression profiles with glioblastoma. MiR-10b and miR-222 were selected as the most significant two-dimensional feature. Crucially, we integrated in vitro experiments on GBM cells and in vivo studies on a mouse model of human glioma to elucidate the synergistic effects between miR-10b and miR-222. Inhibition of miR-10b and miR-222 strongly suppress GBM cells growth, invasion, and induce apoptosis by co-targeting PTEN and leading to activation of p53 ultimately. We also demonstrated that miR-10b and miR-222 co-target BIM to induce apoptosis independent of p53 status. The results define mir-10b and mir-222 important roles in gliomagenesis and provided a reliable survival analysis strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2958058754,"This study assessed households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks in Dinki watershed, northcentral highlands of Ethiopia. The data were collected through a cross-sectional survey conducted on 288 households, three focus group discussions, and 15 key informant interviews. The Climate Resilience Index (CRI) based on the three resilience capacities (absorptive, adaptive and transformative) frame was used to measure households’ resilience to climate change-induced shocks on an agro-ecological unit of analysis. A principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis were used to identify determinant factors and indicators to households’ resilience, respectively. Findings indicate that the indexed scores of major components clearly differentiated the study communities in terms of their agro-ecological zones. Specifically, the absorptive capacity (0.495) was the leading contributing factor to resilience followed by adaptive (0.449) and transformative (0.387) capacities. Likewise, the Midland was relatively more resilient with a mean index value of 0.461. Both the PCA and multiple regression analysis indicated that access to and use of livelihood resources, such as farmlands and livestock holdings, diversity of income sources, infrastructure and social capital were determinants of households’ resilience. In general, it might be due to their exposure to recurrent shocks coupled with limited adaptive capacities including underdeveloped public services, poor livelihood diversification practices, among others, the study communities showed minimal resilience capacity with a mean score of 0.44. Thus, in addition to short-term buffering strategies, intervention priority focusing on both adaptive and transformative capacities, particularly focusing on most vulnerable localities and constrained livelihood strategies, would contribute to ensuring long-term resilience in the study communities."
https://openalex.org/W2961805597,"Objective To evaluate the psychometric properties of the HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in London, United Kingdom (UK). Methods This is a cross-sectional measurement study. We recruited and administered the self-reported HDQ, seven criterion measures, and a demographic questionnaire with adults living with HIV accessing HIV care. We determined median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for disability presence, severity and episodic scores (range 0–100). We calculated Cronbach’s alpha (α) Kuder-Richardson-20 (KR-20) statistics for disability and episodic scores respectively (internal consistency reliability), smallest detectable change (SDC) for each HDQ severity item and domain (precision), and tested 36 a priori hypotheses assessing correlations between HDQ and criterion scores (construct validity). Results Of N = 243 participants, all were male, median age 40 years, 94% currently taking antiretroviral therapy, and 22% living with ≥2 concurrent health conditions. Median HDQ domain scores ranged from 0 (IQR: 0,7) (difficulties with day-to-day activities domain) to 27 (IQR: 14, 41) (uncertainty domain). Cronbach’s alpha for the HDQ severity scale ranged from 0.85 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.80–0.90) in the cognitive domain to 0.93 (95%CI: 0.91–0.94) in the mental-emotional domain. The KR-20 statistic for the HDQ episodic scale ranged from 0.74 (95%CI: 0.66–0.83) in the cognitive domain to 0.91 (95%CI: 0.89–0.94) in the uncertainty domain. SDC ranged from 7.3–15.0 points on the HDQ severity scale for difficulties with day-to-day activities and cognitive symptoms domains, respectively. The majority of the construct validity hypotheses (n = 30/36, 83%) were confirmed. Conclusions The HDQ possesses internal consistency reliability and construct validity with varied precision when administered to males living with HIV in London, UK. Clinicians and researchers may use the HDQ to measure the nature and extent of disability experienced by PLHIV in the UK, and to inform HIV service provision to address the health-related challenges among PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W2962151349,"Social learning has important ecological and evolutionary consequences but the role of certain factors, such as social rank, neophobia (i.e., avoidance of novel stimuli), persistence, and task-reward association, remain less understood. We examined the role of these factors in social learning by captive coyotes (Canis latrans) via three studies. Study 1 involved individual animals and eliminated object neophobia by familiarizing the subjects to the testing apparatus prior to testing. Studies 2 and 3 used mated pairs to assess social rank, and included object neophobia, but differed in that study 3 decoupled the food reward from the testing apparatus (i.e., altered task-reward association). For all three studies, we compared performance between coyotes that received a demonstration from a conspecific to control animals with no demonstration prior to testing. Coyotes displayed social learning during study 1; coyotes with a demonstrator were faster and more successful at solving the puzzle box but did not necessarily use the same modality as that observed to be successful. In study 2, there was no difference in success between treatment groups but this is likely because only one coyote within each pair was successful so successful coyote results were masked by their unsuccessful mate. In study 3, there was no difference in success between treatment groups; only two coyotes, both dominant, hand-reared males with demonstrators were able to perform the task. However, coyotes with a demonstrator were less neophobic, measured as latency to approach the object, and more persistent, measured as time spent working on the apparatus. Social rank was the best predictor of neophobia and persistence and was also retained in the best model for time to eat inside the apparatus, a post-trial measurement of object neophobia. These results suggest coyotes are capable of social learning for novel tasks but social rank, neophobia, and persistence influence their social-learning capabilities. This study contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying how animals gain information about their environment."
https://openalex.org/W2959739852,"The involvement of transactivation response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in neurodegenerative diseases was revealed in 2006, when it was first reported to be the main component of the intracellular inclusions in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. After 12 yr it is not yet possible to purify to a reasonable yield and in a reproducible manner a stable full-length protein, which has limited so far the characterization of its structure, function, molecular interactors, and pathobiology. Using a novel protocol we have achieved the purification of the full-length TDP-43, with both a short pectate lyase B tag and a glutathione S-transferase tag, which consisted in its expression in bacteria, solubilization from inclusion bodies, purification under denaturing conditions, refolding, and a final size exclusion chromatography (SEC) step. Differential scanning fluorimetry was used to find the best buffers and combination of additives to increase both its solubility and its stability. The protein is pure, as determined with electrophoresis, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry; properly refolded, as revealed by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies; functional, because it binds to DNA and protein partners; and stable to degradation and aggregation in a physiologic solution. Analyses with dynamic light scattering and SEC revealed that the protein is a dimer.—Vivoli Vega, M., Nigro, A., Luti, S., Capitini, C., Fani, G., Gonnelli, L., Boscaro, F., Chiti, F.

We thus tested the hypothesis whether the phosphorylation of fibronectin, a major adhesion protein, affects cell behavior. Controlled in vitro phosphorylation of fibronectin by a casein kinase II (CKII) significantly upregulated cell traction forces and total strain energy generated by fibroblasts on nanopillar arrays, and consequently other elementary cell functions including cell spreading and metabolic activity. Mass spectrometry of plasma fibronectin from healthy human donors then identified a constitutively phosphorylated site in the C-terminus, and numerous other residues that became phosphorylated by the CKII kinase in vitro. Our findings open up novel strategies for translational applications including targeting diseased ECM, or to develop assays that probe the phosphorylation state of the ECM or blood as potential cancer markers."
https://openalex.org/W2957748244,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, liver transplant, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. While liver biopsy remains the reference standard for disease diagnosis, analytical and clinical development of non-invasive soluble biomarkers of NASH are of great importance to advance the field. To this end, we performed analytical and clinical validation on a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines implicated hepatic inflammation; IL-6, CRP, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1β, eotaxin, VCAM-1. Biomarker assays were validated for accuracy and precision. Clinical performance was evaluated in a random sample of 52 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD/NASH. Patients were categorized into three groups according to their fibrosis stage; advanced (F3-F4), mild (F1-2) and no (F0) fibrosis. Serum IL-6 was increased in patients with advanced fibrosis (2.71 pg/mL; 1.26 pg/mL; 1.39 pg/mL p<0.01) compared to patients with mild or no fibrosis respectively. While, there was no significant difference noted in CRP, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1β, eotaxin among the three groups, VCAM-1 levels were increased by 55% (p<0.01) and 40% (p<0.05) in the advanced cohort compared to the mild and no fibrosis groups respectively. VCAM-1 also displayed good clinical performance as a biomarker of advanced fibrosis with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.87. The VCAM-1 assay demonstrated robust accuracy and precision, and VCAM-1 outperformed IL-6, CRP, TNFα, and the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1β, and eotaxin as a biomarker of advanced fibrosis in NASH. Addition of biomarkers such as IL-6 and VCAM-1 to panels may yield increased sensitivity and specificity for staging of NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2956848907,"Certain perceptual measures have been proposed as indirect assays of brain neurochemical status in people with migraine. One such measure is binocular rivalry, however, previous studies have not measured rivalry characteristics and brain neurochemistry together in people with migraine. This study compared spectroscopy-measured levels of GABA and Glx (glutamine and glutamate complex) in visual cortex between 16 people with migraine and 16 non-headache controls, and assessed whether the concentration of these neurochemicals explains, at least partially, inter-individual variability in binocular rivalry perceptual measures. Mean Glx level was significantly reduced in migraineurs relative to controls, whereas mean occipital GABA levels were similar between groups. Neither GABA levels, nor Glx levels correlated with rivalry percept duration. Our results thus suggest that the previously suggested relationship between rivalry percept duration and GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmitter concentration in visual cortex is not strong enough to enable rivalry percept duration to be reliably assumed to be a surrogate for GABA concentration, at least in the context of healthy individuals and those that experience migraine."

Unlike most previous studies taking a hypothesis-testing approach, we employed a data mining approach to uncover unknown sound-symbolic correspondences in the domain of locomotion, without limiting ourselves to pre-determined sound-meaning correspondences. In the experiment, we presented 70 locomotion videos to Japanese and English speakers and asked them to create a sound symbolically matching word for each action. Participants also rated each action on five meaning variables. Multivariate analyses revealed cross-linguistically shared and language-specific sound-meaning correspondences within a single semantic domain. The present research also established that a substantial number of sound-symbolic links emerge from conventionalized form-meaning mappings in the native languages of the speakers."

The aims of this study are to describe the epidemiological characteristics of a cohort of Chagas infected pregnant women in Spain, to assess the vertical transmission (VT) rate and evaluate the usefulness of the PCR in the diagnosis of congenital infection in the first months of life.A descriptive, retrospective study including Chagas seropositive pregnant women who were attended at three tertiary hospitals in Madrid, from January 2012 to September 2016. Infants were examined by PCR at birth and 1 month later and serologically studied at 9 months or later. Children were considered infected when the parasite was detected by PCR at any age or when serology remained positive without decline over the age of 9 months.We included 122 seropositive-infected pregnant women, 81% were from Bolivia and only 8.2% had been treated before. 125 newborns were studied and finally 109 were included (12.8% lost the follow-up before performing the last serology). The VT rate was 2.75% (95% CI: 0,57-8,8%). Infected infants had positive PCR at birth and 1 month later. All of them were treated successfully with benznidazole (PCR and serology became negative later on). All non-infected children presented negative PCR. The mean age at which uninfected patients had negative serology was 10.5 months.The VT rate is in keeping with literature and confirms the need to carry out a screening in pregnant women coming from endemic areas. PCR seems to be a useful tool to provide early diagnosis of congenital CD."

Although divergent transport mechanisms have been proposed for these transporters, previous structural and functional analyses of members of the MATE subfamily DinF suggest that the N-terminal domain (NTD) supports substrate and ion binding. In this report, we investigated the relationship of ligand binding within the NTD to the drug resistance mechanism of the H+-dependent MATE from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfMATE). To facilitate this study, we developed a cell growth assay in Escherichia coli to characterize the resistance conferred by PfMATE to toxic concentrations of the antimicrobial compound rhodamine 6G. Expression of WT PfMATE promoted cell growth in the presence of drug, but amino acid substitutions of conserved NTD residues compromised drug resistance. Steady-state binding analysis with purified PfMATE indicated that substrate affinity was unperturbed in these NTD variants. However, exploiting Trp fluorescence as an intrinsic reporter of conformational changes, we found that these variants impaired formation of a unique H+-stabilized structural intermediate. These results imply that disruption of H+ coupling is the origin of compromised toxin resistance in PfMATE variants.

Tetraphenylphosphonium, ethidium, and rhodamine 6G (R6G) were found to bind a negatively charged central cavity formed by acidic and polar residues from the NTD and CTD near the membrane–water interface in the Na+-coupled transporter NorM from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (20Lu M.

In contrast, R6G was found buried within the hydrophobic TM core of H+-coupled DinF from Bacillus halodurans (DinF-BH), in which the majority of contacts are made with NTD residues, including a conserved Asp in TM1 that mediates the only charge–charge interaction with the substrate (19Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y. Structural insights into H+-coupled multidrug extrusion by a MATE transporter.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24141706): 1310-131710.1038/nsmb.2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Disruption of this interaction by substitution (D40N) or protonation of the Asp impaired R6G binding, suggesting an overlapping H+/R6G binding site. Consequently, H+ binding was implicated in drug release by directly competing with the substrate binding site (19Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y. Structural insights into H+-coupled multidrug extrusion by a MATE transporter.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24141706): 1310-131710.1038/nsmb.2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Despite these fundamental differences between subfamilies, mechanistic diversity within the DinF subfamily has been the subject of controversy. Crystallographic analyses of DinF from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfMATE) not only identified a distinct drug (norfloxacin)–binding site deep within the NTD but also a “bent” conformation of TM1 associated with rearrangement of a hydrogen bond network putatively induced by protonation of the conserved Asp-41 (24Tanaka Y. Hipolito C.J. Maturana A.D. Ito K. Kuroda T. Higuchi T. Katoh T. Kato H.E. Hattori M. Kumazaki K. Tsukazaki T. Ishitani R. Suga H. Nureki O.

A similar conformation of TM1 has yet to be observed in DinF-BH. Thus, in combination with complementary functional analysis, the structures of PfMATE supported a transport model distinct from DinF-BH, invoking a critical role of the NTD in facilitating H+-dependent conformational changes in TM1 that collapse the norfloxacin binding cavity. Similar structural changes have been described recently for another bacterial MATE, arguing that the bent conformation of TM1 is a conserved obligatory intermediate in the transport cycle (18Kusakizako T. Claxton D.P. Tanaka Y. Maturana A.D. Kuroda T. Ishitani R. Mchaourab H.S. Nureki O. Structural basis of H+-dependent conformational change in a bacterial MATE transporter.Structure. 2019; 27 (30449688): 293-301.e310.1016/j.str.2018.10.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we explore the function of conserved residues previously implicated in H+ and drug binding within the DinF subfamily to define mechanistic features of the NTD that support drug resistance in PfMATE. Our multifaceted approach incorporates a cell growth assay tailored to uncover PfMATE-mediated resistance to toxic concentrations of R6G in combination with steady-state drug binding and structural analysis. We show that, unlike DinF-BH, high-affinity binding of R6G to PfMATE does not require the charged side chain contributed by a strictly conserved TM1 Asp. However, R6G resistance is compromised by substitution of NTD residues that disrupt formation of an H+-stabilized structural intermediate. The results highlight a role of the NTD in mediating ion coupling to transport through allostery but support the notion of unique drug-binding sites and divergent transport mechanisms within the same subfamily of MATE transporters. Expression of PfMATE promotes cell growth in the presence of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic norfloxacin (24Tanaka Y. Hipolito C.J. Maturana A.D. Ito K. Kuroda T. Higuchi T. Katoh T. Kato H.E. Hattori M. Kumazaki K. Tsukazaki T. Ishitani R. Suga H. Nureki O.

To characterize PfMATE-mediated R6G resistance in vivo, we adapted a cell growth assay used previously to probe the survival of Escherichia coli expressing the Na+/H+-dependent homolog NorM from Vibrio cholerae (NorM-Vc) when subjected to toxic concentrations of doxorubicin (30Claxton D.P.

This assay was shown to discriminate between variants of NorM-Vc that support or compromise cell growth, facilitating the correlation of apparent drug resistance to ion/drug-dependent conformational dynamics associated with the transport mechanism (30Claxton D.P. Jagessar K.L. Steed P.R. Stein R.A. Mchaourab H.S. Sodium and proton coupling in the conformational cycle of a MATE antiporter from Vibrio cholerae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Similarly, expression of functional PfMATE is expected to increase cell survival in the presence of toxic substrates. The experimental paradigm is illustrated as a flow diagram in Fig. 1, and additional details are provided under “Experimental procedures.” Briefly, a small seed culture grown overnight from freshly transformed BL21 (DE3) cells was used to inoculate a larger volume of growth medium with a target absorbance at 600 nm (A600 nm) of 0.0375. The cells were allowed to grow for up to 2 h at 37 °C and were then diluted to A600 nm ∼0.25 and induced with IPTG. Following a 2-h incubation period for protein production, the cells were seeded into a 96-well plate containing growth medium and the substrate R6G. Cell growth was monitored by A650 nm, which was measured by a plate reader over a defined period of time. This wavelength (650 nm) was chosen to minimize the contribution of R6G to the overall absorbance at high (>30 μg/ml) R6G concentrations (Fig. S1). The plate format allowed screening of numerous conditions as a function of time, such as IPTG and drug concentrations. Importantly, cell growth in the absence of drug was incorporated as a control for cell health and viability over the course of the assay, as described below. Therefore, A650 nm in the absence of drug was used as a normalization factor to obtain relative A650 nm. Standardization of this assay for screening activity of PfMATE required careful consideration of key protein expression parameters. Cell growth after induction is strongly dependent on the IPTG concentration. In general, cells expressing PfMATE WT grew less than cells harboring vector alone (pET-19b) at all IPTG concentrations tested (Fig. 1A). This pattern of cell growth was inversely correlated with WT expression levels, as visualized by SDS-PAGE analysis, especially in the range of 10–50 μm IPTG, which induced robust expression (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, cells expressing the WT displayed reduced growth relative to the vector in the absence of drug over the course of the assay (Fig. S2A). These observations suggested that WT expression is metabolically challenging and/or toxic to the cell. We thus reasoned that high-level WT expression may reduce the cell capacity to proliferate under additional toxic stress and obfuscate PfMATE-mediated drug resistance. In support of this conclusion, we observed an increase in the growth of cells expressing the WT at elevated R6G concentrations (≥60 μg/ml) relative to vector alone upon induction with 1 μm IPTG (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2B). Enhanced cell survival was seen over the entire time course of the assay at 75 μg/ml R6G after normalizing to growth in the absence of drug (Fig. 1C). The ratio of A650 nm indicated that expression of the WT increased cell growth by 53% ± 9% on average (n = 6) relative to vector at the 10-h time point, where the normalized growth curve began to plateau. In contrast, cell growth was greatly impaired at the identical R6G concentration following induction with 10 μm IPTG (Fig. S3). In addition to IPTG concentration, potentiation of cell survival was contingent on a full complement of multidrug transporters. Previous applications of this assay with NorM-Vc utilized an E. coli strain devoid of seven endogenous multidrug transporters (BL21 (DE3)-Δ7: macAB, yojHI, acrAB, acrEF, emrAB, emrKY, and mdtEF) (30Claxton D.P. Jagessar K.L. Steed P.R. Stein R.A. Mchaourab H.S. Sodium and proton coupling in the conformational cycle of a MATE antiporter from Vibrio cholerae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, PfMATE-mediated resistance to R6G toxicity was not observed in this background or in the BL21 (DE3)-Δ3 strain (deletion of macAB, yojHI, and acrAB) relative to vector alone under similar expression conditions (Fig. S4). This result suggested that the elevated R6G resistance conferred by expression of WT PfMATE involved concerted activity of intrinsic transporters. Previous crystallographic, computational, and functional studies of PfMATE suggested a critical role of the NTD in binding of target substrates and coupling to the H+ gradient to drive transport (24Tanaka Y.

In conjunction with a highly conserved Pro (Pro-26 in PfMATE) in TM1, a hydrogen bond network composed of residues that line a cavity in the NTD was proposed to mediate a H+-dependent conformational change in TM1 that facilitates substrate extrusion. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these residues are highly conserved (34Ashkenazy H. Abadi S. Martz E. Chay O. Mayrose I. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf 2016: an improved methodology to estimate and visualize evolutionary conservation in macromolecules.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27166375): W344-W35010.1093/nar/gkw408Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 35Landau M.

Consistent with this result, substitution of these residues impaired resistance to norfloxacin and transport of ethidium (24Tanaka Y. Hipolito C.J. Maturana A.D. Ito K. Kuroda T. Higuchi T. Katoh T. Kato H.E. Hattori M. Kumazaki K. Tsukazaki T. Ishitani R. Suga H. Nureki O.

We tested a subset of these variants to ascertain the contribution of these residues to R6G resistance (Fig. 2A). Site-directed mutagenesis of NTD residues (P26A, Y37A, D41A/D41N, and D184A) significantly impaired cell growth relative to the WT in the presence of 75 μg/ml R6G and instead clustered with the vector control (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2, C and D). In contrast, substitution of a nearby nonconserved surface Glu in TM2 (E51A), designed as a control, demonstrated a similar pattern of growth as the WT. Capturing the pattern of PfMATE-mediated R6G resistance, a growth profile of the variants relative to the WT (Fig. 2C) indicated that substitution of functionally required residues reduced cell growth by ∼80% or more. Importantly, the apparent loss of functional activity could not be attributed to reduced expression levels of the variants (Fig. 2D and Fig. S6), and size exclusion chromatography analysis of the purified variants was consistent with folded transporters (Fig. S7). We explored the mechanistic basis of compromised R6G resistance by two approaches. First, we investigated the role of targeted residues in R6G binding. Formation of a complex between R6G and PfMATE purified in β-dodecyl maltoside (β-DDM) micelles was monitored by R6G fluorescence anisotropy. Binding of drug to PfMATE was associated with an increase in anisotropy, similar to the change in fluorescence polarization that was observed upon binding to DinF-BH (19Lu M. Radchenko M. Symersky J. Nie R. Guo Y. Structural insights into H+-coupled multidrug extrusion by a MATE transporter.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24141706): 1310-131710.1038/nsmb.2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Titration of R6G with increasing concentrations of PfMATE generated a binding isotherm that was fit with a single-site binding model to determine the KD (Fig. 3). The binding curve collected at pH 7.5 indicated that R6G was bound to WT PfMATE with high affinity. A subtle right shift in the curve was observed at pH 4, corresponding to a less than 2-fold increase in KD (Table 1). Notably, introduction of the NTD variants,"

Additionally, it presents a series of morphological and molecular characteristics that appear convergent with those seen in other fish species (e.g., Poeciliids) inhabiting sulfide springs. Most notably, J. sulfurica has an enlarged head and postorbital area compared to other fish of the genus and a prognathous lower jaw with a hypertrophied lip, thought to facilitate respiration at the air-water interface. Analyses of cox1 sequence showed that J. sulfurica has two unique mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions convergent to those seen in Poeciliids from sulfide springs and known to provide a physiological mechanism related to living in sulfide environments. A phylogenetic analysis, including molecular and morphological characters, placed J. sulfurica as sister taxa to J. alternimaculata, a species found in nearby, non-sulfide habitats directly connected to the sulfide springs. Thus, it can be inferred that the selection imposed by the presence of H2S has resulted in the divergence between these two species and has potentially served as a barrier to gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W2956800829,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2). Minimally invasive and accurate biomarkers of disease progression and treatment response could facilitate screening of therapeutic compounds in animal models, enrollment of better-defined participants into clinical trials, and treatment monitoring. In this study, we used a targeted approach based on analysis of brain-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs) circulating in plasma to identify miRNA biomarkers of RTT using Mecp2-mutant mice as a model system and human plasma samples. An ""miRNA pair"" approach, i.e. the ratio between two miRNAs, was used for data normalization. Specific miRNA pairs and their combinations (classifiers) analyzed in plasma differentiated wild-type from Mecp2 male and female mice with >90% accuracy. Individual miRNA pairs were more effective in distinguishing male (homozygous) animals than female (heterozygous) animals, suggesting that disease severity correlated with the levels of the miRNA biomarkers. In the human study, 30 RTT patients were compared with age-matched controls. The results of this study showed that miRNA classifiers were able to differentiate RTT patients from controls with 85-100% sensitivity. In addition, a comparison of various age groups demonstrated that the dynamics in levels of miRNAs appear to be associated with disease development (involvement of liver, muscle and lipid metabolism in the pathology). Importantly, certain miRNA biomarker pairs were common to both the animal models and human subjects, indicating the similarity between the underlying pathological processes. The data generated in this feasibility study suggest that circulating miRNAs have the potential to be developed as markers of RTT progression and treatment response. Larger clinical studies are needed to further evaluate the findings presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2960790255,"The overnight polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of patients were scored by an expert to diagnose sleep disorders. Visual sleep scoring is a time-consuming and subjective process. Automatic sleep staging methods can help; however, the mechanism and reliability of these methods are not fully understood. Therefore, experts often need to rescore the recordings to obtain reliable results. Here, we propose a human-computer collaborative sleep scoring system. It is a rule-based automatic sleep scoring method that follows the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines to perform an initial scoring. Then, the reliability level of each epoch is analyzed based on physiological patterns during sleep and the characteristics of various stage changes. Finally, experts would only need to rescore epochs with a low-reliability level. The experimental results show that the average agreement rate between our system and fully manual scorings can reach 90.42% with a kappa coefficient of 0.85. Over 50% of the manual scoring time can be reduced. Due to the demonstrated robustness and applicability, the proposed approach can be integrated with various PSG systems or automatic sleep scoring methods for sleep monitoring in clinical or homecare applications in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2960870116,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent professional antigen (Ag)-presenting cells and inducers of T cell-mediated immunity. A previous microarray analysis identified PDZ and LIM domain protein 4 (Pdlim4) as a candidate marker for DC maturation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Pdlim4 influences DC migration and maturation. Mouse bone marrow-derived DCs were transduced lentivirally with Pdlim4 short hairpin RNA and examined by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blotting. Pdlim4 was highly induced in LPS-stimulated mature DCs (mDCs). Pdlim4-knockdown mDCs showed reduced expression of molecules associated with Ag presentation and T-cell costimulation, reduced cytokine production, and functional defects in their ability to activate T cells. Moreover, Pdlim4 was necessary for mDC migration via C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7)-JNK in in vitro Transwell assays. The importance of Pdlim4 in DC migration was confirmed with an in vivo migration model in which C57BL/6 mice were injected with fluorescently labeled DCs in the footpad and migration to the popliteal lymph nodes was assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, dendrite formation in mDCs was remarkably attenuated under Pdlim4 knockdown. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Pdlim4 is necessary for DC migration via CCR7-JNK, dendrite formation, and subsequent development of functional T-cell responses.—Yoo, J.-Y., Jung, N.-C, Lee, J.-H., Choi, S.-Y., Choi, H.-J., Park, S.-Y., Jang, J.-S., Byun, S.-H., Hwang, S.-U., Noh, K.-E., Park, Y., Lee, J., Song, J.-Y., Seo, H.

Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in the pre-implementation phase of a quality improvement programme. One-stage cluster sampling technique was employed. Data were collected from caregivers of children aged 0–23 months in ten randomly selected PHC facilities in Nassarawa Local Government Area of Kano State. Semi-structured, interviewer administered questionnaires were used. Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize the data. Multilevel logistic regression model with fixed effect and random effect component was fitted to obtain measures of association and variation respectively. Results Caregivers of 675 children responded. Among these children, the prevalence of MOV (for at least one antigen) was 36.15%. MOV (for individual antigens) was highest for inactivated polio vaccine followed by measles vaccine. The random effect model yielded an intraclass correlation coefficient of 9.60% for the empty model. The fixed effect model revealed that MOV was more likely among children that were accompanying a caregiver to the health facility (OR = 2.86, 95%CrI: 1.28 to 5.80) compared to those that were visiting the health facility for medical consultation. Failure to receive vaccination on the day of health facility visit (OR = 2.32, 95%CrI: 1.12 to 4.12) and visiting a clinic with three or more vaccinators (OR = 12.91, 95%CrI: 4.82 to 27.14) increased the likelihood of MOV. Conclusion The study identified important local factors that are responsible for MOV which can be addressed in the QI programme."
https://openalex.org/W4205381026,"Metastatic breast cancer is an extremely complex disease with limited treatment options due to the lack of information about the major characteristics of metastatic disease. There is an urgent need, therefore, to understand the changes in cellular complexity and dynamics that occur during metastatic progression. In the current study, we analyzed the cellular and molecular differences between primary tumors and paired lung metastases using a syngeneic p53-null mammary tumor model of basal-like breast cancer. Distinct subpopulations driven by the Wnt- and/or STAT3 signaling pathways were detected in vivo using a lentiviral Wnt- and STAT3 signaling reporter system. A significant increase in the overlapping populations driven by both the Wnt- and STAT3 signaling pathways was observed in the lung metastases as compared to the primary tumors. Furthermore, the overlapping populations showed a higher metastatic potential relative to the other populations and pharmacological inhibition of both signaling pathways was shown to markedly reduce the metastatic lesions in established lung metastases. An analysis of the unique molecular features of the lung metastases revealed a significant association with immune response signatures. Specifically, Foxp3 gene expression was markedly increased and elevated levels of Foxp3 + Treg cells were detected in close proximity to lung metastases. Collectively, these studies illustrate the importance of analyzing intratumoral heterogeneity, changes in population dynamics, and the immune microenvironment during metastatic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2960363837,"Background Many studies have analysed the effect of browsing by large herbivores on tree species but far fewer studies have studied their effect on understorey shrubs and herbs. Moreover, while many studies have shown that forest features and management intensity strongly influence understorey vegetation, the influence of such variation on the effect of large-herbivore exclusion is not known. This study In this study, we analysed changes of species richness, Shannon diversity, evenness and cover of understorey herbs and shrubs after excluding large herbivores for seven years on 147 forest sites, differing in management intensity and forest features, in three regions of Germany (Schwäbische Alb, Hainich-Dün, Schorfheide-Chorin). Further, we studied how the effect of large-herbivore exclusion on understorey vegetation was influenced by forest management intensity and several forest features. Results As expected, exclusion of large herbivores resulted in highly variable results. Nevertheless, we found that large-herbivore exclusion significantly increased cover and Shannon diversity of shrub communities, while it did not affect herb communities. Forest management intensity did not influence the effect of large-herbivore exclusion while some forest features, most often relative conifer cover, did. In forests with high relative conifer cover, large-herbivore exclusion decreased species richness and cover of herbs and increased Shannon diversity of herbs and shrubs, while in forests with low relative conifer cover large-herbivore exclusion increased species richness and cover of herbs, and decreased Shannon diversity of herbs and shrubs. Conclusion We suggest that browsing by large herbivores should be included when studying understorey shrub communities, however when studying understorey herb communities the effects of browsing are less general and depend on forest features."
https://openalex.org/W2956885781,"Collagen type III (COL3) is one of the 3 major collagens in the body, and loss of expression or mutations in the COL3 gene have been associated with the onset of vascular diseases such the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Previous work reported a significant reduction of COL3 in tissues such as skin and vessels with aging. In agreement, we found that COL3 was significantly reduced in senescent human mesenchymal stem cells and myofibroblasts derived from patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a premature aging syndrome. Most notably, we discovered that ectopic expression of the embryonic transcription factor Nanog homeobox (NANOG) restored COL3 expression by restoring the activity of the TGF-β pathway that was impaired in senescent cells. RNA sequencing analysis showed that genes associated with the activation of the TGF-β pathway were up-regulated, whereas negative regulators of the pathway were down-regulated upon NANOG expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that NANOG bound to the mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD)2 and SMAD3 promoters, in agreement with increased expression and phosphorylation levels of both proteins. Using chemical inhibition, short hairpin RNA knockdown, and gain of function approaches, we established that both SMAD2 and SMAD3 were necessary to mediate the effects of NANOG, but SMAD3 overexpression was also sufficient for COL3 production. In summary, NANOG restored production of COL3, which was impaired by cellular aging, suggesting novel strategies to restore the impaired extracellular matrix production and biomechanical function of aged tissues, with potential implications for regenerative medicine and anti-aging treatments.—Rong, N., Mistriotis, P., Wang, X., Tseropoulos, G., Rajabian, N., Zhang, Y., Wang, J., Liu, S., Andreadis, S.

https://openalex.org/W2959939650,"Bacterial pneumonia is a global health challenge that causes up to 2 million deaths each year. Purinergic signaling plays a pivotal role in healthy alveolar epithelium. Here, we used fluorophore-based analysis and live-cell calcium imaging to address the question of whether the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae directly interferes with purinergic signaling in alveolar epithelial cells. Disturbed purinergic signaling might result in pathophysiologic changes like edema formation and atelectasis, which are commonly seen in bacterial pneumonia. Purine receptors are mainly activated by ATP, mediating a cytosolic calcium response. We found that this purinergic receptor P2Y2-mediated response is suppressed in the presence of S. pneumoniae in A549 and isolated primary alveolar cells in a temperature-dependent manner. Downstream inositol 3-phosphate (IP3) signaling appeared to be unaffected, as calcium signaling via protease-activated receptor 2 remained unaltered. S. pneumoniae–induced suppression of the P2Y2-mediated calcium response depended on the P2Y2 phosphorylation sites Ser-243, Thr-344, and Ser-356, which are involved in receptor desensitization and internalization. Spinning-disk live-cell imaging revealed that S. pneumoniae induces P2Y2 translocation into the cytosol. In conclusion, our results show that S. pneumoniae directly inhibits purinergic signaling by inducing P2Y2 phosphorylation and internalization, resulting in the suppression of the calcium response of alveolar epithelial cells to ATP, thereby affecting cellular integrity and function."
https://openalex.org/W2961604978,"Several studies have shown that the performance of a supply chain is heavily influenced by the pattern of relationships among firms. This paper analyzes the structure of relationships (network topology) that leads to the highest agility of a food supply chain when sudden demand changes occur. To do this, a simulation model that represents a supply chain and specific rules to allocate orders is built. The supply chain in the model follows the specific characteristics of trade in the primary sector. The model is fitted to the conditions of a real seafood supply chain in Mexico. Agility is measured through the effect on the order fulfillment of a sudden demand shock and the recovery time of this rate to previous values. The simulation results show that the most suitable structure depends on how product is distributed among suppliers. If product is evenly shared, supply chains with homogeneous topologies are more agile than supply chains with heterogeneous topologies, but the result is the opposite if product is unevenly shared among suppliers. Other previous recommendations, such as having multiple suppliers and horizontal links, are confirmed by the simulations. These findings contribute to the general debate on which is the optimal topology for an agile supply chain."
https://openalex.org/W2979282702,"Background Low birth weight is an important predictor of maternal and child health. Birth weight is likely to be affected by maternal health, socioeconomic status and quality of health care facilities. Objective To assess trends in the birth weight, the proportion of low birth weight, maternal factors and health care facilities for delivery in villages of Western Maharashtra from the year 2004 to 2016 and to analyze factors associated with low birth weight for total birth data of 2004–2016. Methods Data collected for 19244 births from 22 villages in Vadu Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), Pune, Maharashtra, India from the year 2004 to 2016 were used for this analysis. Results There was an overall increase in the annual mean birth weight from 2640.12 gram [95% CI 2602.21–2686.84] in the year 2004 to 2781.19 gram [95% CI 2749.49–2797.95] in the year 2016. There was no secular trend to show increase or decrease in the proportion of low weight at birth. Increasing maternal age (>18 years) compounded with better education, reduced parity and increasing number of institutional deliveries were significant trends observed during the past decade. Low birth weight was found to be associated with female gender, first birth order, poor maternal education and occupation as cultivation. Conclusion Changes in maternal age, education, occupation, and increased institutionalized deliveries contributed in to increasing birth weights in rural Maharashtra. Female gender, first birth order, poor maternal education and occupation of cultivation are associated with increased risk of low birth weight."
https://openalex.org/W2957974382,"Recently, some authors have suggested that age-related impairments in social-cognitive abilities—emotion recognition (ER) and theory of mind (ToM)—may be explained in terms of reduced motivation and effort mobilization in older adults. We examined performance on ER and ToM tasks, as well as corresponding control tasks, experimentally manipulating self-involvement. Sixty-one older adults and 57 young adults were randomly assigned to either a High or Low self-involvement condition. In the first condition, self-involvement was raised by telling participants were told that good task performance was associated with a number of positive, personally relevant social outcomes. Motivation was measured with both subjective (self-report questionnaire) and objective (systolic blood pressure reactivity—SBP-R) indices. Results showed that the self-involvement manipulation did not increase self-reported motivation, SBP-R, or task performance. Further correlation analyses focusing on individual differences in motivation did not reveal any association with performance, in either young or older adults. Notably, we found age-related decline in both ER and ToM, despite older adults having higher motivation than young adults. Overall, the present results were not consistent with previous claims that motivation affects older adults’ social-cognitive performance, opening the route to potential alternative explanations."

Seventy-eight journals (31%) mentioned COIs in research and authors' obligation towards disclosure; 2 (1%) and 6 (2%) mentioned family members' and institutional COIs, respectively. Twenty-two and 11 journals mentioned at least one form of financial and nonfinancial COI type in research, respectively. Seven journals (3%) required disclosure of the source of financial support in research, but no journals mentioned the amount of support. Seven (3%) and 12 (5%) journals mentioned COIs in the editorial process and peer-review, respectively. Clinical journals (45%) paid more attention to COI policies than non-clinical journals.Approximately one-third of Chinese medical journals had COI policies, and of the journals that mentioned financial COIs most required nonfinancial COIs. However, the extent to which journals implemented COI policies was insufficient. There is a generic lack of standardized disclosure forms and management of COIs in most journals. The subject and details of COIs involved in the editorial and peer-review process received less attention than those in research."
https://openalex.org/W2960739315,"Background Chronic inflammation is the driver of liver injury and results in progressive fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis with consequences including both liver failure and liver cancer. We have previously described increased expression of the highly multifunctional glycoprotein CD147 in liver injury. This work describes a novel role of CD147 in liver inflammation and the importance of leukocyte aggregates in determining the extent of liver injury. Methods Non-diseased, progressive injury, and cirrhotic liver from humans and mice were examined using a mAb targeting CD147. Inflammatory cell subsets were assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Results In liver injury, we observe abundant, intrahepatic leukocyte clusters defined as ≥5 adjacent CD45+ cells which we have termed “leukocyte aggregates”. We have shown that these leukocyte aggregates have a significant effect in determining the extent of liver injury. If CD147 is blocked in vivo, these leukocyte aggregates diminish in size and number, together with a marked significant reduction in liver injury including fibrosis. This is accompanied by no change in overall intrahepatic leukocyte numbers. Further, blocking of aggregation formation occurs prior to an appreciable increase in inflammatory markers or fibrosis. Additionally, there were no observed, “off-target” or unpredicted effects in targeting CD147. Conclusion CD147 mediates leukocyte aggregation which is associated with the development of liver injury. This is not a secondary effect, but a cause of injury as aggregate formation proceeds other markers of injury. Leukocyte aggregation has been previously described in inflammation dating back over many decades. Here we demonstrate that leukocyte aggregates determine the extent of liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2956363247,"Unlike most notodontids, Theroa zethus larvae feed on plants that emit copious latex when damaged. To determine how the larvae overcome this defense, we filmed final instars on poinsettia, Euphorbia pulcherrima, then simulated their behaviors and tested how the behaviors individually and combined affect latex exudation. Larvae initially scraped the stem, petiole, or midrib with their mandibles, then secreted acid from their ventral eversible gland (VEG) onto the abraded surface. Scraping facilitated acid penetration by disrupting the waxy cuticle. As the acid softened tissues, the larvae used their mandibles to compress the plant repeatedly, thereby rupturing the latex canals. Scraping, acid application, and compression created withered furrows that greatly diminished latex exudation distal to the furrows where the larvae invariably fed. The VEG in notodontids ordinarily serves to deter predators; when attacked, larvae spray acid aimed directly at the assailant. Using HPLC, we documented that the VEG secretion of T. zethus contains 30% formic acid (6.53M) with small amounts of butyric acid (0.05M). When applied to poinsettia petioles, the acids caused a similar reduction in latex outflow as VEG secretion milked from larvae. VEG acid could disrupt latex canals in part by stimulating the normal acid-growth mechanism employed by plants to loosen walls for cell elongation. Histological examination of cross sections in poinsettia midribs confirmed that cell walls within furrows were often highly distorted as expected if VEG acids weaken walls. Theroa zethus is the only notodontid caterpillar known to use mandibular scraping and VEG acid to disable plant defenses. However, we document that mandibular constriction of petioles occurs also in other notodontids including species that feed on hardwood trees. This capability may represent a pre-adaptation that facilitated the host shift in the Theroa lineage onto latex-bearing plants by enabling larvae to deactivate laticifers with minimal latex contact."
https://openalex.org/W2957687358,"Nowadays, consumers have become increasingly aware of their local food system as a result of concerning about health and nutrition, food safety and sustainability, and local economic development. This transitional shift from global to direct-to-consumer farm operations has increased the demand for locally produced foods. As an alternative, community supported agriculture (CSA), a direct and sustainable food channel, has gained tremendous popularity in the US. Despite the interest garnered by local agriculture and CSA, relatively few studies have empirically tested the determinants of why this marketing phenomenon has grown so rapidly. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors that drive producers to market their products through CSA by using a county-level data set from the US. Results using a Tobit model indicate that specific operator characteristics, such as young and female operators and those engaged in farming as primary occupation, play a strongly positive role in the likelihood of marketing through CSA; farms with small size, rented land, and engagement in growing vegetables, melons, fruits and tree nut crops are more interested in marketing via CSA; households with higher income and females significantly increase the share of farms marketing through CSA; presence of children and seniors and being married are negatively related to the demand for CSA foods. Moreover, counties with higher density of population, establishments-supermarket and other grocery stores, and legislation or active programs that encourage local food consumption tend to encourage more farms marketing through CSA."

As most patients with diabetic nephropathy suffer from type 2 diabetes, the aim of this study was to investigate whether PAR-1 inhibition also limits diabetic nephropathy in experimental type 2 diabetes. Consequently, leptin-deficient black and tan brachyuric (BTBRob/ob) mice were randomly assigned to vorapaxar (1.75 mg/kg; twice weekly via oral gavage) or vehicle treatment, whereas matched wild-type (WT) BTBR (BTBRWT) mice served as nondiabetic controls. Weight and (nonfasting) blood glucose levels were monitored for up to 18 wk, after which kidney function and histologic damage was evaluated postmortem. We show that blood glucose levels and body weight increased in diabetic BTBRob/ob mice compared with nondiabetic BTBRWT controls. Vorapaxar-dependent PAR-1 inhibition reduced but did not normalize blood glucose levels in BTBRob/ob mice, whereas it potentiated the increase in body weight. Vorapaxar did not, however, preserve kidney function, whereas it only minimally reduced histopathological signs of kidney injury. Overall, we thus show that PAR-1 inhibition reduces blood glucose levels during the progression of diabetic nephropathy in experimental type 2 diabetes but does not improve renal function.

https://openalex.org/W2961971858,"A primary challenge in developing effective vaccines against obligate, intracellular, bacterial tick-borne pathogens that establish persistent infection is the identification of antigens that cross protect against multiple strains. In the case of Anaplasma marginale, the most prevalent tick-borne pathogen of cattle found worldwide, OmpA is an adhesin and thus a promising vaccine candidate. We sequenced ompA from cattle throughout Ghana naturally infected with A. marginale in order to determine the degree of variation in this gene in an area of suspected high genetic diversity. We compared the Ghanaian sequences with those available from N. America, Mexico, Australia and Puerto Rico. When considering only amino acid changes, three unique Ghanaian OmpA variants were identified. In comparison, strains from all other geographic regions, except one, shared a single OmpA variant, Variant 1, which differed from the Ghanaian variants. Next, using recombinant OmpA based on Variant 1, we determined that amino acid differences in OmpA in Ghanaian cattle as compared to OmpA Variant 1 did not alter the binding capacity of antibody directed against OmpA Variant 1, supporting the value of OmpA as a highly conserved vaccine candidate."

A total of 214 DEGs were detected in brain (82 up and 132 down) and 1900 DEGs in lung (1259 up and 641 down). GO enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs in both Brain and Lung were mainly enriched in biological processes 'DNA-templated transcription and Transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter', 'multicellular organism development', 'cell differentiation' and 'apoptotic process'. In addition, COG classification showed that both were mostly involved in 'Replication, Recombination, and Repair', 'Signal transduction and mechanism', 'Translation, Ribosomal structure and Biogenesis' and 'Transcription'. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that brain was mainly enriched in 'Thyroid cancer' pathway whereas lung in 'Complement and Coagulation Cascades' pathway.

Fractional polynomial random effect model is used to model the evolution of CD4 counts over time in response to treatment and to estimate the individual probability to be above a pre-selected CD4 threshold. Human subject research approval for this study was received from University of Gondar Research Ethics Committee and the medical director of the hospital.A total of 1347 patients were included in the analysis presented in this paper. The cohort contributed a total of 236.58 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Later the data were divided into two periods: the first is the estimation period in which the parameters of the model are estimated and the second is the prediction period. Based on the parameters from the estimation period, model based prediction for the time to cross a threshold was estimated. The correlations between observed and predicted values of CD4 levels in the estimation period were 0.977 and 0.982 for Neverapine and Efavirenz containing regimens, respectively; while the correlation between the observed and predicted CD4 counts in the prediction period are 0.742 and 0.805 for NVP and EFV, respectively.The model enables us to estimate a subject-specific expected time to cross a CD4 threshold and to estimate a subject-specific probability to have CD4 count above a pre-specified threshold at each time point. By predicting long-term outcomes of CD4 count of the patients one can advise patient about the potential ART benefits that accrue in the long-term."
https://openalex.org/W2960175479,"Linden (Tilia spp.), a profusely flowering temperate tree that provides bees with vital pollen and nectar, has been associated with bumble bee (Bombus spp.) mortality in Europe and North America. Bee deaths have been attributed, with inadequate evidence, to toxicity from mannose in nectar or starvation due to low nectar in late blooming linden. Here, we investigated both factors via untargeted metabolomic analyses of nectar from five T. cordata trees beneath which crawling/dead bumble bees (B. vosnesenskii) were observed, and of thoracic muscle of 28 healthy foraging and 29 crawling bees collected from linden trees on cool mornings (< 30°C). Nectar contained the pyridine alkaloid trigonelline, a weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but no mannose. Principal component analysis of muscle metabolites produced distinct clustering of healthy and crawling bees, with significant differences (P<0.05) in 34 of 123 identified metabolites. Of these, TCA (Krebs) cycle intermediates were strongly represented (pathway analysis; P<0.01), suggesting that the central metabolism is affected in crawling bees. Hence, we propose the following explanation: when ambient temperature is low, bees with energy deficit are unable to maintain the thoracic temperature required for flight, and consequently fall, crawl, and ultimately, die. Energy deficit could occur when bees continue to forage on linden despite limited nectar availability either due to loyalty to a previously energy-rich source or trigonelline-triggered memory/learning impairment, documented earlier with other alkaloids. Thus, the combination of low temperature and nectar volume, resource fidelity, and alkaloids in nectar could explain the unique phenomenon of bumble bee mortality associated with linden."
https://openalex.org/W2956991807,"The degree to which interspecific competition structures diverse communities is an oft-debated topic. An approach to answering this question is to examine spatial patterns of coexistence among putatively competing species. The degree to which interspecies competition predominates in a community can have important effects on our ability predict the response of that community to perturbations, most notably climate change, when shifting species’ ranges may result in novel species assemblages. We present a study on the avifauna of the Eastern Himalayas. We hypothesize that in a community where competitive interactions predominate, there will be a relationship between pairwise altitudinal overlaps and morphological differences between species. Moreover, we hypothesize that both morphological traits and altitudinal traits depart from a Brownian motion evolution model, resulting in species trait covariances having a phylogenetic component. We find a significant relationship between morphological dissimilarity and altitudinal overlaps of species pairs. We also find that closely related species are significantly more altitudinally stratified than a null model would predict. However, as more distantly related species pairs are included in the analysis, this pattern disappears, indicating that competitive interactions predominate only in closely related species. This is further suggested by the fact that altitudinal ranges themselves are phylogenetically overdispersed at the genus level, as are morphological traits. This effect disappears when the entire phylogeny is examined, with morphology and altitude being phylogenetically underdispersed. Model fitting suggests that individual clades have evolved towards local clade-specific fitness peaks, while within-clade results show evidence of niche partitioning. We interpret these results as a tension between competition on shorter time scales and selection on longer time scales, where competition forces closely-related species away from fitness peaks in order to allow for niche separation and hence coexistence, suggesting that this effect is partially responsible for the recent diversification of Eastern Himalayan avifauna."
https://openalex.org/W2961983299,"Aims Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection under immunosuppression sometimes causes death. This study aimed to elucidate risk factors for CMV infection in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). Methods Patients with AAV who underwent remission induction treatment at Okayama University Hospital between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was the development of CMV infection within 3 months. Results Of the 111 patients, 13 (11.7%) patients developed CMV infection. Patients with CMV infection were older (p = 0.030) and had a higher body mass index (p = 0.029) in comparison to those without CMV infection. A higher proportion had a severe form (p = 0.001) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (p = 0.001), as well as a higher Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (p = 0.018) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.018) levels at baseline. Using logistic regression analysis, severe form and GPA were independent risk factors (odds ratio [OR] = 9.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.92–60.23, and OR = 7.46, 95% CI = 1.46–47.60, respectively). In addition, patients with CMV infection were more likely than those without infection to be glucocorticoid-related diabetes mellitus (p = 0.025). Conclusion Our study highlights disease severity and subgroups of AAV as risk factors for CMV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2958561107,"Innate CD8αα+ cells, also referred to as iCD8α cells, are TCR-negative intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) possessing cytokine and chemokine profiles and functions related to innate immune cells. iCD8α cells constitute an important source of osteopontin in the intestinal epithelium. Osteopontin is a pleiotropic cytokine with diverse roles in bone and tissue remodeling, but also has relevant functions in the homeostasis of immune cells. In this report, we present evidence for the role of iCD8α cells in the homeostasis of TCR-negative NKp46+NK1.1+ IEL (ILC1-like). We also show that the effect of iCD8α cells on ILC1-like IEL is enhanced in vitro by osteopontin. We show that in the absence of iCD8α cells, the number of NKp46+NK1.1+ IEL is significantly reduced. These ILC1-like cells are involved in intestinal pathogenesis in the anti-CD40 mouse model of intestinal inflammation. Reduced iCD8α cell numbers results in a milder form of intestinal inflammation in this disease model, whereas treatment with osteopontin increases disease severity. Collectively, our results suggest that iCD8α cells promote survival of NKp46+NK1.1+ IEL, which significantly impacts the development of intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2960915860,"There is evidence that replacing saturated fat (SFA) with polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) lowers ischemic heart disease (IHD). In order to improve the population’s diet, the World Health Organization has called for the taxation of foods that are high in SFA. We aimed to assess the potential health gains of a European fat tax by applying the SFA intake reduction that has been observed under the Danish fat tax to six other European countries. For each country, we created a fat tax scenario with a decreased SFA intake and a corresponding increase in PUFA. We compared this fat tax scenario to a reference scenario with no change in SFA intake, and to a guideline scenario with a population-wide SFA intake in line with dietary recommendations. We used DYNAMO-HIA to dynamically project the policy-attributable IHD cases of these three scenarios 10 years into the future. A fat tax would reduce prevalent IHD cases by a minimum of 500 and 300 among males and females in Denmark, respectively, up to a maximum of 5,600 and 4,000 among males and females in the UK. Thereby, the prevented IHD cases under a fat tax scenario would correspond to between 11.0% (in females in the Netherlands) and 29.5% (in females in Italy) of the prevented IHD cases under a guideline scenario, which represents the maximum preventable disease burden. Henceforth, our quantification of beneficial health impacts makes the case for the policy debate on fat taxes."
https://openalex.org/W2962448122,"In acidosis, catecholamines are attenuated, and higher doses are often required to improve cardiovascular function. Colforsin activates adenylate cyclase in cardiomyocytes without beta-adrenoceptor. Here, six beagles were administered colforsin or dobutamine four times during eucapnia (partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide 35–40 mm Hg; normal) and hypercapnia (ibid 90–110 mm Hg; acidosis) conditions. The latter was induced by CO2 inhalation. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Cardiovascular function was measured by thermodilution and a Swan-Ganz catheter at baseline and 60 min after 0.3 μg/kg/min (low), 0.6 μg/kg/min (middle), and 1.2 μg/kg/min (high) colforsin administration. The median pH was 7.38 [range 7.33–7.42] and 7.01 [range 6.96–7.08] at baseline in the Normal and Acidosis conditions, respectively. Endogenous adrenaline and noradrenaline levels at baseline were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the Acidosis than in the Normal condition. Colforsin induced cardiovascular effects similar to those caused by dobutamine. Colforsin increased cardiac output in the Normal condition (baseline: 3.9 ± 0.2 L/kg/m2 [mean ± standard error], low: 5.2 ± 0.4 L/kg/min2, middle: 7.0 ± 0.4 L/kg/m2, high: 9.4 ± 0.2 L/kg/m2; P < 0.001) and Acidosis condition (baseline: 6.1 ± 0.3 L/kg/m2, low: 6.2 ± 0.2 L/kg/m2, middle: 7.2 ± 0.2 L/kg/m2, high: 8.3 ± 0.2 L/kg/m2; P < 0.001). Colforsin significantly increased heart rate and decreased systemic vascular resistance compared to values at baseline. Both drugs increased pulmonary artery pressure, but colforsin (high: 13.3 ± 0.6 mmHg in Normal and 20.1 ± 0.2 mmHg in Acidosis) may have lower clinical impact on the pulmonary artery than dobutamine (high: 19.7 ± 0.6 in Normal and 26.7 ± 0.5 in Acidosis). Interaction between both drugs and experimental conditions was observed in terms of cardiovascular function, which were similarly attenuated with colforsin and dobutamine under acute respiratory acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2958255981,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor compound with estrogenic activity, possessing affinity for both nuclear (ERα and ERβ) and membrane estrogen receptors. The main source of BPA exposure comes from the contamination of food and water by plastic storage containers or disposable bottles, among others, in which case BPA is easily ingested. Exposure to BPA during early pregnancy leads to lifelong effects; however, its effect on the immune system has not been fully studied. Since endocrine and immune systems interact in a bidirectional manner, the disruption of the former may cause permanent alterations of the latter, thus affecting a future anti-parasitic response. In this study, neonate BALB/c mice were exposed to a single dose of BPA (250 μg/kg); once sexual maturity was reached, they were orally infected with Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis). The analyses performed after 5 days of infection revealed a decreased parasitic load in the duodenum of mice in the BPA-treated group. Flow cytometry analyses also revealed changes in the immune cell subpopulations of the infected animals when compared to the BPA-treated group. RT-PCR analyses of duodenum samples showed an increased expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-9 in the BPA-treated group. These findings show a new aspect whereby early-life exposure to BPA contributes to the protection against T. spiralis by modulating the anti-parasitic immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2961935119,"This study aimed to explore the feasibility of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) as a carrier protein. Three recombinant pneumococcal surface proteins from three different clades were expressed by the prokaryotic expression system and conjugated to group A meningococcal polysaccharide (GAMP) to generate three polysaccharide-protein conjugates. The conjugates, unconjugated proteins, GAMP, and GAMP-TT vaccine bulk (used as positive control) were immunized into mice, and their immune effects were assessed by the methods of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry (FCM), and serum bactericidal assay (SBA). The results showed that the polysaccharide-protein conjugates could produce higher levels of anti-GAMP IgG titers (P < 0.05), higher ratios of Th1/Th2 (P < 0.05), and higher levels of serum bactericidal activity (P < 0.05), compared with the unconjugated GAMP. The conjugation of PspAs to GAMP also enhanced the anti-PspA responses compared with unconjugated PspAs except for PspA3. In conclusion, the results indicated that the three PspAs were appropriate carrier proteins, as demonstrated by the characteristics of T-cell dependent responses to the GAMP, and might protect against group A of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis."
