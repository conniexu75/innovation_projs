https://openalex.org/W2052471006,"The gas-phase reaction between MoO3-x and H(2)S in a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures (800 degrees to 950 degrees C) has been used to synthesize large quantities of an almost pure nested inorganic fullerene (IF) phase of MoS(2). A uniform IF phase with a relatively narrow size distribution was obtained. The synthesis of IFs appears to require, in addition to careful control over the growth conditions, a specific turbulent flow regime. The x-ray spectra of the different samples show that, as the average size of the IF decreases, the van der Waals gap along the c axis increases, largely because of the strain involved in folding of the lamella. Large quantities of quite uniform nanotubes were obtained under modified preparation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2045209948,"A strategy has been developed for the synthesis of thermoplastic elastomeric polypropylene based on the catalytic activity of the unbridged metallocene bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride [(2-PhInd)(2)ZrCl(2)]. This catalyst was designed to isomerize between achiral and chiral coordination geometries during the polymerization reaction to produce atactic-isotactic stereoblock polymers. The metallocene precursor (2-PhInd)(2)ZrCl(2) in the presence of methylaluminoxane polymerizes propylene to yield rubbery polypropylene. The isotacticity of the polymer, described by the isotactic pentad content, increases with increasing propylene pressure and decreasing polymerization temperature to produce polypropylenes with an isotactic pentad content ranging from 6.3 to 28.1 percent."

In addition, base isolation has become increasingly popular for critical buildings that should still function after an earthquake. How will these two types of buildings perform if a large earthquake occurs beneath a metropolitan area? To answer this question, we simulated the near-source ground motions of a M(w) 7.0 thrust earthquake and then mathematically modeled the response of a 20-story steel-frame building and a 3-story base-isolated building. The synthesized ground motions were characterized by large displacement pulses (up to 2 meters) and large ground velocities. These ground motions caused large deformation and possible collapse of the frame building, and they required exceptional measures in the design of the base-isolated building if it was to remain functional."

https://openalex.org/W2142341717,"Far too few moderate earthquakes have occurred within the Los Angeles, California, metropolitan region during the 200-year-long historic period to account for observed strain accumulation, indicating that the historic era represents either a lull between clusters of moderate earthquakes or part of a centuries-long interseismic period between much larger (moment magnitude, M(w), 7.2 to 7.6) events. Geologic slip rates and relations between moment magnitude, average coseismic slip, and rupture area show that either of these hypotheses is possible, but that the latter is the more plausible of the two. The average time between M(w) 7.2 to 7.6 earthquakes from a combination of six fault systems within the metropolitan area was estimated to be about 140 years."
https://openalex.org/W2056283091,Data on aerodynamic capture of particles are used to estimate efficiency of collection of pollen grains and spores by falling raindrops. Simple probability arguments then yield the fractional removal of airborne pollens and spores by rain. Pollen grains are generally large enough to be washed out by all but the lightest showers of large thunderstorm-type drops; smaller-sized spores experience lower removal rates. Various specialists concerned with pollen dissemination will find rain-scavenging a significant process.

https://openalex.org/W2056811187,The Huronian Cobalt tillite (Gowganda formation) exhibits a preferred dimensional orientation of embedded elongate rock fragments. The orientation is believed to be due to ice motion. Data from four localities show an alignment in about a north-south direction. Data are inadequate to locate center of ice dispersal.

https://openalex.org/W2033641174,"Although there is debate on the maximum size of earthquake that is possible on any of several known fault systems in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan region, it is reasonable to assume that the distribution of earthquakes will follow a fractal distribution of rupture areas. For this assumption and an overall slip-rate for the region of approximately 1 centimeter per year, roughly one magnitude 7.4 to 7.5 event is expected to occur every 245 to 325 years. A model in which the earthquake distribution is fractal predicts that, additionally, there should be approximately six events in the range of magnitude 6.6 in this same span of time, a higher rate than has occurred in the historic record."

https://openalex.org/W2007546676,"The US Department of Energy has sketched out the next generation of fusion projects, but the prospects for funding appear bleak. The most vulnerable programs are three critical elements of the US magnetic fusion program: the Tokamak Physics Experiment, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, and the research base that supports studies ranging from basic plasma physics to the development of materials that would be used in a working fusion power plant. This article describes the areas of work for the future and the problems getting any significant funding through congress."

https://openalex.org/W4292139569,"In the report ""Activation and regeneration of rhodopsin in the insect visual cycle"" by A. Kiselev and S. Subramaniam (25 Nov., p. 1369), the second and third sentences of the last paragraph on page 1371 were incorrectly printed. They should have read, ""When rhodopsin was re-excited immediately after it was regenerated, most of the metarhodopsin formed was thermally stable (that is, M(b) was formed predominantly; Fig. 4A). However, when rhodopsin was re-examined after waiting for various lengths of time (in the dark), an exponential increase was observed in the amount of thermally unstable metarhodopsin produced, implying heterogeneity in the rhodopsin population."""
