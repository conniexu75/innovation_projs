Changes in stress sensitivity and functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may underlie the association between stress and risk for psychiatric disorders. Preclinical work in rodents has linked low levels of maternal care to increased methylation of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene, as well as to exaggerated hormonal and behavioral responses to stress. Recent studies have begun to examine whether early-life stress leads to epigenetic modifications of the GR gene in humans. Methods We examined the degree of methylation of a region of the promoter of the human GR gene (NR3C1) in leukocyte DNA from 99 healthy adults. Participants reported on their childhood experiences of parental behavior, parental death or desertion, and childhood maltreatment. On a separate day, participants completed the dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (Dex/CRH) test, a standardized neuroendocrine challenge test. Results Disruption or lack of adequate nurturing, as measured by parental loss, childhood maltreatment, and parental care, was associated with increased NR3C1 promoter methylation (p<.05). In addition, NR3C1 promoter methylation was linked to attenuated cortisol responses to the Dex/CRH test (p<.05). Conclusions These findings suggest that childhood maltreatment or adversity may lead to epigenetic modifications of the human GR gene. Alterations in methylation of this gene could underlie the associations between childhood adversity, alterations in stress reactivity, and risk for psychopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2034679941,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) constitute highly pathogenic virus that cause severe respiratory diseases in newborn, children, elderly and immuno-compromised individuals. Airway inflammation is a critical regulator of disease outcome in RSV infected hosts. Although “controlled” inflammation is required for virus clearance, aberrant and exaggerated inflammation during RSV infection results in development of inflammatory diseases like pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays an important role in inflammation by orchestrating the pro-inflammatory response. IL-1β is synthesized as an immature pro-IL-1β form. It is cleaved by activated caspase-1 to yield mature IL-1β that is secreted extracellularly. Activation of caspase-1 is mediated by a multi-protein complex known as the inflammasome. Although RSV infection results in IL-1β release, the mechanism is unknown. Here in, we have characterized the mechanism of IL-1β secretion following RSV infection. Our study revealed that NLRP3/ASC inflammasome activation is crucial for IL-1β production during RSV infection. Further studies illustrated that prior to inflammasome formation; the “first signal” constitutes activation of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2)/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling is required for pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 gene expression during RSV infection. Following expression of these genes, two “second signals” are essential for triggering inflammasome activation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and potassium (K+) efflux due to stimulation of ATP-sensitive ion channel promote inflammasome activation following RSV infection. Thus, our studies have underscored the requirement of TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB pathway (first signal) and ROS/potassium efflux (second signal) for NLRP3/ASC inflammasome formation, leading to caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1β release during RSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2031579881,"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are non-conventional lipid-reactive αβ T lymphocytes that play a key role in host responses during viral infections, in particular through the swift production of cytokines. Their beneficial role during experimental influenza A virus (IAV) infection has recently been proposed, although the mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here we show that during in vivo IAV infection, mouse pulmonary iNKT cells produce IFN-γ and IL-22, a Th17-related cytokine critical in mucosal immunity. Although permissive to viral replication, IL-22 production by iNKT cells is not due to IAV infection per se of these cells but is indirectly mediated by IAV-infected dendritic cells (DCs). We show that activation of the viral RNA sensors TLR7 and RIG-I in DCs is important for triggering IL-22 secretion by iNKT cells, whereas the NOD-like receptors NOD2 and NLRP3 are dispensable. Invariant NKT cells respond to IL-1β and IL-23 provided by infected DCs independently of the CD1d molecule to release IL-22. In vitro, IL-22 protects IAV-infected airway epithelial cells against mortality but has no role on viral replication. Finally, during early IAV infection, IL-22 plays a positive role in the control of lung epithelial damages. Overall, IAV infection of DCs activates iNKT cells, providing a rapid source of IL-22 that might be beneficial to preserve the lung epithelium integrity.

Unlike conventional T lymphocytes that recognize peptide-MHC complexes, the TCR of iNKT cells detects self and foreign (i.e. microbial-derived) (glyco)lipids presented by the nonpolymorphic MHC class I-like protein CD1d expressed by Ag-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs) (3.Godfrey D.I.

For instance, using an experimental mouse model of chronic lung disease triggered by infection with Sendai virus, Kim et al. (19.Kim E.Y. Battaile J.T. Patel A.C. You Y. Agapov E. Grayson M.H. Benoit L.A. Byers D.E. Alevy Y. Tucker J. Swanson S. Tidwell R. Tyner J.W. Morton J.D. Castro M. Polineni D. Patterson G.A. Schwendener R.A. Allard J.D. Peltz G. Holtzman M.J. Persistent activation of an innate immune response translates respiratory viral infection into chronic lung disease.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) showed that IL-13 production by iNKT cells is important in the pulmonary pathology. More recently, Stout-Delgado et al. (20.Stout-Delgado H.W. Du W. Shirali A.C. Booth C.J. Goldstein D.R. Aging promotes neutrophil-induced mortality by augmenting IL-17 production during viral infection.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 446-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IL-17 production by iNKT cells from aged mice infected with herpes simplex virus 2 is sufficient to promote liver damage and death. Finally, we recently reported that iNKT cells produce IFN-γ during dengue virus infection and participate in the cytokine storm and vascular leakage, two major pathological features associated with severe dengue virus infection (21.Renneson J. Guabiraba R. Maillet I. Marques R.E. Ivanov S. Fontaine J. Paget C. Quesniaux V. Faveeuw C. Ryffel B. Teixeira M.M. Trottein F.

Thus, the nature of the iNKT cell response is variable according to the virus and possibly the organ targeted. To control iNKT cell functions in the future for therapeutic purposes, it is important to better understand how these cells become activated. It is likely that the recruitment of innate sensors by viruses in sentinel cells, such as DCs, is important for the indirect activation of iNKT cells (8.Brigl M. Brenner M.B.

Kinjo Y. Kronenberg M. The unique role of natural killer T cells in the response to microorganisms.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In this setting, activation of iNKT cells might be triggered by cytokines produced from DCs, by TCR ligation with self lipids, or both (8.Brigl M. Brenner M.B.

Using a mouse-adapted H3N2 IAV strain, we show for the first time that iNKT cells produce IL-22 during infection, a critical cytokine in mucosal immunity. We further present detailed mechanisms by which iNKT cells release IL-22 in the context of IAV infection. Finally, we show that IL-22 protects the pulmonary epithelium against damages during IAV infection.

All animal work conformed to the Pasteur Institute, Lille animal care and use committee guidelines (agreement no. AF 16/20090 from the Comité d'Ethique en Expérimentation Animale Nord Pas-De-Calais). Monoclonal Abs against mouse CD5 (APC-conjugated), NK1.1 (PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated), TCRβ (FITC-conjugated), and isotype controls were purchased from BD Pharmingen. APC-conjugated and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated PBS-57-loaded CD1d tetramers were, respectively, obtained from ProImmune (Oxford, UK) and the NIAID (National Institutes of Health) Tetramer Facility (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The monoclonal Ab against mouse IL-22 (clone 3F11), a kind gift from Dr. W. Ouyang (Genentech, San Francisco, CA), was labeled with the APC conjugation kit from AbD Serotec (Colmar, France). APC-conjugated control mouse IgG2a mAb was from eBioscience. The neutralizing goat IgGs directed against mouse IL1-β, IL-23, TNF-α, and IL-6 were from R&D Systems. Recombinant mouse IL-23 was from Clinisciences, and recombinant mouse IL-1β and IL-22 were from Peprotech (Neuilly-sur-Seine, France). Mice were anesthetized and administered intranasally with 50 μl of PBS containing 600 plaque forming units of virus (Scotland/20/74, H3N2) or PBS alone (mock). Total RNA from cell-sorted pulmonary iNKT cells of mock-treated or IAV-infected mice was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized by classical procedures. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out in an ABI 7500 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 0.5 μm concentrations of specific primers and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen).

PCR amplification of gapdh was performed to control for sample loading and to allow normalization between samples. Quantitative comparison was obtained through the ΔΔCT method. For graphical representation, data are expressed as -fold mRNA level increase compared with the expression level in lung iNKT cells from mock-treated mice. Primers specific for IAV M2 gene 5′-AAGACCAATCCTGTCACCTCTGA-3′ and 5′-CAAAGCGTCTACGCTGCAGTCC-3′ and for mouse hprt 5′-CAGGCCAGACTTTGTTGGAT-3′ and 5′-TTGCGCTCATCTTAGGCTTT-3′ were used to quantify viral load in iNKT cells. IAV and hprt copies for each experimental sample were quantified in duplicate using the standard curves obtained by PCR amplification on serial dilutions of purified PCR products. Viral load is expressed as viral RNA normalized to hprt expression level. Pulmonary and hepatic mononuclear cells from mock-treated or IAV-infected mice were prepared by classical procedures. Briefly, lungs were perfused with PBS, excised, and finely minced followed by enzymatic digestion for 20 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 1 mg/ml collagenase type VIII and 1 μg/ml DNase type I (Sigma). After washing, lung and liver homogenates were resuspended in a 35% Percoll™ gradient, carefully layered onto 70% Percoll™, and centrifuged at 1000 × g without brake at 22 °C for 30 min. The layer at the interface between the two Percoll™ concentrations was carefully aspirated and washed in PBS 2% FCS. Red blood cells were removed with lysis buffer (Sigma). To purify iNKT cells, mononuclear cell s were labeled with phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated PBS-57-loaded CD1d tetramer and FITC-conjugated anti-TCRβ Ab. After cell surface labeling, cells were sorted using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). PBS57-loaded CD1d tetramer+ TCRβ+ cell purity after sorting was consistently >98%. In some cases iNKT cells were further purified according to the expression, or not, of the NK1.1 molecule using PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-NK1.1 Ab. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected 2 or 4 days post-infection (p.i.) by classical procedures in a 0.5-ml wash. Cytokines were quantified using kits from R&D Systems. Lung mononuclear cells were cultured at 1 × 107 cells/ml in complete medium containing 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-1β and IL-23 plus 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 4 h. After activation, cells were washed and stained with LIVE/DEAD® Fixable Dead Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen) in PBS for 30 min. The cells were washed and incubated with appropriate dilutions of eFluor-conjugated CD45, phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated PBS-57-loaded CD1d tetramer, V450-conjugated anti-TCRβ Ab, and PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-NK1.1 Ab for 30 min in PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.01% NaN3. Cells were washed and fixed using IC Fixation Buffer (eBioscience, CliniSciences, Montrouge, France). Fixed cells were then permeabilized in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stained with APC-conjugated mAb against IL-22 or control mouse IgG2a mAb and analyzed on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Bone marrow-derived DCs were generated exactly as described in Paget et al. (34.Paget C. Mallevaey T. Speak A.O. Torres D. Fontaine J. Sheehan K.C. Capron M. Ryffel B. Faveeuw C. Leite de Moraes M.

DCs (1 × 105 cells) were challenged with IAV at 1 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) for 1 h at 37 °C without FCS. After incubation, cells were extensively washed to remove unbound virus and incubated at 37 °C in medium containing FCS. Cell-free supernatants were harvested after 24 h for cytokine analysis. For co-culture experiments, treated DCs were cultured for 2 days with sorted iNKT cells (105 DCs + 105 iNKT cells/well) in round-bottom 96-well plates in RPMI supplemented with 5% FCS. In some cases neutralizing or control Abs were added during the co-culture. Co-culture supernatants were collected, and IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17A/F, IL-21, and IL-22 concentrations were measured by ELISA (R&D systems, Abington, UK (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-21, and IL-22)), eBiosciences, San Diego, CA (IL-17A and IL-17F), and BD Pharmingen (IL-4). Cytokines present in DC supernatants were quantified using commercial ELISA kits distributed by R&D systems (IL-12p40, IL-23, IL-1β, TNF-α), BD Pharmingen (IL-6), and PBL Biomedical Laboratories (Piscataway, NJ) (IFN-β). Mouse primary airway epithelial cells (AEC) were prepared as follows. Briefly, lungs were digested for 25 min in dissociation buffer containing Pronase (1 mg/ml; Streptomyces griseus protease; Sigma). After macrophage depletion (adherence onto polypropylene plates), cells were resuspended on culture plates precoated with BD Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in airway epithelial cell growth medium (Promocell). After 2 weeks, more than 95% of the cells were cytokeratin positive (Abcam, Paris). Before use, cells were starved overnight in airway epithelial cell basal medium and preincubated with recombinant murine IL-22 (Peprotech) for 4 h. Cells were then infected with IAV at 1 m.o.i. for 1 h. Viral infection was stopped by intensive changes of culture medium and addition of serum. Expression of regenerating protein 3β (Reg3b) mRNA was performed by quantitative RT-PCR using 5′-CGCATTAGTTGCCCCAAGG-3′ and 5′-TCCAGGCCTCTTTTGGCAG-3′. Cell viability was evaluated 24 and 48 h after infection using Resorufin (CellTiter-Blue Reagent, Promega). Four days p.i. (100 plaque forming units), the BAL fluid and the whole lungs were collected from WT and Il-22−/− mice. Analysis of cell number in the BALs was performed as described (24.Paget C. Ivanov S.

Evaluators who were blinded to genotype scored lung sections (0 (none)–3 (extreme) on the basis of hyperplasia of bronchial epithelium and intercellular cohesion. Cell or whole lung supernatants were diluted before being applied to 95% confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Virus was adsorbed onto the cells for 1 h at room temperature before being washed off four times with serum-free DMEM. Cells were then covered with serum-free DMEM containing trypsin and 0.8% agarose and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide. Agarose was then removed, and the monolayer was stained with 1% gentian violet to allow for the visualization and counting of plaques. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. or ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between experimental groups was calculated by one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-test or an unpaired Student's t test (GraphPad Prism 4 Software, San Diego, CA). The possibility of using these parametric tests was assessed by checking if the population is Gaussian and the variance is equal (Bartlett's test).

Our objective was to examine if the use of face masks and hand hygiene reduced rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza in the natural setting. A cluster-randomized intervention trial was designed involving 1,178 young adults living in 37 residence houses in 5 university residence halls during the 2007-2008 influenza season. Participants were assigned to face mask and hand hygiene, face mask only, or control group during the study. Discrete-time survival models using generalized estimating equations to estimate intervention effects on ILI and confirmed influenza A/B infection over a 6-week study period were examined. A significant reduction in the rate of ILI was observed in weeks 3 through 6 of the study, with a maximum reduction of 75% during the final study week (rate ratio [RR] = 0.25, [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.87]). Both intervention groups compared to the control showed cumulative reductions in rates of influenza over the study period, although results did not reach statistical significance. Generalizability limited to similar settings and age groups. Face masks and hand hygiene combined may reduce the rate of ILI and confirmed influenza in community settings. These non-pharmaceutical measures should be recommended in crowded settings at the start of an influenza pandemic.[corrected] Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00490633."
https://openalex.org/W2042858467,"Target-mediated clearance and high antigen load can hamper the efficacy and dosage of many antibodies. We show for the first time that the mouse, cynomolgus, and human cross-reactive, antagonistic anti-proprotein convertase substilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies J10 and the affinity-matured and humanized J16 exhibit target-mediated clearance, resulting in dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profiles. These antibodies prevent the degradation of low density lipoprotein receptor, thus lowering serum levels of LDL-cholesterol and potently reducing serum cholesterol in mice, and selectively reduce LDL-cholesterol in cynomolgus monkeys. In order to increase the pharmacokinetic and efficacy of this promising therapeutic for hypercholesterolemia, we engineered pH-sensitive binding to mouse, cynomolgus, and human PCSK9 into J16, resulting in J17. This antibody shows prolonged half-life and increased duration of cholesterol lowering in two species in vivo by binding to endogenous PCSK9 in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. The proposed mechanism of this pH-sensitive antibody is that it binds with high affinity to PCSK9 in the plasma at pH 7.4, whereas the antibody-antigen complex dissociates at the endosomal pH of 5.5-6.0 in order to escape from target-mediated degradation. Additionally, this enables the antibody to bind to another PCSK9 and therefore increase the antigen-binding cycles. Furthermore, we show that this effect is dependent on the neonatal Fc receptor, which rescues the dissociated antibody in the endosome from degradation. Engineered pH-sensitive antibodies may enable less frequent or lower dosing of antibodies hampered by target-mediated clearance and high antigen load."
https://openalex.org/W1979521077,"The characterization of pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiles is an essential step in the development process of new candidate drugs or imaging agents. Simultaneously, the assessment of organ function related to the uptake and clearance of drugs is of great importance. To this end, we demonstrate an imaging platform capable of high-rate characterization of the dynamics of fluorescent agents in multiple organs using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). A spatial resolution of approximately 150 µm through mouse cross-sections allowed us to image blood vessels, the kidneys, the liver and the gall bladder. In particular, MSOT was employed to characterize the removal of indocyanine green from the systemic circulation and its time-resolved uptake in the liver and gallbladder. Furthermore, it was possible to track the uptake of a carboxylate dye in separate regions of the kidneys. The results demonstrate the acquisition of agent concentration metrics at rates of 10 samples per second at a single wavelength and 17 s per multispectral sample with 10 signal averages at each of 5 wavelengths. Overall, such imaging performance introduces previously undocumented capabilities of fast, high resolution in vivo imaging of the fate of optical agents for drug discovery and basic biological research."
https://openalex.org/W1982101081,"Major coastal storms, associated with strong winds, high waves and intensified currents, and occasionally with heavy rains and flash floods, are mostly known because of the serious damage they can cause along the shoreline and the threats they pose to navigation. However, there is a profound lack of knowledge on the deep-sea impacts of severe coastal storms. Concurrent measurements of key parameters along the coast and in the deep-sea are extremely rare. Here we present a unique data set showing how one of the most extreme coastal storms of the last decades lashing the Western Mediterranean Sea rapidly impacted the deep-sea ecosystem. The storm peaked the 26th of December 2008 leading to the remobilization of a shallow-water reservoir of marine organic carbon associated with fine particles and resulting in its redistribution across the deep basin. The storm also initiated the movement of large amounts of coarse shelf sediment, which abraded and buried benthic communities. Our findings demonstrate, first, that severe coastal storms are highly efficient in transporting organic carbon from shallow water to deep water, thus contributing to its sequestration and, second, that natural, intermittent atmospheric drivers sensitive to global climate change have the potential to tremendously impact the largest and least known ecosystem on Earth, the deep-sea ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W1984655664,"Objective Impulse control disorders (ICDs) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) are important behavioral problems that affect a subpopulation of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and typically result in markedly diminished quality of life for patients and their caregivers. We aimed to investigate the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on ICD/DDS frequency and dopaminergic medication usage. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on 159 individuals who underwent unilateral or bilateral PD DBS surgery in either STN or GPi. According to published criteria, pre- and post-operative records were reviewed to categorize patients both pre- and post-operatively as having ICD, DDS, both ICD and DDS, or neither ICD nor DDS. Group differences in patient demographics, clinical presentations, levodopa equivalent dose (LED), and change in diagnosis following unilateral/bilateral by brain target (STN or GPi DBS placement) were examined. Results 28 patients met diagnostic criteria for ICD or DDS pre- or post-operatively. ICD or DDS classification did not differ by GPi or STN target stimulation. There was no change in DDS diagnosis after unilateral or bilateral stimulation. For ICD, diagnosis resolved in 2 of 7 individuals after unilateral or bilateral DBS. Post-operative development of these syndromes was significant; 17 patients developed ICD diagnoses post-operatively with 2 patients with pre-operative ICD developing DDS post-operatively. Conclusions Unilateral or bilateral DBS did not significantly treat DDS or ICD in our sample, even though a few cases of ICD resolved post-operatively. Rather, our study provides preliminary evidence that DDS and ICD diagnoses may emerge following DBS surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2060060298,"Background Angiogenesis is regarded as a hallmark in cancer development, and anti-angiogenic treatment is presently used in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding, endogenous, single stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression. In this study we aimed to identify significantly altered miRs related to angiogenesis in NSCLC. Methods From a large cohort of 335 NSCLC patients, paraffin-embedded samples from 10 patients with a short disease specific survival (DSS), 10 with a long DSS and 10 normal controls were analyzed. The miRs were quantified by microarray hybridization and selected miRs were validated by real-time qPCR. The impacts of different pathways, including angiogenesis, were evaluated by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) derived from Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationship (PANTHER). One of the most interesting candidate markers, miR-155, was validated by in situ hybridization (ISH) in the total cohort (n = 335) and correlation analyses with several well-known angiogenic markers were done. Results 128 miRs were significantly up- or down-regulated; normal versus long DSS (n = 68) and/or normal versus short DSS (n = 63) and/or long versus short DSS (n = 37). The pathway analysis indicates angiogenesis-related miRs to be involved in NSCLC. There were strong significant correlations between the array hybridization and qPCR validation data. The significantly altered angiogenesis-related miRs of high interest were miR-21, miR-106a, miR-126, miR-155, miR-182, miR-210 and miR-424. miR-155 correlated significantly with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in the total cohort (r = 0.17, P = 0.002), though most prominent in the subgroup with nodal metastasis (r = 0.34, P<0.001). Conclusions Several angiogenesis-related miRs are significantly altered in NSCLC. Further studies to understand their biological functions and explore their clinical relevance are warranted."

https://openalex.org/W1972941961,"Maternal effect genes encode proteins that are produced during oogenesis and play an essential role during early embryogenesis. Genetic ablation of such genes in oocytes can result in female subfertility or infertility. Here we report a newly identified maternal effect gene, Nlrp2, which plays a role in early embryogenesis in the mouse. Nlrp2 mRNAs and their proteins (∼118 KDa) are expressed in oocytes and granulosa cells during folliculogenesis. The transcripts show a striking decline in early preimplantation embryos before zygotic genome activation, but the proteins remain present through to the blastocyst stage. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that the NLRP2 protein is located in the cytoplasm, nucleus and close to nuclear pores in the oocytes, as well as in the surrounding granulosa cells. Using RNA interference, we knocked down Nlrp2 transcription specifically in mouse germinal vesicle oocytes. The knockdown oocytes could progress through the metaphase of meiosis I and emit the first polar body. However, the development of parthenogenetic embryos derived from Nlrp2 knockdown oocytes mainly blocked at the 2-cell stage. The maternal depletion of Nlrp2 in zygotes led to early embryonic arrest. In addition, overexpression of Nlrp2 in zygotes appears to lead to normal development, but increases blastomere apoptosis in blastocysts. These results provide the first evidence that Nlrp2 is a member of the mammalian maternal effect genes and required for early embryonic development in the mouse."

We conducted an investigation of this unexplained dermopathy to characterize the clinical and epidemiologic features and explore potential etiologies.A descriptive study was conducted among persons at least 13 years of age and enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) during 2006-2008. A case was defined as the self-reported emergence of fibers or materials from the skin accompanied by skin lesions and/or disturbing skin sensations. We collected detailed epidemiologic data, performed clinical evaluations and geospatial analyses and analyzed materials collected from participants' skin.We identified 115 case-patients. The prevalence was 3.65 (95% CI = 2.98, 4.40) cases per 100,000 enrollees. There was no clustering of cases within the 13-county KPNC catchment area (p = .113). Case-patients had a median age of 52 years (range: 17-93) and were primarily female (77%) and Caucasian (77%). Multi-system complaints were common; 70% reported chronic fatigue and 54% rated their overall health as fair or poor with mean Physical Component Scores and Mental Component Scores of 36.63 (SD = 12.9) and 35.45 (SD = 12.89), respectively. Cognitive deficits were detected in 59% of case-patients and 63% had evidence of clinically significant somatic complaints; 50% had drugs detected in hair samples and 78% reported exposure to solvents. Solar elastosis was the most common histopathologic abnormality (51% of biopsies); skin lesions were most consistent with arthropod bites or chronic excoriations. No parasites or mycobacteria were detected. Most materials collected from participants' skin were composed of cellulose, likely of cotton origin.This unexplained dermopathy was rare among this population of Northern California residents, but associated with significantly reduced health-related quality of life.

https://openalex.org/W2074641102,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are characterized by a high expression of IL-2 receptor α chain (CD25) and of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), the latter being essential for their development and function. Another major player in the regulatory function is the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4) that inhibits cytotoxic responses. However, the regulation of CTLA-4 expression remains less well explored. We therefore studied the microRNA signature of circulating CD4(+) Tregs isolated from adult healthy donors and identified a signature composed of 15 differentially expressed microRNAs. Among those, miR-24, miR-145, and miR-210 were down-regulated in Tregs compared with controls and were found to have potential target sites in the 3'-UTR of FOXP3 and CTLA-4; miR-24 and miR-210 negatively regulated FOXP3 expression by directly binding to their two target sites in its 3'-UTR. On the other hand, miR-95, which is highly expressed in adult peripheral blood Tregs, positively regulated FOXP3 expression via an indirect mechanism yet to be identified. Finally, we showed that miR-145 negatively regulated CTLA-4 expression in human CD4(+) adult peripheral blood Tregs by binding to its target site in CTLA-4 transcript 3'-UTR. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a human adult peripheral blood CD4(+) Treg microRNA signature. Moreover, unveiling one mechanism regulating CTLA-4 expression is novel and may lead to a better understanding of the regulation of this crucial gene."

We conducted the first investigation to use the genome wide association (GWA) approach to identify putative risk variants for ALI. Genome wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Quad 610 BeadChip. We performed a two-stage GWA study followed by a third stage of functional characterization. In the discovery phase (Phase 1), we compared 600 European American trauma-associated ALI cases with 2266 European American population-based controls. We carried forward the top 1% of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at p<0.01 to a replication phase (Phase 2) comprised of a nested case-control design sample of 212 trauma-associated ALI cases and 283 at-risk trauma non-ALI controls from ongoing cohort studies. SNPs that replicated at the 0.05 level in Phase 2 were subject to functional validation (Phase 3) using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses in stimulated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) in family trios. 159 SNPs from the discovery phase replicated in Phase 2, including loci with prior evidence for a role in ALI pathogenesis. Functional evaluation of these replicated SNPs revealed rs471931 on 11q13.3 to exert a cis-regulatory effect on mRNA expression in the PPFIA1 gene (p = 0.0021). PPFIA1 encodes liprin alpha, a protein involved in cell adhesion, integrin expression, and cell-matrix interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2089523347,"The Drosophila TRPA channel Painless is required for the function of polymodal nociceptors which detect noxious heat and noxious mechanical stimuli. These functions of Painless are reminiscent of mammalian TRPA channels that have also been implicated in thermal and mechanical nociception. A popular hypothesis to explain the mechanosensory functions of certain TRP channels proposes that a string of ankyrin repeats at the amino termini of these channels acts as an intracellular spring that senses force. Here, we describe the identification of two previously unknown Painless protein isoforms which have fewer ankyrin repeats than the canonical Painless protein. We show that one of these Painless isoforms, that essentially lacks ankyrin repeats, is sufficient to rescue mechanical nociception phenotypes of painless mutant animals but does not rescue thermal nociception phenotypes. In contrast, canonical Painless, which contains Ankyrin repeats, is sufficient to largely rescue thermal nociception but is not capable of rescuing mechanical nociception. Thus, we propose that in the case of Painless, ankryin repeats are important for thermal nociception but not for mechanical nociception."
https://openalex.org/W1994576080,"Several genome-wide studies demonstrated that alternative splicing (AS) significantly increases the transcriptome complexity in plants. However, the impact of AS on the functional diversity of proteins is difficult to assess using genome-wide approaches. The availability of detailed sequence annotations for specific genes and gene families allows for a more detailed assessment of the potential effect of AS on their function. One example is the plant MADS-domain transcription factor family, members of which interact to form protein complexes that function in transcription regulation. Here, we perform an in silico analysis of the potential impact of AS on the protein-protein interaction capabilities of MIKC-type MADS-domain proteins. We first confirmed the expression of transcript isoforms resulting from predicted AS events. Expressed transcript isoforms were considered functional if they were likely to be translated and if their corresponding AS events either had an effect on predicted dimerisation motifs or occurred in regions known to be involved in multimeric complex formation, or otherwise, if their effect was conserved in different species. Nine out of twelve MIKC MADS-box genes predicted to produce multiple protein isoforms harbored putative functional AS events according to those criteria. AS events with conserved effects were only found at the borders of or within the K-box domain. We illustrate how AS can contribute to the evolution of interaction networks through an example of selective inclusion of a recently evolved interaction motif in the MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1-3 (MAF1-3) subclade. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential effect of an AS event in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), resulting in the deletion of a short sequence stretch including a predicted interaction motif, by overexpression of the fully spliced and the alternatively spliced SVP transcripts. For most of the AS events we were able to formulate hypotheses about the potential impact on the interaction capabilities of the encoded MIKC proteins."

We hypothesized that other ATP-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms conserve porphyrins. Here, we demonstrate that Abcb6−/− mice lack mitochondrial ATP-driven import of coproporphyrin III. Gene expression analysis revealed that loss of Abcb6 results in up-regulation of compensatory porphyrin and iron pathways, associated with elevated protoporphyrin IX (PPIX).

Taken together, our findings suggest that although Abcb6 is not essential for basal porphyrin synthesis, it has an important role in coordinating heme and iron homeostasis during times when high porphyrin demand occurs such as during phenylhydrazine stress. An Abcb6-targeting vector was constructed in the pKO vector by standard molecular procedures. Briefly, the 5′ arm consisted of a 3.2-kb HindIII/XhoI fragment 5′ of Abcb6 exon 6 ligated into the pKONTKV1901 vector (Stratagene). The 3′ arm was a 5.4-kb EcoRI fragment of Abcb6 containing exons 16–19. The fragments were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into 129/SVJ-derived ES cells. Genomic DNA from 798 ES clones that survived 2 weeks of G418 selection was screened first by PCR analysis and subsequently by Southern blot analysis. All procedures involving animals were approved by the St. Jude IAUCAC committee. All mice were born and housed in the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital animal care facility. Mice were maintained on a standard rodent diet. In these experiments, littermates were used as controls. Mitochondria were isolated from livers of female mice, prepared as described (9Krishnamurthy P. Ross D.D. Nakanishi T. Bailey-Dell K. Zhou S. Mercer K.E. Sarkadi B. Sorrentino B.P. Schuetz J.D.

Mitochondria (50–100 μg) were resuspended in Tris-sucrose (TS) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) (final volume, 50 μl). Equal volumes of reaction mix and control mix were freshly prepared for each assay. Reactions (in triplicate) were started by adding 50 μl of reaction or control mix to each sample and incubated the time interval indicated at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by dilution with 1 ml of ice-cold TS buffer, and samples were stored on ice. Blanks were prepared by adding mitochondria and reaction/control mix directly to 1 ml of ice-cold TS buffer and incubating on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g in a refrigerated table-top centrifuge for 5 min, and the pellet was washed twice with ice-cold TS buffer. Pellets were lysed by incubation for 10 min in 1% Nonidet P-40 solution with agitation, and fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelength 630 nm. Concentration of CP was determined from a standard curve of CP in 1% Nonidet P-40. The rate of active transport (pmol·min−1 mg−1) was calculated as the difference between ATP-dependent and -independent uptake. Km and Vmax values were determined for coproporphyrin transport using a combination of two methods. First, the transport rates versus CP concentration graphs were transposed to generate Lineweaver-Burke graphs and values of Km and Vmax estimated by linear regression analysis. To confirm these estimates, nonlinear regression was conducted using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego). The values obtained by these two methods varied by less than 10%. Gene expression screening was based on the methods of Nilsson et al. (11Nilsson R. Schultz I.J. Pierce E.L. Soltis K.A. Naranuntarat A. Ward D.M. Baughman J.M. Paradkar P.N. Kingsley P.D. Culotta V.C. Kaplan J. Palis J. Paw B.H. Mootha V.K. Discovery of genes essential for heme biosynthesis through large scale gene expression analysis.Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Freely available mammalian microarray data were used to search for genes consistently coexpressed with a query dataset. 15 GEO datasets (314 chips) were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus between September and December 2009. A prior p0 value of 15% (versus 5% in the Nilsson method) was used to calculate the integrated p value, as we started from a more narrowly defined list of genes (those up-regulated in Abcb6−/− erythroblasts). We used the following eight heme biosynthetic genes as controls: alad, alas2, cpox, fech, hmbs, ppox, urod, and uros. The gene expression value in each data set was calculated by using the Affymetrix MAS5 method. We mapped Affymetrix probe sets in the Affymetrix Mouse 430_2 array to other Affymetrix array platforms, using either the best matched probe or probe ortholog files available from the Affymetrix web site. When multiple probe sets were applicable to genes, those with the maximum expression values were used. The probability of coexpression of each gene with the eight known heme genes was calculated within each dataset, and the genes were ranked in order of their likelihood of coexpression with the heme genes. The dataset weight (wd) was defined as the mean coexpression probability across the eight heme genes. For the heat map showing Abcb6 expression throughout erythroid differentiation, the dataset GSE4655 (erythroid differentiation in vitro, Homo sapiens) was used. Heat maps were generated on the basis of Z-scores, calculated as Z = (x − m)/s, where x is the raw gene expression value to be standardized; m is the mean gene expression across all samples, and s is the corresponding standard deviation. Samples of peripheral blood mixed with EDTA were lysed in the HPLC mobile phase (described below) for 30 min at room temperature and then centrifuged (50,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Twenty microliters of supernatant was injected into the HPLC system (Beckman System Gold Programmable Solvent Module 126). ZnPP and PPIX were separated on a Hibar 125 × 4-mm LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (5 μm; Merck) with a mobile phase containing 10% 1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 30% methanol, and 60% (v/v) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. ZnPP and PPIX were detected by fluorescence (ZnPP, excitation 415 nm and emission 590 nm; PPIX, excitation 405 nm and emission 630 nm). Under these conditions, ZnPP and PPIX were eluted at 2.5 and 6.1 min, respectively. Results were quantified by comparison to known quantities of external standards. For heme and porphyrin analysis, porphyrins were extracted from whole-blood samples with acidified acetone and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Heme was separated from other porphyrins on a Shimadzu system, using a mobile phase of acetonitrile in water containing 0.05% trichloroacetic acid at 1 ml/min on a reverse-phase C18 column (MC Medical), applying a 30–66% linear gradient over 5 min followed by a 66–90% linear gradient over 20 min. Heme absorbance was read at 400 nm, whereas porphyrin fluorescence was measured at 395 nm (excitation) and 630 nm (emission). The heme/ZnPP ratio of each sample was determined by dividing the heme absorbance by the PPIX fluorescence. The heme absorbance value of each sample was normalized to the absolute reticulocyte count (as determined by both Ter119 and thiazole-orange double-positive cells). EKLF binds specifically to the sequence CCACACCCT (12Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J.

Three EKLF binding patterns were mapped by using DNA pattern analysis and visualized by using Feature map in the RSA suite of tools (15Thomas-Chollier M. Sand O. Turatsinze J.V. Janky R. Defrance M.

Abcb6 comprises 19 exons and is highly conserved in humans and mice (16Emadi-Konjin H.P. Zhang H. Anandan V. Sun D. Schuetz J. Furuya K.N. Isolation of a genomic clone containing the promoter region of the human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Abcb6 was disrupted in embryonic stem (ES) cells by using homologous recombination to replace exons 13 and 14 (encoding the Walker A ATP-binding motif essential for ABC transporter function) (17Krishnamurthy P.C. Du G. Fukuda Y. Sun D. Sampath J. Mercer K.E. Wang J. Sosa-Pineda B. Murti K.G. Schuetz J.D. Identification of a mammalian mitochondrial porphyrin transporter.Nature. 2006; 443: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) with the neomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1A), as verified by PCR (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial lysates from various tissues revealed a gene dose effect, i.e. loss of one allele reduced Abcb6 protein by half (supplemental Fig. S1). After normalization with the mitochondrial protein voltage-dependent anion channel, Abcb6 was highly expressed in the mitochondria of multiple tissues, most highly in the liver and spleen (Fig. 1C). In several tissues (bone marrow and heart), substantial proteolytic cleavage of Abcb6 resulted in a reduced size immunoreactive band. Among the porphyrins that interact with Abcb6, CP was a prime candidate substrate because it potently disrupted the hemin-agarose interaction with Abcb6 and inhibited heme import into mitochondria (17Krishnamurthy P.C. Du G. Fukuda Y. Sun D. Sampath J. Mercer K.E. Wang J. Sosa-Pineda B. Murti K.G. Schuetz J.D. Identification of a mammalian mitochondrial porphyrin transporter.Nature. 2006; 443: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Although CP differs electronically from the endogenous substrate coproporphyrinogen III, the main feature distinguishing the porphyrins interacting with Abcb6 is the tetratrapyrrole structure (17Krishnamurthy P.C. Du G. Fukuda Y. Sun D. Sampath J. Mercer K.E. Wang J. Sosa-Pineda B. Murti K.G. Schuetz J.D. Identification of a mammalian mitochondrial porphyrin transporter.Nature. 2006; 443: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike coproporphyrinogen III, which is highly susceptibility to oxidation and not suitable for isolated mitochondrial transport assays, CP is a stable substrate that is very similar to the endogenous coproporphyrinogen III. Mitochondrial CP uptake assays have been described previously (18Koller M.E. Romslo I. Uptake of protoporphyrin IX by isolated rat liver mitochondria.Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Rebeiz N. Arkins S. Kelley K.W. Rebeiz C.A. Enhancement of coproporphyrinogen III transport into isolated transformed leukocyte mitochondria by ATP.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not provide unequivocal evidence for CP transport because they either did not include ATP or the concentrations were exceedingly high. To determine the kinetics of CP binding and transport, we developed a CP uptake assay using hepatic mitochondria from adult wild-type and Abcb6−/− mice. We utilized the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP to distinguish between ATP-dependent (requiring ATP hydrolysis) and nondependent import (Fig. 2A). The wild-type and Abcb6−/− mice showed nearly identical non-ATP-dependent CP uptake (4.5 ± 0.9 and 5.4 ± 1.8 pmol/mg, respectively). In contrast, ATP-dependent transport (∼4 pmol/min/mg) was measurable only in the wild-type mice. In the wild-type mice, ATP-dependent CP transport was saturable and displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Vmax of 9.8 pmol·min−1 mg−1 and a Km of 12.6 μm (Fig. 2B). We hypothesized that Abcb6 up-regulation is required to meet the increased demand for porphyrins during erythropoiesis. We tested this hypothesis in an immortalized erythroid cell line, the murine MEL cells, which can be induced by hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) to activate heme/porphyrin synthesis. MEL cells were untreated or treated with HMBA for 120 h before mitochondrial isolation. The initial rate of ATP-dependent CP transport was four times as great in HMBA-treated cells (18.24 pmol·min−1 mg−1) as in untreated cells (4.67 pmol·min−1 mg−1) (Fig. 2C, upper panel). In contrast, non-ATP-dependent CP uptake was almost identical in treated and untreated MEL cells (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Quantitative analysis indicated that mitochondrial expression of Abcb6 was increased by a factor of ∼5 by HMBA treatment. Although the expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (an energy-independent porphyrin importer) also increased in HMBA-treated MEL cells (Fig. 2D), it did not appear to substantially contribute to the ATP-independent import of CP, consistent with the weak affinity of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor for CP compared with hemin or PPIX (Fig. 2C). Moreover, immunoblot analysis showed no greater mitochondrial expression of other non-ATP-dependent porphyrin importers, voltage-dependent anion channel, ANT1, or 2-oxoglutarate carrier, in Abcb6−/− mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 2D). The increased CP transport we observed in HMBA-treated MEL cells corresponded to a 20-fold increase in heme (measured by HPLC) during the same time course of differentiation (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2). Although small amounts of heme accumulate in the uninduced MEL cells, it is most notable that endogenous coproporphyrinogen III only accumulates in the noninduced cells and not in the MEL cells in which Abcb6 was strongly induced. Together, these data indicate that Abcb6 is required for ATP-dependent mitochondrial import of CP and that in MEL cells, Abcb6 expression levels parallel increased ATP-dependent CP import. Given the parallel increase in heme and Abcb6 function and expression, these findings suggest that Abcb6 is crucial to coordinating porphyrin and iron pathways to synthesize heme. Although the Abcb6−/− mice appeared phenotypically normal, multiple independent intercrosses among Abcb6+/− mice (153 viable offspring) yielded 10% fewer mice of the Abcb6−/− genotype and of the Abcb6+/− genotype than expected (Table 1). Because of the role of Abcb6 in mitochondrial porphyrin transport and regulation of intracellular porphyrins, we examined the peripheral blood parameters of Abcb6−/− mice (Table 2). Surprisingly, the mean erythrocyte PPIX concentration was 41% greater in Abcb6−/− mice than in their wild-type littermates (p = 0.006), although the mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin differed only slightly. All other hematologic parameters measured were comparable in Abcb6+/+ and Abcb6−/− animals.TABLE 1Non-Mendelian inheritance of the Abcb6 geneAbcb6+/+Abcb6+/−Abcb6−/−Expected % (n)aExpected inheritance in a population of 153 is given in parentheses.25% (38.25)bp = 0.02, Pearson's χ2 test with 2 degrees of freedom.50% (76.5)25% (38.25)Observed % (n)35% (53)42% (64)23% (36)a Expected inheritance in a population of 153 is given in parentheses.b p = 0.02, Pearson's χ2 test with 2 degrees of freedom.

In particular, the elevated erythrocyte PPIX in Abcb6−/− mice suggested that porphyrin biosynthesis may be altered, possibly leading to alteration of iron usage and other interrelated pathways. To determine whether gene expression is altered in the absence of Abcb6, we compared transcript expression in Abcb6−/− and wild-type erythroblasts (MACS-purified Ter119-positive cells) by using an Affymetrix microarray (Fig. 3). Pathway analysis (GENEGO, KEGG, and Gseap) indicated the highest ranked pathways were in the porphyrin metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathways (p = 2.18 × 10−12 and 2.04 × 10−9, respectively), consistent with the known role of Abcb6 in activating heme synthesis and with the up-regulation of Abcb6 during erythroid development (10Lynch J.

To determine the relationship of these genes to heme biosynthesis, we adapted an expression screening approach described by Nilsson et al. (11Nilsson R. Schultz I.J. Pierce E.L. Soltis K.A.

Analysis of public gene expression datasets available on GEO (23Li F.M. Lim C.K. Peters T.J. An HPLC assay for rat liver ferrochelatase activity.Biomed. Chromatogr. 1987; 2: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) revealed that during erythroid differentiation Abcb6 is up-regulated in parallel with many of the eight heme pathway (alas2, alad, hmbs, uros, urod, cpox, ppox, and fech) genes (Fig. 3A). We focused on the 69 mitochondrial and known erythroid-associated genes (of 175) that were up-regulated by a factor of 2 or more in Abcb6−/− erythroblasts, plus eight other heme pathway genes (supplemental Table S1), of the total of more than 3500 genes, whose expression was altered by a factor of 2 or more (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table S2). Nearly all of the 69 genes were independently verified by ABI gene card analysis (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, a total of 72 candidate genes were examined within a collection of 314 microarray datasets (supplemental Table S3) representing a wide range of erythropoiesis-relevant conditions. The dataset weight and individual rankings were used to select candidate genes whose expression was highly related to heme gene expression across a range of cell types and experimental conditions as illustrated in Fig. 3C. Many of the highest ranking genes in our final list (the top 20 candidates) were potential EKLF targets (24Drissen R. von Lindern M. Kolbus A. Driegen S. Steinlein P. Beug H. Grosveld F. Philipsen S.

Furthermore, heme biosynthetic pathway genes such as Alas2 and Hmbs are known to have EKLF-binding sites, and there is evidence of endogenous binding to EKLF (25Frampton J. Walker M. Plumb M.

Importantly, Abcb6 has bona fide EKLF-binding sites (supplemental Table 4 and supplemental Fig. S4A) and is activated by EKLF (supplemental Fig. S4B). Several transcription factors with known roles in erythropoiesis (EKLF, Nfe2, and MyD116) were expressed more highly in Abcb6−/− than in Abcb6+/+erythroid cells (supplemental Table S1). However, EKLF was the transcription factor with the highest integrated p value in the expression screen of those that play a role in regulating heme biosynthetic genes (Table 3). Furthermore, EKLF expression was strongly up-regulated, and FECH protein was increased in Abcb6−/− mice (Fig. 4A), consistent with the observed elevation of FECH mRNA and the fact that FECH is a known EKLF target (27Tugores A.

Cues contributing to the settlement choices and metamorphosis of larvae have important implications for the success of individuals and populations, but cues mediating larval settlement for many marine invertebrates are largely unknown. This study assessed larval settlement in two common Great Barrier Reef sponges, Coscinoderma matthewsi and Rhopaloeides odorabile, to cues that enhance settlement and metamorphosis in various species of scleractinian coral larvae. Methanol extracts of the crustose coralline algae (CCA), Porolithon onkodes, corresponding to a range of concentrations, were used to determine the settlement responses of sponge larvae. Cnidarian neuropeptides (GLW-amide neuropeptides) were also tested as a settlement cue. Settlement in both sponge species was approximately two-fold higher in response to live chips of CCA and optimum concentrations of CCA extract compared to 0.2 µm filtered sea water controls. Metamorphosis also increased when larvae were exposed to GLW-amide neuropeptides; R. odorabile mean metamorphosis reached 42.0±5.8% compared to 16.0±2.4% in seawater controls and in C. matthewsi mean metamorphosis reached 68.3±5.4% compared to 36.7±3.3% in seawater controls. These results demonstrate the contributing role chemosensory communication plays in the ability of sponge larvae to identify suitable habitat for successful recruitment. It also raises the possibility that larvae from distinct phyla may share signal transduction pathways involved in metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2085024878,"In the current study, we investigated the time course of the implicit processing of affective pictures with an orthogonal design of valence (negative vs. positive) by arousal (low vs. high). Previous studies with explicit tasks suggested that valence mainly modulates early event-related potential (ERP) components, whereas arousal mainly modulates late components. However, in this study with an implicit task, we observed significant interactions between valence and arousal at both early and late stages over both parietal and frontal sites, which were reflected by three different ERP components: P2a (100-200 ms), N2 (200-300 ms), and P3 (300-400 ms). Furthermore, there was also a significant main effect of arousal on P2b (200-300 ms) over parieto-occipital sites. Our results suggest that valence and arousal effects on implicit affective processing are more complicated than previous ERP studies with explicit tasks have revealed."
https://openalex.org/W2117977178,"Multiple studies have addressed the mechanisms maintaining polymorphism within a population. However, several examples exist where species inhabiting diverse habitats exhibit local population-specific polymorphism. Numerous explanations have been proposed for the maintenance of geographic variation in color patterns. For example, spatial variation in patterns of selection or limited gene flow can cause entire populations to become fixed for a single morph, resulting in separate populations of the same species exhibiting separate and distinct color morphs. The mottled rock rattlesnake (Crotalus lepidus lepidus) is a montane species that exhibits among-population color polymorphism that correlates with substrate color. Habitat substrate in the eastern part of its range is composed primarily of light colored limestone and snakes have light dorsal coloration, whereas in the western region the substrate is primarily dark and snakes exhibit dark dorsal coloration. We hypothesized that predation on high contrast color and blotched patterns maintain these distinct color morphs. To test this we performed a predation experiment in the wild by deploying model snakes at 12 sites evenly distributed within each of the two regions where the different morphs are found. We employed a 2×2 factorial design that included two color and two blotched treatments. Our results showed that models contrasting with substrate coloration suffered significantly more avian attacks relative to models mimicking substrates. Predation attempts on blotched models were similar in each substrate type. These results support the hypothesis that color pattern is maintained by selective predation."
https://openalex.org/W2004598566,"The kinetics of T and B cell immune recovery after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is affected by many pre- and post-transplant factors. Because of the profoundly depleted baseline T and B cell immunity in recombination activating gene 2 (RAG-2)-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) patients, some of these factors are eliminated, and the immune recovery after BMT can then be clearly assessed. This process was followed in ten SCID patients in parallel to their associated transplant-related complications. Early peripheral presence of T and B cells was observed in 8 and 4 patients, respectively. The latter correlated with pre-transplant conditioning therapy. Cells from these patients carried mainly signal joint DNA episomes, indicative of newly derived B and T cells. They were present before the normalization of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. Early presentation of the ordered TCR gene rearrangements after BMT occurred simultaneously, but this pattern was heterogeneous over time, suggesting different and individual thymic recovery processes. Our findings early after transplant could suggest the long-term patients' clinical outcome. Early peripheral presence of newly produced B and T lymphocytes from their production and maturation sites after BMT suggests donor stem cell origin rather than peripheral expansion, and is indicative of successful outcome. Peripheral detection of TCR excision circles and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles in RAG-2-deficient SCID post-BMT are early markers of T and B cell reconstitution, and can be used to monitor outcome and tailor specific therapy for patients undergoing BMT."

This amino acid stretch was therefore suggested to direct NM1 into the nucleus.We investigated the mechanism of nuclear import of NM1 in detail. Using over-expressed GFP chimeras encoding for truncated NM1 mutants, we identified a specific sequence that is necessary for its import to the nucleus. This novel nuclear localization sequence is placed within calmodulin-binding motif of NM1, thus it is present also in the Myo1c. We confirmed the presence of both isoforms in the nucleus by transfection of tagged NM1 and Myo1c constructs into cultured cells, and also by showing the presence of the endogenous Myo1c in purified nuclei of cells derived from knock-out mice lacking NM1. Using pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays we identified importin beta, importin 5 and importin 7 as nuclear transport receptors that bind NM1. Since the NLS sequence of NM1 lies within the region that also binds calmodulin we tested the influence of calmodulin on the localization of NM1. The presence of elevated levels of calmodulin interfered with nuclear localization of tagged NM1.We have shown that the novel specific NLS brings to the cell nucleus not only the ""nuclear"" isoform of myosin I (NM1 protein) but also its ""cytoplasmic"" isoform (Myo1c protein). This opens a new field for exploring functions of this molecular motor in nuclear processes, and for exploring the signals between cytoplasm and the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1971883379,"Rapid secretion of eosinophil-associated RNases (EARs), such as the human eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), from intracellular granules is central to the role of eosinophils in allergic diseases and host immunity. Our knowledge regarding allergic inflammation has advanced based on mouse experimental models. However, unlike human eosinophils, capacities of mouse eosinophils to secrete granule proteins have been controversial. To study mechanisms of mouse eosinophil secretion and EAR release, we combined an RNase assay of mouse EARs with ultrastructural studies. In vitro, mouse eosinophils stimulated with the chemokine eotaxin-1 (CCL11) secreted enzymatically active EARs (EC50 5 nM) by piecemeal degranulation. In vivo, in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation, increased airway eosinophil infiltration (24-fold) correlated with secretion of active RNases (3-fold). Moreover, we found that eosinophilic inflammation in mice can involve eosinophil cytolysis and release of cell-free granules. Cell-free mouse eosinophil granules expressed functional CCR3 receptors and secreted their granule proteins, including EAR and eosinophil peroxidase in response to CCL11. Collectively, these data demonstrate chemokine-dependent secretion of EARs from both intact mouse eosinophils and their cell-free granules, findings pertinent to understanding the pathogenesis of eosinophil-associated diseases, in which EARs are key factors.—Shamri, R., Melo, R.

https://openalex.org/W2020367862,"The role of tight junctions (TJs) in the establishment and maintenance of lipid polarity in epithelial cells has long been a subject of controversy. We have addressed this issue using lysenin, a toxin derived from earthworms, and an influenza virus labeled with a fluorescent lipid, octadecylrhodamine B (R18). When epithelial cells are stained with lysenin, lysenin selectively binds to their apical membranes. Using an artificial liposome, we demonstrated that lysenin recognizes the membrane domains where sphingomyelins are clustered. Interestingly, lysenin selectively stained the apical membranes of epithelial cells depleted of zonula occludens proteins (ZO-deficient cells), which completely lack TJs. Furthermore, the fluorescent lipid inserted into the apical membrane by fusion with the influenza virus did not diffuse to the lateral membrane in ZO-deficient epithelial cells. This study revealed that sphingomyelin-cluster formation occurs only in the apical membrane and that lipid polarity is maintained even in the absence of TJs."
https://openalex.org/W1983511161,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) can be reductively degraded by microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. However, little is known about the effect of electron donors on microbial communities involved in PBDEs degradation. Here we employed 454 Titanium pyrosequencing to examine the phylogenetic diversity, composition, structure and dynamics of microbial communities from microcosms under the conditions of different electron donor amendments. The community structures in each of the five alternate electron donor enrichments were significantly shifted in comparison with those of the control microcosm. Commonly existing OTUs between the treatment and control consortia increased from 5 to 17 and more than 50% of OTUs increased around 13.7 to 186 times at least in one of the microcosms after 90-days enrichment. Although the microbial communities at different taxonomic levels were significantly changed by different environmental variable groups in redundancy analysis, significant correlations were observed between the microbial communities and PBDE congener profiles. The lesser-brominated PBDE congeners, tri-BDE congener (BDE-32) and hexa-BDE, were identified as the key factors shaping the microbial community structures at OTU level. Some rare populations, including the known dechlorinating bacterium, Dehalobacter, showed significant positive-correlation with the amounts of PBDE congeners in the consortia. The same results were also observed on some unclassified bacteria. These results suggest that PBDEs-degrading microbial communities can be successfully enriched, and their structures and compositions can be manipulated through adjusting the environmental parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2031674701,"To examine the relationship between negative life events, coping styles, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among adolescent survivors exposed to 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, China.A survey was conducted in a sample of 2250 adolescent students from two schools in Dujiangyan District, a seriously damaged area, 20 kilometers away from the epicenter, 6 months after the earthquake. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire including demographics, negative life events, coping styles, and PTSD symptoms.Academic pressure was the strongest predictor of adolescents' PTSD symptoms among all negative life events. Main effects of negative life events, positive coping and negative coping on PTSD symptoms were significant in both younger adolescents and older adolescents, while the moderator effects of two coping styles were found significant only within older adolescents.Coping may play a role to moderate the relationship between post-earthquake negative life events and PTSD symptom, but the function seems to depend on the age of participants. Psychosocial coping skills training may be important in the prevention and intervention of mental health problems in adolescent survivors of traumatic earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2045785924,"Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of craniofacial development, and mutations in the TCOF1 gene are responsible for over 90% of TCS cases. The knowledge about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this syndrome is relatively scant, probably due to the difficulty of reproducing the pathology in experimental animals. Zebrafish is an emerging model for human disease studies, and we therefore assessed it as a model for studying TCS. We identified in silico the putative zebrafish TCOF1 ortholog and cloned the corresponding cDNA. The derived polypeptide shares the main structural domains found in mammals and amphibians. Tcof1 expression is restricted to the anterior-most regions of zebrafish developing embryos, similar to what happens in mouse embryos. Tcof1 loss-of-function resulted in fish showing phenotypes similar to those observed in TCS patients, and enabled a further characterization of the mechanisms underlying craniofacial malformation. Besides, we initiated the identification of potential molecular targets of treacle in zebrafish. We found that Tcof1 loss-of-function led to a decrease in the expression of cellular proliferation and craniofacial development. Together, results presented here strongly suggest that it is possible to achieve fish with TCS-like phenotype by knocking down the expression of the TCOF1 ortholog in zebrafish. This experimental condition may facilitate the study of the disease etiology during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2063115758,"The ζε module consists of a labile antitoxin protein, ε, which in dimer form (ε(2)) interferes with the action of the long-living monomeric ζ phosphotransferase toxin through protein complex formation. Toxin ζ, which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis and may be bactericide in nature, at or near physiological concentrations induces reversible cessation of Bacillus subtilis proliferation (protective dormancy) by targeting essential metabolic functions followed by propidium iodide (PI) staining in a fraction (20-30%) of the population and selects a subpopulation of cells that exhibit non-inheritable tolerance (1-5×10(-5)). Early after induction ζ toxin alters the expression of ∼78 genes, with the up-regulation of relA among them. RelA contributes to enforce toxin-induced dormancy. At later times, free active ζ decreases synthesis of macromolecules and releases intracellular K(+). We propose that ζ toxin induces reversible protective dormancy and permeation to PI, and expression of ε(2) antitoxin reverses these effects. At later times, toxin expression is followed by death of a small fraction (∼10%) of PI stained cells that exited earlier or did not enter into the dormant state. Recovery from stress leads to de novo synthesis of ε(2) antitoxin, which blocks ATP binding by ζ toxin, thereby inhibiting its phosphotransferase activity."

Its epiphytic or endophytic presence in asymptomatic plants is crucial for the spread of Olive and Oleander knot disease, as already ascertained for P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Psv) on Olive and for pv. nerii (Psn) on Oleander, while no information is available for pv. fraxini (Psf) on Ash. Nothing is known yet about the distribution on the different host plants and the real host range of these pathovars in nature, although cross-infections were observed following artificial inoculations. A multiplex Real-Time PCR assay was recently developed to simultaneously and quantitatively discriminate in vitro and in planta these P. savastanoi pathovars, for routine culture confirmation and for epidemiological and diagnostical studies. Here an innovative High-Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA)-based assay was set up to unequivocally discriminate Psv, Psn and Psf, according to several single nucleotide polymorphisms found in their Type Three Secretion System clusters. The genetic distances among 56 P. savastanoi strains belonging to these pathovars were also evaluated, confirming and refining data previously obtained by fAFLP. To our knowledge, this is the first time that HRMA is applied to a bacterial plant pathogen, and one of the few multiplex HRMA-based assays developed so far. This protocol provides a rapid, sensitive, specific tool to differentiate and detect Psv, Psn and Psf strains, also in vivo and against other related bacteria, with lower costs than conventional multiplex Real-Time PCR. Its application is particularly suitable for sanitary certification programs for P. savastanoi, aimed at avoiding the spreading of this phytopathogen through asymptomatic plants."

https://openalex.org/W2023881581,"Background Mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor-suppressor gene have been identified in not only NF2-related tumors but also sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VS). This study investigated the genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumors and blood from 30 Korean patients with sporadic VS and correlated these alterations with tumor behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings NF2 gene mutations were detected using PCR and direct DNA sequencing and three highly polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers were used to assess the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from chromosome 22. Aberrant hypermethylation of the CpG island of the NF2 gene was also analyzed. The tumor size, the clinical growth index, and the proliferative activity assessed using the Ki-67 labeling index were evaluated. We found 18 mutations in 16 cases of 30 schwannomas (53%). The mutations included eight frameshift mutations, seven nonsense mutations, one in-frame deletion, one splicing donor site, and one missense mutation. Nine patients (30%) showed allelic loss. No patient had aberrant hypermethylation of the NF2 gene and correlation between NF2 genetic alterations and tumor behavior was not observed in this study. Conclusions/Significance The molecular genetic changes in sporadic VS identified here included mutations and allelic loss, but no aberrant hypermethylation of the NF2 gene was detected. In addition, no clear genotype/phenotype correlation was identified. Therefore, it is likely that other factors contribute to tumor formation and growth."

Importantly, the effects of S100 proteins on the biological behavior of CacyBP/SIP in gastric cancer remain unclear. Herein, we report the construction of eukaryotic expression vectors for wild-type CacyBP/SIP and a truncated mutant lacking the S100 protein binding domain (CacyBP/SIPΔS100). The expressions of the wild-type and truncated recombinant proteins were demonstrated by transfection of MKN45 gastric cancer cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated interaction between S100A6 and wild-type CacyBP/SIP in MKN45 cells. Removal of the S100 protein binding domain dramatically reduced the affinity of CacyBP/SIP for S100 proteins as indicated by reduced co-immunoprecipitation of S100A6 by CacyBP/SIPΔS100. The MTT assay, FACS assay, clonogenic assay and tumor xenograft experiment were performed to assess the effect of CacyBP/SIP on cell growth and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of CacyBP/SIP inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenesis of MKN45 gastric cancer cells; the proliferation and tumorigenesis rates were even further reduced by the expression of CacyBP/SIPΔS100. We also showed that S100 proteins negatively regulate CacyBP/SIP-mediated inhibition of gastric cancer cell proliferation, through an effect on β-catenin protein expression and transcriptional activation of Tcf/LEF. Although the underlying mechanism of action requires further investigation, this study provides new insight into the interaction between S100 proteins and CacyBP/SIP, which might enrich our knowledge of S100 proteins and be helpful for our understanding of the development of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2134897953,"We previously reported that RanBP9 binds low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and BACE1 and robustly increased Aβ generation in a variety of cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. To confirm the physiological/ pathological significance of this phenotype in vivo, we successfully generated transgenic mice overexpressing RanBP9 as well as RanBP9-null mice. Here we show that RanBP9 overexpression resulted in > 2-fold increase in Aβ40 levels as early as 4 mo of age. A sustained increase in Aβ40 levels was seen at 12 mo of age in both CHAPS-soluble and formic acid (FA)-soluble brain fractions. In addition, Aβ42 levels were also significantly increased in FA-soluble fractions at 12 mo of age. More important, increased Aβ levels were translated to increased deposition of amyloid plaques. In addition, RanBP9 overexpression significantly decreased the levels of synaptophysin and PSD-95 proteins. Conversely, RanBP9-null mice showed increased levels of synaptophysin, PSD-95, and drebrin A protein levels. Given that loss of synapses is the best pathological correlate of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased Aβ levels by RanBP9 observed in the present study provides compelling evidence that RanBP9 may indeed play a key role in the etiology of AD.

https://openalex.org/W2099186542,"Structural Biology (SB) techniques are particularly successful in solving virus structures. Taking advantage of the symmetries, a heavy averaging on the data of a large number of specimens, results in an accurate determination of the structure of the sample. However, these techniques do not provide true single molecule information of viruses in physiological conditions. To answer many fundamental questions about the quickly expanding physical virology it is important to develop techniques with the capability to reach nanometer scale resolution on both structure and physical properties of individual molecules in physiological conditions. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) fulfills these requirements providing images of individual virus particles under physiological conditions, along with the characterization of a variety of properties including local adhesion and elasticity. Using conventional AFM modes is easy to obtain molecular resolved images on flat samples, such as the purple membrane, or large viruses as the Giant Mimivirus. On the contrary, small virus particles (25-50 nm) cannot be easily imaged. In this work we present Frequency Modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) working in physiological conditions as an accurate and powerful technique to study virus particles. Our interpretation of the so called ""dissipation channel"" in terms of mechanical properties allows us to provide maps where the local stiffness of the virus particles are resolved with nanometer resolution. FM-AFM can be considered as a non invasive technique since, as we demonstrate in our experiments, we are able to sense forces down to 20 pN. The methodology reported here is of general interest since it can be applied to a large number of biological samples. In particular, the importance of mechanical interactions is a hot topic in different aspects of biotechnology ranging from protein folding to stem cells differentiation where conventional AFM modes are already being used."

We identified both cellular and soluble biomarkers in the pleural fluid that allowed highly accurate diagnosis of pleural TB compared to peripheral blood markers. Multi-plex cytokine analysis on unstimulated pleural fluid showed that IP-10 resulted in a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 9.6 versus 2.8 for IFN-γ; a combination of IP-10, IL-6 and IL-10 resulted in an AUC of 0.96 and positive LR of 10. A striking finding was the significantly higher proportion of PPD-specific IFN-γ+TNF-α+ cell population (PPD-IGTA) in the pleural fluid compared to peripheral blood of TB subjects. Presence of this pleural PPD-IGTA population resulted in 95% correct classification of pleural TB disease with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100%. These data suggest that analysis of the site of infection provides superior diagnostic accuracy compared to peripheral blood for pleural TB, likely due to the sequestration of effector cells at this acute stage of disease."

Recently, a functional polymorphism (-31G>C, rs9904341) in the promoter of survivin has been shown to influence its expression and confer susceptibility to different types of cancer. The present study was aimed to investigate whether the polymorphism also influences susceptibility and progression of renal cell cancer (RCC) in a Chinese population.We genotyped this polymorphism using the TaqMan assay in a case-control study comprised of 710 RCC patients and 760 controls. The logistic regression was used to assess the genetic association with occurrence and progression of RCC.Compared with the genotypes containing G allele (GG and GC), we found a statistically significant increased occurrence of RCC associated with the CC genotype [P = 0.006, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-1.76]. The polymorphism was associated with risk of developing advanced stage (OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.34-3.07) and moderately differentiated (OR = 1.75; 95%CI = 1.20-2.54) RCC. Furthermore, the patients carrying the CC genotype had a significantly greater prevalence of high clinical stage disease (P(trend) = 0.003). Similar results were also observed when we restricted the analysis to clear cell RCC, a major histological type of RCC.Our results suggest that the functional -31G>C polymorphism in the promoter of survivin may influence the susceptibility and progression of RCC in the Chinese population.

https://openalex.org/W2014163671,"Although the protective effect of transient ureteral obstruction (UO) prior to ischemia on subsequent renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been documented, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be understood. We showed in the current study that 24 h of UO led to renal tubular hypoxia in the ipsilateral kidney in mice, with the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α, which lasted for a week after the release of UO. To address the functions of HIF-2α in UO-mediated protection of renal IRI, we utilized the Mx-Cre/loxP recombination system to knock out target genes. Inactivation of HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α blunted the renal protective effects of UO, as demonstrated by much higher serum creatinine level and severer histological damage. UO failed to prevent postischemic neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis induction in HIF-2α knockout mice, which also diminished the postobstructive up-regulation of the protective molecule, heat shock protein (HSP)-27. The renal protective effects of UO were associated with the improvement of the postischemic recovery of intra-renal microvascular blood flow, which was also dependent on the activation of HIF-2α. Our results demonstrated that UO protected the kidney via activation of HIF-2α, which reduced tubular damages via preservation of adequate renal microvascular perfusion after ischemia. Thus, preconditional HIF-2α activation might serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic acute renal failure."
https://openalex.org/W2019824820,"Background Recently low dose organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been strongly linked to various chronic diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Both field and animal studies have suggested a possibility that persistent lipophilic chemicals like OC pesticides can cause vitamin D deficiency, but there have been no human studies of exposure to any chemical as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency. This study was performed to examine if serum concentrations of OC pesticides were associated with serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the U.S. general population. Methodology/Principal Findings Cross-sectional associations of serum OC pesticides with serum 25(OH)D were investigated in 1,275 subjects aged ≥20 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES), 2003–2004. We selected 7 OC pesticides detectable in ≥80% of participants. Among the 7 OC pesticides, p,p′-DDT (β = −0.022, P<0.01), p,p′-DDE (β = −0.018, P = 0.04), and β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β = −0.022, P = 0.02) showed significant inverse associations with serum 25(OH)D levels. When study subjects were stratified by age, race, and the presence of various chronic diseases, p,p′-DDT showed consistent inverse associations in all subgroups, although stronger associations tended to be observed among subjects with old age, white race, or chronic diseases. Conclusion/Significance The current study suggests that the background exposure to some OC pesticides leads to vitamin D deficiency in human. Considering the importance of vitamin D deficiency in the development of chronic diseases, chemical exposure as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency should be evaluated in prospective and experimental studies."

It is a 53-residue protein that tightly binds to the M14A subfamily of carboxypeptidases (traditionally known as pancreatic-like carboxypeptidases). It displays an inhibition constant (Ki) in the picomolar range against several MCPs belonging to the abovementioned subfamily: bovine carboxypeptidase A1 (bCPA1), human CPA1 (hCPA1), and human carboxypeptidase A4 (hCPA4; which has been structurally characterized in this work). Such Ki values are 3 orders of magnitude lower than for other known exogenous protein inhibitors of carboxypeptidases (4.Hass G.M. Nau H. Biemann K. Grahn D.T. Ericsson L.H. Neurath H.

A common feature of all of these protein inhibitors is their small size (39–75 residues) and their stabilization by several disulfide bridges. In all cases, the inhibition relies on the interaction of the C-terminal tail with the active site groove of the carboxypeptidase in a mechanism that mimics substrate binding (8.Rees D.C.

Although there are neither sequence nor three-dimensional structure similarities between the main body of these inhibitors, they all have effects on the key residues for the activity of the enzyme. Remarkably, a protein carboxypeptidase inhibitor for humans, latexin, which is the only endogenous inhibitor isolated so far, displays a different mode of action, in a way reminiscent of the interaction of the prodomain with the carboxypeptidase, covering the active site of the enzyme (11.Pallarès I.

NvCI displays a different protein fold, and its interface with hCPA4 has been analyzed in detail and compared with the few reported structures of exogenous MCP inhibitors to rationally explain its exceptional ability (picomolar range) to inhibit certain MCPs.DISCUSSIONThe few reports that appeared in the last decade on the structure-function relationships of MCP inhibitors of exogenous origin (4.Hass G.M.

A mutagenesis analysis.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1502-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicated that they share a similar substrate-like mechanism of inhibition. Thus, they suffer a trimming of their C termini, behaving as competitive tight-binding inhibitors, mimicking the interaction of a peptide substrate with the active site of the enzyme, and requiring only the S1 and S2 subsites to be covered to fully inhibit the enzyme. Thus, even though these exogenous MCP inhibitors are isolated from evolutionarily distant organisms, this is a good example of convergent evolution dictated by the architecture of the active site of the enzyme. However, the structure of NvCI with hCPA4 indicates that the trimming action is absent (i.e. a shorter two-residue tail is sufficient) and that the S3 subsite is also implicated, in addition to S1 and S2, in promoting stronger inhibition in the picomolar range.In addition to this primary and essential C-terminal interaction, MCP inhibitors possess a second interface (distant from active site) that covers different regions of the carboxypeptidase and confers stability to the complex formation (Fig. 4). The NvCI interface with hCPA4 is quite extended in comparison with the other known inhibitors, covering a total of 1875 Å2. In other known cases, for the protein inhibitors from leech (LCI), potato (PCI), and the Ascaris worm (ACI), the interface of CPA-like enzymes is clearly smaller: 1509, 1241, and 1426 Å2, respectively. An exception would be the two-domain (exosite-behaving) tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI), which is the largest and covers a total interface of 2108 Å2. Although the secondary interaction surface provided by all inhibitors is distinct, there is only a single way of positioning the C-terminal tail in the active site of the enzyme.As mentioned above, the main body of each of the exogenous carboxypeptidase inhibitors has a completely different three-dimensional structure, with the C-terminal tail as the only similar structural motif (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. 4). The short C-terminal tail of NvCI, considered from the third disulfide bridge and formed by only two residues, Tyr-52 and Ala-53, is sufficient for a tight-binding inhibition of several types of carboxypeptidases. Interestingly, as mentioned above, in NvCI, the P3 position (Cys-51) also participates in the binding with a double main chain hydrogen bond with Glu-163 of hCPA4, presumably increasing the affinity and lowering the Ki value for NvCI, which is in the picomolar range, 3 orders of magnitude lower than the other inhibitors. This fact suggests a reason for the strongest inhibitor being NvCI in comparison with the other described proteinaceous inhibitors of MCPs.The different ways that nature acts along evolution to inhibit carboxypeptidases can be used as a valuable tool to elucidate the determinants for a general mechanism of inhibition of MCPs. In general, these proteases are secreted and their enzymatic action takes place normally in the extracellular space, except in the case of a novel subfamily of cytosolic carboxypeptidases, which have been recently described and are presumably involved in tubulin processing (30.Rodríguez de la Vega M. Sevilla R.G. Hermoso A. Lorenzo J. Tanco S. Diez A. Fricker L.D. Bautista J.M. Avilés F.X.

Knowledge of the control of interference with those mechanisms, by rational structure-based or other drug design approaches, can be potentially of great interest, especially for biotechnical and biomedical industrial purposes. In addition, the expansion of this strategy to the variety of forms found in the very diverse phyla of invertebrates, including marine organisms such as N. versicolor, is revealing a rich source of discovery for novel scaffolds and lead compounds.

Their activity normally takes place outside of the cell, by removing the C-terminal residues of polypeptidic chains. The activity of MCPs can be regulated in distinct organisms through the action of exogenous carboxypeptidase inhibitors (1.Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. Fricker L.D. Messerschimidt A. Bode W. Cygler M.

Their activity normally takes place outside of the cell, by removing the C-terminal residues of polypeptidic chains.

We have recently isolated a novel MCP inhibitor (NvCI) from the marine snail Nerita versicolor. It is a 53-residue protein that tightly binds to the M14A subfamily of carboxypeptidases (traditionally known as pancreatic-like carboxypeptidases). It displays an inhibition constant (Ki) in the picomolar range against several MCPs belonging to the abovementioned subfamily: bovine carboxypeptidase A1 (bCPA1), human CPA1 (hCPA1), and human carboxypeptidase A4 (hCPA4; which has been structurally characterized in this work). Such Ki values are 3 orders of magnitude lower than for other known exogenous protein inhibitors of carboxypeptidases (4.Hass G.M. Nau H. Biemann K. Grahn D.T. Ericsson L.H. Neurath H.

A common feature of all of these protein inhibitors is their small size (39–75 residues) and their stabilization by several disulfide bridges. In all cases, the inhibition relies on the interaction of the C-terminal tail with the active site groove of the carboxypeptidase in a mechanism that mimics substrate binding (8.Rees D.C.

Although there are neither sequence nor three-dimensional structure similarities between the main body of these inhibitors, they all have effects on the key residues for the activity of the enzyme. Remarkably, a protein carboxypeptidase inhibitor for humans, latexin, which is the only endogenous inhibitor isolated so far, displays a different mode of action, in a way reminiscent of the interaction of the prodomain with the carboxypeptidase, covering the active site of the enzyme (11.Pallarès I.

The marine Caribbean fauna is characterized by its richness and diversity, which make it a very attractive natural source for the identification of novel biomolecules with biological and biomedical interests. The potential of marine invertebrates as a source of these biomolecules has been reported in previous studies, particularly those focused on endoproteases such as serine and cysteine proteases and their inhibitors, some with exceptional structural and functional properties (2.Arolas J.L.

A mutagenesis analysis.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1502-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicated that they share a similar substrate-like mechanism of inhibition. Thus, they suffer a trimming of their C termini, behaving as competitive tight-binding inhibitors, mimicking the interaction of a peptide substrate with the active site of the enzyme, and requiring only the S1 and S2 subsites to be covered to fully inhibit the enzyme. Thus, even though these exogenous MCP inhibitors are isolated from evolutionarily distant organisms, this is a good example of convergent evolution dictated by the architecture of the active site of the enzyme. However, the structure of NvCI with hCPA4 indicates that the trimming action is absent (i.e. a shorter two-residue tail is sufficient) and that the S3 subsite is also implicated, in addition to S1 and S2, in promoting stronger inhibition in the picomolar range.In addition to this primary and essential C-terminal interaction, MCP inhibitors possess a second interface (distant from active site) that covers different regions of the carboxypeptidase and confers stability to the complex formation (Fig. 4). The NvCI interface with hCPA4 is quite extended in comparison with the other known inhibitors, covering a total of 1875 Å2. In other known cases, for the protein inhibitors from leech (LCI), potato (PCI), and the Ascaris worm (ACI), the interface of CPA-like enzymes is clearly smaller: 1509, 1241, and 1426 Å2, respectively. An exception would be the two-domain (exosite-behaving) tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor (TCI), which is the largest and covers a total interface of 2108 Å2. Although the secondary interaction surface provided by all inhibitors is distinct, there is only a single way of positioning the C-terminal tail in the active site of the enzyme.As mentioned above, the main body of each of the exogenous carboxypeptidase inhibitors has a completely different three-dimensional structure, with the C-terminal tail as the only similar structural motif (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. 4). The short C-terminal tail of NvCI, considered from the third disulfide bridge and formed by only two residues, Tyr-52 and Ala-53, is sufficient for a tight-binding inhibition of several types of carboxypeptidases. Interestingly, as mentioned above, in NvCI, the P3 position (Cys-51) also participates in the binding with a double main chain hydrogen bond with Glu-163 of hCPA4, presumably increasing the affinity and lowering the Ki value for NvCI, which is in the picomolar range, 3 orders of magnitude lower than the other inhibitors. This fact suggests a reason for the strongest inhibitor being NvCI in comparison with the other described proteinaceous inhibitors of MCPs.The different ways that nature acts along evolution to inhibit carboxypeptidases can be used as a valuable tool to elucidate the determinants for a general mechanism of inhibition of MCPs. In general, these proteases are secreted and their enzymatic action takes place normally in the extracellular space, except in the case of a novel subfamily of cytosolic carboxypeptidases, which have been recently described and are presumably involved in tubulin processing (30.Rodríguez de la Vega M.

https://openalex.org/W2015934121,"Introduction Despite the excellent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive action of glucocorticoids (GCs), their use for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) still carries significant risks in terms of frequently occurring severe side effects, such as the impairment of intestinal tissue repair. The recently-introduced selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists (SEGRAs) offer anti-inflammatory action comparable to that of common GCs, but with a reduced side effect profile. Methods The in vitro effects of the non-steroidal SEGRAs Compound A (CpdA) and ZK216348, were investigated in intestinal epithelial cells and compared to those of Dexamethasone (Dex). GR translocation was shown by immunfluorescence and Western blot analysis. Trans-repressive effects were studied by means of NF-κB/p65 activity and IL-8 levels, trans-activation potency by reporter gene assay. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis of cells exposed to SEGRAs. The effects on IEC-6 and HaCaT cell restitution were determined using an in vitro wound healing model, cell proliferation by BrdU assay. In addition, influences on the TGF-β- or EGF/ERK1/2/MAPK-pathway were evaluated by reporter gene assay, Western blot and qPCR analysis. Results Dex, CpdA and ZK216348 were found to be functional GR agonists. In terms of trans-repression, CpdA and ZK216348 effectively inhibited NF-κB activity and IL-8 secretion, but showed less trans-activation potency. Furthermore, unlike SEGRAs, Dex caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell restitution with no effect on cell proliferation. These differences in epithelial restitution were TGF-β-independent but Dex inhibited the EGF/ERK1/2/MAPK-pathway important for intestinal epithelial wound healing by induction of MKP-1 and Annexin-1 which was not affected by CpdA or ZK216348. Conclusion Collectively, our results indicate that, while their anti-inflammatory activity is comparable to Dex, SEGRAs show fewer side effects with respect to wound healing. The fact that SEGRAs did not have a similar effect on cell restitution might be due to a different modulation of EGF/ERK1/2 MAPK signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1999357270,"Proprotein convertase 7 (PC7) is a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which is involved in the endoproteolysis of a variety of precursor proteins. Under steady state conditions, PC7 is mainly localized in the trans-Golgi network, but a small fraction is found at the cell surface. So far, no sorting signals for membrane trafficking have been identified in PC7. In this study, we have examined the internalization of PC7 from the plasma membrane. Our results show that internalization of PC7 is mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles. After inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis using hypertonic conditions or the small molecule inhibitor, Pitstop 2, PC7 accumulated at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, PC7 was present in isolated clathrin-coated vesicles. To determine the internalization motif, constructs were generated in which parts of the N and C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail of PC7 were deleted, and chimeric proteins were constructed consisting of the luminal and transmembrane domains of Tac (CD25) and parts of the cytoplasmic domain of PC7. Antibody uptake experiments as well as surface biotinylation experiments demonstrated that the region between Ala(713) and Cys(726) in the cytoplasmic domain of PC7 is essential and sufficient for the internalization of PC7 but not for trans-Golgi network localization. Individual amino acids in this region were substituted with alanine, which identified Pro, Leu, and Cys as the essential amino acids. In conclusion, internalization of PC7 depends on a short transferable sequence in the cytoplasmic tail, which contains the three crucial amino acids PLC."
https://openalex.org/W2031488973,"Background Many cases of Cutaneous Larva Migrans (CLM) have been observed among devotees, during and immediately after the annual festival at the Nallur Hindu temple in Jaffna. Objective To ascertain the risk factors associated with infestation and devotees' knowledge and practices regarding the condition. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross-sectional study using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and observation was conducted in August 2010. Out of 200 selected devotees 194(97%) responded. Soil and dog faecal samples were collected from the temple premises and examined for the presence of nematode larva and egg respectively. Among 194 male respondents, 58.2%(95% CI: 51.2%–65.0%) had lesions of CLM. One hundred and thirty (67%) respondents performed the ritual everyday; whereas 33% did so on special days. One hundred and twelve (57.7%) participants performed the ritual before 5.00am and remaining 42.3% performed after 5.00am. Among the participants, 77(36.7%) had the similar condition in previous years. One hundred and fifty seven (80.9%) were aware about this disease and 52(27%) devotees adopted some kind of precautionary measures. Bivariate analysis showed significant association between occurrence of CLM lesions and frequency of performing the ritual (p<0.001, OR-15.1; 95% CI:7.2-32.0), the timing of ritual performance (p = 0.022, OR-1.96; 95% CI:1.10–3.52), similar condition in previous year (p<0.001, OR-6.83; 95% CI: 3.39–13.76) and previous awareness of the condition (p = 0.005; OR-0.59;95% CI:0.43–0.82). Multivariate analysis showed that the frequency of ritual performance (OR-11.75; 95% CI 5.37–25.74) and similar conditions in previous years (OR-4.71; 95% CI: 2.14–10.39) were the independent risk factors. Two of the 20 soil samples were positive for the nematode larvae and three out of five dog faeces were positive for hookworm eggs. Conclusions/Significance Deworming the stray dogs around the temple premises combined with the awareness programs among the public may be the effective and feasible precautionary measures to control similar epidemics in future."
https://openalex.org/W1973385507,"The early African experience in the Americas is marked by the transatlantic slave trade from ∼1619 to 1850 and the rise of the plantation system. The origins of enslaved Africans were largely dependent on European preferences as well as the availability of potential laborers within Africa. Rice production was a key industry of many colonial South Carolina low country plantations. Accordingly, rice plantations owners within South Carolina often requested enslaved Africans from the so-called ""Grain Coast"" of western Africa (Senegal to Sierra Leone). Studies on the African origins of the enslaved within other regions of the Americas have been limited. To address the issue of origins of people of African descent within the Americas and understand more about the genetic heterogeneity present within Africa and the African Diaspora, we typed Y chromosome specific markers in 1,319 men consisting of 508 west and central Africans (from 12 populations), 188 Caribbeans (from 2 islands), 532 African Americans (AAs from Washington, DC and Columbia, SC), and 91 European Americans. Principal component and admixture analyses provide support for significant Grain Coast ancestry among African American men in South Carolina. AA men from DC and the Caribbean showed a closer affinity to populations from the Bight of Biafra. Furthermore, 30-40% of the paternal lineages in African descent populations in the Americas are of European ancestry. Diverse west African ancestries and sex-biased gene flow from EAs has contributed greatly to the genetic heterogeneity of African populations throughout the Americas and has significant implications for gene mapping efforts in these populations."
https://openalex.org/W2018199151,"Neuronal degeneration and the deterioration of neuronal communication lie at the origin of many neuronal disorders, and there have been major efforts to develop cell replacement therapies for treating such diseases. One challenge, however, is that differentiated cells are challenging to transplant due to their sensitivity both to being uprooted from their cell culture growth support and to shear forces inherent in the implantation process. Here, we describe an approach to address these problems. We demonstrate that rat hippocampal neurons can be grown on colloidal particles or beads, matured and even transfected in vitro, and subsequently transplanted while adhered to the beads into the young adult rat hippocampus. The transplanted cells have a 76% cell survival rate one week post-surgery. At this time, most transplanted neurons have left their beads and elaborated long processes, similar to the host neurons. Additionally, the transplanted cells distribute uniformly across the host hippocampus. Expression of a fluorescent protein and the light-gated glutamate receptor in the transplanted neurons enabled them to be driven to fire by remote optical control. At 1-2 weeks after transplantation, calcium imaging of host brain slice shows that optical excitation of the transplanted neurons elicits activity in nearby host neurons, indicating the formation of functional transplant-host synaptic connections. After 6 months, the transplanted cell survival and overall cell distribution remained unchanged, suggesting that cells are functionally integrated. This approach, which could be extended to other cell classes such as neural stem cells and other regions of the brain, offers promising prospects for neuronal circuit repair via transplantation of in vitro differentiated, genetically engineered neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2069411196,"Babesiosis (formerly known as piroplasmosis) is a tick-borne disease caused by the intraerythrocytic development of protozoa parasites from the genus Babesia. Like Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of malaria, or Toxoplasma gondii, responsible for human toxoplasmosis, Babesia belongs to the Apicomplexa family. Babesia canis is the agent of the canine babesiosis in Europe. Clinical manifestations of this disease range from mild to severe and possibly lead to death by multiple organ failure. The identification and characterization of parasite surface proteins represent major goals, both for the understanding of the Apicomplexa invasion process and for the vaccine potential of such antigens. Indeed, we have already shown that Bd37, the major antigenic adhesion protein from Babesia divergens, the agent of bovine babesiosis, was able to induce complete protection against various parasite strains. The major merozoite surface antigens of Babesia canis have been described as a 28-kDa membrane protein family, anchored at the surface of the merozoite. Here, we demonstrate that Bc28.1, a major member of this multigenic family, is expressed at high levels at the surface of the merozoite. This protein is also found in the parasite in vitro culture supernatants, which are the basis of effective vaccines against canine babesiosis. We defined the erythrocyte binding function of Bc28.1 and determined its high resolution solution structure using NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, although these proteins are thought to play a similar role in the adhesion process, the structure of Bc28.1 from B. canis appears unrelated to the previously published structure of Bd37 from B. divergens. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments also suggest that the mechanism of the interaction with the erythrocyte membrane could be different for the two proteins. The resolution of the structure of Bc28 represents a milestone for the characterization of the parasite erythrocyte binding and its interaction with the host immune system.

The resolution of the structure of Bc28 represents a milestone for the characterization of the parasite erythrocyte binding and its interaction with the host immune system. The phylum Apicomplexa, a large group of single-celled eukaryotic intracellular parasites, includes some of the most important pathogenic parasites of humans and animals, the deadliest of which is the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for one million human deaths per year and with almost half of the human population at risk of contracting malaria. No vaccine currently exists against P. falciparum, and parasites are becoming increasingly resistant to pharmaceuticals. This is also true for other pathogenic Apicomplexa, such as Toxoplasma, which, together with Plasmodium, challenge global human health improvement programs, and coccidiosis and babesiosis are detrimental for agri-business in both industrialized and developing countries. Babesiosis (formerly known as piroplasmosis) is a tick-borne disease caused by the intraerythrocytic development of an Apicomplexa from the Babesia genus. Hemolytic anemia due to parasite development leads to major symptoms, such as hemoglobinury, fever, asthenia, and renal failure. Among other animals, domestic dogs are susceptible to several species, mainly from the so-called large Babesia (in contrast to smaller Babesia, such as Babesia gibsoni): Babesia canis in Europe, Babesia rossi in Africa, and Babesia vogeli in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Clinical manifestations range from mild to severe and can lead to death by multiple organ failure (1.Irwin P.J. Canine babesiosis. From molecular taxonomy to control.Parasit. Vectors. 2009; 26: S4Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The search for an efficient recombinant vaccine against Apicomplexa parasites requires the identification of high potential antigen candidates. Such antigens are molecules originating from parasites, which could be targeted by the immune system to at least limit the parasitic infection and its consequences. One of the methods for finding antigen candidates relies on the identification of molecules recognized by the immune system of individuals that recovered from parasitic infection. In another approach, target molecules can be chosen from those that are involved in critical life processes of the parasite; invasion of the host cell by the parasite represents one such process. Because Apicomplexa are intracellular parasites, the most accessible antigens are found at the surface of transitory extracellular forms like merozoites, after host cell egress and before or during the invasion of the next host cell. Targeting the merozoite surface by recombinant vaccines has been proved to be relatively efficient against malaria (2.Fowkes F.J. Richards J.S. Simpson J.A. Beeson J.G. The relationship between anti-merozoite antibodies and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. A systematic review and meta-analysis.PLoS Med. 2010; 7: e1000218Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Adhesive proteins at the surface of Apicomplexa infective stages are involved in the first step of host cell invasion. Some of these interacting proteins contain domains conserved through a large panel of organisms, ranging from bacteria to mammals, as well as parasite-specific architecture. In several parasites, lineage-specific expansion of some of these interacting domains had led to large protein repertoires, as exemplified by the SAG1 (surface antigen 1) family in Toxoplasma gondii or the DBL (Duffy binding-like) domain in P. falciparum (3.Anantharaman V.

As in many other parasites, the surface of Apicomplexa infective stages is coated mainly by GPI 4The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.-anchored proteins (4.von Itzstein M.

Although the surface of Toxoplasma tachyzoites is mainly coated by proteins from the SRS family (7.Jung C. Lee C.Y. Grigg M.E. The SRS superfamily of Toxoplasma surface proteins.Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and SUSA family (8.Pollard A.M. Onatolu K.N. Hiller L. Haldar K. Knoll L.J.

In contrast to the high diversity of GPI-anchored proteins found in Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, ranging from 20 to more than 150 kDa, and generated by a high copy number multigenic family, the GPI-anchored protein repertoire of Babesia appears to be less complex. In the recently sequenced genome of Babesia bovis, only the five genes of the already known variable merozoite surface antigen were found (6.Brayton K.A. Lau A.O. Herndon D.R. Hannick L. Kappmeyer L.S. Berens S.J. Bidwell S.L. Brown W.C. Crabtree J. Fadrosh D. Feldblum T. Forberger H.A. Haas B.J. Howell J.M. Khouri H. Koo H. Mann D.J. Norimine J. Paulsen I.T. Radune D. Ren Q.

Genome sequence of Babesia bovis and comparative analysis of apicomplexan hemoprotozoa.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1401-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In B. canis and Babesia divergens, in the absence of genomic data, only the small erythrocyte-binding protein Bc28 and Bd37 families are currently known (10.Carcy B. Précigout E. Schetters T. Gorenflot A. Genetic basis for GPI-anchor merozoite surface antigen polymorphism of Babesia and resulting antigenic diversity.Vet. Parasitol. 2006; 138: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that immunization with recombinant Bd37, the major antigenic adhesion GPI-anchored protein from B. divergens, was able to induce complete protection against various parasite polymorphic strains (11.Delbecq S. Hadj-Kaddour K. Randazzo S. Kleuskens J. Schetters T. Gorenflot A. Précigout E. Hydrophobic moieties in recombinant proteins are crucial to generate efficient saponin-based vaccine against Apicomplexan Babesia divergens.Vaccine. 2006; 24: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The intraerythrocytic protozoa B. divergens is the agent of bovine babesiosis in Europe. We previously solved the solution structure of this erythrocyte-binding protein. It suggests that conformational plasticity could be functionally and/or immunologically important (12.Delbecq S. Auguin D. Yang Y.S. Löhr F. Arold S. Schetters T. Précigout E. Gorenflot A. Roumestand C. The solution structure of the adhesion protein Bd37 from Babesia divergens reveals structural homology with eukaryotic proteins involved in membrane trafficking.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In an attempt to find Bd37 homologues in B. canis, amplifications by low specificity PCR using Bd37-derived primers were performed on parasite DNA, leading to the identification of the Bc28 protein family. These proteins are in the 28 kDa range and do not show any clear sequence homology with the Bd37 protein family (in which currently two members were identified), suggesting structural divergence (10.Carcy B. Précigout E. Schetters T. Gorenflot A. Genetic basis for GPI-anchor merozoite surface antigen polymorphism of Babesia and resulting antigenic diversity.Vet. Parasitol. 2006; 138: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the atomic structure as well as the erythrocyte binding function of Bc28.1 from B. canis, the major member of the Bc28 multigenic family. In agreement with the low sequence homology, our data reveal an apparently unrelated structure when compared with Bd37 from B. divergens, although the two proteins are thought to play a similar role in the two organisms. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that Bc28.1 and Bd37 might bind to the erythrocyte membrane through different mechanisms, at least in the early stages of the association. In vitro culture of B. canis strain A parasites was previously described, using erythrocytes from dogs housed in a dedicated facility (agreement B 34-175-17). Briefly, continuous cultures of parasites were performed in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% dog serum and 2% (packed cell volume) dog erythrocytes. Erythrocyte ghosts were obtained by freeze-thawing cycles followed by several washes of membranes with phosphate-buffered saline until hemoglobin has been removed. Ghosts were then boiled in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer. From a previous screen of monoclonal antibodies raised against purified merozoites from B. canis, 5Y.-S. Yang, B. Murciano, K. Moubri, P. Cibrelus, T. Schetters, A. Gorenflot, S. Delbecq, and C. Roumestand, unpublished data. the mAb 6C9 was selected as recognizing a 28-kDa merozoite surface antigen. The hybridoma secreting the 6C9 antibody was recloned by limiting dilution and expanded in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then transferred in a CELLine two-compartment bioreactor (Integra Biosciences) for large scale production in aseric conditions, and cell culture supernatant was harvested weekly, sterile-filtered, and frozen at −20 °C until use. B. canis parasites were cultivated in 24-well plates in 800 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% dog serum. Rabbit serum directed against Bc28.1 was added (10% volume) and the corresponding preimmune serum was used as a negative control. An unrelated serum (anti-BcVir15, 8%) previously shown to induce parasite growth inhibition was used as a positive control. The monoclonal 6C9 was purified using ion exchange chromatography and dialyzed against PBS. Purified mAb was added at 1 mg/ml to the culture, and an unrelated mAb produced in similar conditions was used as a control. Each culture was done in triplicate, and medium replacement with appropriate antibodies was done after 24 h of incubation. The parasitemia in each culture was assessed by thin blood smears after an additional 24 h of incubation. Infective B. canis merozoites have been purified using streptolysin O-mediated lysis of parasitized red blood cells followed by differential centrifugation. Starting from in vitro culture, dog erythrocytes were washed three times with RPMI 1640. The streptolysin O (La Technique Biologique) was added to the packed red blood cells at 0.025 units/μl, and then 8 volumes of RPMI 1640 was added to 1 volume of packed red blood cells. After 10 min at 37 °C, the cell suspension was centrifuged (10 min, 300 × g), and supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 1100 × g. The pellet contains purified, infective merozoites, whereas supernatant was called soluble fraction, which mainly represents the erythrocyte cytoplasm. Phase partitioning using Triton X-114 was performed essentially according to Bordier (13.Bordier C. Phase separation of integral membrane proteins in Triton X-114 solution.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were solubilized in 10 volumes of 2% precondensed Triton X-114 (Fluka) in Tris-buffered saline, and soluble fractions were brought to 2% Triton X-114 by the addition of 11.4% solution in TBS. After incubation on ice for 1 h, solutions were centrifuged at 13,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min, and supernatants were submitted to phase partitioning at 37 °C for 5 min. Detergent-enriched and aqueous phases were then separated by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min). Each phase was washed twice; solutions were adjusted to 2% Triton X-114 and submitted to phase partitioning. Finally, each phase was adjusted to 1% Triton X-114 and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C by anti-Bc28.1 rabbit serum. Erythrocytes ghosts were obtained by freeze-thawing cycles followed by several washes of membranes with phosphate-buffered saline until hemoglobin had been removed. Ghosts were then boiled in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer. Expression plasmid containing the coding sequence of equinatoxin II from Actinia equina (a kind gift from Dr. G. Anderluh, University of Ljubljana (Ljubljana, Slovenia)) was used to produce equinatoxin II in Escherichia coli. As described for P. falciparum (14.Jackson K.E. Spielmann T. Hanssen E. Adisa A. Separovic F. Dixon M.W. Trenholme K.R. Hawthorne P.L. Gardiner D.L. Gilberger T. Tilley L. Selective permeabilization of the host cell membrane of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells with streptolysin O and equinatoxin II.Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), erythrocytes parasitized by B. canis were lysed by incubation with 150 μg/ml equinatoxin II in PBS. After several washes in PBS (centrifugation for 5 min at 1200 × g), merozoite samples were treated with anti-Bc28.1 rabbit serum for 30 min in PBS and then with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). With other samples of the same batch, merozoite viability was assessed by incubation with 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate or propidium iodide. Live cells were then deposited between two microscopy slides and imaged with FITC, TRITC, and DAPI filter sets (Axioskop, Zeiss). After running in SDS-PAGE, the protein samples were transferred using semidry blotter onto nitrocellulose membranes, and membranes were then incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% non-fat dry milk). Duplicate membranes were incubated for 1 h either with mAb 6C9 supernatant (1:500 in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) or hybridoma culture medium at the same dilution, washed, and incubated with anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (West Pico supersignal substrate, Pierce) was added, and blots were analyzed using a Gnome CCD imager and GeneSnap software (Syngene). For immunofluorescence analysis, parasitized red blood cells from an in vitro culture of B. canis A were washed in RPMI 1640 and fixed on Teflon-coated slides by acetone/methanol (4:1) at −20 °C. Slides were incubated for 1 h with mAb 6C9 culture supernatant serially diluted in PBS in a wet chamber, washed, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) containing 10 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma), mounted with Citifluor, and observed with immersion oil (×100) on a fluorescence microscope with an FITC filter set (Axioskop, Zeiss). Images were captured with a digital camera fitted on the microscope. B. canis parasites were metabolically labeled in the presence of [35S]methionine, parasitized erythrocytes were washed three times in RPMI, and the packed cells were then lysed in 10 volumes of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 600 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.8). After 1 h on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble materials. The soluble fraction (50 μl) or culture supernatant (200 μl) was then mixed with 5 μl of serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C under agitation. A volume of 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50% slurry) was then added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature under agitation. Beads were then washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie staining, gels were dried in Amplify (GE Healthcare) and imaged using X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Dog erythrocytes (50 μl of packed cells) were washed three times with PBS and incubated with purified recombinant proteins (0.5 mg in 1 ml of PBS) for 1 h with rotations. Erythrocytes were then harvested by centrifugation (1800 × g, 3 min) and layered on silicon oil (d = 1.05, Sigma). After centrifugation (4000 × g, 3 min), supernatant and silicon oil were carefully removed, and bound proteins were eluted from erythrocytes using 50 μl of PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl. Experiments were done either with an increasing amount of erythrocytes (packed cell volume ranging from 10 to 100 μl) or an increasing amount of recombinant Bc28.1 protein (0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg in 1 ml of PBS). Unbound and bound proteins were then analyzed by Western blot using HRP-conjugated anti-His tag antibody (Qiagen) revealed with WestPico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The sequence coding for the predicted full-length recombinant Bc28.1 polypeptide (see Fig. 1; accession number CS019629) from Ser18 to Asp235 was cloned in pIVEX 2.4a (Roche Applied Science), which appends a N-terminal hexahistidine tag using primers Bc28.1FLNterFor (5′-cgcttaattaaacatatgaccagctgcactgaggatgagaaaagggatagtgtc-3′) and Bc28.1FLRev (5′-ttagttagttaccggatcccttaatccttcttacccttggctccagatatac-3′), which both contain sequences complementary to the destination vector and to the Bc28.1 coding sequence to allow assembly by splicing of overlap extension. The forward primers Bc28delC19For (5′-cgcttaattaaacatatgaccactgaggatgagaaaagggatagtgtc-3′) and Bc28delA32For (5′-cgcttaattaaacatatgaccgctacgtccgttgaagccagcttaaag-3′) were used in association with Bc28.1FLRev to build the ΔC19-Bc28.1 and Δ-Bc28.1 recombinant proteins (see Fig. 2), respectively. The proofreading thermostable DNA polymerase Phusion (Finnzymes) was used for all amplification in cloning procedures. The recombinant vector was transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein production. Bacteria were cultivated in minimum M9-based medium containing NH4Cl and glucose as the nitrogen and carbon source, respectively, isotopically enriched as needed (Eurisotop, St. Aubin, France). After cell growth and induction in an O2-controlled fermentor operated in fed batch at 37 °C, cells were harvested and frozen at −80 °C. Cells were lysed in binding buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) using a high pressure homogenizer at 1200 bars (Emulsiflex, Avestin). After the addition of polyethyleneimine (0.1%), centrifugation, and filtration, the clarified supernatant was loaded on a HisTrap column using AKTAExplorer, and the column was washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer containing 1 m NaCl and finally eluted in Tris 50 mm, pH 8.0, containing 400 mm imidazole. 15N and 15N/13C and protein samples were concentrated to 0.5 mm and desalted in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5.FIGURE 2Schematic description of the Bc28.1 sequence. Top, molecules found in the parasite. The gene coding for Bc28.1 displays no intron, as evidenced by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequence. The Bc28.1 is translated as a precursor protein containing both N- and C-terminal hydrophobic sequences (black boxes) predicted to be a signal peptide and a GPI anchor signal, respectively. Mature GPI-anchored Bc28.1 was found at the merozoite surface, whereas a soluble form of the protein, potentially without a GPI anchor, was found produced inside the parasite and secreted in the in vitro culture supernatant. The three last sequences correspond to recombinant proteins used in the present study. In all sequence schemes, the structured core of the protein (Ser32–Glu224) is represented as white boxes, and unstructured parts (Ser18–Ser38 and Glu224–Asp235) are shown as gray boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the examination of the electrostatic properties of the Bc28.1 protein surface, mutagenesis was performed to disrupt the large positive area on one face of Bc28.1. The residues His128, Arg129, Lys137, and Lys195 were changed either by glutamate or alanine using primers HRKalaRev (5′-agacaattccgccgcagtgatagaaagcacgtagag), HRKalaFor (5′-agccttaagaatgcgatcgatgaatggaag), K195alaFor (5′-gcggatatgatttacattaacgacgctatg), and K195Rev (5′gtgggacaccaattcgttaaccactgttgc) to construct the Bc28.1HRKKAla mutant. The primers HRKgluFor (5′-agccttaagaatgaaatcgatgaatggaag), HRKgluRev (5′-agacaattcttcttcagtgatagaaagcacgtagag), K195gluFor (5′-gaagatatgatttacattaacgacgctatg), and K195Rev were used to construct the mutant Bc28.1HRKKGlu. Each primer was purified and phosphorylated at 5′ extremities (Sigma-Genosys). The plasmid coding for the full-length recombinant Bc28.1 protein was used as template. After a first round of amplification with a first primer couple, the plasmid template was digested by DpnI (10 units, 15 min at 37 °C before clean-up) (NucleoSpin Extract II, Macherey-Nagel). The PCR product was then self-ligated and transformed in DH5a. Clones containing mutated plasmids were then screened, and a second round of amplification was done with the second primer couple followed by the same procedure. After verification by sequencing, mutated plasmids coding for Bc28.1HRKKGlu and Bc28.1HRKKAla were transformed in BL21(DE3) for expression and purification. Before testing their adhesion properties, the structure integrity of the two mutants was checked using CD spectroscopy. NMR experiments were performed at 37 °C on Bruker AVANCE 500 (triple resonance) or 600 and 700 MHz (double resonance) spectrometers equipped with 5-mm Z-gradient 1H-13C-15N cryogenic probes. Backbone and Cβ resonance assignments were made using standard HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments (15.Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog.

HN and Hα assignments were confirmed using 1H,15N and 1H,13C NOESY-HSQC experiments (mixing time 100 ms) recorded on the 15N- or 15N,13C-labeled samples, respectively. The analysis of the aromatic and methyl regions of the spectrum was considerably facilitated by the analysis of two-dimensional NOESY (and TOCSY) experiments recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 950 MHz (with cryoprobe) spectrometer on an unlabeled 0.1 mm protein sample dissolved in deuterated buffer. 1H chemical shifts were directly referenced to the methyl resonance of DSS, whereas 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to the absolute frequency ratios 15N/1H = 0.101329118 and 13C/1H = 0.251449530. All NMR spectra were processed with GIFA (16.Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. Gifa version 4. A complete package for NMR data set processing.J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOE experiments were recorded on the Bruker AVANCE 700 spectrometer. Proton saturation was achieved by application of high power 120° pulses spaced at 20-ms intervals for 3 s prior to the first pulse on 15N (17.Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Backbone dynamics of proteins as studied by 15N inverse detected heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Application to staphylococcal nuclease.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). A relaxation delay equal to 6 s between each scan was used in order to obtain a complete relaxation of water magnetization and to reduce effects arising from amide proton exchange. Moreover, the two experiments with and without proton saturation were acquired in an interleaved manner, FID by FID. The 2164 assigned NOE peaks were classified into five categories (very strong (≤2.4 Å), strong (≤2.8 Å), medium (≤3.6 Å), weak (≤4.4 Å), or very weak (≤4.8 Å)). This set was completed with 341 φ and ψ dihedral angle restraints taken out from TALOS predictions (18.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. Protein backbone angle restraints from searching a database for chemical shift and sequence homology.J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The initial structures of Bc28 were calculated using the program CYANA (19.Güntert P. Automated NMR structure calculation with CYANA.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). A total of 100 structures were calculated at this stage. The 20 best structures (based on the final target penalty function values) were minimized with CNS 1.2 according the RECOORD procedure (20.Nederveen A.J. Doreleijers J.F. Vranken W. Miller Z.

This factor is highly expressed in postmitotic neurons in the fetal brain and may be involved in various biological steps, such as neurological and immunological processes. In this study, we globally characterized the transcriptional targets of MIBP1 and proteins that interact with MIBP1. Microarray hybridization followed by gene set enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in the pathways downstream of MYC, NF-κB, and TGF-β were down-regulated when HEK293 cells stably overexpressed MIBP1. In silico transcription factor binding site analysis of the promoter regions of these down-regulated genes showed that the NF-κB binding site was the most overrepresented. The up-regulation of genes known to be in the NF-κB pathway after the knockdown of endogenous MIBP1 in HT1080 cells supports the view that MIBP1 is a down-regulator of the NF-κB pathway. We also confirmed the binding of the MIBP1 to the NF-κB site. By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we detected O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase as a prominent binding partner of MIBP1. Analyses using deletion mutants revealed that a 154-amino acid region of MIBP1 was necessary for its O-GlcNAc transferase binding and O-GlcNAcylation. A luciferase reporter assay showed that NF-κB-responsive expression was repressed by MIBP1, and stronger repression by MIBP1 lacking the 154-amino acid region was observed. Our results indicate that the primary effect of MIBP1 expression is the down-regulation of the NF-κB pathway and that this effect is attenuated by O-GlcNAc signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2048270881,"The development of efficient anti-cancer therapy has been a topic of intense interest for several decades. Combined administration of certain molecules and immune cells has been shown to be an effective form of anti-cancer therapy. Here, we examined the effects of administering an immune stimulating peptide (WKYMVm), 5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU), and mature dendritic cells (mDCs) against heterotopic cancer animal model. Administration of the triple combination strongly reduced tumor volume in CT-26-inoculated heterotopic cancer animal model. The induced anti-tumor activity was well correlated with FAS expression, caspase-3 activation, and cancer cell apoptosis. The triple combination treatment caused recruitment of CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells into the tumor. The production of two cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-12, were strongly stimulated by administration of the triple combination. Depletion of CD8 T lymphocytes or NK cells by administration of anti-CD8 or anti-asialoGM1 antibody inhibited the anti-tumor activity and cytokine production of the triple combination. The triple combination strongly inhibited metastasis of colon cancer cells in a heterotopic cancer animal model as well as in a metastatic cancer animal model, and enhanced the survival rate of the mice model. Adoptive transfer of CD8 T lymphocytes and NK cells further increased the survival rate. Taken together, we suggest that the use of triple combination therapy of WKYMVm, 5-FU, and mDCs may have implications in solid tumor and metastasis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1987500319,"The era of personalized medicine for cancer therapeutics has taken an important step forward in making accurate prognoses for individual patients with the adoption of high-throughput microarray technology. However, microarray technology in cancer diagnosis or prognosis has been primarily used for the statistical evaluation of patient populations, and thus excludes inter-individual variability and patient-specific predictions. Here we propose a metric called clinical confidence that serves as a measure of prognostic reliability to facilitate the shift from population-wide to personalized cancer prognosis using microarray-based predictive models. The performance of sample-based models predicted with different clinical confidences was evaluated and compared systematically using three large clinical datasets studying the following cancers: breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and neuroblastoma. Survival curves for patients, with different confidences, were also delineated. The results show that the clinical confidence metric separates patients with different prediction accuracies and survival times. Samples with high clinical confidence were likely to have accurate prognoses from predictive models. Moreover, patients with high clinical confidence would be expected to live for a notably longer or shorter time if their prognosis was good or grim based on the models, respectively. We conclude that clinical confidence could serve as a beneficial metric for personalized cancer prognosis prediction utilizing microarrays. Ascribing a confidence level to prognosis with the clinical confidence metric provides the clinician an objective, personalized basis for decisions, such as choosing the severity of the treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1995400967,"Dominant-negative mutants of class II transactivator (mCIITAs) with N-terminal depletion have been used to repress the transcription of class II genes in xenotransplantation. Here, we report that mCIITA overexpressing myeloid cell line Ana-1 (Ana-1-mCIITA) derived from a C57BL/6 mouse was able to down-regulate the MHC class II expression and reverse immune responses from Th1 (IL-2+IFN-γ+STAT4+) to Th2 (IL-4+IL-5+IL-10+IL-13+STAT6+) when cocultured with T cells. Mechanism analysis indicated that the mCIITA protein is able to initiate a NOD-like receptor-related signaling pathway via binding of the cytoplasmic Nod2 protein, which was followed by activating RIP2, caspase 1, and IKK-α/β. This ensures the expression of the genes encoding the cytokines IL-33, IL-1β, and TNF-α; however, only the highly expressed IL-33 is responsible for inducing the type 2 response, with a skewed Th2 cytokine secretion (IL-4+IL-5+IL-10+IL-13+IL-2−IFN-γ−), which was completely prevented by the deactivation of the Nod2 gene with siRNA or by the blockage of the IL-33-related signaling using the mAb ST2L against the IL-33 receptor. mCIITA-mediated Th2 conversion was also successfully induced in vivo in a mCIITA-transgenic C57BL/6 mouse model. These results indicate that the Th1/Th2 balance could be regulated by an N terminus-depleted CIITA molecule via NOD-like receptor-related signaling, a property valuable for disease control, especially for inducing transplantation tolerance via the repression of class II expression and the attenuation of a Th1-dominant response.
