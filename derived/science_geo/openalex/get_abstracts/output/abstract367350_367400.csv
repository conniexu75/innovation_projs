https://openalex.org/W2104806799,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical roles in the regulation of gene expression; however, as miRNA activity requires base pairing with only 6-8 nucleotides of messenger RNA, predicting target mRNAs is a major challenge. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) has identified functional protein-RNA interaction sites. Here we use HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native argonaute (Ago, also called Eif2c) protein-RNA complexes in mouse brain. This produced two simultaneous data sets-Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites-that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify interaction sites between miRNA and target mRNA. We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain. Ago HITS-CLIP provides a general platform for exploring the specificity and range of miRNA action in vivo, and identifies precise sequences for targeting clinically relevant miRNA-mRNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2150904790,"Despite the successes of genomics, little is known about how genetic information produces complex organisms. A look at the crucial functional elements of fly and worm genomes could change that. The National Human Genome Research Institute's modENCODE project (the model organism ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) was set up in 2007 with the goal of identifying all the sequence-based functional elements in the genomes of two important experimental organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Armed with modENCODE data, geneticists will be able to undertake the comprehensive molecular studies of regulatory networks that hold the key to how complex multicellular organisms arise from the list of instructions coded in the genome. In this issue, modENCODE team members outline their plan of campaign. Data from the project are to be made available on http://www.modencode.org and elsewhere as the work progresses."

https://openalex.org/W2068928962,"Several hundred malaria parasite proteins are exported beyond an encasing vacuole and into the cytosol of the host erythrocyte, a process that is central to the virulence and viability of the causative Plasmodium species. The trafficking machinery responsible for this export is unknown. Here we identify in Plasmodium falciparum a translocon of exported proteins (PTEX), which is located in the vacuole membrane. The PTEX complex is ATP-powered, and comprises heat shock protein 101 (HSP101; a ClpA/B-like ATPase from the AAA+ superfamily, of a type commonly associated with protein translocons), a novel protein termed PTEX150 and a known parasite protein, exported protein 2 (EXP2). EXP2 is the potential channel, as it is the membrane-associated component of the core PTEX complex. Two other proteins, a new protein PTEX88 and thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), were also identified as PTEX components. As a common portal for numerous crucial processes, this translocon offers a new avenue for therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2006131916,"Common copy number variations (CNVs) represent a significant source of genetic diversity, yet their influence on phenotypic variability, including disease susceptibility, remains poorly understood. To address this problem in human cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study of CNVs in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, a disease in which single nucleotide polymorphism variations are known to influence susceptibility. We first genotyped 846 Caucasian neuroblastoma patients and 803 healthy Caucasian controls at approximately 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and performed a CNV-based test for association. We then replicated significant observations in two independent sample sets comprised of a total of 595 cases and 3,357 controls. Here we describe the identification of a common CNV at chromosome 1q21.1 associated with neuroblastoma in the discovery set, which was confirmed in both replication sets. This CNV was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent in situ hybridization and analysis of matched tumour specimens, and was shown to be heritable in an independent set of 713 cancer-free parent-offspring trios. We identified a previously unknown transcript within the CNV that showed high sequence similarity to several neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF) genes and represents a new member of this gene family (NBPF23). This transcript was preferentially expressed in fetal brain and fetal sympathetic nervous tissues, and the expression level was strictly correlated with CNV state in neuroblastoma cells. These data demonstrate that inherited copy number variation at 1q21.1 is associated with neuroblastoma and implicate a previously unknown neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene in early tumorigenesis of this childhood cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2016252630,"During both stem cell differentiation and X chromosome inactivation, the process that silences one female X chromosome to ensure gene dosage parity between the sexes, chromatin undergoes epigenetic reprogramming to lock in a new state. Reprogramming of differentiated cells into iPS cells also causes reactivation of the inactivated X chromosome, and it has been proposed that the pluripotency factor Oct4 links both processes. In this study, Donohoe et al. find that Oct4 regulates X-chromosome inactivation by triggering X-chromosome pairing and counting. Oct4 interacts with both noncoding RNA genes (Tsix and Xite) and proteins (Ctcf and Yy1). This work shows that there is a complex network involved in epigenetic reprogramming of the X chromosome in stem cells. During both stem cell differentiation and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) of mouse embryonic stem cells, chromatin undergoes epigenetic reprogramming. XCI and cell differentiation are tightly coupled, with the blocking of one process compromising the other. The pluripotency factor, Oct4, is now shown to regulate XCI, and is the first identified factor that links both processes. Pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled by defined transcription factors1,2. During differentiation, mouse ES cells undergo global epigenetic reprogramming, as exemplified by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in which one female X chromosome is silenced to achieve gene dosage parity between the sexes3,4,5. Somatic XCI is regulated by homologous X-chromosome pairing6,7 and counting8,9,10, and by the random choice of future active and inactive X chromosomes. XCI and cell differentiation are tightly coupled11, as blocking one process compromises the other8,12 and dedifferentiation of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells is accompanied by X chromosome reactivation2. Recent evidence suggests coupling of Xist expression to pluripotency factors occurs13, but how the two are interconnected remains unknown. Here we show that Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1)14 lies at the top of the XCI hierarchy, and regulates XCI by triggering X-chromosome pairing and counting. Oct4 directly binds Tsix and Xite, two regulatory noncoding RNA genes of the X-inactivation centre15,16, and also complexes with XCI trans-factors, Ctcf and Yy1 (ref. 17), through protein–protein interactions. Depletion of Oct4 blocks homologous X-chromosome pairing and results in the inactivation of both X chromosomes in female cells. Thus, we have identified the first trans-factor that regulates counting, and ascribed new functions to Oct4 during X-chromosome reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2086943873,"T-cell acute leukaemias (T-ALL) often show central nervous system (CNS) infiltration that has to be treated aggressively. In most T-ALL cases, the Notch signalling pathway is constitutionally activated. Buonamici et al. now show that Notch signalling induces the expression of the cytokine receptor CCR7. CCR7 is shown to be responsible for the trafficking of T-ALL cells to the CNS; this appears to involve the expression of the CCR7 ligand CCL19 on brain endothelial cells. Targeting CCR7 may thus offer a therapeutic approach to prevent CNS relapse in T-ALL patients. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) patients are at an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse, and yet, despite its clinical importance, little is known about the mechanism of leukaemic cell infiltration of the CNS. Here, using T-ALL animal modelling and gene-expression profiling, the chemokine receptor CCR7 is shown to be the essential adhesion signal required for the targeting of leukaemic T cells into the CNS. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is a blood malignancy afflicting mainly children and adolescents1. T-ALL patients present at diagnosis with increased white cell counts and hepatosplenomegaly, and are at an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse2,3. For that reason, T-ALL patients usually receive cranial irradiation in addition to intensified intrathecal chemotherapy. The marked increase in survival is thought to be worth the considerable side-effects associated with this therapy. Such complications include secondary tumours, neurocognitive deficits, endocrine disorders and growth impairment3. Little is known about the mechanism of leukaemic cell infiltration of the CNS, despite its clinical importance4. Here we show, using T-ALL animal modelling and gene-expression profiling, that the chemokine receptor CCR7 (ref. 5) is the essential adhesion signal required for the targeting of leukaemic T-cells into the CNS. Ccr7 gene expression is controlled by the activity of the T-ALL oncogene Notch1 and is expressed in human tumours carrying Notch1-activating mutations. Silencing of either CCR7 or its chemokine ligand CCL19 (ref. 6) in an animal model of T-ALL specifically inhibits CNS infiltration. Furthermore, murine CNS-targeting by human T-ALL cells depends on their ability to express CCR7. These studies identify a single chemokine–receptor interaction as a CNS ‘entry’ signal, and open the way for future pharmacological targeting. Targeted inhibition of CNS involvement in T-ALL could potentially decrease the intensity of CNS-targeted therapy, thus reducing its associated short- and long-term complications."
https://openalex.org/W2016291752,"Reversible phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine is the most widely studied posttranslational modification of proteins. The number of phosphorylated sites on a protein (n) shows a significant increase from prokaryotes, with n </= 7 sites, to eukaryotes, with examples having n >/= 150 sites. Multisite phosphorylation has many roles and site conservation indicates that increasing numbers of sites cannot be due merely to promiscuous phosphorylation. A substrate with n sites has an exponential number (2(n)) of phospho-forms and individual phospho-forms may have distinct biological effects. The distribution of these phospho-forms and how this distribution is regulated have remained unknown. Here we show that, when kinase and phosphatase act in opposition on a multisite substrate, the system can exhibit distinct stable phospho-form distributions at steady state and that the maximum number of such distributions increases with n. Whereas some stable distributions are focused on a single phospho-form, others are more diffuse, giving the phospho-proteome the potential to behave as a fluid regulatory network able to encode information and flexibly respond to varying demands. Such plasticity may underlie complex information processing in eukaryotic cells and suggests a functional advantage in having many sites. Our results follow from the unusual geometry of the steady-state phospho-form concentrations, which we show to constitute a rational algebraic curve, irrespective of n. We thereby reduce the complexity of calculating steady states from simulating 3 x 2(n) differential equations to solving two algebraic equations, while treating parameters symbolically. We anticipate that these methods can be extended to systems with multiple substrates and multiple enzymes catalysing different modifications, as found in posttranslational modification 'codes' such as the histone code. Whereas simulations struggle with exponentially increasing molecular complexity, mathematical methods of the kind developed here can provide a new language in which to articulate the principles of cellular information processing."

https://openalex.org/W1992907404,"Theropods have traditionally been assumed to have lost manual digits from the lateral side inward, which differs from the bilateral reduction pattern seen in other tetrapod groups. This unusual reduction pattern is clearly present in basal theropods, and has also been inferred in non-avian tetanurans based on identification of their three digits as the medial ones of the hand (I-II-III). This contradicts the many developmental studies indicating II-III-IV identities for the three manual digits of the only extant tetanurans, the birds. Here we report a new basal ceratosaur from the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period of China (156–161 million years ago), representing the first known Asian ceratosaur and the only known beaked, herbivorous Jurassic theropod. Most significantly, this taxon possesses a strongly reduced manual digit I, documenting a complex pattern of digital reduction within the Theropoda. Comparisons among theropod hands show that the three manual digits of basal tetanurans are similar in many metacarpal features to digits II-III-IV, but in phalangeal features to digits I-II-III, of more basal theropods. Given II-III-IV identities in avians, the simplest interpretation is that these identities were shared by all tetanurans. The transition to tetanurans involved complex changes in the hand including a shift in digit identities, with ceratosaurs displaying an intermediate condition. The idea that the dinosaurs are still with us, as birds, is now widely accepted. But there is a nagging problem. The bird hand (now reduced and embedded in the wing) is thought to derive from the second, third and fourth digits of an ancestral five-digit hand. Yet the three-fingered hand of the closest extinct relatives of birds, the theropod dinosaurs, appears to derive from the first, second and third digits. How did one hand transform into the other? Prolific dinosaur hunter Xing Xu and his colleagues may have solved the problem, with the discovery of a small, primitive herbivorous theropod from the Jurassic of the Junggar Basin in western China. This creature, approximately 155 million years old, has a stub of the first digit alongside more fully developed second, third and fourth digits. The wrist bones of this primitive dinosaur are more like those associated with digits two, three and four; but the finger bones themselves are more like the first, second and third. This suggest that dinosaur hand-to-wing evolution involved complex developmental shifts in the wrist and fingers, and this newly discovered dinosaur is a snapshot of this change as it happened. The bird hand is thought to derive from the second, third and fourth digits of an ancestral five-digit hand. However, the three-fingered hand of theropod dinosaurs, which are the closest extinct relatives of birds, are thought to derive from the first, second and third digits. The discovery of a small, primitive herbivorous theropod from the Jurassic period of China with a stub of the first digit alongside more developed second, third and fourth digits, sheds light on this problem."
https://openalex.org/W2020565480,"Sport hunting has provided important economic incentives for conserving large predators since the early 1970's, but wildlife managers also face substantial pressure to reduce depredation. Sport hunting is an inherently risky strategy for controlling predators as carnivore populations are difficult to monitor and some species show a propensity for infanticide that is exacerbated by removing adult males. Simulation models predict population declines from even moderate levels of hunting in infanticidal species, and harvest data suggest that African countries and U.S. states with the highest intensity of sport hunting have shown the steepest population declines in African lions and cougars over the past 25 yrs. Similar effects in African leopards may have been masked by mesopredator release owing to declines in sympatric lion populations, whereas there is no evidence of overhunting in non-infanticidal populations of American black bears. Effective conservation of these animals will require new harvest strategies and improved monitoring to counter demands for predator control by livestock producers and local communities."
https://openalex.org/W1986511022,"SIRT3 is a major mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase playing important roles in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and energy production and has been linked to the beneficial effects of exercise and caloric restriction. SIRT3 is emerging as a potential therapeutic target to treat metabolic and neurological diseases. We report the first sets of crystal structures of human SIRT3, an apo-structure with no substrate, a structure with a peptide containing acetyl lysine of its natural substrate acetyl-CoA synthetase 2, a reaction intermediate structure trapped by a thioacetyl peptide, and a structure with the dethioacetylated peptide bound. These structures provide insights into the conformational changes induced by the two substrates required for the reaction, the acetylated substrate peptide and NAD(+). In addition, the binding study by isothermal titration calorimetry suggests that the acetylated peptide is the first substrate to bind to SIRT3, before NAD(+). These structures and biophysical studies provide key insight into the structural and functional relationship of the SIRT3 deacetylation activity."
https://openalex.org/W2079844680,"Macrophages are aptly positioned to function as the primary line of defence against invading pathogens in many organs, including the lung and peritoneum. Their ability to phagocytose and clear microorganisms has been well documented. Macrophages possess several substances with which they can kill bacteria, including reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and antimicrobial proteins. We proposed that macrophage-derived proteinases may contribute to the antimicrobial properties of macrophages. Macrophage elastase (also known as matrix metalloproteinase 12 or MMP12) is an enzyme predominantly expressed in mature tissue macrophages and is implicated in several disease processes, including emphysema. Physiological functions for MMP12 have not been described. Here we show that Mmp12(-/-) mice exhibit impaired bacterial clearance and increased mortality when challenged with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria at macrophage-rich portals of entry, such as the peritoneum and lung. Intracellular stores of MMP12 are mobilized to macrophage phagolysosomes after the ingestion of bacterial pathogens. Once inside phagolysosomes, MMP12 adheres to bacterial cell walls where it disrupts cellular membranes resulting in bacterial death. The antimicrobial properties of MMP12 do not reside within its catalytic domain, but rather within the carboxy-terminal domain. This domain contains a unique four amino acid sequence on an exposed beta loop of the protein that is required for the observed antimicrobial activity. The present study represents, to our knowledge, the first report of direct antimicrobial activity by a matrix metallopeptidase, and describes a new antimicrobial peptide that is sequentially and structurally unique in nature."

https://openalex.org/W2150560481,"Recent attempts at rebuilding the myocardium using stem cells have yielded disappointing results. The lack of a supporting vasculature may, in part, explain these disappointing findings. However, concerns over possible side effects have hampered attempts at revascularizing the infarcted myocardium using systemic delivery of proangiogenic compounds. In this study, we develop the technology to enhance the morphology and function of postinfarct neovasculature. Previously, we have shown that the up-regulated expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules in the myocardial infarction (MI) region provides a potential avenue for selectively targeting drugs to infarcted tissue. After treatment with anti-P-selectin-conjugated liposomes containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), changes in cardiac function and vasculature post-MI were quantified in a rat MI model. Targeted delivery of VEGF to post-MI tissue resulted in significant increase in fractional shortening and improved systolic function. These functional improvements were accompanied by a 21% increase in the number of anatomical vessels and a 74% increase in the number of perfused vessels in the MI region of treated animals. No significant improvements in cardiac function were observed in untreated, systemic VEGF-treated, nontargeted liposome-treated, or blank immunoliposome-treated animals. Targeted delivery of low doses of proangiogenic compounds to post-MI tissue results in significant improvements in cardiac function and vascular structure."

https://openalex.org/W1985941404,"Cerebral malaria (CM) is characterized by accumulation of circulating cells within brain microvessels, among which platelets play an important role. In vitro, platelets modulate the cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (PRBCs) to brain endothelial cells. Here we show for the first time that platelet microparticles (PMPs) are able to bind to PRBCs, thereby transferring platelet antigens to the PRBC surface. This binding is largely specific to PRBCs, because PMPs show little adherence to normal red blood cells. PMP adherence is also dependent on the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 variant expressed by PRBCs. PMP binding to PRBCs decreases after neutralization of PRBC surface proteins by trypsin or after treatment of PMPs with a mAb to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) and glycoprotein IV (CD36). Furthermore, PMP uptake is a dynamic process that can be achieved by human brain endothelial cells (HBECs), inducing changes in the endothelial phenotype. Lastly, PMPs dramatically increase PRBC cytoadherence to HBECs. In conclusion, our study identifies several mechanisms by which PMPs may participate in CM pathogenesis while interacting with both PRBCs and HBECs. PMPs thereby provide a novel target for antagonizing interactions between vascular cells that promote microvascular sludging and blood brain barrier alteration during CM."

Although TDP-43 is localized in the nucleus of unaffected neurons, nuclear staining of this protein is significantly reduced in neurons bearing ubiquitin inclusions (1Neumann M. Sampathu D.M.

In this study, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to investigate the effect of TDP-43 loss of function on cell death and neurite outgrowth and elucidated a novel relation between TDP-43 and the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. The oligonucleotide siRNA duplex was synthesized by Takara Bio (Shiga, Japan). The siRNA sequences were as follows: scrambled (control) siRNA-set1, 5′-GAAUCAGAUGCACAUGAGUTT-3′; -set2, 5′-ACGGCCUAAUCUAACAGACTT-3′; TDP-43 siRNA-set1, 5′-GAACGAUGAACCCAUUGAATT-3′; -set2, 5′-CCAAUGCUGAACCUAAGCATT-3′. Unless otherwise mentioned, set 1 siRNA was used for TDP-43 knockdown throughout the experiments. The pEGFP-Rac1 construct was produced as described elsewhere (23Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Watanabe T. Wang S. Noritake J. Sato K. Fukata M. Takefuji M. Nakagawa M. Izumi N. Akiyama T. Kaibuchi K. Dev.

Mouse TDP-43 (GenBankTM accession number NM_145556) cDNA was amplified by PCR from mouse brain cDNA using the following primers: 5′-GTGCTTCCTCCTTGTGCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCACACTGAACAAACCAATCTG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the entire coding region of mouse TDP-43 was inserted in-frame into either the KpnI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1/V5His vector (Invitrogen) or the KpnI and BamHI sites of the pDsRed-Monomer-Hyg-N1 vector (Clontech). An siRNA-resistant form of the TDP-43 gene was generated by changing the targeted sequence of the siRNA to 5′-GAATGACGAGCCAATTGAA-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined) using the KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Neuro-2a cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), a line derived from mouse neuroblastoma, were maintained as described previously (25Niwa J. Yamada S. Ishigaki S. Sone J. Takahashi M. Katsuno M. Tanaka F. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28087-28095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The transfection of siRNA into Neuro-2a cells was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. For the transfection of the intended plasmid and siRNA, cells were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. To differentiate the Neuro-2a cells, the medium was changed to Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 20 μm retinoic acid, and cells were cultured for 24 h. For the interventional studies, the cells were incubated for 24 h with differentiation medium containing Clostridium difficile toxin B (Sigma-Aldrich) or for 12 h with medium containing GGTI-298 (Calbiochem). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the differentiation medium at the indicated concentration 24 h after siRNA transfection, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Neuro-2a cells cultured in 6-well dishes were photographed using an Olympus IX71 inverted phase-contrast microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The length of the longest neurite was measured with Image Gauge version 4.22 software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Averages of the lengths of over 100 transfected cells were analyzed. To confirm the efficacy of siRNA transfection, BLOCK-iTTM Alexa Fluor® Red Fluorescent Control (Invitrogen) was co-transfected with TDP-43 siRNA or control RNA. The efficacy of plasmid transfection was ensured using DsRed (Clontech). To assess neurite outgrowth in TDP-43 knockdown cells, we performed a time course analysis starting at 24 h after the siRNA transfection when the differentiation medium was changed. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-caboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)-based cell proliferation assay was carried out on the differentiated Neuro-2a cells 48 h post-transfection using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a multiple plate reader (PowerscanHT, Dainippon Pharmaceutical). The assays were carried out in 6 wells for each condition. To assess cell apoptosis, differentiated Neuro-2a cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Annexin V and with propidium iodide (PI) using the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. TUNEL assays were performed using the APO-DIRECTTM kit (BD Biosciences). The extent of staining in 10,000 cells was monitored by FACSCaliburTM and CellQuest version 3.1.3 acquisition and analysis software (BD Biosciences) immediately after the staining. Neuro-2a cells were grown on black 96-well plates. The caspase-3/7 activity of differentiated Neuro-2a cells was analyzed using the Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay (Promega) after 48 h of transfection or intended treatment according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. Fluorescence (485/528 nm) was measured in the multiple plate reader, and the assay was carried out in 6 wells for each condition. mRNA levels were determined by real time PCR as described before (26Katsuno M. Adachi H. Minamiyama M. Waza M. Tokui K. Banno H. Suzuki K. Onoda Y. Tanaka F. Doyu M. Sobue G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12106-12117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly total RNA from Neuro-2a cells was reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA, real time PCR was performed, and the product was detected by the iCycler system (Bio-Rad). For an internal standard control, the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was simultaneously quantified. The following primers were used: 5′-CCGCATGTCAGCCAAATACAAG-3′ and 5′-ACCAGAATTGGCTCCAACAACAG-3′ for TDP-43 and 5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′ and 5′-TTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG-3′ for GAPDH. Western blot analyses were performed as described before (27Katsuno M. Adachi H. Doyu M. Minamiyama M. Sang C. Kobayashi Y. Inukai A. Sobue G. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 768-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly Neuro-2a cells were lysed in Cellytic lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) 48 h after transfection. For subcellular fractionation, we used the ProteoExtact Subcellular Proteome Extraction kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (5–20% gradient gel) and analyzed by Western blotting with ECL Plus detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-TDP-43 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; ProteinTech, Chicago, IL), anti-Rac1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Millipore, Temecula, CA), anti-RhoA mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), anti-Cdc42 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (Thr-853) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Millipore), anti-myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-H-Ras rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Rab5 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000; BD Pharmingen) as a cytosol marker, anti-integrin β1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a membrane marker, anti-green fluorescent protein mouse monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Millipore), anti-Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Millipore), anti-geranylgeranyltransferase-1β mouse polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan), and anti-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abgent, San Diego, CA). To measure RhoA and Rac1/Cdc42 GTPase activities, we used the Rho binding domain (RBD) of the Rho effector protein with Rhotekin and Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) region of the Cdc42/Rac effector protein with p21 activated kinase 1 (PAK), respectively. Pulldown assays were performed in the presence of glutathione S-transferase-tagged Rhotekin-RBD and PAK-CRIB protein-agarose beads (Cytoskeleton) according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. Neuro-2a cells, which were transfected with EGFP-Rac1, DsRed-TDP-43, and siRNA (TDP-43 siRNA or control RNA), were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.1% Triton X-100 for extraction of cytosol components. After washing, samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and then photographed with a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 (Carl Zeiss AG). Neuro-2a cells were transfected with siRNA on 10-cm2 dishes. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, 20 μm lovastatin (Sigma) was added to the culture medium. Twenty-four hours after the addition of lovastatin, the cells were labeled by adding fresh culture medium containing 6.25 μCi/ml [14C]mevalonolactone (50–62 mCi/mmol) (GE Healthcare) and 20 μm lovastatin. Nineteen hours after labeling, the cells were harvested, and Rac1 was immunoprecipitated by incubating with 4 mg of anti-RhoA mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Rac1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Millipore) for 24 h followed by adding 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The 14C-labeled gels were fixed and soaked in Amplify Fluorographic Reagent (GE Healthcare) for 30 min. The gels were dried, and labeled proteins were visualized on a Typhoon 9410 Workstation (GE Healthcare) after exposure to a Storage Phosphor Screen (GE Healthcare) for 72 h. We validated this experiment using 20 μm GGTI-298. Statistical differences (not including neurite length data) were analyzed by analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc analyses for three or more group comparisons and the unpaired Student舗s t test for two-group comparisons. Neurite length differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (SPSS version 15.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Two-tailed p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. To analyze the effect of TDP-43 depletion, two sets of siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected into Neuro-2a cells. The efficiency of TDP-43 siRNA transfection was confirmed by Western blotting and quantitative real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1, A and B). To assess cell viability, we carried out an MTS-based cell proliferation assay in differentiated Neuro-2a cells after 48 h of siRNA transfection. The viability of knockdown cells was significantly decreased by both sets of siRNA compared with each control (Fig. 1C). To exclude the possibility of an off-target effect, a plasmid carrying an siRNA-resistant form of TDP-43 was co-transfected together with set 1 siRNA. As a result, the siRNA-resistant form of TDP-43 prevented the reduction of cell viability (Fig. 1D). The apoptotic process was quantified with Annexin V/PI staining and TUNEL labeling. The knockdown of TDP-43 significantly increased the number of PI-positive cells (Fig. 2A). However, the number of cells positive for Annexin V or TUNEL was not altered (Fig. 2, B and C). In the caspase-3/7 assay, there was no significant difference between knockdown and control cells (Fig. 2D). To clarify the effects of TDP-43 depletion on cellular morphology, we performed a time course experiment measuring the average length of neurites. Neurites of control cells extended over the course of 48 h, but neurite outgrowth was significantly inhibited in TDP-43-depleted cells (Fig. 2E).FIGURE 2Apoptosis analyses and quantitative assessment of neurite outgrowth in TDP-43-depleted Neuro-2a cells.

First RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 GTPase activities were investigated by pulldown assays. In TDP-43-depleted cells, the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 GTPase were all decreased compared with the controls (Fig. 3, A and B). Inactivation of RhoA GTPase was also confirmed by a significant reduction in the level of the Thr-853 phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1, which is exclusively phosphorylated by Rho kinase (28Feng J. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Isaka N. Nishikawa M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). To verify that inactivation of Rho family GTPases leads to neuronal damage, we tested the effects of C. difficile toxin B, a pan-inhibitor of Rho family proteins, on differentiated Neuro-2a cells. As a result, this toxin reduced cell viability and inhibited neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3, C and D). Small G proteins, including Rho and Ras family members, must be able to localize at the cell membrane to exert their biological functions (29Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus investigated the intracellular distribution of Rho family proteins to elucidate the mechanism by which TDP-43 regulates their GTPase activity. Western blots showed that the amounts of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, but not H-Ras or Rab5, in the membrane fractions were decreased in the TDP-43 knockdown cells (Fig. 4A). The subcellular fraction of Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, another regulator of Rho activity, was not altered by TDP-43 knockdown (Fig. 4A). The siRNA-resistant form of TDP-43 rescued the reduction in the amount of membrane-bound Rho family GTPases (Fig. 4B). The fluorescent images also demonstrated that membrane-localized Rac1 was significantly reduced in TDP-43 knockdown cells in comparison with control cells (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Fluorescent images of Neuro-2a cells. Neuro-2a cells co-transfected with EGFP-Rac1, DsRed-TDP-43, and siRNA (TDP-43 siRNA or control RNA) were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.1% Triton X-100. Membrane-localized Rac1 was significantly reduced in the TDP-43 depleted cells (arrowhead) compared with the cells that escaped knockdown of TDP-43 (arrow) and with the control RNA-transfected cells. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For membrane localization to occur, members of the Rho family of GTPases have to be catalyzed by transferring GGPP to the C-terminal motif (geranylgeranylation), whereas Ras family members, such as H-Ras, require farnesyl pyrophosphate. We thus tested two agents that modulate geranylgeranylation of Rho family molecules. GGTI-298, a specific inhibitor of geranylgeranylation, has been shown to increase neural cell death through the inactivation of Rho family GTPases (30Tanaka T. Tatsuno I. Uchida D. Moroo I. Morio H. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Saito Y. Hirai A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2852-2859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Meske V. Albert F. Richter D. Schwarze J. Ohm T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In differentiated Neuro-2a cells, GGTI-298 inhibited neurite outgrowth and reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner without any evidence of caspase-3/7 activation (Fig. 6, A–C). GGTI-298 also decreased the amount of membrane-bound Rho GTPases (Fig. 6D). In contrast, GGPP, the final substrate of geranylgeranylation, prevented the reduction in the amounts of membrane-bound RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 caused by TDP-43 knockdown (Fig. 6E). In addition, GGPP restored viability and neurite outgrowth in TDP-43-depleted cells (Fig. 6, F and G). These findings indicate that impaired geranylgeranylation appears to be the molecular basis of TDP-43 depletion-induced cellular damage. We next examined whether TDP-43 regulates geranylgeranylation of Rho GTPases. Fig. 7, A–C, shows that TDP-43 increased the amount of membrane-bound Rho GTPases, augmented neurite outgrowth, and increased cell viability in GGTI-298-treated cells.FIGURE 7Effect of TDP-43 in Neuro-2a cells on GGTI-298-induced cellular phenotype.

Error bars indicate S.E. (B) or S.D. (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these observations suggest that TDP-43 regulates the activities of Rho family members through protein geranylgeranylation. We thus investigated the effect of TDP-43 depletion on protein geranylgeranylation using [14C]mevalonic acid (MVA). Incorporation of [14C]MVA into RhoA or Rac1 was significantly decreased in the TDP-43-depleted Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 8, A and B), suggesting that the knockdown of TDP-43 inhibits geranylgeranylation of Rho family members. GGTI-298 reduced incorporation of [14C]MVA into Rac1, further confirming this conclusion (Fig. 8C). Protein geranylgeranylation of the Rho family is regulated by specific enzymes: geranylgeranyltransferase-Iβ and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase-1, which is responsible for synthesis of GGPP. We therefore investigated the expression levels of these enzymes. However, the knockdown of TDP-43 did not alter the protein expression level of geranylgeranyltransferase-Iβ or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase-1 (data not shown). In the present study, we demonstrated that knockdown of TDP-43 inhibits neurite outgrowth and induces cell death in differentiated Neuro-2a cells, suggesting that loss of TDP-43 function plays a causative role in neurodegeneration. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 depletion causes neuronal cell damage, we examined the relationship between TDP-43 and Rho family GTPases. Neuronal morphology is determined in large part through the regulation of the cytoskeleton. One of the key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton is the Rho family of GTPases: RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (15Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 16Burridge K. Wennerberg K.

Although each Rho family member has a distinct effect on cell morphology and plays an important role in the regulation of neuronal survival, we demonstrated that pan-inhibition of Rho family proteins by C. difficile toxin B suppressed neurite outgrowth and reduced cell viability as reported previously (19Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 20Bradke F. Dotti C.G.

Neurochem. 2006; 97: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were all decreased in TDP-43-depleted cells, suggesting that knockdown of TDP-43 induces inhibition of neurite outgrowth and cell death through the inactivation of Rho family GTPases. There was no evidence of apoptosis mediated by TDP-43 knockdown in the model we used perhaps because of the biological characteristics of Neuro-2a cells in which the induction of apoptosis is known to be difficult (34Sueyoshi N. Maehara T. Ito M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1197-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Saito M. Saito M. Cooper T.B. Vadasz C. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2005; 29: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In support of this view, we confirmed that GGTI-298 had no effect on apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells under the present conditions (Fig. 6C), although this reagent has been shown to efficiently induce apoptosis in non-neuronal cells (36Xia Z. Tan M.M. Wong W.W. Dimitroulakos J. Minden M.D. Penn L.Z. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1398-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 37Li X. Liu L. Tupper J.C. Bannerman D.D. Winn R.K. Sebti S.M.

Various molecules have been shown to regulate the activity of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, but few are capable of regulating all three GTPases concomitantly. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which TDP-43 regulates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, we directed our attention to the fact that membrane localization is the key regulatory factor common to these molecules. Small G proteins, including members of the Rho and Ras families, act as molecular switches cycling between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (18Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar, 38Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Zhou K.

Post-translational modification with a C-terminal prenyl moiety allows small G proteins to associate with the membrane where they can interact with and activate their effectors (29Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins that require prenylation include the farnesyl group, such as the Ras family, and the geranylgeranyl group, such as the Rho or the Rab family (29Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that knockdown of TDP-43 decreased membrane-bound RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 but did not affect the intracellular distribution of H-Ras or Rab5. TDP-43 knockdown also inhibited the incorporation of [14C]MVA, a tracer of the mevalonate pathway, into RhoA and Rac1 in differentiated Neuro-2a cells. In contrast, the expression level of Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, which functions by extracting Rho family GTPases from membranes and solubilizing them in the cytosol (41Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dovas A. Couchman J.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), was not significantly altered by TDP-43 knockdown. In addition, inhibition of geranylgeranylation by GGTI-298 reproduced the cytotoxic effects of TDP-43 depletion, whereas GGPP, the substrate of the geranylgeranylation pathway, restored cell viability and neurite outgrowth in TDP-43-depleted Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore in GGTI-298 treated cells, overexpression of TDP-43 restored the membrane localization of Rho GTPases as well as cell viability and neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest that TDP-43 depletion inactivates Rho family GTPases through inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation. Protein geranylgeranylation of Rho family members is catalyzed by geranylgeranyltransferase-I using GGPP produced by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase-1 as the substrate (43Ericsson J. Greene J.M. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Duan D.R. Florence C. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1731-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Geranylgeranyltransferase-I consists of two subunits, α and β, and the α subunit is also a component of protein farnesyltransferase (44Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus assessed the mRNA and protein expression of geranylgeranyltransferase-Iβ and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase-1 in Neuro-2a cells. However, the expression levels of these enzymes were not altered by TDP-43 knockdown. These results imply that TDP-43 depletion decreases the activities of these enzymes. Ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions are a histopathological hallmark of ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Although the nature of these aggregates has not been fully elucidated, recent studies have identified TDP-43 as the major component of the ubiquitin-immunoreactive neuronal inclusions seen in ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (1Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A.

There has been a great deal of debate about whether loss or gain of function of TDP-43 causes neuronal dysfunction and eventual cell death. Although TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved nuclear protein, under the pathological conditions in ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions, TDP-43 completely disappears from the nuclei of the affected neurons (1Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. Feiden W. Kretzschmar H.A.

Hashizume Y. Oda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). These histopathological findings indicate that loss of nuclear TDP-43 may underlie neuronal degeneration, although it is also possible that neuronal inclusions possess cytotoxic properties. It has been reported that TDP-43 depletion leads to up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 protein and transcript levels followed by misregulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis in cultured human epithelial cancer cells (14Ayala Y.M. Misteli T. Baralle F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3785-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the present study, knockdown of TDP-43 inactivated Rho family GTPases and thereby induced cell death in differentiated Neuro-2a cells. Although this is not the model imitating the dislocation of TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, our findings suggest that loss of function of TDP-43 may induce neuronal degeneration probably through dysregulation of Rho family GTPases. In summary, we have demonstrated that TDP-43 depletion inhibits neurite outgrowth and induces neuronal cell death. This phenomenon possibly results from a reduced membrane localization of Rho family GTPases due to the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation."
https://openalex.org/W2071729342,"MC2 (ACTH) receptors require MC2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) to reach the cell surface. In this study, we show that MRAP has the opposite effect on the closely related MC5 receptor. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microscopy experiments, MC2 receptor was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of MRAP and targeted to the plasma membrane with MRAP. MC5 receptor was at the plasma membrane in the absence of MRAP, but trapped intracellularly when expressed with MRAP. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, where one fragment of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was fused to receptors and another to MRAP, we showed that MC2 receptor-MRAP dimers were present at the plasma membrane, whereas MC5 receptor-MRAP dimers were intracellular. Both MC2 and MC5 receptors co-precipitated with MRAP. MRAP did not alter expression of beta2-adrenergic receptors or co-precipitate with them. To determine if MRAP affects formation of receptor oligomers, we co-expressed MC2 receptors fused to YFP fragments in the presence or absence of MRAP. YFP fluorescence, reporting MC2 receptor homodimers, was readily detectable with or without MRAP. In contrast, MC5 receptor homodimers were visible in the absence of MRAP, but little fluorescence was observed by microscopic analysis when MRAP was co-expressed. Co-precipitation of differentially tagged receptors confirmed that MRAP blocks MC5 receptor dimerization. The regions of MRAP required for its effects on MC2 and MC5 receptors differed. These results establish that MRAP forms stable complexes with two different melanocortin receptors, facilitating surface expression of MC2 receptor but disrupting dimerization and surface localization of MC5 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2012820951,"Cellular DNA lesions are efficiently countered by DNA repair in conjunction with delays in cell cycle progression. Previous studies have demonstrated that Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 can form a heterotrimeric complex (the 9-1-1 complex) that plays dual roles in cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA repair in eukaryotic cells. Although the 9-1-1 complex has been proposed to form a toroidal structure similar to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which plays essential roles in DNA replication and repair, the structural basis by which it performs different functions has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the human 9-1-1 complex at 3.2 A resolution. The crystal structure, together with biochemical assays, reveals that the interdomain connecting loops (IDC loop) of hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 are largely divergent, and further cocrystallization study indicates that a PCNA-interacting box (PIP box)-containing peptide derived from hFen1 binds tightly to the interdomain connecting loop of hRad1, providing the molecular basis for the damage repair-specific activity of the 9-1-1 complex in contrast to PCNA. Furthermore, structural comparison with PCNA reveals other unique structural features of the 9-1-1 complex that are proposed to contribute to DNA damage recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2074009076,"Macrophages detect pathogen infection via the activation of their plasma membrane-bound Toll-like receptor proteins (TLRs). The heterotypic interaction between the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains of TLRs and adaptor proteins, like Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), is the first intracellular step in the signaling pathway of the mammalian innate immune response. The hetero-oligomerization of the TIRs of the receptor and adaptor brings about the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which regulates the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a bacterial TIR domain solved at 2.5 A resolution. The three-dimensional fold of Paracoccus denitrificans TIR is identical to that observed for the TIR of human TLRs and MyD88 proteins. The structure shows a unique dimerization interface involving the DD-loop and EE-loop residues, whereas leaving the BB-loop highly exposed. Peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry also reveals that the same region is used for dimerization in solution and in the context of the full-length protein. These results, together with a functional interaction between P. denitrificans TIR and MyD88 visualized in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, further substantiate the model that bacterial TIR proteins adopt structural mimicry of the host active receptor TIR domains to interfere with the signaling of TLRs and their adaptors to decrease the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2048650878,"Neurons are highly dependent on astrocyte survival during brain damage. To identify genes involved in astrocyte function during ischemia, we performed mRNA differential display in astrocytes after oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). We detected a robust down-regulation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) mRNA that was accompanied by a sharp decrease in protein levels and activity. OGD-induced apoptosis was increased by the combined deletion of S6K1 and S6K2 genes, as well as by treatment with rapamycin that inhibits S6K1 activity by acting on the upstream regulator mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Astrocytes lacking S6K1 and S6K2 (S6K1;S6K2−/−) displayed a defect in BAD phosphorylation and in the expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore reactive oxygen species were increased while translation recovery was impaired in S6K-deficient astrocytes following OGD. Rescue of either S6K1 or S6K2 expression by adenoviral infection revealed that protective functions were specifically mediated by S6K1, because this isoform selectively promoted resistance to OGD and reduction of ROS levels. Finally, “in vivo” effects of S6K suppression were analyzed in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemia, in which absence of S6K expression increased mortality and infarct volume. In summary, this article uncovers a protective role for astrocyte S6K1 against brain ischemia, indicating a functional pathway that senses nutrient and oxygen levels and may be beneficial for neuronal survival.

In summary, this article uncovers a protective role for astrocyte S6K1 against brain ischemia, indicating a functional pathway that senses nutrient and oxygen levels and may be beneficial for neuronal survival. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the central nervous system. Their functions are crucial for central nervous system homeostasis, because they provide trophic, metabolic, and antioxidant support to neurons. In addition, astrocytes show the ability to modulate synaptic activity and are responsible for preserving neuronal integrity in conditions of disease and injury. In this regard, recent evidence indicates that they are protective for neurons during cerebral ischemia (1Li L. Lundkvist A. Andersson D. Wilhelmsson U. Nagai N. Pardo A.C. Nodin C. Ståhlberg A.

As there is a growing consensus that astrocyte dysfunction may compromise the ability of neurons to survive, the need for studies that clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the astrocytic response to ischemia is plainly justified.Among the intracellular pathways that integrate signals from nutrients and oxygen, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 2The abbreviations used are: mTORmammalian target of rapamycinGAPGTPase-activating proteinS6K1-2, S6 kinase 1 and 24EBPeIF4E-binding proteinOGDoxygen and glucose deprivationH2DCF-DAdichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateDMEMDulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s mediumMCAOmiddle cerebral artery occlusionRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePIpropidium iodidem.o.i.multiplicity of infection. 2The abbreviations used are: mTORmammalian target of rapamycinGAPGTPase-activating proteinS6K1-2, S6 kinase 1 and 24EBPeIF4E-binding proteinOGDoxygen and glucose deprivationH2DCF-DAdichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateDMEMDulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s mediumMCAOmiddle cerebral artery occlusionRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidePIpropidium iodidem.o.i.multiplicity of infection. kinase plays an evolutionary conserved role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism (2Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4612) Google Scholar). mTOR exists in the cell in at least two distinct complexes with different partners, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The activity of mTORC1 is exquisitely sensitive to the energy status of the cell and is blocked by the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin. Glucose and oxygen deprivation inhibits mTORC1 activity, respectively, through the regulation of AMP-activated kinase and REDD1/REDD2 proteins (3Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L. Manning B.D.

These factors favor the action of the tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2, which suppress mTORC1 by forming a complex with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for the small GTPase Rheb (6Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).In turn, mTORC1 phosphorylates at least three distinct classes of substrates, the eIF4E-binding proteins (4EBP-1 to -3), the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) and the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1. However, the pathophysiological role of the mTOR pathway during hypoxia-induced brain damage and the involvement of the distinct mTOR effectors remain to be established.The anabolic actions of the mTOR pathway may in part depend on the regulation of protein synthesis. mTOR associates with the translation initiation factor eIF3 (7Holz M.K.

However loss of function mouse mutants of 4EBPs and S6Ks failed to uncover a role of these effectors in global protein synthesis during resting conditions, while instead suggesting an involvement in energy homeostasis and mitochondrial function (11Aguilar V.

Therefore, mTOR plays critical anabolic and energetic functions still poorly understood, raising the appealing possibility that hypoxia-induced down-regulation of the mTOR pathway could be linked to brain damage. In this regard, S6K, besides stimulating phosphorylation of the ribosomal proteins rpS6 and eIF4B, has been shown to inactivate the anti-apoptotic factor BAD and the insulin receptor substrate IRS (13Um S.H.

Moreover, S6K activity is decreased in in vivo paradigms of global and focal brain ischemia (15Janelidze S. Hu B.R. Siesjö P. Siesjö B.K. Neurobiol.

Mjøs O.D. Sack M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Here we show that oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) decreases S6K1 mRNA levels in astrocyte cultures, leading to a reduction of S6K1 protein and activity. S6K loss of function leads to increased astrocyte death during ischemia, impairment of protein synthesis recovery, unbalance between mitochondrial pro- and anti-apoptotic factors and rise in ROS levels. Finally we reveal an effect of S6K suppression on mouse mortality and infarct volume following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Our data indicate a novel role of S6K1 promoting astrocyte survival, protein synthesis, and brain protection in conditions of ischemic stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsDichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) and Annexin V conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fetal bovine serum and glutamine were obtained from Invitrogen.

Animals were initially in the mixed C57/Bl6-129Ola genetic background and then backcrossed ten times to a “pure” C57/Bl6 background. Primary cultures of astroglial cells were also prepared as mentioned before (19Benavides A. Pastor D. Santos P. Tranque P. Calvo S.

Briefly, cortices from 1-day-old mouse pups were aseptically removed, minced, dissociated by trypsinization, and maintained in Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Fourteen days after plating, the flasks were shaken for 15–18 h at 37 °C to remove oligodendroglial and microglial cells. Astrocytes were then detached by trypsinization and plated either on culture dishes or poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in supplemented DMEM. All experiments were performed 2–3 days after cells were re-plated.Flow Cytometry for Cell Size MeasurementAstrocytes were dispersed by trypsinization, and the resulting single cell suspension was immediately used for cell size measurement. Relative cell size was assessed in 10,000-cell samples using a BD-LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Forward scatter height histograms were plotted, and mean values were calculated using CellQuest software, according to the manufacturer舗s instructions.Ischemia ModelsIn Vitro OGDIschemia was induced following a formerly reported method (19Benavides A. Pastor D. Santos P. Tranque P. Calvo S. Glia. 2005; 52: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using an anaerobic chamber. Glucose- and serum-free DMEM was made anoxic by aeration with 99.95% N2 for 30 min, and subsequently saturated with 5% CO2 in N2 for a further 20-min period. 24-h serum-starved astrocyte cultures were washed three times with ischemia media and maintained at 37 °C inside the ischemic chamber incubator. At the end of the designated period, medium was replaced and cells were returned to a normal culture incubator.Permanent MCAOExperiments were performed on 3-month-old male wild-type and S6K1;2−/− mice. They were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (in 70%N2O, 30%O2) for induction and 1.5% isoflurane for maintenance, and the rectal temperature was kept at 37 °C with a heating pad. The middle cerebral artery was exposed and occluded permanently by electrocoagulation (21Caso J.R. Pradillo J.M. Hurtado O. Lorenzo P. Moro M.A. Lizasoain I. Circulation. 2007; 115: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). All procedures conformed to the Committee of Animal Care at the Universidad Complutense of Madrid according with European Union rules (86/609/CEE, 2003/65/CE, and RD 1201/2005). Brains were removed 2 or 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), cut into seven 1-mm-thick coronal brain slices (Brain Matrix, WPI-Europe, Aston, Stevenage, UK), and stained in 0.2 m phosphate buffer containing 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Infarct size (mm3) was determined as previously described (22Pérez-Asensio F.J. Hurtado O. Burguete M.C. Moro M.A. Salom J.B. Lizasoain I. Torregrosa G. Leza J.C. Alborch E. Castillo J. Knowles R.G.

One milliliter of TRIzol was used per ten million cells. The isolated RNA was subsequently treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega) to remove any genomic DNA contamination.Differential DisplaymRNA differential display was carried out with the RNAimage kit (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) as previously shown (19Benavides A. Pastor D. Santos P. Tranque P. Calvo S. Glia. 2005; 52: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). RNA from control astrocytes was compared with RNA obtained from astrocytes that had been subjected to OGD for 6 and 8 h. RNA bands with different intensity in controls and OGD-treated astrocytes were isolated, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence homology was analyzed using the BLASTnt alignment software.Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-PCR)Changes in the mRNA expression were examined by RT-PCR using an ABIPrism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). cDNA (1 μl of reverse transcription product) was amplified using SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in the presence of primer oligonucleotides specific for S6K1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and GAPDH. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Quantification was performed by the comparative Ct (cycle threshold) method (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119255) Google Scholar), using the GAPDH expression level as internal control. Primers for all target sequences (Table 1) were designed using the computer Primer Express software provided with the 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Cell lysates were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Pall Corp., Ann Harbor, MI) as previously described (24Pérez-Ortiz J.M.

Membranes were probed with the anti-S6K1, anti-phosphoThr389 S6K, anti-S6K2, anti-phospoSer235/236 S6 anti-Bad, and anti-phosphoSer-136 Bad primary antibodies, and subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies following the manufacturer舗s instructions. An enhanced chemiluminescence system was used for visualization.ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitation was carried out on a rocking platform in a cold room. Astrocytes were harvested with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.7 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin. Total protein (0.5 mg) from each sample was precleared with 20 μl of protein A-agarose slurry (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 4 °C, and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g. Supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of Bad antibody. Protein A-Agarose (20 μl) was then added and incubated for 3 h. After centrifugation, the immunoprecipitate was washed twice with lysis buffer. Finally, sample loading buffer (20 μl) was added to the immunoprecipitate and boiled for 5 min before Western blot analysis.Immunofluorescence MicroscopyAstrocytes grown on glass coverslips inserted in 6-well plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and blocked and permeabilized with 4% goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) plus 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-phospo-Ser-235/236 S6 antibody polyclonal antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 4% goat serum. After subsequent washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rhodamine (TRITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals) diluted 1:5000. Fluorescent images of the cells were obtained with a Leica DMRXA microscope.Viability AssaysMTT AssayCells were plated in 96-well culture plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well. At the indicated periods medium was removed and 100 μl of DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in a CO2 incubator. Finally, the MTT-containing medium was removed, and purple formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide to each well. Absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad M-550) at 570 nm with a reference filter at 655 nm.Fluorescence Microscope Imaging of Annexin V StainingAstrocytes grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and stained for 15 min with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 and propidium iodide (PI), according to the manufacturer舗s indications (Molecular Probes). Cells were then mounted on slides and observed under a fluorescence microscope using the appropriate filters.Flow Cytometry for Annexin V/PI AssessmentAstrocytes were harvested by trypsinization and stained simultaneously with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 and PI, according to the manufacturer舗s indications (Molecular Probes). Early apoptotic cells were distinguished from other cells with a BD-LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it can be detected by Annexin V conjugates. Cells that were positive for Annexin V and negative for PI were considered early apoptotic. Annexin V-negative/PI-negative cells were identified as living cells, and cells positive for PI were designated as dead cells (necrotic plus late apoptotic cells).Flow Cytometry for Intracellular ROS ProductionCells were incubated with the cell permeant dye H2DCF-DA, which de-esterifies intracellularly to H2DCF. ROS oxidize H2DCF to the brightly fluorescent compound 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein, monitored by flow cytometry as previously described (24Pérez-Ortiz J.M. Tranque P. Vaquero C.F. Domingo B. Molina F. Calvo S. Jordán J. Cena V. Llopis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8976-8985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and OGD-exposed astrocytes were incubated with 5 μm H2DCF-DA for 15 min at 37 °C, detached from the plate with trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and immediately used for flow cytometry. Triplicate samples were run in each experiment, and at least 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed. Mean fluorescence was calculated by using the program CellQuest.Analysis of Protein Synthesis RateProtein synthesis rate was determined as described (25Mieulet V. Roceri M. Espeillac C. Sotiropoulos A. Ohanna M. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Sandri M. Pende M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C712-C722Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Astrocytes, grown in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM and incubated for 2 h in 1 ml of medium containing 40 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of 0.2% Triton. Three 10-μl aliquots from total cell lysate were counted in a scintillation counter to evaluate the label in total cell lysate. The remaining lysate was treated with trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The amount of free radiolabel was assayed in three 10-μl supernatant aliquots in the scintillation counter. The amount of radiolabel incorporated into protein was then calculated by subtracting the value of the non-incorporated label from the value of the label in the total lysate.Adenoviral InfectionReplication-defective adenoviral vectors driving the expression of Myc-tagged S6K1 (Ad-S6K1), kinase-dead S6K1 (Ad-KD-S6K1), and S6K2 (Ad-S6K2) were constructed as previously described (26Patel S.

Adenoviruses were amplified in the permissive HEK-293 host cell line. Viral particles were purified by banding in a CsCl density gradient, and the viral titer was determined by the End-Point Dilution Assay as described before (19Benavides A. Pastor D. Santos P. Tranque P. Calvo S. Glia. 2005; 52: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 20 or 200, which resulted in a high transgene expression. An adenoviral vector expressing the β-galactosidase enzyme was used as control.StatisticsAll data were analyzed using the STATGRAPHICS plus 5.1 software package (Rockville, MD). Comparison between two groups was performed using Student舗s t test. One-way analysis of variance followed by a least significant differences test was applied when multiple comparisons were required. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.DISCUSSIONBy using mouse lacking S6K activity, we have shown for the first time that S6K1 is required for protection against ROS, protein synthesis and astrocyte survival after oxygen and glucose deprivation. Moreover S6K activity limits brain damage induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, an in vivo model of ischemia. Since we and others have shown that the mTOR/S6K pathway is regulated by oxygen and glucose levels, our functional studies define an important signal transduction element for astroglial function during ischemic conditions.A differential display mRNA assay to search for genes involved in the astrocyte response to ischemia led to the first evidence that S6K1 is down-regulated in these cells in response to OGD. This initial strategy to show a reduction in S6K1 mRNA was later complemented with experiments that evidenced a significant diminution in total S6K peptide as well as a profound decline of its active, phosphorylated form. Consistent with the S6K inactivation, phosphorylation of its target, the ribosomal S6 protein, a component of the translation machinery, was also decreased by OGD in astrocytes. In agreement with our data, previous reports have shown dephosphorylation and down-regulation of S6K as a consequence of focal and global brain ischemia in vivo (15Janelidze S. Hu B.R. Siesjö P. Siesjö B.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Martín de la Vega C. Burda J. Nemethova M. Quevedo C. Alcázar A. Martín M.E. Danielisova V. Fando J.L.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is enough evidence to sustain that S6K inactivation may have important consequences for functional recovery. In addition, our work supports the notion that S6K also displays prosurvival functions based on the regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in conditions of cellular stress such as ischemia. This emerging mechanism of protection by S6K would accompany the well known effects of the kinase on cell growth.As previously shown in other cell types, astrocyte cell size depends on S6K activity. Our strategy to ascertain S6K functions on astrocyte exposed to ischemia involved the use of knock-out mice in which both forms of S6K (S6K1 and S6K2) had been suppressed by homologous recombination. Previous studies illustrated that simultaneous deletion of S6K1 and S6K2 provides a significant increase in perinatal lethality as well as a small size phenotype (9Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In turn, deletion of only S6K1 provides a small mice phenotype with reduction of pancreatic β-cells (33Pende M. Kozma S.C. Jaquet M. Oorschot V. Burcelin R. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Klumperman J. Thorens B. Thomas G. Nature. 2000; 408: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and myoblast size (28Ohanna M. Sobering A.K. Lapointe T. Lorenzo L. Praud C. Petroulakis E. Sonenberg N. Kelly P.A. Sotiropoulos A. Pende M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar); whereas S6K2 mutants are normal. Thus, our data showing that S6K1;2−/− astrocytes are smaller than wild-type counterparts are in agreement with earlier work and support the role of this kinase as a master regulator of cell growth. Differences in astrocyte size were marked, because they were clearly visible under the microscope. Moreover, quantification by flow cytometry revealed that S6K suppre"

This action involves CLU forming soluble high molecular weight (HMW) complexes with the client protein. Other than their unquantified large size, the physical characteristics of these complexes were previously unknown. In this study, HMW CLU-citrate synthase (CS), HMW CLU-fibrinogen (FGN), and HMW CLU-glutathione S-transferase (GST) complexes were generated in vitro, and their structures studied using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), ELISA, SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering (DLS), bisANS fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectrophotometry (CD). Densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels indicated that all three HMW CLU-client protein complexes had an approximate mass ratio of 1:2 (CLU:client protein). SEC indicated that all three clients formed complexes with CLU ≥ 4 × 107 Da; however, DLS estimated HMW CLU-FGN to have a diameter of 108.57 ± 18.09 nm, while HMW CLU-CS and HMW CLU-GST were smaller with estimated diameters of 51.06 ± 6.87 nm and 52.61 ± 7.71 nm, respectively. Measurements of bisANS fluorescence suggest that the chaperone action of CLU involves preventing the exposure to aqueous solvent of hydrophobic regions that are normally exposed by the client protein during heat-induced unfolding. CD analysis indicated that, depending on the individual client protein, CLU may interact with a variety of intermediates on protein unfolding pathways with different amounts of native secondary structure. In vivo, soluble complexes like those studied here are likely to serve as vehicles to dispose of otherwise dangerous aggregation-prone misfolded extracellular proteins.

Controlled unfolding is important in many biological processes including protein translocation, degradation by proteases, and regulation of enzyme activity. Uncontrolled unfolding and the consequent accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates is implicated in the pathology of many diseases including Alzheimer disease and type II diabetes and is promoted by various stresses such as oxidative stress (1Davies K.J. Delsignore M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9908-9913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), shear stress (2Ker Y.C. Chen R.H. Lebenson Wiss.

Biol. 2002; 322: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Cells have extensive quality control mechanisms to ensure that intracellular proteins are maintained predominantly in their native conformations. Molecular chaperones are known to play a central role in these systems by targeting unfolded proteins for refolding or degradation (4Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

These findings suggest a role for CLU in the clearance of extracellular misfolded proteins; however, the mechanism by which this may occur has yet to be determined. Currently, little is known about the physical characteristics of the soluble complexes formed during the interaction of CLU with chaperone client proteins (9Humphreys D.T. Carver J.A.

The present study provides new insights into the properties of complexes formed in vitro between CLU and citrate synthase (CS), fibrinogen (FGN), and glutathione S-transferase (GST). 4,4′-Bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate; bisANS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), CS, and FGN were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All buffer salts and H2O2 were obtained from Ajax Chemical Co. Human blood was obtained as a kind gift from Wollongong Hospital (Wollongong, NSW, Australia) and processed to yield plasma, which was stored frozen at −20 °C until used. CLU was purified from human plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography as previously described (23Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GST was expressed in Escherichia coli using the vector pGEX-2T (without an insert; Invitrogen) as previously described (24Heuer K.H. Mackay J.P. Podzebenko P. Bains N.P. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9069-9075Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and purified using a glutathione-SepharoseTM High Performance column according to the manufacturer舗s directions (GE Healthcare). CS (6.0 μm), FGN (6.0 μm), or GST (20 μm) were incubated at 41, 45, or 60 °C, respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) NaN3 (PBS/Az) in the presence or absence of CLU (6.6, 6.5, and 3.2 μm, respectively) or the control protein, BSA (at the same respective molar concentrations). The solutions were added in triplicate 100-μl aliquots to a 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-one). Protein precipitation was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 360 nm (A360 nm; an indication of turbidity) with a FLUOstar Optima incubator microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies). Preheated control proteins were prepared by incubating client proteins or CLU (alone) at the same temperature and for the same duration used to form the HMW complexes. Preheated controls were filtered (0.45 μm) and the clarified solutions assayed for residual protein content using the bicinchoninic microprotein assay (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar), or the respective extinction coefficients at 280 nm. SEC was carried out using a SuperoseTM 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) at the recommended flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and the absorbance at 280 nm continuously monitored using an ÄKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Mass standards were from a commercial high molecular weight calibration kit (GE Healthcare). All buffers and samples were filtered (0.45 μm) before use. SEC-purified HMW complexes were collected from fractions between 7–8 ml in the peak corresponding to the size exclusion limit of ≥ 4 × 107 Da. The integrity of the complexes was checked periodically by reanalysis using the same column. The wells of an ELISA plate (Greiner Bio-one) were coated with purified G7 anti-CLU antibody (23Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), then blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS (BSA/PBS). Mixtures of CLU and client protein were heated as described under “Precipitation Assays,” and fractionated by SEC (as described above). After washing with PBS, proteins eluting at the exclusion limit (≥4 × 107 Da), preheated CLU or client proteins, or a mixture of CLU and individual client proteins were incubated in the wells of the ELISA plate (diluted to 50 μg/ml in BSA/PBS). Then a primary antibody (or antiserum) reactive with the client protein, diluted in BSA/PBS, was added following the manufacturer舗s instructions. Finally an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in BSA/PBS was added following the manufacturer舗s instructions. All incubations were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking and washing was performed with PBS. After a final wash, ortho-phenylenediamine at 2.5 mg/ml in 50 mm citric acid, 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 5, was added. The absorbance at 490 nm (A490 nm) was measured using a SpectraMax Plus384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Nonspecific binding was assessed using a species-matched polyclonal antibody or serum of irrelevant specificity and the appropriate secondary antibody. Primary antibodies used were sheep polyclonal anti-CS (IgG fraction, Abcam), goat anti-FGN antiserum, and rabbit polyclonal anti-GST (IgG fraction, Chemicon). The respective controls were polyclonal anti-apolipoprotein A1 (IgG fraction, Abcam), normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich), and purified normal rabbit IgG fraction (Sigma-Aldrich). Solutions of SEC-purified HMW CLU-CS, HMW CLU-FGN, and HMW CLU-GST complexes, CLU, FGN, CS, or GST (controls were preheated or untreated), or mixtures of these proteins, were made between 0.1 and 1.0 mg/ml in PBS and filtered (0.45 μm). Triplicate samples were examined in low volume plastic cuvettes using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern). Particle diameters were recorded as a frequency distribution curve, and the average diameter and range (average peak and width of 9 normally distributed curves) reported. Several milligrams of CS, FGN, GST, or CLU were extensively dialyzed against distilled water and then freeze-dried. The recovered protein was weighed using a XS205 Dual Range analytical balance (Mettler Toledo). The proteins were redissolved in an appropriate volume of filtered (0.45 μm) PBS and the absorbance at 280 nm of several aliquots measured using a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The average absorbance at 280 nm and the known protein concentration were used to calculate the extinction coefficient using Beer舗s law. These proteins, as well as SEC-purified HMW CLU-CS, HMW CLU-FGN, and HMW CLU-GST complexes were reduced by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and separated on a 12% SDS gel. Six sample wells containing unknown amounts of reduced HMW CLU-CS, HMW CLU-FGN, or HMW CLU-GST complexes, and triplicate wells containing 0.5–6 μg of reduced CS, FGN, GST, or CLU were also loaded onto the gel. Following Coomassie Blue staining and destaining, the major bands corresponding to reduced CS, FGN, GST, and CLU were analyzed using a GS 800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The average optical density/mm2 of the major bands was used to construct a standard curve for each protein. Using these standard curves, the relative amounts of CLU and FGN, CS or GST present in the SEC-purified HMW complexes were calculated. For bisANS analyses, CLU client proteins (0.5 mg/ml CS, 2 mg/ml FGN, or 0.5 mg/ml GST), or mixtures of client proteins (at the same concentrations) and CLU (at 0.4 mg/ml for experiments using CS or FGN, or at 0.2 mg/ml for experiments using GST) were incubated under the same conditions used to form HMW CLU-client protein complexes (see above). At specified time points, samples were taken from the solutions and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Following completion of the time courses, all samples were thawed and immediately diluted in PBS containing bisANS to give final concentrations of 50 μg/ml client protein and 10 μm bisANS. Samples containing CLU alone were diluted to give equivalent concentrations to that present in the (CLU + client protein) samples (i.e. 15 μg/ml or 30 μg/ml). Fluorescence was measured on a FLUOstar Optima fluorescence plate reader using excitation and emission windows of 360 ± 10 and 490 ± 10 nm, respectively. For CD analyses, samples were analyzed as previously described (26Stewart E.M. Aquilina J.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Murphy-Durland D. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S. Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); all samples were in 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4. Individual proteins were analyzed before and after heating (the latter were residual soluble protein) at the following concentrations: CLU at 164 μg/ml, CS at 119 μg/ml, FGN at 164 μg/ml, and GST at 110 μg/ml. In separate experiments, spectra were acquired for HMW complexes of CLU-CS (119 μg/ml), CLU-FGN (164 μg/ml), CLU-GST (110 μg/ml), and solutions of CLU or the individual client proteins at concentrations corresponding to those present in the complexes analyzed (calculated on the basis of the mass ratios of CLU:client protein in the complexes). Estimates of secondary structure were obtained using the program CDSSTR (27Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). For thioflavin T fluorescence assays, all samples were prepared at 50 μg/ml in PBS and contained 62.5 μm thioflavin T; fluorescence was measured using a FLUOstar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies), with an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 nm (slit-width 10 nm). Lysozyme amyloid was formed as described in Ref. 28Yerbury J.J. Poon S. Meehan S. Thompson B. Kumita J.R. Dobson C.M. Wilson M.R. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar. When incubated alone at 41 °C, 6 μm CS showed a progressive increase in turbidity (increasing A360 nm; Fig. 1A) from 0 to about 500 min. No further increase in turbidity was observed after ∼500 min. Under the same conditions, when CLU was present with CS at a near equimolar concentration, no increases in turbidity were detected, indicating that CS was stabilized in solution. At the same concentration, BSA had little effect on the precipitation of CS. Incubation of FGN alone at 45 °C resulted in progressive precipitation of the protein after an initial lag phase of ∼200 min, no further increases in turbidity were measured after 800 min (Fig. 1B). Under the same conditions, co-incubation of 6.5 μm CLU with 6.0 μm FGN completely abolished any increase in turbidity; in contrast, 6.5 μm BSA had little effect on the precipitation of FGN. Incubation of 20 μm GST at 60 °C resulted in rapid precipitation of the protein after a lag phase of ∼25 min (Fig. 1C). After 40 min, the protein solution reached maximum turbidity and prolonged heating had no further effect. Co-incubation of 20 μm GST with 3.2 μm CLU almost completely inhibited the precipitation of GST under the same conditions. This was in contrast to co-incubation with 3.2 μm BSA, where the protein solution exhibited a similar precipitation profile to that observed when GST was incubated alone. However, the maximum turbidity was marginally less in the presence of BSA. Both CLU and BSA were stable when incubated alone at 41–60 °C (data only shown for 60 °C; Fig. 1C). As first reported by Humphreys et al. (9) the effect of CLU on protein precipitation was dose-dependent for all client proteins (data not shown). To produce preheated protein controls, solutions of individual proteins were heated as described above and insoluble protein removed by filtration through a 0.45-μm filter. There was no difference in the SEC profiles of unheated CS, FGN, GST, or CLU and the residual corresponding proteins remaining in solution after the respective heat treatments (Fig. 2). Also, when the residual, soluble heat-treated proteins were mixed, very little interaction was detected by SEC between CLU and CS (Fig. 2A), CLU and FGN (Fig. 2B), or CLU and GST (Fig. 2C). SEC fractionation of the heat-stressed mixtures of CLU and CS (41 °C), CLU and FGN (45 °C), or CLU and GST (60 °C) showed that they contained HMW species eluting at the exclusion limit of the column (≥4 × 107 Da) that were absent from the same mixtures left unheated, and from solutions of the individual proteins (Fig. 2). Compared with FGN and GST, co-incubation of CS with CLU at 41 °C produced proportionally less HMW species; however, it was evident that complexes comparable in mass to those formed at higher temperatures by CLU and FGN or GST were also formed by CLU and CS. The exclusion limit peak was collected in each case and represented putative HMW CLU-client protein complexes. The identity of these complexes was confirmed by sandwich ELISA (see below). These complexes were stored in PBS/Az at 4 °C, and their integrity checked at intervals by SEC; under these conditions they remained stable for months. Sandwich ELISA designed to capture CLU and subsequently detect CS, FGN, or GST was used to confirm the identity of the putative complexes purified by SEC. Relative to the samples containing the HMW complexes, little absorbance was obtained for control samples (Fig. 3). To estimate the stoichiometry of individual proteins within the HMW complexes, SEC-purified complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, the gels stained with Coomassie Blue, and the intensity of individual protein bands quantified by densitometry. After standard curves were generated for each protein, the approximate mass ratios and molar ratios for each complex were calculated. The mass ratio of CLU to client protein was similar for CS, FGN, and GST complexes (about 1:2 in each case). However, the molar ratios were very different; HMW CLU-CS complexes contained approximately the same number of molecules of CS and CLU, HMW CLU-FGN complexes contained about 3 molecules of CLU for every FGN molecule, while CLU-GST complexes contained 5 molecules of GST for each molecule of CLU (Table 1). These estimated CLU:client protein ratios were employed when selecting controls for structural studies of the HMW complexes.TABLE 1Approximate mass and molar ratios of client protein to CLU in SEC-purified HMW CLU-CS, HMW CLU-FGN, and HMW CLU-GST complexesHMW complexConditionsMass ratio (CLU:Client)Standard errorMolar ratio (CLU:Client)Standard error±, n = 3±, n = 3CLU-CS9 h, 41 °C1: 1.810.0271: 1.170.01CLU-FGN12 h, 45 °C1: 1.880.1461: 0.340.03CLU-GST50 min, 60 °C1: 2.110.1681: 5.140.41 Open table in a new tab The results of DLS were consistent between 0.1 and 1 mg/ml; representative results obtained at 0.5 mg/ml are shown (Fig. 4). In contrast to SEC, DLS was unable to resolve the differently sized oligomers of CLU in solution; DLS analysis of CLU samples indicated a normally distributed particle size. There was no apparent difference in size between native and preheated control proteins. The limitations of DLS in determining the respective diameters of particles of similar size, resulted in a peak corresponding to an intermediate size (compared with the individual proteins) when mixtures of residual preheated CLU and CS FGN or GST were analyzed. DLS indicated that SEC purified HMW CLU-CS and HMW CLU-GST were approximately six times larger than either of their respective components, while HMW CLU-FGN was more than 8 times larger than CLU or FGN (Fig. 4). The bisANS fluorescence of individual soluble preheated client proteins showed time-dependent changes. For CS, there was a gradual increase in fluorescence peaking at 6 h, before declining at 8 h (Fig. 5A). FGN showed transient peak fluorescence at 1–2 h before returning to the level of the unheated control (Fig. 5B). For GST, the fluorescence was increased over the period 1–3 h before declining at 4 h (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the bisANS fluorescence of solutions of CLU heated alone only displayed a small increase at 1 h and 6 h after heating at 45 °C (Fig. 5); CLU did not precipitate under any of these conditions (data not shown). In all cases, at times when preheated soluble client protein showed increased bisANS fluorescence, the corresponding fluorescence of the respective preheated mixtures of CLU and client protein showed a lesser change. This suggests that the interaction between CLU and partially unfolded client proteins in theses mixed solutions reduces the extent to which hydrophobic regions on the client proteins are exposed to solvent. Thioflavin T analyses were carried out to determine if SEC-purified complexes possessed any amyloid-like characteristics (i.e. contained β-sheet rich structures). SEC-purified HMW CLU-FGN and CLU-GST complexes and the relevant native and preheated protein controls all produced less than 8% of the fluorescence arising from a sample of lysozyme amyloid present at the same mass concentration (data not shown). The CD spectrum for unheated CLU indicated high α-helical content with minima at ∼208 nm and ∼222 nm. The molar ellipticity at these wavelengths slightly increased when CLU was preheated at 43 or 60 °C. Under these conditions, CDSSTR analysis predicted a large decrease in α-helical content, a similarly large increase in predicted β-sheet content and smaller increases in the predicted contents of β-turn and unordered structure (Fig. 6A and Table 2). However, heating at 41 °C only produced small increases in the predicted content of β-sheet and β-turn structure (Fig. 6A and Table 2). Preheated CS had a CD spectrum superimposable on that of unheated CS (Fig. 6B). In contrast, following heating at 45 °C, FGN showed a change in minima from ∼222 nm to ∼200 nm, consistent with the following predicted changes: a small decrease in α-helical content, a moderate decrease in β-sheet, and small increases in β-turn and unordered structure content (Fig. 6C and Table 2). After heating at 60 °C, GST also showed a change in minima from that typical of high α-helical to a more disordered structure. CDSSTR predicted a substantial decrease in α-helical content and much smaller increases in β-sheet, β-turn, and unordered structure content (Fig. 6D and Table 2). Comparing the CD spectra of SEC-purified HMW CLU-CS complexes with those of mixtures of the native or soluble preheated client proteins suggested that secondary structure was significantly altered in HMW CLU-CS complexes (Fig. 6E). This was largely attributed to a predicted loss of more than half the native α-helical content, compared with the unheated proteins (Table 2). Analysis of the spectrum of a mixture of soluble preheated CS and preheated CLU predicted that, relative to the CLU-CS complex, the proteins had a smaller decrease in α-helical content and an increase in unordered structure. In contrast the CD spectrum for HMW CLU-FGN complexes was virtually superimposable on that of a mixture of native CLU and FGN (Fig. 6F and Table 2). However, a corresponding mixture of preheated CLU and preheated FGN had a very different CD spe"

Measurements of PLC activity in vitro and analysis of membrane binding have suggested that ALI5-type mutations facilitate membrane interactions without compromising substrate binding and hydrolysis. The residue mutated in ALI14 (Tyr-495) is within the spPH domain. Replacement of this residue had no effect on folding of the domain and enhanced Rac activation of PLCγ2 without increasing Rac binding. Importantly, the activation of the ALI14-PLCγ2 and corresponding PLCγ1 variants was enhanced in response to EGF stimulation and bypassed the requirement for phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues. ALI5- and ALI14-type mutations affected basal activity only slightly; however, their combination resulted in a constitutively active PLC.

PLC-catalyzed formation of the second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), constitutes one of the major cell signaling responses. These second messengers provide a common link from highly specific receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, antigens, and growth factors to downstream, intracellular targets; thus, they contribute to regulation of biological functions as diverse as cell motility, fertilization, and sensory transduction.

Of two PLCγ enzymes, PLCγ1 is ubiquitously expressed and appears to regulate a multitude of cellular functions in many tissues. Plcg1-null mice die by embryonic day 9, highlighting the widespread importance of this enzyme (5Ji Q.S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

PLCγ1 is activated in response to growth factor stimulation; in addition, its function in T-cell responses has been extensively documented (1Suh P.G. Park J.I. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Peak J.C. Katan M.

PLCγ2, in contrast, is most highly expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system and plays a key role in regulation of the immune response. Consistent with this, Plcg2-null mice display defects in the functioning of B cells, platelets, mast cells, and natural killer cells (6Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E.

It has been suggested that, in cancer cells, PLCγ1 could function as a key, rate-limiting, common component involved in cell motility triggered by several growth factors and integrins (7Wells A. Adv.

The possibility that the activity of PLCγ could be up-regulated due to mutation has not yet been fully investigated in cancer. Previous studies of PLCγ2, however, have demonstrated the first gain-of-function mutation in a PLC molecule in the context of an organism, and shown that, in principle, PLC activity can be greatly enhanced by point mutations (13Yu P.

Furthermore, this work has demonstrated that such a mutation is linked to a dramatic phenotypic disorder. By using a large scale ENU mutagenesis to discover new immune regulators, several mouse strains were generated with spontaneous autoimmune and inflammatory symptoms; two of these strains harbor a mutation in PLCγ2. In addition to the previously described ALI5 mutation (13Yu P. Constien R. Dear N. Katan M. Hanke P. Bunney T.D. Kunder S. Quintanilla-Martinez L. Huffstadt U. Schröder A. Jones N.P. Peters T.

Notably, while in Plcg2-null mice such responses are lacking, the ALI5 mutation resulted in their enhancement. In particular, further analyses of the ALI5 mutation in the context of signaling in B-cells have demonstrated that calcium responses to the crosslinking of the B-cell receptor were enhanced and prolonged resulting in enhanced deletion of B cells and autoreactivity (13Yu P.

The domain organization of PLCγ enzymes is characterized by the insertion of a highly structured region (PLCγ-specific array, γSA) between the two halves of the TIM-barrel catalytic domain common to all PLCs. The γSA comprises a split PH (spPH) domain flanking two tandem SH2 domains and a SH3 domain (1Suh P.G. Park J.I. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Peak J.C. Katan M. Fukami K. Kataoka T. Yun S. Ryu S.H. BMB Rep. 2008; 41: 415-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A distinct regulatory feature of PLCγ enzymes is that their activation is linked to an increase in phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues (most notably within the γSA) by receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (17Poulin B. Sekiya F. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4276-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Sekiya F. Poulin B. Kim Y.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32181-32190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiple protein-protein interactions (mainly mediated by SH2 domains) also contribute to activation and have an important role in localizing PLCγ into protein complexes with different binding partners, depending on cell type and specific cellular compartments. One mode of activation that is specific for the PLCγ2 isozyme is direct binding to and activation by Rac. The interaction involves the spPH domain, and this activation mechanism does not require tyrosine phosphorylation (19Piechulek T. Rehlen T. Walliser C. Vatter P. Moepps B. Gierschik P. J. Biol.

In molecular terms, changes that lead to PLC activation in response to different input signals, or due to point mutations, are not well understood and require further studies. Here we describe further analysis of the two gain-of-function mutations, ALI5 and ALI14, obtained using ENU mutagenesis. These mutations map to different regions in PLCγ2, and we performed detailed analysis of these regions in both PLCγ isozymes. To characterize the molecular mechanism of gain-of-function, we combined studies in vitro and in different cellular signaling contexts. We have found that ALI5- and ALI14-type point mutations lead, by distinct mechanisms, to an enhancement of responses to a variety of input signals while their combination results in a constitutively active PLC enzyme.

This construct was used to produce baculoviruses. QuikChange PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to introduce point mutations. All mutants were fully sequenced to verify the fidelity of PCR. COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2.5 mm glutamine. Prior to transfection cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well and grown for 16 h in 2 ml/well of the same medium. For transfection, 1.0 μg of PLCγ DNA was mixed with 1 μl of PlusReagentTM and 7 μl of LipofectamineTM (Invitrogen) and added to the cells in 0.8 ml of DMEM without serum. The cells were incubated for 3.5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 before the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with DMEM-containing serum. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with inositol-free DMEM without serum and incubated for 24 h in 1.5 ml of the same medium supplemented with 0.25% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 1.5 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (MP Biomedicals). After a further 24 h, the cells were incubated in 1.2 ml of inositol-free DMEM without serum containing 20 mm LiCl with or without stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF (Calbiochem). The cells were lysed by addition of 1.2 ml of 4.5% perchloric acid. After incubating the samples on ice for 30 min, they were centrifuged for 20 min at 3700 × g. Supernatants and pellets were separated. The supernatants were neutralized by addition of 3 ml of 0.5 m potassium hydroxide/9 mm sodium tetraborate and centrifuged for a further 20 min at 3700 × g. Supernatants were loaded onto AG1-X8 200–400 columns (Bio-Rad) that had been converted to the formate form by addition of 2 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid and equilibrated with water. The columns were washed three times with 5 ml of 60 mm ammonium formate/5 mm sodium tetraborate, and inositol phosphates were eluted with 5 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid. 5 ml Ultima-Flo scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the eluates and the radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The values represent total inositol phosphates. The pellets from the first centrifugation were resuspended in 100 μl of water and 375 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (200:100:15) was added. The samples were vortexed, and an additional 125 μl of chloroform and 125 μl of 0.1 m HCl were added. After further vortexing, the samples were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. 10 μl of the lower phase were placed in a scintillation vial with 3 ml of Ultima-Flo scintillation fluid and the radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The obtained values correspond to radioactivity in inositol lipids. PLC activity is expressed as the total inositol phosphates formed relative to the amount of [3H]myo-inositol in the phospholipid pool. Because the differences in steady state labeling of inositol lipids are small (within 20%), this normalized PLC activity corresponds closely to PLC values expressed as total inositol phosphates; however, the error bars between the duplicates are generally smaller. For production of recombinant PLCγ1 (3–1224) (wild type and mutants), baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were grown in suspension culture in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) in 2000-ml roller bottles. Cells were infected with baculovirus at 1.8 × 106 cell/ml in a 400-ml culture and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C on a rotary shaker at 140 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were stored at −80 °C until required. Frozen pellets were lysed with 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm TCEP, 1 mm AEBSF, 1× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 400 units of DNaseI, pH 8.0) at 4 °C on a rotating wheel for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 1 h, and the recombinant protein was then purified by a five step process. First, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5 ml of HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) with wash buffer A (25 mm Tris/Cl, 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), pH 8.0) and eluted with elution buffer B (25 mm Tris/Cl, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, and 1 mm TCEP, pH 8.0). Second, the purification tags were proteolytically cleaved overnight by TeV protease in cleavage and dialysis buffer C (25 mm Tris/Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm TCEP, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. Third, the cleaved protein was passed over a Ni2+-loaded HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) in buffer C and the flow-through collected. Fourth, the flow-through fraction was loaded on a Superdex 200 26/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in gel filtration buffer D (25 mm Tris/Cl, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP, pH 8.0) and fractions of monomeric protein collected. Finally, these fractions were concentrated by loading on a 1-ml Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) in wash buffer E (20 mm Tris/Cl and 1 mm TCEP, pH 8.0) and elution on a NaCl gradient with elution buffer F (20 mm Tris/Cl, 1 m NaCl and 1 mm TCEP, pH 8.0). Fractions containing concentrated protein were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. The assay was based on the method described in Ellis et al. (23Ellis M.V. James S.R. Perisic O. Downes C.P.

The reaction contained 20 mm Tris/Cl pH 6.8, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% sodium cholate, 200 μm PIP2, and 25 ng of protein in 50 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of spPH proteins was obtained at 25 °C on a Varian UnityPLUS spectrometer (500 MHz) using pulse field gradient-based water suppression. Resonances were obtained from the backbone NH and aromatic side chain CH protons (20Walliser C. Retlich M. Harris R. Everett K.L. Josephs M.B. Vatter P. Esposito D. Driscoll P.C. Katan M.

Alignments of PLCδ1 with PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 were made with ClustalW and used in combination with the PLCδ1 structure (PDB:2ISD) to identify the X and Y region in the catalytic domains. The raw sequences of these regions from PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 were loaded in DeapView/Swiss-PDBViewer and three-dimensional models constructed using the SwissModel server (25Bordoli L. Kiefer F. Arnold K. Benkert P. Battey J. Schwede T. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Side chains were repositioned in optimized conformations using SCWRL (26Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Proteins Suppl. 1999; 3: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Stereochemical verifications of the models were carried out using Procheck (27Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar) and ProSA (28Wiederstein M. Sippl M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar). The models were analyzed using DeapView/Swiss-PDBViewer and Pymol. All surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed at 23 °C using a lipid-coated L1 chip in the BIACORE X system as described previously (29Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing the sensor chip surface with the running buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl), POPC/POPE/POPS/cholesterol/PIP3 (12: 33: 22: 8: 22: 3%) and POPC (100%) vesicles were injected at 5 ml/min to the active surface and the control surface, respectively, to give the same resonance unit (RU) values. The level of lipid coating for both surfaces was kept at the minimum that is necessary for preventing the nonspecific adsorption to the sensor chips. This low surface coverage minimized the mass transport effect and kept the total protein concentration above the total concentration of protein binding sites on vesicles. For PLCγ1 lipid binding measurements, the flow rate was maintained at 15 ml/min for both association and dissociation phases. The PLCγ2 residue altered in ALI5 mice (Asp-993) has been mapped to the structurally defined catalytic domain (Fig. 1A) that has high sequence similarity between different PLC families (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). The residue corresponding to Asp-993 in PLCγ2 is present in all PLC families (Fig. 1B and supplemental, Fig. S1). The two available structures of the catalytic domain from PLCδ1 and PLCβ2 superimpose well and provided a good template for modeling the catalytic domain from PLCγ enzymes. These models are shown in Fig. 1C. Residue Asp-993 and the corresponding Asp-1019 in PLCγ1 are present within one of 3 loops that form a ridge around the active site. The ridge region contains several negatively charged and hydrophobic residues. Residues Asp-1019, Asp-342, Phe-344, and Glu-347 in PLCγ1 correspond to Asp-993, Asp-334, Leu-336, and Glu-339 in PLCγ2, respectively (Fig. 1D). The ALI5 mutation in PLCγ2, D993G, has been analyzed in the context of B-cell signaling, and the data showed an increase in IP3 and calcium generation in stimulated cells in response to BCR activation (13Yu P. Constien R. Dear N. Katan M. Hanke P. Bunney T.D. Kunder S. Quintanilla-Martinez L. Huffstadt U. Schröder A. Jones N.P. Peters T. Fuchs H. Hrabé de Angelis M. Nehls M. Grosse J. Wabnitz P. Meyer T.P.

We first tested whether the impact of this mutation is restricted to B-cell components or has a more general impact on PLCγ2 activity. After transfection in COS cells, the PLCγ2 D993G variant has enhanced activation (about 6-fold) following EGF stimulation or co-transfection with the activated variant of Rac (Fig. 2, A and B). Subsequently, we analyzed the corresponding PLCγ1 mutation with respect to EGF-stimulated activation; this signaling context has been particularly well defined for the PLCγ1 isozyme. The effect of D1019G replacement was similar to the D993G mutation in PLCγ2, giving a severalfold enhancement of activity over the wild type (Fig. 2D). We further tested whether enhanced PLC activation following replacement of Asp-993 or the corresponding Asp-1019 was a consequence of the removal of negative charge in this region or was due to a change in local conformation. As shown in Fig. 2D, the replacement of Asp-1019 by alanine, leucine or asparagine, like the ALI5 mutation (replacement by glycine), resulted in an enhanced activation in EGF-stimulated cells. The most striking activation was observed for the D1019L variant; here the leucine side chain has a similar size to aspartic acid but lacks the negative charge. These data suggest that in the wild-type PLC enzyme, the negative charge of the conserved Asp-1019 residue has a role in limiting PLC activity toward the substrate, presented within the overall negatively charged plasma membrane, and that the removal of this negative charge leads to gain-of-func"
https://openalex.org/W2114104144,"Individual differences in human cognitive abilities show consistently positive correlations across diverse domains, providing the basis for the trait of ""general intelligence"" (g). At present, little is known about the evolution of g, in part because most comparative studies focus on rodents or on differences across higher-level taxa. What is needed, therefore, are experiments targeting nonhuman primates, focusing on individual differences within a single species, using a broad battery of tasks. To this end, we administered a large battery of tasks, representing a broad range of cognitive domains, to a population of captive cotton-top tamarin monkeys (Saguinus oedipus).Using a Bayesian latent variable model, we show that the pattern of correlations among tasks is consistent with the existence of a general factor accounting for a small but significant proportion of the variance in each task (the lower bounds of 95% Bayesian credibility intervals for correlations between g and task performance all exceed 0.12).Individual differences in cognitive abilities within at least one other primate species can be characterized by a general intelligence factor, supporting the hypothesis that important aspects of human cognitive function most likely evolved from ancient neural substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2054138896,"Many gene-encoded neurotoxins with various functions have been discovered in fish, reptiles, and mammals. A novel 60-residue neurotoxin peptide (anntoxin) that inhibited tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) was purified and characterized from the skin secretions of the tree frog Hyla annectans (Jerdon). This is the first gene-encoded neurotoxin found in amphibians. The IC50 of anntoxin for the TTX-S channel was about 3.4 μm. Anntoxin shares sequence homology with Kunitz-type toxins but contains only two of three highly conserved cysteine bridges, which are typically found in these small, basic neurotoxin modules, i.e. snake dendrotoxins. Anntoxin showed an inhibitory ability against trypsin with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 0.025 μm. Anntoxin was distributed in skin, brain, stomach, and liver with a concentration of 25, 7, 3, and 2 μg/g wet tissue, respectively. H. annectans lives on trees or other plants for its entire life cycle, and its skin contains the largest amount of anntoxin, which possibly helps defend against various aggressors or predators. A low dose of anntoxin was found to induce lethal toxicity for several potential predators, including the insect, snake, bird, and mouse.

Amphibians, the first group of organisms forming a connecting link between land and water, have been forced to adapt and survive under a variety of conditions laden with pathogens and predators. Amphibian skin plays key roles in every day survival and the ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions. Although amphibian skin is exposed to biological or non-biological injuries such as microorganism infection, parasitization, predation, and physical harm including radiation and aseptic wound (6Clarke B.T.

Tree frogs spend much more time living on trees than other amphibians, so they may encounter more biotic and abiotic risk factors. A large number and variety of species can prey upon tree frogs, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, spiders, and scorpions. Most tree frogs are green or brown in dorsal coloration that facilitate living in a forest canopy. In addition, there is an excellent chemical defense system in these frogs for maintaining survival. To investigate such chemical defense mechanisms, we purified and characterized a novel neurotoxin peptide from the skin secretions of the tree frog Hyla annectans. Adult H. annectans of both sexes (n = 150; weight range 3–5 g) were collected in the Yunnan Province of China. Their skins were subjected to a 6-volt electronic stimulation for 3–5 s to collect skin secretions. Skin secretions were dissolved with 0.1 m NaCl solution (containing protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). All experiments were approved by the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Peptide purification from the skin secretions was performed by Sephadex G-50 (Superfine, Amersham Biosciences, 2.6 × 100 cm) gel filtration chromatography followed by C8 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, 4The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLCreverse phase high performance liquid chromatographyRMSDroot mean square deviationTTX-Stetrodotoxin-sensitiveTTX-Rtetrodotoxin-resistanceVGSCvoltage-gated sodium channelDRGdorsal root ganglionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flightELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The molecular mass was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) using an AXIMA CFR spectrometer (Kratos Analytical) in positive ion and linear mode. Complete peptide sequencing was undertaken by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems pulsed liquid-phase sequencer, model 491. Assignment of the disulfide bridges was performed as follows. Native peptide (0.1 mg) was digested by endoproteinase Glu-C (34 μg). The hydrolytic fragments of the peptide were recovered by C18 RP-HPLC chromatography and reduced in 20 μl of citrate buffer (1 m, pH 3.0) containing 6 m guanidine-HCl and 0.05 m Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at 40 °C for 5 h. The products were purified again by C18 RP-HPLC chromatography. The masses of all recovered fractions were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and submitted to Edman degradation sequencing. Details are described under supplemental materials. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Ltd.) from the skin of a single sample of amphibian. cDNA was synthesized by SMARTTM techniques using a SMARTTM PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer舗s instruction.

Finally, PCR products were cloned into pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer, Model ABI PRISM 377. The inhibition effects of the peptide isolated upon hydrolysis of synthetic chromogenic substrates (S-2238, H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA, Kabi Vitrum, Stockholm, Sweden) by trypsin were assayed according to methods previously described (24Li J.

Purif. 2006; 47: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which releases anntoxin from the fusion protein. Details are described under supplemental materials. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out to analyze gene expression of anntoxin in H. annectans using a pair of primers (forward: 5′-AGACTTCTGTGGTTTTCTTGGTTGT-3′, and reverse: 5′-CTCGAGGGTTTTGAATCTATTGCCA-3′. Western blotting and ELISA analyses were performed to detect anntoxin expression in eight frog tissues: skin, brain, heart, stomach, liver, intestine, pancreas, and thigh muscle, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant anntoxin. Details are described under supplemental materials. Samples for NMR experiments contained 0.3 ml of 2 mm anntoxin in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH 6.5. For the detection of hydrogen bonds, this sample was lyophilized and redissolved in D2O (99.99%). All NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian Unity Inova 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with three RF channels and a triple resonance z axis pulse-field gradient probe. The tertiary structure calculation was performed according to the standard ARIA/CNS protocol (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Proton-proton distance restraints were derived primarily from the NOESY spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms. Final structures were analyzed using the program packages MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29– 32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Details are described under supplemental materials. Purified recombinant anntoxin was used as antigen to immunize male New Zealand White rabbits in our laboratory. The polyclonal antibodies (IgG) were purified from harvested rabbit sera by double ammonium sulfate precipitations (35% final concentration) and then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The IgG of a negative control was purified from pre-immunized rabbit sera. The acute toxicities of anntoxin against several potential aggressors or predators including insect, snake, bird, and mouse were tested. For all the tested animals, the same volume of buffers was used as a blank control. Bovine serum albumin with the same volume and concentration was administrated as a protein control. The tested animals were observed for 24 h after injection. Survival times were recorded, and the LD50 value was calculated according to a previous report (32Meier J. Theakston R.D. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the animal care and use committee of Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Details are described under supplemental materials. Rat DRG neurons were acutely dissociated and maintained in a short-term primary culture according to the procedures adapted from Xiao et al. (33Xiao Y. Tang J. Yang Y. Wang M. Hu W. Xie J. Zeng X. Liang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26220-26226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Potassium, sodium, and calcium currents were recorded from experimental cells using the whole-cell patch clamp technique by an Axon 700B patch clamp amplifier (AXON, American). The P/4 protocol was used to subtract linear capacitive and leakage currents. Experimental data were acquired and analyzed using the program Clampfit10.0 (AXON) and Sigmaplot (Sigma). Details are described under supplemental materials. Capped cRNAs encoding potassium ion channels (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv2.1, Kv4.2, Kv4.3) were synthesized after linearizing the plasmids and performing the transcription by a standard protocol (34Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Using the linearized plasmids as templates, cRNAs were synthesized in vitro using the large-scale T7, SP6, or T3 mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit (Ambion). These cRNAs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Whole-cell currents from oocytes were recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp (TURBO TEC-03X, NPI Electronic, Germany). Details are described under supplemental materials. Considering that many neurotoxins have trypsin-inhibitory activity (35Liang S. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we used trypsin inhibition as a marker for identifying the possible neurotoxins from all purified fractions. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the skin secretions of H. annectans have been fractionated into several peaks by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. The trypsin-inhibitory activity was concentrated in peak III, which was purified further by C8 RP-HPLC. A sharp peptide peak (III-3) at 215 nm was eluted at acetonitrile percentage of around 40% (Fig. 1B). Tricine-SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed that this peak was a purified peptide (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), which was named anntoxin. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis gave it a mass of 6724.92 (supplemental Fig. S1A). Native anntoxin could inhibit the hydrolysis of synthetic chromogenic substrates by trypsin. The Ki value was determined to be 0.023 μm under the assay conditions. Edman degradation sequencing gave anntoxin a sequence of AQDYRCQLSRNYGKGSGSFTNYYYDKATSSCKTFRYRGSGGNGNRFKTLEDCEATCVTAE. This sequence contains four half-cysteines. Analysis using the ExPASy MW/pI tool showed that anntoxin with all reduced cysteines has a predicted molecular weight of 6728.31, which is 3.4 units larger than the observed mass of 6724.92 (supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting that these cysteines indeed form disulfide bridges. To confirm the intramolecular disulfide bridges, native anntoxin was hydrolyzed by endoproteinase Glu-C, and those hydrolytic fragments were reduced and sequenced by Edman degradation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequencing results (supplemental Fig. S2) indicated that two disulfide bridges were in the sequence of anntoxin, Cys6-Cys56 and Cys31-Cys52 (supplemental Fig. S2). NMR results as described below also confirmed the disulfide bridge profile. Several cDNA clones encoding precursors of annotxin were cloned from a skin cDNA library of H. annectans. The open reading frame of cDNA encodes a polypeptide composed of 81 amino acids, including the mature anntoxin sequence (Fig. 2A, GenBankTM accession FJ598043). The amino acid sequences deduced from the cDNA sequences completely match the amino acid sequences determined by Edman degradation. The cloning further confirms the presence of gene-encoded anntoxin in this frog. With a Blast search, the sequence of mature anntoxin showed an identity of 44% and a similarity of 53% with the snake neurotoxin, dendrotoxin delta-DaTX, or venom basic protease inhibitor K identified from green mamba venoms (2Imredy J.P. Chen C. MacKinnon R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14867-14874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 2B. The Blast search also found the presence of the conserved typsin inhibitor domain and conserved interactive sites (14KGSGST20) with trypsin in the anntoxin sequence (Fig. 2B). To confirm the structure and function of anntoxin and to get enough purified anntoxin for bioassays, the recombinant vector construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 for anntoxin expression. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the expression of recombinant anntoxin was intensively induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion protein was released by formic acid, and then purified by Sephadex G-50 and C18 RP-HPLC. The purified recombinant anntoxin has the same behavior on Tricine-SDS-PAGE as native anntoxin (supplemental Fig. S1, B–D). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis gave it a mass of 6822.01 that matched well with the predicted molecular weight of 6821.43. Its sequence was further confirmed by Edman degradation sequencing. Recombinant anntoxin is bigger than native anntoxin by 97.1 units, resulting from a proline extension at the N terminus of recombinant anntoxin. The recombinant anntoxin had similar trypsin-inhibitory activity as the native anntoxin, with a Ki value of 0.025 μm. Proton resonances of almost all residues of anntoxin are identified in the TOCSY and NOESY spectra except G43 (supplemental Table S1, BMRB ID: 16094). Backbone atom superposition of the 10 lowest energy structures of anntoxin is shown in Fig. 3A (PDB ID: 2KCR). The resonances of the Gly41 to Asn44 region in the NOESY spectrum are severely overlapped. Therefore, distance restraints derived from this region are less reliable, resulting in a large RMSD for this structural region. The average RMSD for the 10 structures is 0.39 Å for backbone and 0.73 Å for overall heavy atoms in secondary structures (residues 21–25, 30–34, 49–59). However, for the whole structure (residues 2–59), this value is 1.89 Å for the backbone and 2.47 Å for heavy atoms. Such large RMSD values are due to a lack of proton-proton distance restraints in loop regions (supplemental Table S2). There is no NOE violation above 0.5 Å. The Ramachandran plot reveals that the distributions of the backbone dihedral angles (ϕ, φ) within the whole structure (residues 1–60) of the ensembles are 64.4% of the residues in the most favored regions, 25.4% in additionally allowed regions, 6.55% in generously allowed regions. The structure of anntoxin resembles the typical Kunitz-type fold, which consists of a twisted β-hairpin (residues Thr20-Phe34), an α-helix (residues Leu49-Ala59), and a short 310 helix (residues Tyr4-Cys6) in the N terminus (Fig. 3B). The disulfide bridges of Cys6-Cys56 and Cys31-Cys52 (Fig. 3C) are confirmed by their direct NOE contacts as well as long range NOEs of the adjacent residues. To compare the structures of anntoxin and other Kunitz-type proteins, the structure of anntoxin was aligned with that of conkunitzin-S1 (PDB ID: 2CA7), which is also a Kunitz-type peptide with two disulfide bridges (Fig. 3D) (36Bayrhuber M. Vijayan V. Ferber M. Graf R. Korukottu J. Imperial J. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Terlau H. Zweckstetter M. Becker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23766-23770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These two structures possess similar secondary structures and fold. The RMSD for the two structures is 1.05 Å, indicating anntoxin adopts a typical Kunitz fold. Frog tissues including skin, brain, heart, stomach, liver, intestine, pancreas, and thigh muscle were used to check the tissue expression of anntoxin and its mRNA. By RT-PCR analysis, it was found that only three tissues including skin, brain, and liver have anntoxin mRNA (Fig. 4A). By Western blotting using the antibody against recombinant anntoxin, the peptide anntoxin was found in four tissues including skin, brain, stomach, and liver (Fig. 4B). Anntoxin was found in stomach although no mRNA was cloned by RT-PCR. The reason could be either that the frog stomach might have trace anntoxin mRNA that cannot be checked by RT-PCR or the anntoxin was transferred from other tissues to stomach. The amounts of anntoxin in these tissues were determined by ELISA. Compared with other tissues, skin was the tissue containing the highest concentration of anntoxin (around 25 μg/g WT). There are 7, 3, and 2 μg/g WT anntoxin concentrations in brain, stomach, and liver, respectively (Fig. 4C). Recombinant anntoxin showed lethal toxicities against tested animals like insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Administered intraperitoneally, the toxic dose (LD50) against L. exigua Hubner, E. plumbea, C. coturnix, and Kunming mice is 0.05, 0.45, 2.5, and 3 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Anntoxin could rapidly exert its toxicity against these animals. Insects (L. exigua Hubner) administered the toxin intensively wriggled 5–10 s after injection and lost mobility after 1–3 min of injection. Snakes (E. plumbea) had a comparatively slow response for the toxin administration, and the toxicosis symptom of wriggling was observed after 2–3 h of injection. The toxicosis symptoms of the common quails (C. coturnix) were respiratory distress, convulsion, leg paralysis, and shambling/tottering after 2–5 min of injection. The Kunming mice injected with the toxin showed symptoms of respiratory distress, rotating, and convulsions after 2–5 min of injection. All these results indicated that anntoxin is a highly lethal toxin. The biological activity of the peptide on voltage-gated channels was performed using a whole-cell patch clamp recording technique. Sodium currents were elicited from adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons by a depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. As seen in Fig. 5A, 1 μm anntoxin inhibited tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium current amplitude only by 23 ± 5%, but when toxin concentration in the extracellular solution increased 10-fold, almost 75 ± 10% of TTX-S sodium current amplitude was depressed with a time constant (τ) of 62.5 s (Fig. 5D). Because both TTX-S and tetrodotoxin resistance (TTX-R) sodium channels are expressed in small DRG neurons, we added 200 nm TTX into extracellular solution to separate TTX-R currents from mixture currents. However, the following application of 10 μm toxin exhibited no effect on TTX-R currents (Fig. 5B). The IC50 of anntoxin for TTX-S channels estimated from the concentration effect curve was about 3.4 μm (Fig. 5C). The current-voltage (Fig. 5E) curve of TTX-S sodium channels indicated that anntoxin did not change the threshold of activation or the activation voltage of inward peak currents, and there was also no shift in the membrane reversal potential, implying that it did not change the ion selectivity of channels. As seen in Fig. 6A, calcium current amplitude is depressed only by 7 ± 5% when exposed to 10 μm anntoxin. Outward potassium currents were elicited from adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons by a depolarization to 30 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. 10 μm anntoxin reduced the control potassium current amplitude in rat DRG neurons by 14 ± 8% (Fig. 6B). Using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique, we also observed the actions of the anntoxin on six potassium channel isoforms (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3 and Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. When the cells were held at −80 mV, the activities of four potassium channel isoforms (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kv2.1) that we tested were not significantly affected by anntoxin at the same concentration (Fig. 6, C–F). Another two potassium channel isoforms (Kv4.2 and 4.3) were not affected by anntoxin at all (data not shown). Results indicated that the anntoxin might have little effect on outward potassium channels. Anntoxin, a novel neurotoxin peptide, was purified and characterized from skin secretions of the tree frog, H. annectans. It is composed of 60 amino acid residues including 4 cysteines. This is the first gene-encoded neurotoxin ever found in amphibians. The two disulfide bridges in anntoxin, Cys6-Cys56 and Cys31-Cys52 (Fig. 2B), are assigned and confirmed by sequence analysis of hydrolytic fragments by endoproteinase Glu-C (supplemental Fig. S2) and NMR experiments (Fig. 3). Anntoxin shares sequence homology with Kunitz-type protein toxins, i.e. snake dendrotoxins, although anntoxin lacks one highly conserved cysteine bridge (Fig. 2B). Just like other Kunitz-type protein toxins, anntoxin shows a typical Kunitz-type fold, which consists of a twisted β-hairpin (residues Thr20-Phe34), an α-helix (residues Leu49-Ala59), and a short 310 helix (residues Tyr4-Cys6) in the N terminus (Fig. 3). The trypsin-inhibitory function of anntoxin further supports the model of a Kunitz-type fold. Similar to other neurotoxins, anntoxin showed lethal toxicities against potential aggressors or predators including insect, snake, bird, and mouse at a low dose. Most of the tested animals showed obvious intoxication symptoms a short time after administration of anntoxin. Anntoxin was mainly expressed in the frog skin (25 μg/g WT), while only minor expression was found in brain (7 μg/g WT), stomach (3 μg/g WT), and liver (2 μg/g WT) (Fig. 4). Amphibian naked skins are directly exposed to environmental factors, and thus they have to act on the first line against various aggressions and injuries. Most amphibian skins are devoid of good physical protection, but they have a perfect chemical defense system. The chemical system is made up of many bioactive substances eliciting pharmacological effects like cardiotoxic, myotoxic, neurotoxic, and antimicrobial activities (4Daly J.W. Myers C.W. Whittaker N. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 1023-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 5Daly J.W. Highet R.J. Myers C.W. Toxicon. 1984; 22: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Clarke B.T. Biol.

All these properties clearly repel potential predators or pathogens. Anntoxin is an important component of the skin chemical defense system of the tree frog, H. annectans. Anntoxin舗s strong and fast-acting toxicity against potential predators and its skin distribution with a high concentration make it an excellent chemical component to act as the first-line defense and enable the forest-living frog to evolve an ecological adaptation. Potassium channels are the largest and most diverse class of voltage-gated ion channels. As of now, nearly 100 genes encoding potassium channel have been characterized (37Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 38Manganas L.N. Wang Q. Scannevin R.H. Antonucci D.E. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14055-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Considering the structural similarity of anntoxin with snake potassium channel neurotoxins and conkunitzin-S1 (36Bayrhuber M. Vijayan V. Ferber M. Graf R. Korukottu J. Imperial J. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Terlau H. Zweckstetter M. Becker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23766-23770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a 60-residue potassium channel neurotoxin from the venom of the cone snail Conus striatus (Fig. 2B), we hypothesized that anntoxin may have some effect on the potassium channel. As illustrated in Fig. 6, anntoxin had little effect on the potassium current amplitude. Six potassium channel isoforms including Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv2.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3, were tested without being significantly affected by anntoxin. In addition, anntoxin had no effect on the calcium channel (Fig. 6A). Results of our experiments have proven that anntoxin inhibits the neuronal TTX-S voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), with an IC50 value of 3.4 μm in adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, and no significant effect on the TTX-R VGSC (Fig. 5). VGSCs play important roles in electrical signaling in almost all kinds of excitable tissues. They are responsible for the generation of action potentials and nervous influx conduction in sensory nerves (39Narahashi T. Deguchi T. Urakawa N. Ohkubo Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1960; 198: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Roy M.L. Narahashi T. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Up to date, two different types of VGSC, TTX-S and TTX-R VGSCs have been found (40Roy M.L. Narahashi T. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many neurotoxins such as ciguatoxin (41Strachan L.S. Lewis R.J. Nicholson G.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 379-388PubMed Google Scholar), scorpion toxins (42Possani L.D. Becerril B.

Toxicon. 2003; 41: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have shown interaction with VGSCs. All the neurotoxins from scorpion, conus, and spider contain at least three disulfide bridges. However, the anntoxin described in the current report only possesses two disulfide bridges. It is the first neurotoxin interacting with VGSC ever found containing other than three disulfide bridges. This unique structure of anntoxin may be a powerful tool for the study of the interaction between VGSCs and neurotoxins. Although conkunitzin-S1, which shares the same disulfide bridge motif as anntoxin, has been demonstrated to inhibit shaker potassium channels (Kv1) (36Bayrhuber M. Vijayan V. Ferber M. Graf R. Korukottu J. Imperial J. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Terlau H. Zweckstetter M. Becker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23766-23770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), our study results show that its analogue anntoxin exhibited no significant effect on potassium current. On the other hand, anntoxin could markedly inhibit the TTX-S VGSC. Therefore, divergent amino acid residues between conkunitzin-S1 and anntoxin might be responsible for the different ion channel interaction behavior. In summary, the anntoxin in the current report is the first gene-encoded neurotoxin found in amphibians. This neurotoxin with its special disulfide bridge motif should aid in the investigation of multiple molecular forms of VGSCs. Further work needs be done to explore the interaction of anntoxin with VGSCs. Download .zip (.55 MB) Help with zip files"
https://openalex.org/W2127356527,"BNIP3 (Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3) is a BH3-only proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Because the interaction of Bcl-2 proteins with intracellular Ca(2+) stores has been linked to apoptosis, the role of Ca(2+) transfer between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in BNIP3-mediated cell death was determined in a rat dopaminergic neuronal cell line, Mes 23.5. BNIP3 mutants were constructed to target either ER or mitochondria. Localization of BNIP3 to the ER membrane facilitated release of Ca(2+) and subsequently increased uptake of Ca(2+) into mitochondria. Excessive accumulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), resulting in execution of a caspase-independent cell death. Reduction of ER Ca(2+) induced by ER-targeted BNIP3 and the subsequent cell death was blocked by the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2. On the other hand, mitochondria-targeted BNIP3 initiated apoptosis by a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism by inducing mitochondrial pore transition and dissipation of DeltaPsi(m). The disruption of DeltaPsi(m) and cell death was not blocked by Bcl-2 overexpression. These findings show that BNIP3 undergoes a dual subcellular localization and initiates different cell death signaling events in the ER and mitochondria. Bcl-2 counters the BNIP3-initiated mobilization of ER Ca(2+) depletion to reduce the level of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2011102026,"For understanding the spread of infectious diseases it is crucial to have knowledge of the patterns of contacts in a population during which the infection can be transmitted. Besides contact rates and mixing between age groups, the way individuals distribute their contacts across different locations may play an important role in determining how infections spread through a population.Representative surveys were performed in eight countries to assess the number of social contacts (talking to another person at close distance either with or without physical contact), using a diary approach in which participants recorded individual contacts. The overall sample size was 7290 respondents. We analyzed the reported numbers of contacts per respondent in six different settings (household, work, school, leisure, transportation and others) to define different contact profiles. The identification of the profiles and classification of respondents according to these profiles was conducted using a two-step cluster analysis algorithm as implemented in SPSS. We identified seven distinct contact profiles: respondents having (1) mixed: contacts predominantly at school, during transportation and leisure time, (2) contacts during leisure time, (3) contacts mainly in the household (large family), (4) contacts at work, (5) contacts solely at school, (6) contacts in other places and finally (7) respondents having a low number of contacts in any setting. Similar contact profiles can be found in all eight European countries which participated in the study. The distributions of respondents across the profiles were similar in all countries. The profiles are dominated by work, school and household contacts. But also contacts during leisure activities play an important role in the daily lives of a large fraction of individuals. A surprisingly large number of individuals has only few contacts in all locations. There was a distinct age-dependence in the distribution of the population across contact profiles.In contrast with earlier studies that focussed on the contribution of different age groups to the spread of an infectious disease, our results open up the opportunity to analyze how an infection spreads between locations and how locations as work or school are interconnected via household contacts. Mathematical models that take these local contact patterns into account can be used to assess the effect of intervention measures like school closure and cancelling of leisure activities on the spread of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2079110780,"Termination of RNA polymerase (pol) II transcription in vivo requires the 5'-RNA exonuclease Rat1. It was proposed that Rat1 degrades RNA from the 5'-end that is created by transcript cleavage, catches up with elongating pol II, and acts like a Torpedo that removes pol II from DNA. Here we test the Torpedo model in an in vitro system based on bead-coupled pol II elongation complexes (ECs). Recombinant Rat1 complexes with Rai1, and with Rai1 and Rtt103, degrade RNA extending from the EC until they reach the polymerase surface but fail to terminate pol II. Instead, the EC retains an approximately 18-nucleotide RNA that remains with its 3'-end at the active site and can be elongated. Thus, pol II termination apparently requires a factor or several factors in addition to Rat1, Rai1, and Rtt103, post-translational modifications of these factors, or unusual reaction conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2005745123,"Mutations in the apically located Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) co-transporter, NKCC2, lead to type I Bartter syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disorder, yet the mechanisms underlying the regulation of mutated NKCC2 proteins in renal cells have not been investigated. Here, we identified a trihydrophobic motif in the distal COOH terminus of NKCC2 that was required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit and surface expression of the co-transporter. Indeed, microscopic confocal imaging showed that a naturally occurring mutation depriving NKCC2 of its distal COOH-terminal region results in the absence of cell surface expression. Biotinylation assays revealed that lack of cell surface expression was associated with abolition of mature complex-glycosylated NKCC2. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that the absence of mature protein was not caused by reduced synthesis or increased rates of degradation of mutant co-transporters. Co-immunolocalization experiments revealed that these mutants co-localized with the ER marker protein-disulfide isomerase, demonstrating that they are retained in the ER. Cell treatment with proteasome or lysosome inhibitors failed to restore the loss of complex-glycosylated NKCC2, further eliminating the possibility that mutant co-transporters were processed by the Golgi apparatus. Serial truncation of the NKCC2 COOH terminus, followed by site-directed mutagenesis, identified hydrophobic residues (1081)LLV(1083) as an ER exit signal necessary for maturation of NKCC2. Mutation of (1081)LLV(1083) to AAA within the context of the full-length protein prevented NKCC2 ER exit independently of the expression system. This trihydrophobic motif is highly conserved in the COOH-terminal tails of all members of the cation-chloride co-transporter family, and thus may function as a common motif mediating their transport from the ER to the cell surface. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model whereby naturally occurring premature terminations that interfere with the LLV motif compromise co-transporter surface delivery through defective trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2132043066,"Cocaine, a potent addictive substance, is an inhibitor of monoamine transporters, including DAT (dopamine transporter), SERT (serotonin transporter) and NET (norepinephrine transporter). Cocaine administration induces complex behavioral alterations in mammals, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we tested the effect of cocaine on C. elegans behavior. We show for the first time that acute cocaine treatment evokes changes in C. elegans locomotor activity. Interestingly, the neurotransmitter serotonin, rather than dopamine, is required for cocaine response in C. elegans. The C. elegans SERT MOD-5 is essential for the effect of cocaine, consistent with the role of cocaine in targeting monoamine transporters. We further show that the behavioral response to cocaine is primarily mediated by the ionotropic serotonin receptor MOD-1. Thus, cocaine modulates locomotion behavior in C. elegans primarily by impinging on its serotoninergic system."
https://openalex.org/W2012406431,"BdbD is a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase (TDOR) from Bacillus subtilis that functions to introduce disulfide bonds in substrate proteins/peptides on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane and, as such, plays a key role in disulfide bond management. Here we demonstrate that the protein is membrane-associated in B. subtilis and present the crystal structure of the soluble part of the protein lacking its membrane anchor. This reveals that BdbD is similar in structure to Escherichia coli DsbA, with a thioredoxin-like domain with an inserted helical domain. A major difference, however, is the presence in BdbD of a metal site, fully occupied by Ca(2+), at an inter-domain position some 14 A away from the CXXC active site. The midpoint reduction potential of soluble BdbD was determined as -75 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode, and the active site N-terminal cysteine thiol was shown to have a low pK(a), consistent with BdbD being an oxidizing TDOR. Equilibrium unfolding studies revealed that the oxidizing power of the protein is based on the instability introduced by the disulfide bond in the oxidized form. The crystal structure of Ca(2+)-depleted BdbD showed that the protein remained folded, with only minor conformational changes. However, the reduced form of Ca(2+)-depleted BdbD was significantly less stable than reduced Ca(2+)-containing protein, and the midpoint reduction potential was shifted by approximately -20 mV, suggesting that Ca(2+) functions to boost the oxidizing power of the protein. Finally, we demonstrate that electron exchange does not occur between BdbD and B. subtilis ResA, a low potential extra-cytoplasmic TDOR."
https://openalex.org/W2016655140,"Histidine-aspartate phosphorelays are employed by two-component signal transduction family proteins to mediate responses to specific signals or stimuli in microorganisms and plants. The RedCDEF proteins constitute a novel signaling system in which four two-component proteins comprising a histidine kinase, a histidine-kinase like protein, and two response regulators function together to regulate progression through the elaborate developmental program of Myxococcus xanthus. A combination of in vivo phenotypic analyses of in-frame deletions and non-functional point mutations in each gene as well as in vitro autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer analyses of recombinant proteins indicate that the RedC histidine kinase protein autophosphorylates and donates a phosphoryl group to the single domain response regulator, RedF, to repress progression through the developmental program. To relieve this developmental repression, RedC instead phosphorylates RedD, a dual receiver response regulator protein. Surprisingly, RedD transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine kinase-like protein RedE, which itself appears to be incapable of autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RedE may render RedE accessible to RedF, where it removes the phosphoryl group from RedF-P, which is otherwise an unusually stable phosphoprotein. These analyses reveal a novel “four-component” signaling mechanism that has probably arisen to temporally coordinate signals controlling the developmental program in M. xanthus.

These systems couple a vast array of signals to regulation of highly diverse processes, such as induction of virulence factors, formation of biofilms, sporulation initiation, chemotaxis, quorum sensing, and nutrition utilization (reviewed in Refs. 1Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The defining feature of these systems is the presence of conserved protein domains that participate in signal transmission via phosphotransfer between histidine and aspartate residues. Specifically, the conserved domains include an HisKA dimerization phospho-accepting domain, which usually contains an invariant histidine as the phospho-accepting residue; a HATPase_c domain, which binds and hydrolyzes ATP to donate the γ-phosphoryl group to the HisKA domain; and a receiver (REC) domain, which contains an invariant aspartic acid as a phospho-accepting domain (reviewed in Ref. 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). These conserved signaling domains are highly modular and can be coupled to a vast variety of signal/stimulus sensing or output domains (4Galperin M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4169-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 5Mascher T. Helmann J.D. Unden G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 910-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).TCS systems are named after the most common and simple arrangement of these domains into two components: a histidine protein kinase (HK), in which the HisKA and HATPase_c domains (collectively the transmitter region) are preceded by a variable signal sensing region, and a response regulator (RR) protein in which a REC domain is followed by a variable output (effector) domain (2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). In these classical TCS systems, the HK autophosphorylates in response to a change in a specific signal/stimulus, and the phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the RR, which then modulates the activity of the associated output domain (2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). Typically, the HK and RR genes are encoded together as a pair in a single transcriptional unit.TCS systems can also consist of more than a single HK and RR pair. In multistep His-Asp phosphorelay systems, an HK first phosphorylates a receiver (REC1) domain, and the phosphoryl group is subsequently passed to a histidine residue contained in an additional histidine-containing phosphotransferase (Hpt)/Spo0B domain. The phosphoryl group is then transferred from the Hpt/Spo0B domain to the receiver (REC2) of the terminal RR, which mediates the adaptive response (6Perraud A.L. Weiss V. Gross R. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Histidine phosphotransferase domains alone are not capable of kinase or phosphatase activities. Although Hpt domains share little sequence similarity, structural analyses demonstrate that they share a common four-helix bundle structure in which the phosphorylated histidine lies within a helix (7Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Song H.K. Lee J.Y. Lee M.G. Moon J. Min K. Yang J.K. Suh S.W. J. Mol.

In these multistep phosphorelay systems, examples exist in which the HK, REC1, and Hpt domains are arranged into the same protein (12Uhl M.A. Miller J.F.

In addition to multistep phosphorelay TCS systems, so-called “many-to-one” or “one-to-many” TCS systems (16Skerker J.M. Prasol M.S. Perchuk B.S. Biondi E.G. Laub M.T. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) have been described in which more than one sensor kinase feeds into a single RR (17Jiang M. Shao W. Perego M. Hoch J.A. Mol.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or a single HK functions with more than one cognate RR (19Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), respectively. These branched systems are thought to be employed to integrate signals into a single output or to coordinate diverse responses to one signal, respectively.Myxococcus xanthus is a ubiquitous Gram-negative soil-dwelling bacterium with a complex and elaborate multicellular life cycle and is a model organism for complex social behaviors. Under nutrient-rich conditions, M. xanthus cells exhibit cooperative feeding (20Rosenberg E. Keller K.H. Dworkin M. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 770-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the cells swarm in groups and secrete antibiotics and digestive enzymes to paralyze and digest prey microorganisms or digest decaying organic material (21Reichenbach H. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Under nutrient-limited conditions, M. xanthus cells aggregate into mounds (fruiting bodies) of ∼105 cells and, within these fruiting bodies, differentiate into environmentally resistant spores (reviewed in Ref. 22Shimkets L.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 525-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The developmental program requires at least 72 h under laboratory conditions. It is assumed that formation of multicellular spore-filled fruiting bodies aids in the dispersal of groups of spores to more favorable environments such that the spores germinate in groups and cooperative feeding is facilitated. Regulation of the developmental program requires integration of information relating to both individual cells and groups of cells, including starvation status and population density, and requires cells to be both temporally and positionally coordinated (22Shimkets L.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 525-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 23Kaiser D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 75-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Progression through the M. xanthus development program is subject to both positive and negative regulation by TCS systems (listed in Ref. 24Shi X. Wegener-Feldbrügge S. Huntley S. Hamann N. Hedderich R. Søgaard-Andersen L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Positive regulators, such as the HKs SdeK (25Pollack J.S. Singer M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3589-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), AsgA (26Plamann L. Li Y. Cantwell B. Mayor J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2014-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the RR FruA (27Ellehauge E. Nørregaard-Madsen M. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), function to promote developmental progression, and mutants in these genes prevent completion of the developmental program. Interestingly, however, in M. xanthus, several TCS signaling systems have been shown to be negative regulators, including EspA (28Cho K. Zusman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Higgs P.I. Jagadeesan S. Mann P. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4416-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), TodK (30Rasmussen A.A. Søgaard-Andersen L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5452-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), EspC (31Lee B. Higgs P.I. Zusman D.R. Cho K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5029-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and RedCDEF (32Higgs P.I. Cho K. Whitworth D.E. Evans L.S. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8191-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Disruption of these genes causes the cells to progress through the developmental program more quickly, suggesting that the corresponding proteins function to repress progression through the developmental program. This early development phenotype is also associated with the formation of more disorganized, sometimes smaller and more numerous fruiting bodies, and inappropriate sporulation outside of the fruiting bodies, but the sporulation efficiency is not reduced. It is likely that these systems are therefore necessary to ensure coordinated behavior during the complex multicellular developmental program of M. xanthus.In particular, the complex Red signaling system is intriguing, since it consists of four adjacent genes encoding putative two-component signal transduction proteins (redC, -D, -E, and -F), which are arranged in a single operon consisting of at least seven genes (redA to -F) (32Higgs P.I. Cho K. Whitworth D.E. Evans L.S. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8191-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RedC and RedD encode a predicted membrane-bound HK and a dual receiver domain RR, respectively, whereas RedE and RedF encode a histidine kinase-like protein and a single receiver domain RR, respectively. A combination of genetic epistasis and yeast two-hybrid analyses suggests that these four proteins probably function in a single signaling system to regulate progression through the developmental program, but the mechanism of signal transduction is unknown (32Higgs P.I. Cho K. Whitworth D.E. Evans L.S. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8191-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Here, we employ a combination of genetic and biochemical analyses to characterize each of these four Red TCS proteins. We demonstrate that the HK RedC autophosphorylates and donates a phosphoryl group to the RRs RedF and RedD. Interestingly, the HK-like protein RedE does not appear to autophosphorylate but instead receives a phosphoryl group from the RR RedD and additionally acts as a phosphatase for the RR RedF-P. The phosphorylated form of RedF appears to be abnormally stable in vitro. Analysis of the developmental phenotypes of mutants in each gene indicates that RedC and RedF are necessary to repress developmental progression, whereas RedD and RedE are necessary to relieve this repression. These data are assembled into a model of a novel “four-component” signaling mechanism.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we characterized a complex TCS system consisting of four proteins: RedC, a membrane-bound HK; RedD, a dual receiver RR; RedE, an HK-like protein; and RedF, a stand-alone receiver domain. We demonstrated that RedD, RedE, and RedF are expressed both in the vegetative and developmental phases of the M. xanthus life cycle. We can indirectly determine that RedC is also present based on the following observations: 1) RedD, RedE, and RedF protein levels are drastically reduced in ΔredC, but not redCH253A, mutants, and 2) red transcript levels are the same in these two mutants (data not shown), indicating that deletion of redC does not somehow decrease red transcript levels. These observations suggest that RedD, RedE, and RedF are degraded in the absence of RedC. Consequently, if at least RedD, RedE, or RedF is present, RedC is very likely also present.Using a combination of in vivo phenotype analysis and in vitro autophosphorylation/phosphotransfer analyses, we propose a model for how these four proteins function together to regulate progression through the developmental program of M. xanthus (Fig. 6). A combination of genetic and biochemical data suggests that repression of the developmental program is mediated by RedC HK-dependent phosphorylation of RedF RR (RedF-P). First, redCH253A, ΔredF, and redFD61A mutants display an early developmental phenotype, indicating that RedC kinase activity and phosphorylated RedF are necessary to mediate developmental repression. Second, the redCH253A ΔredF double mutant displays an early developmental phenotype that is most similar to that of the ΔredF mutant. Although both mutants develop early, the ΔredF and redCH253A ΔredF double mutants consistently form darker and more disorganized fruiting bodies than the redCH253A mutant, indicating that ΔredF is epistatic to redCH253A and suggesting that RedF functions downstream to RedC. Finally, recombinant RedC in E. coli membrane fractions autophosphorylates and transfers a phosphoryl group to RedF.Our data suggest that repression of the developmental program is relieved when RedC HK phosphorylates residue Asp-60 on the first receiver domain of RedD RR instead of RedF (Fig. 6). The phosphoryl group is passed from RedD RR to the HK-like RedE protein on His-24, RedE becomes accessible to RedF-P RR, and RedE then removes the phosphoryl group from RedF-P. The evidence for this part of the model is as follows. First, ΔredE and ΔredD mutants display a delayed developmental phenotype, suggesting that they are necessary to promote the release of developmental repression. Consistent with RedF as the output for the Red system, ΔredF is epistatic to both ΔredE and ΔredD based on the developmental phenotype of the respective double mutants. Second, we observed that in vitro both RedC-T-P and full-length RedC phosphorylate RedD REC1, that a phosphoryl group is transferred from RedD-P to RedE His-24, and that RedE acts as a phosphatase on RedF-P.In our model, RedE is only an efficient phosphatase on RedF-P after it receives a phosphoryl group from RedD-P. First, we observed phosphotransfer from RedD-P to the conserved His-24 in RedE in vitro. Second, the redEH24A mutant phenocopies the ΔredE mutant, indicating that His-24 is essential for RedE function. Third, the phosphatase activity of RedE on RedF-P is not disrupted by the H24A mutation in vitro, indicating that phosphorylation is not necessary for phosphatase activity per se. Together, these results suggest that in vivo RedE is normally not accessible to RedF-P, perhaps because it is sequestered by another protein or differentially localized relative to RedF-P. Phosphorylation of RedE could then release RedE such that it can then act as a phosphatase on RedF-P. Alternatively, it may simply be that the specific activity of RedE-P is higher than that of RedE such that in in vivo, RedE does not effectively dephosphorylate RedF-P.Consistent with the observation that RedE is necessary to release the phosphoryl group from RedF-P, the phosphorylated form of the RedF protein is unusually stable in vitro. Our data indicate that ∼90% of the radiolabeled phosphoryl group can still be detected on RedF after a 72-h incubation, which means that RedF is the most stable phosphorylated receiver thus far described (47Thomas S.A. Brewster J.A. Bourret R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The intrinsic autodephosphorylation activity of receiver domains varies widely and has been shown to be dependent on the nature of the amino acids located in at least two variable active site residues, and it is generally correlated with the time scale of the biological process being controlled (47Thomas S.A. Brewster J.A. Bourret R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consistently, the biological process in the case of RedF is control of the lengthy developmental program of M. xanthus. We observed that RedF is present not only during vegetative conditions but also up to 30–36 h of development, suggesting that the protein could indeed be functionally active for an extended period of time.The observation that RedF-P is extremely stable may also explain some of the subtle details of certain red mutant phenotypes. For instance, the redCH253A mutant has a slightly less severe early development phenotype than the redFD61A mutant, suggesting that RedF is phosphorylated at a low level in the redCH253A background. Although it is possible that there is an additional minor RedF phosphodonor, which is a genuine input into Red-mediated repression of development, it is also likely that RedF is subject to nonspecific phosphorylation at a low level. The latter interpretation may also explain the mixed early aggregation/reduced sporulation phenotype observed in the redCH253A ΔredD background; during the long developmental program, nonspecifically phosphorylated RedF would continue to accumulate in the absence of RedD-induced RedE phosphatase activity, and developmental progression could be eventually repressed, leading to the reduced sporulation phenotype.Our data suggest that the output of the Red system is modulated through the phosphorylation state of RedF, which in turn probably depends upon whether RedC is either phosphorylating RedF or RedD. We do not yet understand the nature of the signal(s) that control this choice, but given the necessity of the NH2-terminal domain for the RedC-dependent phosphorylation of RedF, the NH2-terminal region probably constitutes a sensing domain, which, depending upon signal occupancy, could modulate kinase activity and/or the affinity of RedC for either RedF or RedD. A similar observation was made in the three-component CbbRRS TCS system of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, in which the NH2-terminal sensing domain of the HK CbbSR is necessary for determining which of the two RR proteins (CbbRR1 or CbbRR2) becomes phosphorylated (48Romagnoli S. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2780-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 49Romagnoli S. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that the second receiver domain in RedD (REC2), for which we have not currently identified a role, is involved in integrating signals from an unidentified histidine protein kinase such that phosphorylation of RedD REC2 could alter the affinity of RedD REC1 for RedC or, alternatively, RedE. Interestingly, sequence alignments of the individual receiver domains of RedD indicate that the two receivers belong to different receiver domain subfamilies, as designated by Grebe and Stock (50Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 139-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RedD REC1 belongs to receiver class A4 containing NtrC-like RRs, whereas RedD REC2 belongs to family A3 containing CheY-like receiver domains. 3S. Huntley and L. Søgaard-Andersen, personal communication. Interestingly, RedC groups with the NtrB family of kinases (consistent with its role as a kinase for RedD REC1), and we speculate that RedD REC2 could function to integrate signals from an additional TCS system.An additional important question is how the stand-alone receiver protein RedF could modulate progression through the developmental program. In one scenario, RedF-P could interact with a histidine phosphotransferase and function in a multistep phosphorelay system similar to the role of Spo0F in induction of sporulation in Bacillus species. Spo0F is a single domain RR that provides a phosphoryl group to a histidine phosphotransferase protein, which subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to a DNA-binding RR that directly controls gene transcription (15Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Hpt domains can be difficult to identify by sequence alone, and no convincing candidates for the Red system have been identified in M. xanthus. In an alternate scenario, RedF could function as an allosteric stimulator of an additional unknown kinase, similar to the effect of DivK of Caulobacter crescentus on PleC (51Paul R. Jaeger T. Abel S. Wiederkehr I. Folcher M. Biondi E.G. Laub M.T. Jenal U. Cell. 2008; 133: 452-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Finally, RedF could function by directly interacting with an effector protein that modulates the developmental program in a manner analogous to the single domain RR protein CheY, which binds directly to a flagellar switch protein regulating motility via control of the direction of flagellar rotation in chemotaxis systems (52Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 53Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although redC–F are expressed in an operon containing at least three other genes (redA, redB, and redG), the respective mutants have no detectable phenotypes, suggesting that they are not directly involved in regulating developmental progression (32Higgs P.I. Cho K. Whitworth D.E. Evans L.S. Zusman D.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8191-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating how the developmental program is specifically controlled by the single domain RR RedF and are searching for RedF interaction partners.Our data suggest an elaborate signaling system that expands the previously described repertoire of two-component signal transduction mechanisms and provides an important example of how the inherent plasticity of the two-component signaling framework can be exploited in different signaling systems. The lengthy multicellular developmental program of M. xanthus depends on temporal and positional coordination of intra- and intercellular signals. The Red system is organized such that multiple input signals could be coordinated and integrated, and the presence of a single receiver domain output protein provides the potential for dissemination of signals to several additional systems.

These systems couple a vast array of signals to regulation of highly diverse processes, such as induction of virulence factors, formation of biofilms, sporulation initiation, chemotaxis, quorum sensing, and nutrition utilization (reviewed in Refs. 1Hoch J.A.

The defining feature of these systems is the presence of conserved protein domains that participate in signal transmission via phosphotransfer between histidine and aspartate residues. Specifically, the conserved domains include an HisKA dimerization phospho-accepting domain, which usually contains an invariant histidine as the phospho-accepting residue; a HATPase_c domain, which binds and hydrolyzes ATP to donate the γ-phosphoryl group to the HisKA domain; and a receiver (REC) domain, which contains an invariant aspartic acid as a phospho-accepting domain (reviewed in Ref"
https://openalex.org/W2029523750,"We have characterized the structure and the function of the 6.6-kDa protein SvtR (formerly called gp08) from the rod-shaped virus SIRV1, which infects the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus that thrives at 85 degrees C in hot acidic springs. The protein forms a dimer in solution. The NMR solution structure of the protein consists of a ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) fold between residues 13 and 56 and a disordered N-terminal region (residues 1-12). The structure is very similar to that of bacterial RHH proteins despite the low sequence similarity. We demonstrated that the protein binds DNA and uses its beta-sheet face for the interaction like bacterial RHH proteins. To detect all the binding sites on the 32.3-kb SIRV1 linear genome, we designed and performed a global genome-wide search of targets based on a simplified electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Four targets were recognized by the protein. The strongest binding was observed with the promoter of the gene coding for a virion structural protein. When assayed in a host reconstituted in vitro transcription system, the protein SvtR (Sulfolobus virus transcription regulator) repressed transcription from the latter promoter, as well as from the promoter of its own gene."

SoxB contains a di-manganese(II) site and is proposed to catalyze the release of sulfate from a protein-bound cysteine S-thiosulfonate. A direct assay for SoxB activity is described. The structure of recombinant Thermus thermophilus SoxB was determined by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.5 Å. Structures were also determined for SoxB in complex with the substrate analogue thiosulfate and in complex with the product sulfate. A mechanistic model for SoxB is proposed based on these structures. SoxB is an essential component of the bacterial Sox sulfur oxidation pathway.

Structures were also determined for SoxB in complex with the substrate analogue thiosulfate and in complex with the product sulfate. A mechanistic model for SoxB is proposed based on these structures. The oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur species by sulfur bacteria is an important component of the biogeochemical sulfur cycle and has practical applications in biomining, agriculture, biocorrosion, fuel desulfuration, and waste treatment (1Dahl C. Friedrich C.G. Microbial Sulfur Metabolism. Springer-Verlag, 2007Google Scholar, 2Lengeler J.W. Drews G. Schlegel H.G. Biology of the Prokaryotes. Blackwell Science, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar). Sulfur bacteria use the electrons liberated in sulfur oxidation reactions as the reductant for carbon dioxide fixation and/or as donors to respiratory electron transport chains. The Sox (sulfur oxidizing) system is one of the most widely distributed sulfur oxidation pathways and is found in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing eubacteria (3Friedrich C.G. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Substrates of the Sox system are reported to include thiosulfate, sulfide, elemental sulfur, sulfite, and tetrathionate (4Wodara C. Bardischewsky F. Friedrich C.G. J.

The Sox pathway has been best characterized in the α-Proteobacterium Paracoccus pantotrophus. In this bacterium thiosulfate is oxidized to sulfate by the four periplasmic protein complexes SoxYZ, SoxAX, SoxB, and SoxCD (3Friedrich C.G. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Curr.

Intermediates in the pathway are covalently bound to a cysteine residue located in a conserved Gly-Gly-Cys-Gly-Gly sequence at the C terminus of the SoxY protein (9Quentmeier A. Friedrich C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This C-terminal peptide acts as a swinging arm enabling the cysteine and its bound adducts to enter the active sites of the other pathway components (10Sauvé V. Bruno S. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23194-23204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the current pathway model the heme protein SoxAX (11Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T.

Many bacteria with a Sox system lack the SoxCD complex found in P. pantotrophus and are instead thought to feed the sulfane group of thiosulfate into other sulfur oxidation pathways (12Hensen D. Sperling D. Trüper H.G. Brune D.C. Dahl C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Beller H.R. Chain P.S. Letain T.E. Chakicherla A. Larimer F.W.

Inoue K. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6097-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction assigned to SoxB in the Sox pathway model is the hydrolysis of a sulfur-sulfur bond. This is an unusual enzymatic reaction that has only otherwise been suggested for enzymes designated as trithionate or tetrathionate hydrolases (15Meulenberg R. Pronk J.T. Frank J. Hazeu W. Bos P. Kuenen J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16De Jong G.A. Hazeu W. Bos P. Kuenen J.G. Eur. J.

The thiosulfohydrolase activity proposed for SoxB has yet to be directly demonstrated. It is, instead, inferred from two key observations. First, in vitro pathway reconstitution experiments show that SoxB catalyzes a nonoxidative reaction (7Rother D. Henrich H.J. Quentmeier A. Bardischewsky F. Friedrich C.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Second, SoxB has sequence similarity to the 5′-nucleotidase family of enzymes (19Knöfel T. Sträter N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because 5′-nucleotidases catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphate groups from nucleotides, this sequence similarity suggests that SoxB also carries out a hydrolytic reaction. Catalytically active SoxB purified from P. pantotrophus or the closely related bacterium Paracoccus versutus contains up to two atoms of manganese but only traces of other metal ions (20Cammack R. Chapman A. Lu W.P. Karagouni A. Kelly D.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 239-243Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Friedrich C.G. Quentmeier A. Bardischewsky F. Rother D. Kraft R. Kostka S. Prinz H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4677-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). EPR studies suggest that the manganese ions are present in the form of a dinuclear Mn(II) cluster with bis(μ-hydroxo) (μ-carboxylato) bridging ligands (20Cammack R. Chapman A. Lu W.P. Karagouni A. Kelly D.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 239-243Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Epel B. Schäfer K.O. Quentmeier A. Friedrich C. Lubitz W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In phylogenetic and environmental studies the presence of a soxB gene has been used as a marker for the presence of the Sox pathway and as an indicator of the ability of the organism to oxidize thiosulfate (23Petri R. Podgorsek L. Imhoff J.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 197: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Meyer B. Imhoff J.F. Kuever J. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2957-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Here we report experiments aimed at establishing a direct assay of SoxB activity. We have used x-ray crystallography to determine the structure of recombinant SoxB from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus. This is the first structure of an enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of a sulfur-sulfur bond. We have also obtained structures of T. thermophilus SoxB in complex with mechanistically relevant ligands. Based on these structures, we propose a model for the SoxB mechanism. T. thermophilus HB27 SoxB was expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli with a Strep II tag replacing the N-terminal Tat signal peptide. The soxB gene was amplified from genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-GCTAGCTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAAAGGCGCCCTGGAGGACCCCAGGTCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ACGCCTGGTACCTCATC CCGTCACCTCCGG-3′. The amplicon was used as the target in a second round of PCR using the same reverse primer and 5′-CAGGACGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGGCTAGCTGGAGCCACCCG-3′ as the forward primer. This second amplicon was digested with EcoRI and KpnI and ligated into the same sites in pQE80L (Qiagen) to produce the expression plasmid pVS048. E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Novagen) containing pVS048 was cultured aerobically at 30 °C in 2 liters of LB medium (25Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.2Google Scholar) that had been supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2, 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, and 25 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol. When the culture reached an A600 nm of 0.6, soxB expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl Β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth was continued for a further 17 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, with EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and a few crystals each of lysozyme and DNase I (both Sigma-Aldrich). The resuspended cells were broken by three passages through a French Press at 8000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 155,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and heat-treated at 65 °C for 20 min. Denatured material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 2.5-ml Strep-Tactin Superflow column (IBA) previously equilibrated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2. The column was washed with 60 ml of the equilibration buffer. SoxB was then eluted with 10 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm dethiobiotin. SoxB fractions were concentrated and further purified on a Superdex 200 10/300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. The T. thermophilus HB27 SoxYZ complex was expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli with a hexahistidine tag replacing the N-terminal signal peptide of SoxY. The soxY gene was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CCTGCGGGATCCCAGGGCCTCGAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-GCCGCAGGTACCTTAACCGCAGCCCCCCACG-3′. The resulting amplicon was digested with BamHI and KpnI and cloned into the same sites in pQE80L to produce plasmid pVS054. The soxZ gene was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-ACCGTGGGTACCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGCCTTTTAGGACCATCGCG-3′ and 5′-CGGGCAAAGCTTTTAGGCCAGCTCCAGCTTGA-3′. The resulting amplicon was digested with KpnI and HindIII and cloned into the same sites in pVSO54 to produce plasmid pVS056. E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) containing pVS056 was cultured, and a heat-treated soluble extract was prepared using the same protocol that was employed in the purification of recombinant SoxB except that the growth medium was not supplemented with MnCl2. The heat-treated extract was supplemented with 1 mm DTT 4The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolPEGpolyethylene glycol. and loaded onto a 5-ml His-Trap column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm DTT. The column was washed with equilibration buffer containing 25 mm imidazole and then developed with a linear 25–210 mm imidazole gradient. SoxYZ fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and further purified on a Superdex 75 10/300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT. dithiothreitol polyethylene glycol. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry of the purified SoxYZ complex showed that the N-terminal methionine residue of the recombinant SoxZ protein had been removed. The N-terminal amino acid of SoxY released by the Edman reaction ran at the same chromatographic position as phenylalanine. In addition, the recombinant SoxY protein had a mass 14 Da greater than the expected mass value of 14,668 Da. These observations are consistent with the N-terminal methionine of SoxY being methylated, as has been reported previously for proteins that have a positively charged residue as the second amino acid (this residue is arginine in T. thermophilus SoxY) (26Apostol I. Aitken J. Levine J. Lippincott J. Davidson J.S. Abbott-Brown D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2616-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To produce DTT-free reduced SoxYZ, the purified protein was supplemented with a further 5 mm DTT to ensure complete reduction of the active site cysteine. Excess DTT was then removed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 10/300 column in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To produce the S-thiosulfonate derivative of SoxYZ, the purified protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium tetrathionate for 16 h at 22 °C. Excess tetrathionate together with the thiosulfate reaction product were removed from the protein by gel filtration as described above. The samples were desalted by a 30-min dialysis against 0.1% formic acid using a 0.025-μm pore floating membrane (Millipore). After dialysis the samples were diluted with acetonitrile to a SoxYZ concentration of 10 μm. Electrospray mass spectrometry data were obtained using a QTof1 (Micromass) operated using MassLynx v4.0. The samples were sprayed from borosilicate emitters (Proxeon Biosystems) using a capillary voltage tuned between 1.5 and 2.1 kV to obtain a stable spray. Cone voltage was maintained at 40 V. Raw spectra were combined and processed using MaxEnt1 (Micromass). Crystals were grown at 20 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of SoxB at 6.5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 μl of 24–26% (v/v) tert-butanol, and 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.5. To ensure that the two metal sites were well occupied with manganese, 2 mm MnCl2 was added to the mother liquor for some structures. For crystallization in the presence of sulfur compounds, 2 mm disodium thiosulfate or diammonium sulfate was added directly to the protein prior to setting up the drops. The crystal used for the phasing was cryoprotected in the crystallization solution by the addition of 25% (v/v) glycerol to the mother liquor. The structure derived from this crystal showed glycerol molecules occupying the active site. To avoid interference of cryoprotectant with the active site, 25% (v/v) PEG 400 replaced glycerol for the cryoprotection of all other crystals analyzed. 100 mm disodium thiosulfate or diammonium sulfate were added to the cryosolutions for crystals grown in the presence of these chemicals. All of the data sets were collected at 100 K either in-house using a Bruker MicroStar microfocus x-ray generator with Montel optics and a Bruker platinum 135 CCD detector or at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ID14-1, Grenoble, France) (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics for T. thermophilus SoxBSoxB-glycerolSoxB-Mn2+SoxB-Mn2+-thiosulfateSoxB-Mn2+-sulfateAdditive(s)Mn2+Sodium thiosulfate and Mn2+Ammonium sulfate and Mn2+Cryoprotectant agentGlycerolPEG 400PEG 400PEG s400X-ray source (wavelength)In-house (1.54 Å)In-house (1.54 Å)In-house (1.54 Å)ESRF ID14-1 (0.93 Å)Space groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Cell dimensions (Å)a = 71.3, b = 86.5, c = 96.0a = 70.4, b = 86.7, c = 95.1a = 70.8, b = 86.7, c = 95.4a = 70.8, b = 86.6, c = 96.1Resolution (Å)57.3-1.5 (1.54-1.50)64.1-2.1 (2.16-2.10)64.2-1.85 (1.89-1.85)39.5-1.50 (1.54-1.50)Number of unique reflections90,71932,81748,24486,525Redundancy9.8 (1.2)13.0 (10.2)7.6 (3.0)6.0 (3.0)Completeness (%)100 (100)99.9 (99.4)100 (100)95.8 (87.1)Rmerge (%)4.4 (35.3)8.4 (39.5)6.0 (37.9)5.8 (23.0)Average I/σI26 (1.6)25.6 (6.4)21.5 (2.9)8.7 (3.3)Refinement statistics R (%)17.1 (22.7)18.6 (21.9)20.0 (27.0)18.2 (23.2) Rfree (%)19.1 (26.1)23.1 (26.8)23.4 (29.0)20.7 (28.3)Root mean square deviation from idealized covalent geometry Bonds (Å)0.0080.0100.0090.009 Angles (Å)1.211.231.131.23Protein residues in model32–57330–57329–57331–573Number of atoms in model5079477848415222Number of protein atoms4437444043754599Number of nonprotein atoms2 Mn2+ (1 at 100% and 1 at 75% occupancy), 564 H2O, 30 glycerol (5), 30 tert-butanol (6), 16 acetate (4)2 Mn2+, 336 H2O2 Mn2+, 439 H2O, 20 tert-butanol (4),5 S2O32− (1)2 Mn2+, 592 H2O, 10 sulfate (2 molecules at 25% occupancy each), 15 tert-butanol (3), 4 acetate (1)Mean <B> protein (Å2)13.920.718.214.8Mean <B> nonprotein (Å2)30.928.728.929.9Residues in most favorite Ramachandran regions (%)98.097.696.597.41Ramachandran outliers (%)0.00.00.920.0 Open table in a new tab The images were processed using SAINT (27Bruker SMART, SAINT, SADABS and XPREP Software Reference Manual.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar) to find the two manganese sites (f″ = 2.8 e− at λ = 1.54 Å) and five sulfur atoms. DANO/SIGMA values from SHELXD ranged from 4 to 1.5 in the resolution range 50–2.5 Å. XPREP was then rerun keeping Friedel mates intensities separate, and these intensities were processed through CCP4-combat and then CCP4-truncate (30Winn M.D. Ashton A.W. Briggs P.J. Ballard C.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The heavy atom model eventually comprised two manganese and six sulfur sites. Starting from the SHARP phase distribution solvent flattening in the program Solomon using a 47.5% solvent content produced a 1.8-Å map that enabled autobuilding in the program ArpWarp (32Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Residues before Tyr32 were not seen. All other minor gaps in the autobuilt model were easily built manually (11 residues in total). An autoBUSTER refinement 5C. Vonrhein, personal communication. was performed on the model for SoxB residues 32–573 with the two active site manganese atoms assigned a full occupancy. After 10 autoBUSTER cycles with water addition, the R factor was 23.5% and the Rfree was 25.3%. The structure was further refined with Refmac5 (33Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J.

MicroPIXE measurements were carried out at the Ion Beam Centre (University of Surrey) on a beamline arranged as described by Grime et al. (41Grime G.W. Dawson M. Marsh M. McArthur I.C. Watt F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. B. 1991; 54: 52-63Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Two SoxB crystals were dried onto 2-μm-thick mylar films in aluminum target holders (42Garman E.

Biol. 2005; 89: 173-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A 2.5-MeV proton beam 3 μm in diameter was used to induce characteristic x-ray emission from the dried crystal under vacuum. The X-rays were detected in a solid state lithium drifted silicon detector with high energy resolution. The proton beam was then scanned spatially in the x and y dimensions. Spatial maps were obtained of all elements heavier than neon that were present in the sample. Quantitative information was obtained by collecting spectra at selected points on the crystals and also at a point on the backing film. These spectra were analyzed using GUPIX (44Johansson S.A.E. Campbell J.L. Malmqvist K.G. Particle-Induced X-Ray Emission Spectrometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) to determine the amount of each element of interest in the sample relative to the sulfur signal from the six methionine residues found in the recombinant T. thermophilus SoxB protein. The SoxB protein from the thermophilic bacterium T. thermophilus HB27 was expressed in E. coli. The identity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. The protein was a monomer in solution as judged by size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). To establish that the recombinant T. thermophilus SoxB was enzymatically active and as a means to substantiate the proposed SoxB reaction, we attempted to assay SoxB activity directly. Recombinant T. thermophilus SoxYZ was produced in E. coli, and the active site cysteine residue of the SoxY subunit was chemically modified to the S-thiosulfonate (-S-SO3−) derivative. The authenticity of this modification was confirmed by mass spectrometry showing that the derivatized SoxY protein had a molecular mass 113 Da greater than that of the native protein (the mass of thiosulfate is 112 Da) (Fig. 1, compare samples 2 and 6). The additional mass could be removed by DTT treatment. This indicated that the S-thiosulfonate group had formed a disulfide linkage with the protein and must therefore be conjugated through the sulfane sulfur to the unique active site cysteine residue in SoxY (Fig. 1, compare samples 6 and 12). The S-thiosulfonate SoxYZ protein was mixed with SoxB and incubated for 3 h at 70 °C, which is the optimum growth temperature of T. thermophilus. The reaction products were then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Following incubation, the mass peak corresponding to the S-thiosulfonate SoxY derivate had disappeared (Fig. 1, compare samples 6 and 9), whereas the SoxZ mass peak was unchanged from the start of the reaction. Identical results were obtained for a duplicate reaction that had been supplemented with Mn2+ to guard against the possibility that recombinant SoxB had not been fully loaded with metal cofactors (Fig. 1, compare samples 8 and 9). If SoxB was omitted from the reaction, no alteration of the S-thiosulfonate SoxY peak was seen even if Mn2+ was present (Fig. 1, sample 7). Taken together these observations showed that SoxB had specifically converted the SoxY derivative into a new species. The nature of the resultant species was not, however, immediately apparent because no new mass peaks were detected. Insight into the nature of the product species was instead obtained from SDS-PAGE analysis. T. thermophilus SoxYZ is sufficiently thermostable that the two subunits do not dissociate in 2% (w/v) SDS at room temperature (Fig. 1, sample 1). However, if the temperature is increased to 100 °C, SoxY and SoxZ appear to become separated and migrate with identical mobility under SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, compare samples 1 and 2). This interpretation of the electrophoretic behavior of T. thermophilus SoxYZ was confirmed by expressing and analyzing each subunit individually (data not shown). If the cysteine residue of SoxY is initially in the reduced state, it has a strong tendency to form an intermolecular disulfide bridge with the cysteine residue of another SoxY protein molecule. This disulfide-linked dimer is evident as a species of 31 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which disappears in the presence of DTT (Fig. 1, compare samples 2 and 13). Formation of this disulfide-linked SoxY dimer is enhanced by incubation at 70 °C in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 1, compare samples 3 and 4). Divalent metal ions are known to act as a catalyst for disulfide bond shuffling (45Fan Q.R. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23700-23706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 46Builder S. Hart R. Lester P. Reifsnyder D. U. S. Patent 5808006. 1998; (9, 15)Google Scholar). The S-thiosulfonate-SoxYZ preparation contained very little disulfide-linked SoxY dimer, and the concentration of the dimer was not altered by incubation with Mn2+ at 70 °C (Fig. 1, compare samples 6, 7, and 12). However, incubation with SoxB at 70 °C led to a significant increase in SoxY dimers with or without supplementary Mn2+ (Fig. 1, compare sample 7 with samples 8 and 9). The SoxB-dependent formation of SoxYZ complex dimers was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). The addition of DTT to the SoxB-containing reaction led to the disappearance of the SoxY dimer band on SDS-PAGE and of the SoxYZ complex dimer peak on the size exclusion column (Fig. 1, compare samples 8 and 11; supplemental Fig. S1). These changes were associated with the appearance of a mass peak corresponding to unmodified SoxY (Fig. 1, compare samples 8 and 11). Thus the SoxB reaction leads to the partial conversion of the S-thiosulfonate SoxY derivative to a species in which SoxYZ complexes form a disulfide-linked dimer through the SoxY cysteine residue. At first sight this conclusion is at odds with the current proposal that the product of the SoxB reaction should be S-sulfane SoxY rather than a disulfide-linked SoxY dimer. However, taking into account the propensity of the reduced SoxY cysteine to form disulfide links to other SoxY molecules nonenzymatically, we believe that the observed SoxB-dependent products are still consistent with SoxB catalyzing a thiosulfohydrolase reaction. Removal of the terminal sulfonate group in the SoxB reaction produces a reactive sulfane derivative that we suggest would nonenzymatically form disulfide linkages via reactions such as the following.

Similarly, in Caco-2BBe cells, NHERF3 and NHE3 colocalized in the BB under basal conditions but after elevation of [Ca2+]i by carbachol, this overlap was abolished. NHERF3 short hairpin RNA knockdown (>50%) in Caco-2BBe cells significantly reduced basal NHE3 activity by decreasing BB NHE3 amount. Also, carbachol-mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity was abolished in Caco-2BBe cells in which NHERF3 protein expression was significantly reduced. In summary: 1) NHERF3 colocalizes and directly binds NHE3 at the plasma membrane under basal conditions; 2) NHERF3 reconstitutes [Ca2+]i inhibition of NHE3 activity and dissociates from NHE3 in fibroblasts and polarized intestinal epithelial cells with elevated [Ca2+]i; 3) NHERF3 short hairpin RNA significantly reduced NHE3 basal activity and brush border expression in Caco-2BBe cells.

Short-term regulation of NHE3 activity is achieved through a variety of factors that affect NHE3 turnover number and/or surface expression and often involve a role for the cytoskeleton and accessory proteins, including the multi-PDZ domain containing proteins, NHERF1 and NHERF2 (1.Zachos N.C.

However, many details of this regulation are not understood.The NHERF (Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor) family of multi-PDZ domain containing proteins consists of four evolutionarily related members, all of which are expressed in epithelial cells of the mammalian small intestine (2.Donowitz M.

Recently, two additional PDZ domain containing proteins, termed NHERF3/PDZK1 and NHERF4/PDZK2/IKEPP, have been demonstrated to possess sequence homology with NHERF1 and NHERF2 (11.Hernando N.

However, unlike NHERF1 and NHERF2, which are comprised of two tandem PDZ domains flanked by a C-terminal ezrin/radixin/moesin binding domain, NHERF3 and NHERF4 consist of four PDZ domains but no other protein-protein interacting domains (12.Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar).NHERF3 was initially identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen from a human kidney cDNA library using the membrane-associated protein MAP17, as bait (12.Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). NHERF3 is expressed in the brush border of epithelial cells of the kidney proximal tubule and the small intestine (12.Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). NHERF3 associates with and, in a few cases, has been shown to regulate the activity of multiple apical membrane ion transporters including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), urate anion exchanger 1 (URAT1), sodium-phosphate cotransporter type IIa (NaPiIIa), proton-coupled peptide transporter (PEPT2), and organic cation/carnitine cotransporter (OCTN2) (15.Anzai N.

Recent studies have begun evaluating the effect of NHERF3 on mouse intestinal Na+ and Cl− transport. Basal electroneutral sodium absorption was decreased by >40% in the NHERF3 null mouse jejunum (21.Hillesheim J. Riederer B. Tuo B. Chen M. Manns M. Biber J. Yun C. Kocher O. Seidler U.

Physiol. 2007; 581: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cAMP and [Ca2+]i inhibition of NHE3 activity was abolished in the NHERF3 null mouse colon. However, the mechanism by which NHERF3 regulates NHE3 activity was not resolved.Several physiological and pathophysiological agonists, acting through [Ca2+]i-induced second messenger systems, are known to inhibit electroneutral NaCl absorption in the small intestine (1.Zachos N.C.

Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Elevation of [Ca2+]i has previously been demonstrated to inhibit NHE3 activity in a NHERF2-, but not NHERF1-dependent manner (5.Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ryu S.H. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol.

NHERF2 regulation of NHE3 involves the formation of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane that include NHE3, NHERF2, α-actinin-4, and PKCα, which induce endocytic removal of NHE3 from the plasma membrane by a PKC-dependent mechanism (5.Kim J.H.

Because multiple PDZ proteins exist in the apical pole of epithelial cells (2.Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the current study was designed to determine whether NHERF3 could reconstitute Ca2+ regulation of NHE3 activity and to define how that occurred.DiscussionAcute regulation by ligands and second messengers (i.e. cAMP, cGMP, and [Ca2+]i) of intestinal neutral NaCl absorption, which includes NHE3, is known to depend on the NHERF family of multi-PDZ domain containing proteins (1.Zachos N.C. Tse M. Donowitz M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 411-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2.Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The involvement of the NHERF family has added another level of complexity to the understanding of the post-prandial changes in Na+ absorption and the abnormalities of this process that occur in diarrheal diseases.Several approaches have been taken to understand the contribution of individual NHERF proteins to NHE3 regulation. Cell lines lacking endogenous NHERF family members have been transfected with individual NHERF proteins and knock-out mouse models of individual NHERFs have been created. Studies performed in NHERF1 KO mice not only confirmed previous cell line studies suggesting a role for NHERF1 in cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity, but also demonstrated that cAMP regulation via NHERF1 was tissue dependent (i.e. NHERF1 was necessary for cAMP inhibition of NHE3 activity in renal proximal tubule but not in distal ileum) (10.Yun C.H. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 39.Murtazina R. Kovbasnjuk O.

Moreover, studies of the NHERF3 KO mouse demonstrated that whereas these mice appeared healthy, intestinal NHE3 activity was significantly reduced and these mice failed to respond to both cAMP and elevated [Ca2+]i with NHE3 inhibition (21.Hillesheim J.

Intestinal studies of NHERF3 KO mice have not yet addressed whether changes in NHE3 regulation could also be due to compensatory changes of the other NHERF proteins (21.Hillesheim J. Riederer B.

Physiol. 2007; 581: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The current study began a reductionist evaluation of the contribution of NHERF3 to NHE3 regulation by examining a fibroblast cell model (PS120), which lacks most members of the NHERF family (except for a small amount of NHERF1) as well as a Na+ absorptive intestinal cell line (Caco-2BBe), which endogenously expresses all four NHERF family members. These models allowed us to examine the role of NHERF3 alone (in PS120 cells) in NHE3 regulation and when it was the only NHERF protein knocked down (in Caco-2BBe cells). This Caco-2BBe NHERF3 shRNA model had the additional advantage that NHE3 regulation was not affected by other NHERF-containing, non-epithelial cells that affect NHE3 function when studying intact mouse models. Our current study demonstrated that NHERF3 reconstituted Ca2+ inhibition of NHE3 in both the fibroblast and Caco-2BBe cell models, by what appears to be a similar process. The mechanism appears to involve NHERF3 anchoring NHE3 to the plasma membrane under basal conditions and release of NHE3 anchoring with elevated [Ca2+]i. Our study confirmed a previous observation that NHERF3 directly binds NHE3 (20.Thomson R.B. Wang T. Thomson B.R. Tarrats L. Girardi A. Mentone S. Soleimani M. Kocher O. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, our results indicated that this interaction involved an internal NHE3 binding site, which was unlike a previous report that indicated that the binding of NHERF3 to NHE3 involved the C-terminal three amino acids of NHE3 (only a C-terminal fusion protein was used in these studies, precluding the ability to identify an internal binding site) (20.Thomson R.B. Wang T. Thomson B.R. Tarrats L. Girardi A. Mentone S. Soleimani M. Kocher O. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13331-13336Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The involvement of an internal NHE3 binding site for NHERF3 has been recently suggested by Gisler et al. (42.Gisler S.M. Kittanakom S. Fuster D. Wong V. Bertic M. Radanovic T. Hall R.A. Murer H.

This NHE3-NHERF3 dissociation was associated with decreased NHE3 membrane expression and activity. To further determine whether NHERF3 played an anchoring role in NHE3 expression on the plasma membrane, shRNA was used to knockdown NHERF3 in Caco-2BBe cells. These studies revealed that apical NHE3 expression was significantly reduced in the absence of NHERF3. We interpret these results to indicate that NHERF3 anchors NHE3 to the plasma membrane under basal conditions. Interrupting the NHE3-NHERF3 interaction either by knocking down NHERF3 or by elevated Ca2+ leads to increased internalization of NHE3, presumably by ongoing endocytosis in the first case and via stimulated endocytosis of NHE3 shown to occur with elevated Ca2+ in the second case (5.Kim J.H.

This interpretation is supported by mutation studies of the CFTR C-terminal PDZ binding motif. Deletion of this motif did not alter apical sorting of CFTR but rather decreased the membrane half-life of CFTR suggesting that the CFTR-PDZ motif served as a membrane retention signal (43.Swiatecka-Urban A. Duhaime M. Coutermarsh B. Karlson K.H. Collawn J. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Langford G. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40099-40105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Whether the internal binding site of NHE3 for NHERF3 is also a membrane retention signal, requires further study.The results of the current study along with our preliminary evidence that NHERF2 and NHE3 associate dynamically (44.Cha B. Kenworthy A. Murtazina R. Donowitz M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3353-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) represent the first evidence that binding between NHE3 and members of the NHERF family occurs dynamically. However, the Ca2+-dependent association between NHE3 and NHERF3 is not the first time NHERF proteins have been shown to bind dynamically to their substrates. Dynamic association of PDZ proteins during signal transduction has been previously demonstrated for NaPiIIa, CFTR, β2-adrenergic receptor, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (45.Déliot N.

For example, following parathyroid hormone receptor activation, NaPiIIa dissociates from NHERF1 (47.Voltz J.W. Brush M. Sikes S. Steplock D. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33879-33887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the case of CFTR, PKC activation causes CFTR to be released from the PDZ2 domain of NHERF1 thereby removing one of the two CFTR/NHERF1 binding sites (47.Voltz J.W. Brush M. Sikes S. Steplock D.

The mechanisms demonstrated to be responsible for dynamic NHERF/substrate interactions include, presence of substrate, substrate phosphorylation, NHERF phosphorylation, and/or NHERF dimerization (6.Morales F.C.

In addition, multiple other aspects of signaling (e.g. endocrine) seem to influence the relationship of NHERF proteins with their substrates. Phosphorylation of NHERF3 at Ser509 by PKA and glucagon was associated with increased expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I and PDZK1, which resulted in decreased plasma high density lipoprotein levels (50.Nakamura T. Shibata N. Nishimoto-Shibata T. Feng D. Ikemoto M. Motojima K. Iso-O N. Tsukamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13404-13409Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the details responsible for NHERF3-dependent regulation of NHE3 activity remain to be determined, the results of the current study appear to represent another example of the highly regulated association of the NHERFs with their ligands.Previous studies examining acute NHE3 regulation by cAMP, cGMP, and elevated [Ca2+]i identified a role for members of the NHERF family in forming NHE3-containing, multiprotein complexes (2.Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 51.Donowitz M. Li X. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 825-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Of these identified regulatory processes, the most complicated appears to be calcium inhibition. Studies of murine KO models, although still in progress, have demonstrated that NHERF3 is necessary for basal as well as calcium and cAMP inhibition of intestinal neutral NaCl absorption and NHE3 inhibition (best illustrated in the colon) and that NHERF2 is necessary for basal activity and calcium inhibition of NHE3 activity in the ileum (21.Hillesheim J. Riederer B. Tuo B. Chen M. Manns M. Biber J. Yun C. Kocher O. Seidler U. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 454: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22.Cinar A. Chen M. Riederer B. Bachmann O.

De Jonge H. Donowitz M. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: A749Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Supporting these findings, NHERF2 and, as shown here, NHERF3 can reconstitute calcium inhibition in fibroblasts that lack all endogenous NHERFs other than a small amount of NHERF1 expression. That both NHERF2 and NHERF3 are involved in NHE3 inhibition with elevated Ca2+ indicates the complexity of this regulatory process. In a parallel study, we generated stable NHERF2 knockdown in Caco-2BBe cells to determine whether NHERF2, which is also present in the BB of Caco-2BBe cells (2.Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and contributes to basal and/or Ca2+ regulation of NHE3 activity (data not shown and in preparation for submission elsewhere). In contrast to NHERF3 KD, basal NHE3 activity was not altered in the NHERF2 KD Caco-2BBe cells. However, NHERF2 KD prevented carbachol-mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity. This result supports previous studies demonstrating that Ca2+ inhibition of NHE3 activity requires NHERF2 (5.Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ryu S.H. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23714-23724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although both NHERF2 and NHERF3 are required for Ca2+ inhibition, only NHERF3 contributes to basal NHE3 activity suggesting the NHERF2- and NHERF3-regulated NHE3 activity by different mechanisms that may involve their differential subcellular localization. Although mechanistic studies have suggested the role of NHERF2 in Ca2+ regulation of NHE3 involves formation of NHE3 containing complexes that include α-actinin-4 and PKCα (5.Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23714-23724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and dynamic fixation of NHE3 to the cytoskeleton (44.Cha B. Kenworthy A. Murtazina R. Donowitz M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3353-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the role of NHERF3 was not understood until the current studies. We reasoned that to understand how a complex regulatory process functions, studies of simple cells as well as studies in epithelial cell culture models would be useful.In the current studies, it was shown that elevation of [Ca2+]i inhibits NHE3 in cells containing NHERF3 by decreasing the amount of NHE3 on the plasma membrane of fibroblasts and the BB of Caco-2BBe cells. A similar decrease of BB NHE3 was demonstrated in the BB of the rabbit ileum treated with carbachol, supporting that these cell culture models might provide insights in the mechanism of calcium inhibition of NHE3 (52.Li X. Zhang H. Cheong A. Leu S. Chen Y. Elowsky C.G. Donowitz M. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanistic insights provided from both cell models was that although NHE3 associates with NHERF3 under basal conditions, acute elevation of intracellular [Ca2+]i dissociates NHE3 from NHERF3. Moreover, confocal microscopy and acceptor photobleaching FRET showed that NHERF3 does not traffic with NHE3 from the plasma membrane to the recycling compartment of fibroblasts. Also, in Caco-2BBe cells, NHERF3 remained in the BB, whereas NHE3 moved to the lower part of the BB, compatible with movement to the intervillus clefts, from which increased endocytosis occurs. Because NHE3 association with NHERF proteins limits NHE3 mobility in the BB, as assessed by FRAP (44.Cha B. Kenworthy A. Murtazina R. Donowitz M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3353-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we suggest that the dissociation from NHERF3 is a necessary part of the mechanism that frees NHE3 to move from its microvillus or plasma membrane location where it associates with the cytoskeleton to the microvillus clefts from which it can be endocytosed. The similarity in the apparent role of NHERF3 to fix NHE3 in the membrane under basal conditions and to release NHE3 with elevated Ca2+ further indicates that some NHE3 regulatory steps are similar in polarized epithelial cells and fibroblasts despite the great differences in structure of the membrane domains involved.In conclusion, an important implication from the current studies is that multip"
https://openalex.org/W2079050436,"Early onset generalized dystonia (DYT1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder caused by deletion of a single glutamate residue (torsinA DeltaE) in the C-terminal region of the AAA(+) (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein torsinA. The pathogenic mechanism by which torsinA DeltaE mutation leads to dystonia remains unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of a 628-amino acid novel protein, printor, that interacts with torsinA. Printor co-distributes with torsinA in multiple brain regions and co-localizes with torsinA in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, printor selectively binds to the ATP-free form but not to the ATP-bound form of torsinA, supporting a role for printor as a cofactor rather than a substrate of torsinA. The interaction of printor with torsinA is completely abolished by the dystonia-associated torsinA DeltaE mutation. Our findings suggest that printor is a new component of the DYT1 pathogenic pathway and provide a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention in dystonia."
https://openalex.org/W1979264094,"Food sharing is vital for a large number of species, either solitary or social, and is of particular importance within highly integrated societies, such as in colonial organisms and in social insects. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that govern the distribution of food inside a complex organizational system remain unknown. Using scintigraphy, a method developed for medical imaging, we were able to describe the dynamics of food-flow inside an ant colony. We monitored the sharing process of a radio-labelled sucrose solution inside a nest of Formica fusca. Our results show that, from the very first load that enters the nest, food present within the colony acts as negative feedback to entering food. After one hour of the experiments, 70% of the final harvest has already entered the nest. The total foraged quantity is almost four times smaller than the expected storage capacity. A finer study of the spatial distribution of food shows that although all ants have been fed rapidly (within 30 minutes), a small area representing on average 8% of the radioactive surface holds more than 25% of the stored food. Even in rather homogeneous nests, we observed a strong concentration of food in few workers. Examining the position of these workers inside the nest, we found heavily loaded ants in the centre of the aggregate. The position of the centre of this high-intensity radioactive surface remained stable for the three consecutive hours of the experiments. We demonstrate that the colony simultaneously managed to rapidly feed all workers (200 ants fed within 30 minutes) and build up food stocks to prevent food shortage, something that occurs rather often in changing environments. Though we expected the colony to forage to its maximum capacity, the flow of food entering the colony is finely tuned to the colony's needs. Indeed the food-flow decreases proportionally to the food that has already been harvested, liberating the work-force for other tasks."

Bacterial GGTs catalyze the first step in glutathione degradation. For example, Helicobacter pylori GGT removes glutamate from glutathione tripeptide via the formation of a γ-glutamyl acyl enzyme. This intermediate is resolved by the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule, causing the release of γ-glutamate (21.Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N.

In the absence of the physiological nucleophile (muropeptides), CapD acyl intermediates can be resolved by the nucleophilic attack of water to generate hydrolysis products. Here, we report the high resolution crystal structure of CapD in the absence and presence of a glutamate dipeptide and compare it with the known structures of H. pylori and Escherichia coli GGTs. By combining structural, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we identify the unique features of CapD that distinguish the protein from GGTs and detect several residues that are important for CapD autocatalytic cleavage and PDGA processing. This structural information will further the development of small molecule inhibitors that disrupt CapD activity and that may be useful as anti-infective therapies for anthrax.

The DNA sequence of plasmid pXO2 (GenBank accession NC_007323) was used to design primers to amplify the CapD open reading frame by PCR with the following primer pair: 5′-TACTTCCAATCCAATGCGTTCAACAAAATAAAAGACAGT-3′ and 5′-TTATCCACTTCCAATGTCATTTATTTGATTTCCAAGTTCC-3′. The amplified product was directly cloned in the ligation-independent cloning vector pMCSG19 (25.Donnelly M.I. Zhou M. Millard C.S. Clancy S. Stols L. Eschenfeldt W.H. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This primer design avoids cloning of the putative signal peptide of 28 residues (predicted by the SignalP 3.0 server). pMCSG19 vector encodes the maltose-binding protein (MBP) sequence followed in order by: (i) tobacco vein mottling virus protease cleavage site, (ii) hexa-histine tag (His6 tag), (iii) TEV protease cleavage site, and (iv) target protein. Upon cleavage with TEV protease, three residues (Ser-Asn-Ala) are added at the N terminus of the target protein. For site-directed mutagenesis, the QuikChange site-directed strategy from Stratagene was employed. The pMCSG19-capD plasmid was used as a template for amplification of DNA with pairs of primers that introducing a discrete change of Thr368, Thr370, Ser372, or Arg520 to Ala. No other change was introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and variant CapD proteins were produced as a fusion protein MBP-His6-CapD produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) carrying plasmids pMAGIC that encode three rare E. coli tRNAs: Arg (AGG/AGA), Ile (ATA), and pRK1037 (26.Nallamsetty S. Kapust R.B. Tözsér J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 38: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Scientific Reagents, Inc.). Cells were grown in the presence of ampicillin and kanamycin, 100 and 30 μg/ml, respectively, to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6, and isopropyl-α-d-thiogalactoside (1 mm) was added to induce the expression of the fusion protein. MBP was removed in situ upon production of the TVMV protease encoded on plasmid pRK1037. 4 h after the addition of isopropyl-α-d-thiogalactoside, cells were harvested, suspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% v/v glycerol), and stored at −20 °C. Cells were thawed and lysed by sonication after the addition of protease inhibitors (Sigma, P8849) and lysozyme (1 mg/ml). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 g (RC5C-Plus centrifuge, Sorval) for 20 min and filtered through 0.45- and 0.22-mm in-line filters (Gelman). His6-CapD was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC-I) using a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP column charged with Ni+2 ions and buffer-exchange chromatography on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column and AKTATM Xpress (General Electric Health Systems). The His6 tag was cleaved using recombinant His6-TEV protease expressed from vector pRK508 (27.Kapust R.B. Waugh D.S. Protein Expr Purif. 2000; 19: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. D. Waugh, NCI, National Institutes of Health). The protease over target protein ratio was 1:30, and incubation was performed at 4 °C for 72 h, after which the protease was removed using a 3-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelating column (Qiagen). The CapD protein was concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). The buffer was exchanged during this procedure to crystallization Buffer E (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative of CapD was prepared as described (28.Walsh M.A. Dementieva I. Evans G. Sanishvili R. Joachimiak A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells producing MBP-His6-CapD were grown at 37 °C in enriched M9 medium (25.Donnelly M.I. Zhou M. Millard C.S. Clancy S. Stols L. Eschenfeldt W.H. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 8.5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, and 1% thiamine. After the A600 reached 1.2, 0.01% (w/v) each of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine were added to inhibit the metabolic pathway of methionine and promote SeMet incorporation. 60 mg of SeMet was added to 1 liter of culture, and 15 min later, protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-α-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were incubated at 20 °C overnight, harvested, suspended in lysis Buffer D (500 mm NaCL, 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% v/v glycerol, 50 mg of protease inhibitor mixture), and stored at −80 °C. The SeMet derivative was purified as described earlier. Edman degradation was used to identify the N-terminal sequence of small chains of CapD and mutant variants. The analysis was performed on a Beckman 7300 analyzer at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University. CapD activity was assayed using PDGA from B. anthracis as the substrate. PDGA was isolated as described (24.Richter S. Anderson V.J. Garufi G. Lu L. Budzik J.M. Joachimiak A. He C. Schneewind O. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 404-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PDGA degradation by CapD wild type and mutants was performed following a modified protocol (16.Candela T. Fouet A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PDGA (100 μg) was incubated with 2 μm enzyme in a 20-μl reaction volume and HEPES-KOH buffer 20 mm, pH 7.5. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and products separated on 2.5% agarose gel. PDGA in the gel was visualized with methylene blue stain (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). For hydrolysis of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate, 400 pmol of γ-d-glutamic acid pentamer (Abz-[γ-d-Glu]5-Dpn) was added to a final volume reaction of 40 μl containing 20 pmol of enzyme. The assay was performed in 25 mm HEPES-KOH buffer containing 1% Tween 20 at pH 7.5 and 21 °C. Increase in fluorescence was measured in a FluoroMax-2 (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ). CapD crystallization conditions were established with the help of the Mosquito robot (TTP LabTech) using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique in a 96-well CrystalQuick plate (Greiner Bio-One). Crystallization screens included Index, Crystal Screen (Hampton Research), Wizard (Emerald Biosystems), and SM4 and SM5 (NeXtal from Qiagen). For structure determination, the complete data set was collected from orthorhombic crystals grown in a crystallization solution containing PEG 3350 12.5%, 0.1 m LiSO4, and 0.1 m HEPES-Na, pH 7.0. Prior to data collection, the concentration of the PEG 3350 in the crystallization solution was increased to 32% for cryoprotection, and the crystals were flash cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Three segments of a single, long crystal were used to collect a complete data set for structure determination. In the course of crystal optimization, the monoclinic crystal form was obtained from PEG 3350 15%, PEG 400 8%, 0.05 m LiSO4, and 0.1 m HEPES-Na, pH 7.0. These crystals diffract to a high resolution of 1.80 Å. Prior to data collection, these crystals were cryoprotected using 15% glycerol, and crystals were flash cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 19ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory using the program SBCcollect. For phasing, a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set was collected to 2.3 Å resolution at the wavelength near the selenium absorption peak (λ = 0.9794 Å) from one SeMet-labeled protein crystal (space group P212121, unit cell dimensions a = 47.70, b = 72.00, c = 128.85 Å). The high resolution data (1.8 Å) were collected from monoclinic crystal (space group P21, unit cell dimensions a = 52.67, b = 120.62, c = 77.38 Å, β = 90.87°). All data were processed and scaled with the HKL3000 suite (see TABLE 1, TABLE 2) (29.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). The CapD crystal structure was first determined using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing and data obtained from an orthorhombic crystal. 13 selenium sites were located using the program SHELEXD (30.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). These selenium sites were used for phasing to 2.30 Å with the program MLPHARE (31.Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. 1991: 80-86Google Scholar). After density modification (32.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a partial model of 369 residues without side chains was obtained from an automatic model building trial using the program RESOLVE (32.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All the above referenced programs are integrated within the program suite HKL3000 (29.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Based on the initial partial model, most parts of the CapD monomer were built manually using COOT (33.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar). The electron density for most of the CapD was of high quality. After several cycles of manual model adjustment and improvement using COOT, the model was refined using REFMAC (34.Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). The high resolution structure was obtained using data collected from a monoclinic crystal. The structure was determined using the CapD 2.30 Å structure as a starting model and MOLREP of the CCP4 program suite (14.Scorpio A. Chabot D.J. Day W.A. O'Brien D.K. Vietri N.J. Itoh Y. Mohamadzadeh M. Friedlander A.M. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The model was refined using REFMAC (34.Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab The model of CapD with the physiological substrate di-γ-d-Glu was created using the Dundee PRODRG server and refined with the monomer library sketcher. The normalized structure of di-γ-d-Glu was modeled into the omit electron density map, and real space refinement was performed to the maximum fitness of the ligand to the map. Two orientations of the ligand between enzyme and substrate were considered. Based on the geometry analysis and density fit analysis, the best fitted one was shown in Fig. 2C. Recombinant CapD lacking the N-terminal signal peptide within the first 28 amino acids (residues 29–528) was produced in E. coli. The recombinant protein underwent autocatalytic processing to yield a stable heterodimer with large L and small S chains, residues 29–351 and 352–528, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the small subunit was verified by Edman degradation. Orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals of the CapD heterodimer were obtained. The structure of CapD was determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing of the orthorhombic crystal form and SeMet-labeled protein using HKL3000 (29.Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) and refined to 2.30 Å (R = 19.7%, Rfree = 25.2%) (Table 1). This crystal form contained one CapD molecule with bound l-Glu-l-Glu dipeptide (di-α-l-Glu), a non-hydrolyzable analog of poly-γ-d-glutamic acid, in the asymmetric unit. The peptide was acquired by CapD during protein expression in E. coli. The structure of CapD in monoclinic crystal was determined by molecular replacement, using CapD as a starting model, and refined to 1.80 Å (R = 19.7%, Rfree = 24.2%). This crystal form contained two CapD molecules in the asymmetric unit, one with bound di-α-l-Glu and one unliganded (Table 2). Electron densities in both crystals were of high quality and generally continuous. Nevertheless, electron densities for residues 29–45 and 337–351, i.e. the first 17 and the last 15 residues of the L chain, and residue 528, the last residue of the S chain, were poorly defined, and these residues could not be modeled into the structure. At 1.80 Å, the heterodimer has overall dimensions of 60 × 45 × 35 Å, and the crystal structure confirmed the discontinuity of the peptide backbone between residues 351 and 352, liberating the N terminus of the S chain at Thr352. The L and S chains are highly intertwined throughout the structure with a 9,192 Å2 surface area buried between them. CapD contains two central β-sheets stacked with clusters of 8 and 10 α-helices above and below, respectively (Fig. 1A). Together, these secondary structures form a six-layer sandwich (α/α/β/β/α/α), a variation of the four-layer sandwich (α/β/β/α) found in the structure of Ntn hydrolases. In the central β-sheet sandwich, strands are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, and both L and S chains contribute strands to the nearly flat β-sheets. The N-terminal portion of the L chain sequence provides the entire domain folded below the β-sheet sandwich, which is composed of 10 helices arranged in two layers (Fig. 1A). The upper helical domain with eight helices is composed of elements that are derived from both the L and the S chain, whereas a three-stranded mixed β-sheet is provided by the S chain (Fig. 1A). A large, solvent-accessible groove is located in the middle of the molecule between the lower and upper domains. Three areas of strongly positive electrostatic potential on the surface of CapD form a Y-shape and converge within the deep cleft in the middle of the molecule (Fig. 1B). The active site nucleophile, Thr352, is positioned at the bottom of this cleft. Comparison of the CapD structure with other protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) was performed with the SSM server (35.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2002246336,"ITK-SYK, a novel fusion tyrosine kinase (FTK) resulting from a recurrent t(5;9)(q33;q22), was recently identified in a poorly understood subset of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. However, the biochemical and functional properties of ITK-SYK are unknown. Here we demonstrate that ITK-SYK is a catalytically active tyrosine kinase that is sensitive to an established inhibitor of SYK. The expression of ITK-SYK, but not SYK, transformed NIH3T3 cells, inducing loss of contact inhibition and formation of anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar, in a kinase activity-dependent manner. ITK-SYK is unusual among FTKs in having an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Introduction of a well characterized loss-of-function mutation (R29C) into the PH domain of ITK-SYK inhibited its phosphorylation, markedly reduced its catalytic activity, and abrogated its ability to activate the ERK signaling pathway and to transform NIH3T3 cells. Although ITK-SYK was membrane-associated, ITK-SYK-R29C was not. However, each of these properties could be recovered by retargeting ITK-SYK-R29C back to the plasma membrane by the addition of an N-terminal myristylation sequence. Consistent with a model in which ITK-SYK requires PH domain-mediated binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate generated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), ITK-SYK activity was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of PI3K and increased by co-expression with a constitutively active form of PI3K. Together, these findings identify ITK-SYK as an active, transforming FTK dependent upon PH domain-mediated membrane localization, identify a novel mechanism for activation of an oncogenic FTK, and suggest ITK-SYK as a rational therapeutic target for t(5;9)(q33;q22)-positive lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2009251019,"Mast cells (MCs) play a critical role in both acute and chronic inflammation and mature in peripheral tissues from bone marrow-derived progenitors that circulate in the blood as immature precursors. MCs developed from cord blood-derived progenitors cultured with stem cell factor (SCF) alone express intragranular tryptase (MC(T)s), the phenotype predominant in the lung. MC progenitors are likely to encounter the serum-borne bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), during migration to target tissues. S1P accelerated the development of cord blood-derived MCs (CB-MCs) and strikingly increased the numbers of MC-expressing chymase. These MCs have functional Fc epsilonRIs, and similar to skin MC(TC)s that express both tryptase and chymase, also express CD88 and are activated by anaphylatoxin C5a and the secretagogue compound 48/80. S1P induced release of IL-6, a cytokine known to promote development of functionally mature MC(TC)s, from cord blood cultures containing adherent macrophages, and from highly purified macrophages, but not from macrophage-depleted CB-MCs. In contrast, S1P stimulated secretion of the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2), from these macrophage-depleted and purified CB-MCs. These results suggest crucial roles for S1P in regulating development of human MCs and their functions and reveal a complex interplay between macrophages and MC progenitors in the development of mature human MCs."
https://openalex.org/W1966352654,"High-density tiling microarrays are a powerful tool for the characterization of complete genomes. The two major computational challenges associated with custom-made arrays are design and analysis. Firstly, several genome dependent variables, such as the genome's complexity and sequence composition, need to be considered in the design to ensure a high quality microarray. Secondly, since tiling projects today very often exceed the limits of conventional array-experiments, researchers cannot use established computer tools designed for commercial arrays, and instead have to redesign previous methods or create novel tools.Here we describe the multiple aspects involved in the design of tiling arrays for transcriptome analysis and detail the normalisation and analysis procedures for such microarrays. We introduce a novel design method to make two 280,000 feature microarrays covering the entire genome of the bacterial species Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis, respectively, as well as the use of multiple copies of control probe-sets on tiling microarrays. Furthermore, a novel normalisation and background estimation procedure for tiling arrays is presented along with a method for array analysis focused on detection of short transcripts. The design, normalisation and analysis methods have been applied in various experiments and several of the detected novel short transcripts have been biologically confirmed by Northern blot tests.Tiling-arrays are becoming increasingly applicable in genomic research, but researchers still lack both the tools for custom design of arrays, as well as the systems and procedures for analysis of the vast amount of data resulting from such experiments. We believe that the methods described herein will be a useful contribution and resource for researchers designing and analysing custom tiling arrays for both bacteria and higher organisms."

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a multimodular glycoprotein with three EGF-like modules, E1, E2, and E3, arranged in tandem. These modules likely propagate conformational changes between surrounding C-terminal and N-terminal elements of TSP-1 and interact with other extracellular molecules. E1, E2, and their homologs in other TSPs are unique among EGF-like modules in having two residues rather than one between Cys-4 and Cys-5. In addition, E2 has a calcium-binding site and an unusually long loop between Cys-5 and Cys-6.

Monoclonal antibodies HB8432 and C6.7, which recognize epitopes in E2, bound to E12, E23, or E123 with greater affinity than to E2 alone.

These results indicate that interactions among the modules of E123 influence the tertiary structure and calcium binding of E2.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). TSP-1, which was the first TSP to be discovered and remains the best characterized, and TSP-2 are trimers. Each subunit is composed of an N-terminal module, oligomerization domain, von Willebrand factor type C module, three properdin or TSP type 1 modules, and the C-terminal signature domain that includes three EGF-like modules (E123), 13 aspartate-rich calcium-binding repeats of the wire module, and a lectin-like module (2Adams J.C.

Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). All have a signature domain, with the major difference being the presence of four rather than three EGF-like modules in the signature domain of pentameric TSPs.EGF-like modules exist in more than 300 human extracellular proteins and play important roles in biological processes such as blood clotting and cell-cell signaling (5Zanuttin F.

The modules are 30–50 residues long and characterized by six cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds in the order 1–3, 2–4, and 5–6 (Fig. 1) (6Wouters M.A. Rigoutsos I. Chu C.K. Feng L.L.

Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The backbone structure of the EGF-like modules consists of two submodules, referred to as the major (N-terminal) and minor (C-terminal) submodules (6Wouters M.A. Rigoutsos I. Chu C.K. Feng L.L. Sparrow D.B. Dunwoodie S.L. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Drakenberg T. Ghasriani H. Thulin E. Thämlitz A.M. Muranyi A. Annila A. Stenflo J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of the three EGF-like modules of TSP-2 has been solved as part of the TSP-2 signature domain in 2 mm calcium (Ca2+) (Fig. 1) (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All have the 1–3, 2–4, and 5–6 disulfide pattern. There is one Ca2+-binding site in the second EGF-like module (E2), located near the interface between the first and second EGF-like modules (E1 and E2) (Fig. 1). There is only one residue between the fourth and fifth cysteines in most EGF-like modules (6Wouters M.A. Rigoutsos I. Chu C.K. Feng L.L. Sparrow D.B. Dunwoodie S.L. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, E1 and E2 of TSP-1 and TSP-2 and three of the four EGF-like modules (E1, E2, and E2′) of pentameric TSPs have two residues between the fourth and fifth Cys. This difference is potentially important because the N-terminal major submodule of the repeat containing the 1–3 and 2–4 disulfides and the C-terminal submodule with the 5–6 disulfide have the potential to undergo hinge-like motions around the residues between the fourth and fifth Cys (6Wouters M.A. Rigoutsos I.

Having two rather than one residue between these two Cys increases the potential flexibility. In addition, E2 modules in all five TSPs contain an unusually long loop of 23 residues between the fifth and sixth Cys (Fig. 1). In the TSP-2 signature domain structure, residues from the long loop interact with repeat 12N of the wire module (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). E3, which has one residue between the fourth and fifth Cys, interacts with the wire and the lectin-like module (3Carlson C.B. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A common polymorphism (N700S) in wire repeat 1C of human TSP-1 influences the stability of the EGF-like modules (10Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the interactions between the EGF-like modules and more C-terminal elements of the signature domain allow conformational changes in the more C-terminal elements to be propagated N-terminally.The EGF-like modules (E123) of TSP-1 denature in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with a melting temperature of ∼68 °C in 2 mm Ca2+ (10Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although most EGF-like modules are stable to heating (7Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We have investigated this transition in detail to learn its origins and the influence of Ca2+. The results indicate interactions among the modules of E123 that enhance Ca2+ binding and influence the tertiary structure of E2.RESULTSThe recombinant proteins were expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified from conditioned medium with nickel chelate chromatography. The average yields of the recombinant proteins from 1 liter of conditioned medium varied from 5.6 mg for E3 to 55 mg for E123 (Table 1). Proteins had >95% purity by SDS-PAGE (data not shown).EGF modules typically have a far-UV CD spectrum with a minimum at ∼200 nm that is stable upon heating (5Zanuttin F. Guarnaccia C. Pintar A. Pongor S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4229-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 9Kohda D. Inagaki F.

J. 2004; 21: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The spectra of E1, E2, E3, E12, E23, and E123 each had a negative band with slightly different minima at 25 °C as follows: 203 nm for E1, E2, and E3; 209 nm for E12; 205 nm for E23; and 207 nm for E123 (Fig. 2A). In addition, E1 had a positive peak at 230 nm. The positive maximum that was prominent only in the spectra of E1 likely arises from Trp-570, as described in the previous far-UV CD results of EGF-like modules with tryptophan (9Kohda D. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11928-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Kitamura M. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Ishimizu T. Hase S. Glycoconj.

The shapes of the negative bands are compatible with the lack of α-helix or β-sheet in E1, E2, and E3 in the TSP-2 signature domain structure (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M.

Protein Res. 1992; 39: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When the proteins were heated from 25 to 70 °C, the spectrum of E2 (Fig. 2B) or E1 or E3 (not shown) changed little. For E12, E23, and E123, the minima of the negative bands shifted to 203 nm (Fig. 2, C and D, and data not shown). The shift occurred at about 55 °C for E12 and E23 and 65 °C for E123 (Fig. 2, C and D, insets).FIGURE 2Far UV CD of E1, E2, E3, E12, E23, and E123. A, spectra of the six proteins at 25 °C.

The melting temperature for E123 matched the 68 °C transition found in DSC of the signature domain of TSP-2 in 2 mm Ca2+ and attributed to E123 (10Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, DSC was performed on all six constructs. For E1, E2, and E3, there was no obvious melting temperature (Tm) up to 85 °C (Fig. 3A). In contrast, peaks with maxima at 58.9, 52.2, and 67.6 °C were found for E12, E23, and E123, respectively, in 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3, B–D). Denaturations were reversible. The melting curves of E12 and E123 fitted a model with a single transition when analyzed by Origin 7.0. The melting temperatures and energies involved in the denaturation processes were different when the Ca2+ concentration was changed (Fig. 3, B–D, and Table 2). The melting temperatures of E12 shifted from 52.2 °C in EDTA to 54.9 °C in 0.2 mm Ca2+ and reached 58.9 °C in 2 mm Ca2+. The ΔH values were ∼50 kcal/mol. The Tm of E23 shifted from 44.3 °C in EDTA to 49.4 °C in 0.2 mm Ca2+ and to 52.2 °C in 2 mm Ca2+. The data for E23 and the quality of base lines did not allow curve fitting or estimations of ΔH values. The Tm of E123 changed from 59.0 °C in EDTA to 62.6 °C in 0.2 mm Ca2+ and to 67.6 °C in 2 mm Ca2+. The ΔH increased from 33 kcal/mol in EDTA to 44 kcal/mol in 0.2 mm Ca2+ and 63 kcal/mol in 2 mm Ca2+.FIGURE 3DSC of E1, E2, E3, E12, E23, and E123.

In the TSP-2 signature domain crystal, there is one Ca2+-binding site in E2 near the interface with E1 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We reasoned that binding of this site may be linked to the interaction of E2 with adjacent modules, and we therefore tested kinetics and energetics of Ca2+ binding to the site in recombinant E2, E12, E23, and E123 at 25 °C using ITC. Binding was tighter in the presence of E1 or E3 or of both E1 and E3, with KD values of 11.5 μm for E2, 2.9 μm for E12, 2.2 μm for E23, and 0.3 μm for E123 (Fig. 4 and Table 3). In addition, the data indicated that 1 mol of E123 bound 0.7 mol of Ca2+, whereas E2, E12, and E23 bound significantly less Ca2+, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 mol respectively. Finally, the tracings of E2, E12, and E23 were strange with less heat flow with the first 5-μl injections. Thermodynamically, the negative ΔH and positive ΔS indicated that the Ca2+ binding is driven by both enthalpy and entropy in all cases (Table 3).FIGURE 4ITC of Ca2+ binding.

This conclusion was tested further with two anti-TSP-1 monoclonal antibodies, HB8432 and C6.7, which recognize epitopes that include Glu-609 of E2 (14Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). HB4832 recognizes this epitope better when the complete signature domain is present, whereas C6.7 recognizes E12 and the complete signature domain equally well as assessed by a competitive ELISA (15Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In competition ELISAs, recognition of E2 by HB8432 was 30–100-fold less than recognitions of E12, E23, or E123 (Fig. 5A). The EC50 values of the bindings were 120, 24, 30, and 2.8 μm for E2, E12, E23, and E123, respectively. C6.7 recognized E12, E23, and E123 equally well but failed to recognize E2 (Fig. 5B). Similar results were found in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5) and in EDTA (data not shown).FIGURE 5Competition ELISAs by soluble proteins.

ELISAs were performed in the presence of 2.0 mm Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe EGF-like modules of group A TSPs are unusual in two respects as described in the Introduction and as follows: the presence of two residues between Cys-4 and Cys-5 of E1 and E2; and the intimate interactions among E2, E3, and the wire and lectin-like modules. Individual EGF-like modules are heat-stable in that the modules do not denature until the temperature is higher than 90 °C (7Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our results with far-UV CD and DSC of E1, E2, and E3 alone agree with this generalization; the far-UV CD of these recombinant EGF-like modules changed little as the temperature was raised, and no transition was evident in DSC up to 85 °C.Far UV CD and DSC analysis revealed that, in contrast to the single modules, the tandem E12, E23, and E123 constructs had transitions with Tm values in the range of 44–68 °C. The transition seen with the tandem modules likely arises from perturbation of a conformation in E2 that is induced by interactions with the adjacent modules. Competition ELISA showed that HB4832 and C6.7 recognize epitopes on E2 that are exposed preferentially in constructs that include E1 or E3 or both E1 and E3. The effects of surrounding modules of the antigenicity of E2 were found in the presence and absence of Ca2+. There are two possible reasons for the epitope recognition differences. The first is that E2 is less well structured in the absence of the adjacent EGF-like modules, so that the binding site is exposed differently. The second possibility is that there are two or more distinct populations of E2 conformers, and the presence of adjacent modules influences the fraction of E2 that is in a given conformation. Based on the crystal structure of the TSP-2 signature domain (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and residues that are identical in TSP-1 and TSP-2, one would expect that Arg-623 in the long loop between the fifth and sixth Cys of E2 forms a salt bridge with Asp-671 of E3, and 632QGVE of the long loop of E2 interacts with 577PGY of E1 through side chain interactions. Therefore, the long loop is positioned to interact with both E1 and E3 and may be the structural element of E2 that is most influenced by module-module interactions.Approximately 35% of EGF-like modules in the data base are predicted to bind Ca2+ (8Drakenberg T. Ghasriani H. Thulin E. Thämlitz A.M. Muranyi A. Annila A. Stenflo J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8782-8789Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on the structures of a number of Ca2+-binding EGF-like modules (20Boswell E.J. Kurniawan N.D. Downing A.K. Messerschmidt A. Handbook of Metalloproteins. Wiley, New York2004: 553-570Google Scholar), the Ca2+-binding site on E2 in the TSP-2 signature domain crystal (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and sequence alignments of the EGF-like modules of TSP-1 and TSP-2, one may predict the Ca2+ coordination pattern of E2 of TSP-1 as involving the side chains of Asp-588, Asn-610, and Glu-591 and main chain carbonyl groups of Val-589, Thr-611, and Gly-614. ITC of Ca2+ binding of the recombinant TSP-1 EGF-like modules E2, E12, E23, and E123 demonstrated that, when compared with E2 alone, the affinity increases 10-fold when E1 or E3 is adjacent to E2 and 100-fold in E123 and that there was also greater fractional occupancy when the adjacent modules were present. These findings are compatible with the scenario in which there are two or more distinct populations of E2 conformers, and the presence of adjacent modules influences the fraction of E2 that is capable of binding Ca2+. We cannot explain why E2, E12, and E23 required one injection of Ca2+ to facilitate Ca2+ binding, whereas E123 did not. β-Hydroxylation of the Asp/Asn in the sequence CX(D/N)XXXX(Y/F)XC between the third and fourth Cys is important for Ca2+ binding to EGF-like modules (21Stenflo J. Stenberg Y. Muranyi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The post-translational modification is often partial and requires the native conformation (22Fernlund P. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12509-12512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Stenflo J. Ohlin A.K. Owen W.G. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the recombinant EGF-like modules adopt different conformations that influence Asn-610 β-hydroxylation and the ability to bind Ca2+.DSC demonstrated that binding of Ca2+ stabilizes the conformation induced in E2 by the presence of E1 and/or E3. Most likely, Ca2+ stabilizes the interactions at the interfaces between E1 and E2 and between E2 and E3 and thereby enhances the effects of the interfaces on the conformation of E2 at higher temperatures, even though the antibody probes indicated that at 25 °C the conformation of E2 is not dependent on the occupation of the Ca2+.In addition to the Ca2+-binding site in E2, the TSP-1 signature domain is predicted to have 26 binding sites in the wire and 4 binding sites in the lectin-like module (4Carlson C.B.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because a transition attributable to the EGF-like modules is found in DSC of the complete signature domains of TSP-1 and TSP-2 (10Carlson C.B. Liu Y. Keck J.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20069-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and HB4832 and C6.7 recognize E2 in the TSP-1 signature domain (14Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to assume that the Ca2+-binding site in E2 is similar in the tandem construct and signature domain. The sub-micromolar binding of Ca2+ to E123 is considerably tighter than the ∼100 μm binding of Ca2+ to the wire (25Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Pranghofer M.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51915-51922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The affinity for binding of Ca2+ to the lectin-like module is not known.The presence of two rather than one residue between the fourth and fifth cysteines in E1 and E2 is predicted to increase the flexibility within these modules by hinge-like movement around the residues, as described in the Introduction. Such movement may be impeded in E2 compared with E1 because the long loop between the fifth and sixth cysteines interacts extensively with the N-terminal submodule. Interactions of the long loop in E2 with E1 and E3 may impede such flexibility further. We speculate that the interaction of E1 with E2 may influence the flexibility of E1 but has no evidence for such an hypothesis. In particular, intrinsic fluorescence and near UV CD, which would be expected to be influenced by changes in the environment of Trp-570 in E1, were identical in E1 and E12 (data not shown).Pentameric TSPs have a fourth EGF-like module (E2′) that is interposed between E2 and E3. E2′ is predicted to have a Ca2+-binding site and has the same unusual cysteine spacing pattern present in E1 and E2 of TSP-1. The difference in effects of E123 and E122′3 groupings on the conformation of E2 and dynamics of the tandem modules may be profound. The signature domain of TSP-4 precipitates when subjected to DSC, whereas the signature domain of TSP-2 is stable (26Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast to the reversible denaturation of E123 of TSP-1 (Fig. 3D), recombinant E122′3 of TSP-4 subjected to DSC precipitates at ∼60 °C (data not shown). E2 is predicted to interact with the Ca2+-binding face of E2′ rather than E3 with the potential for cooperative binding of Ca2+ to the sites in E2 and E2′. In addition, there are three rather than two sites of potential intra-module flexibility in the E122′3 grouping. Further studies of the interactions among the EGF-like modules of the pentameric TSPs are needed, e.g. looking for the type of allosterism demonstrated for the four tandem EGF-like module of protein S, in which binding of Ca2+ the most C-terminal module changes the conformation of the most N-terminal module (13Persson K.E. Stenflo J. Linse S. Stenberg Y. Preston R.J. Lane D.A. Rezende S.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10682-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Several observations indicate that changes in the signature domain cause conformational changes in more N-terminal parts of TSP-1. Binding of monoclonal antibodies and heparin to the N-terminal modules is influenced by the presence or absence of Ca2+ in the signature domain (27Calzada M.J. Kuznetsova S.A. Sipes J.M. Rodrigues R.G. Cashel J.A. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of latent transforming growth factor-β by the thrombospondin repeat 1 is blocked by antibody mAb133, which reacts with the signature domain (14Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

 inflammation. The mechanisms that maintain this hyporesponsiveness are just beginning to be unravelled. Dendritic cells, the key organizers of appropriate immune responses, actively sample
 commensal microbes. In organs other than the gut, this would trigger a strong immune response, and the responsiveness of intestinal dendritic cells to microbes is thought to be thwarted by
 anti-inflammatory molecules released by gut cells. But the situation could be much more complex: hyporesponsiveness might be restricted to certain 'microbe-associated molecular patterns'
 (MAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharides, large molecules attached to the outer membrane of many bacteria. Linda Klavinskis of Kings College London and her team have analysed the
 MAMP-responsiveness of dendritic cells migrating from gut tissue to local lymph nodes. Surprisingly, these cells do respond to harmless Bacillus spores and most MAMPs — but not
 lipopolysaccharides (V. Cerovic et al. J. Immunol. 182, 2405–2415; 2009). Does this suggest that hyporesponsiveness of intestinal dendritic cells is transient? The maintenance of
 hyporesponsiveness in the gut mucosa, patterns of MAMP-hyporesponsiveness, and localization and timing of MAMP responses will be important topics for future research. Unfortunately,
 unactivated dendritic cells are hard to isolate from the gut mucosa. In situ analysis of dendritic-cell responses to gut microbes in intact tissue holds much promise. Technical advances in
 multicolour two-photon microscopy, fluorescently tagged microbes, and transgenic mice expressing cell-type and response-specific fluorescent reporter proteins will be instrumental in this key
 area of biology."
