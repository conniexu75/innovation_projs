https://openalex.org/W2016576879,"The mineral content of bone can be determined by measuring the absorption by bone of a monochromatic, low-energy photon beam which originates in a radioactive source (iodine-125 at 27.3 kev or americium 241 at 59.6 kev). The intensity of the beam transmitted by the bone is measured by counting with a scintillation detector. Since the photon source and detector are well collimated, errors resulting from scattered radiation are reduced. From measurements of the intensity of the transmitted beam, made at intervals across the bone, the total mineral content of the bone can be determined. The results are accurate and reproducible to within about 3 percent."

https://openalex.org/W1970001287,"By administering C14-labeled tyrosine or H3-labeled 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to guinea pigs it has been possible to achieve sufficient labeling of the norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain to permit measurement of their turnover rates. The half-life of brain dopamine was about 2.5 hours. The half-life of norepinephrine was about 4 hours, suggesting a rate of synthesis of at least 0.03 to 0.04 μg/g per hr or 2.4 μg/day for the whole guinea pig brain."
https://openalex.org/W2080089284,"Pregnant rats were either unmanipulated or were handled for 10 minutes three times daily throughout pregnancy. Offspring remained with their natural mothers or were crossfostered within and between experimental and control groups. When tested at 45 and 100 days of age, the offspring of handled mothers were found to be generally less emotional than the controls."
https://openalex.org/W1993280986,"The DNA of bacteriophage SP8, when denatured, yields two components differing in buoyant density in cesium chloride gradients and separable by chromatography on a column of methylated bovine serum albumin and kieselguhr. The denser of the two strands (H) contains more pyrimidines and fewer purines than the lighter (L) strand. Only the H strand forms hybrids with the RNA synthesized by the infected host. The L strand is capable of annealing with complementary RNA synthesized in vitro with it as primer in reactions catalyzed by RNA polymerase. During the vegetative development of phage, host-specific messenger RNA is also synthesized."
https://openalex.org/W2042858277,"Long-term epileptiform seizures were induced in the cat by a single stimulation of the basolateral components of the amygdala with cholinergic agents. These electro-physiological changes were accompanied by persisting alterations of the animal's ""emotional responsiveness."" It is evident dent that electroencephalographic seizure activity and overt behavior can be dissociated in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2035190691,"The cortisone-induced de novo synthesis of liver glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase, aldolase, and lactic dehydrogenase was prevented by injections of Actinomycin D in the rat. In the in vitro assay systems, addition of actinomycin exerted no effect on the enzyme activities examined. The evidence favors the concept that the increased gluconeogenesis induced by corticoids entails at a certain stage an increased rate in the synthesis of gluconeogenic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2050613810,"Rabbit gamma globulin has been extensively reduced, and its polypeptide chains separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in SM guanidine hydrochloride. The larger H (or A) chains make up two-thirds of the molecule and have a molecular weight of approximately 55,000 each. The smaller L (or B) chains account for the other one-third and have a molecular weight of approximately 25,000 each. The data are consistent with a model of the gamma globulin molecule that has two H and two L chains."
https://openalex.org/W2056034149,"Delayed utilization of tritiated thymidine by regenerating mouse liver can be almost completely suppressed by a continuous infusion of nonradioactive thymidine. In addition, as shown earlier for lymphocytes, labeled granulocytes are a potential source of the tritium marker. These observations suggest that the delayed incorporation of label into DNA must be due to the transfer of labeled nucleoside, which may be derived either from the degradation of DNA or from a long-lived intracellular pool. In either case, the transferred material probably originates from all tissues that have a high rate of cell turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2074027151,A microbeam probe capable of vaporizing many biological materials is formed by focusing a conventional laser through a microscope objective. The elemental gases which are excited by this demagnified spot are raised to emission levels when sparked between carbon electrodes. Elemental analysis is then performed on the excited material by conventional spectroscopy. The method is simple and rapid. Simultaneous analysis of multiple elements is practical.
https://openalex.org/W2074651433,"Aqueous extraction of lyophilized Anacystis nidulans cells followed by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose separates three different c-type cytochromes. Of the two present in highest concentration, cytochrome-554 has a +0.35-volt redox potential and resembles the cytochrome f of other photosynthetic tissues, while cytochrome-549 has a -0.26-volt potential. The possible participation of cytochrome-549 in electron transport in photosynthesis in this alga at a more negative oxidation-reduction potential than previously postulated for any cytochrome is inferred from the similarities in its spectra to the light-induced spectral changes in vivo observed by others."
https://openalex.org/W1999774960,"In 19 lots of standard commercial gamma globulin from humans, the titers of antibody neutralizing rubella virus varied from 256 to 2048. The titers could not be correlated with geographic location of the donors, method of extraction, or tissue source. Samples of gamma globulin from rubella convalescents had titers of 4096. These titers were approximately 20 times higher than those in serum specimens from patients ill with natural or experimental infection. Serum antibody appears to persist for a number of years at nearly the original titers."

https://openalex.org/W2048125059,"The tyrosyl groups of reduced and carboxymethylated human serum albumin, in which all disulfide bonds are broken, ionize at lower pH than those of native albumin, in spite of the greater negative charge on the protein produced by the S-carboxy-methyl groups. The heat and entropy of ionization of these groups in the reduced albumin are also ""normal,"" in contrast to native albumin. Spectro-photometric titrations at 244 and 295 mmicro give equivalent results. The more open structure of the reduced albumin, as compared with the native protein, presumably allows the tyrosine groups to come freely into contact with solvent. In acid solutions the heights of the two peaks at 236 and 287 mmicro in the difference spectrum (albumin at pH 7 against albumin at a lower pH) are strictly proportional over the whole course of the titration. Both peaks apparently arise from changes in the environment of tyrosyl residues, rather than from more general conformational changes."

https://openalex.org/W2090525134,"One year after exposure to intense electric shock, rats were punished with shocks of lesser intensity. The previous exposure increased the suppressive effects of the punishment during both the initial encounter with punishment and over the course of a 7-day test period. Rats that had not been previously exposed to shock recovered during continued shock punishment."
https://openalex.org/W2069306511,"The activity of an enzyme system which readily converts estriol to 16-ketoestradiol is present only in the kidneys of mature female rats and is absent in the kidneys of male rats and immature rats of either sex. The full enzyme activity occurs in kidneys of rats of either sex at any stage of maturity after administration of estradiol for 2 weeks. The time course of the appearance and disappearance of the enzyme, the absence of detectable inhibitors and activators, and evaluation of cofactor requirements suggest that this may be an example of enzyme induction by the hormone. Furthermore, the enzyme activity itself represents a metabolic pathway for estriol metabolism whose potential quantitative significance has not heretofore been recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2089825992,"The relationship between generalization and discrimination is explored in the present study by utilizing the results of systematic changes in the generalization gradient to predict changes in discrimination behavior. In the first of two experiments, differing groups of pigeons were trained to respond to a wavelength of 550 mmicro under conditions of varying schedules of reinforcement. Generalization gradients were then obtained and the ratios of the responses to selected discriminative stimuli calculated. These were used to predict discrimination behavior in a second experiment using the same stimuli. Both the number of trials to a discrimination criterion and the ratio of response indicate the plausibilty of an inverse hypothesis, and the applicability of the generalization model to related behavior such as discrimination."

https://openalex.org/W2064166820,"SEVERAL investigations have been carried out on the relative difficulties of learning the various ‘arithmetical facts’ or tautologies contained in the multiplication and addition tables. A variety of operational criteria of ‘difficulty’ have been used by different workers, one of whom1 gives a comparative review of earlier work, with which his own results substantially agree. In particular it seems clear that the chief source of difficulty with a given combination (such as 2.7 = 14 or 4 + 5 = 9) is the size of the numbers concerned. However, on the question of which numbers, exactly, are responsible for the difficulty—the addends and factors, or the sums and products—both the evidence and the considered opinions of different investigators are nicely balanced between the two points of view."
