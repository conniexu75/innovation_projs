https://openalex.org/W1561943245,"Abstract A simple, rapid, manual technique is described for determining the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of proteins on a nanomole scale. In this modification of the 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Edman degradation, inorganic carriers permit convenient manipulation of small amounts of protein, and use of the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate throughout the procedure maintains protein solubility. Nanomole quantities of pure protein for such sequence analysis are readily isolated from multicomponent systems by analytical scale polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Proteins are recovered quantitatively from the gel by elution. The method is therefore suitable for characterization of the proteins derived from multichain enzymes and viruses."

The stained cell body and its branches throughout the neuropil are visible in both the light and electron microscope. In whole mount preparations, the resolution of neurites within the neuropil is of a quality that permits the comparison of branching patterns between cells and during various functional states."

Mice that respond well to this antigen produce antibody restricted with respect to light chain class (lambda) and to an antigenic determinant resulting from a particular heavy and light chain interaction. The response to dextran is controlled by a locus linked to the-heavy chain locus."

Detergent binding was determined by subjecting the proteins to gel filtration in the presence of micellar concentrations of radioactive deoxycholate or the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. The amount of detergents bound to the proteins could be measured from the amount of radioactive detergent that co-eluted with the protein. The lipophilic proteins bound large amounts of deoxycholate and Triton X-100 (up to about 70% of their weight). The hydrophilic proteins tested bound little or no deoxycholate or Triton X-100."
https://openalex.org/W1576239999,"Abstract Polysomes involved in ovalbumin synthesis were identified by the binding of 125I-anti-ovalbumin to hen oviduct polysomes. Techniques were developed for the isolation of undegraded hen oviduct polysomes and for the preparation of 125I-γ-globulin free of ribonuclease activity. The distribution of 125I-anti-ovalbumin in the polysome profile is in accordance with the size of the polysomes that are expected to be synthesizing ovalbumin. Anti-ovalbumin does not react with polysomes extracted from tissues that do not synthesize ovalbumin, and antibodies directed against a protein that is not synthesized in the oviduct do not bind to hen oviduct polysomes. These criteria indicate that the reaction is specific for polysomes that synthesize ovalbumin. Polysomes that bind 125I-anti-ovalbumin can be precipitated by the addition of ovalbumin and an excess of specific antibody."

Crushed single crystals of these compounds compare favorably with commercial platinum catalysts in initial activity and lifetime. Therefore, these compounds are promising substitutes for platinum in devices for the catalytic treatment of auto exhaust."
https://openalex.org/W1639043875,"Abstract The relationship between spleen and liver microsomal heme oxygenase activities and the microsomal electron transport system requiring NADPH and cytochrome P-450 has been demonstrated by immunochemical techniques. An antibody preparation to purified, homogeneous NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (NADPH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.2.3) was shown to inhibit concomitantly NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and heme oxygenase activities in rat liver and spleen and pig spleen microsomal preparations. Previous work demonstrated the requirement for this enzymic activity in the reduction of cytochrome P-450 associated with drug hydroxylation reactions and steroid metabolism by concomitant inhibition of these various activities with anti-NADPH-cytochrome c reductase γ-globulin. The levels of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase in both rat and pig spleen reported in the present study are less than 10% of those found in rat and pig liver. Even at these levels, however, the reductase activity is sufficient to maintain the electron flux required for heme oxygenase activity under conditions in which heme catabolism is maximal. Methemalbumin treatment of rats resulted in a 3.7-fold increase in hepatic heme oxygenase activity which was concomitantly inhibited by anti-reductase γ-globulin, indicating that the induced enzyme system maintained its requirement for the microsomal electron transport system. Comparison of electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and ethyl isocyanide difference spectra of liver microsomes from untreated and methemalbumin-treated rats failed to demonstrate the induction of a new cytochrome moiety as a result of in vivo administration of methemalbumin, a substrate for the heme oxygenase system. The administration of methemalbumin in vivo to rats did not result in an increase in the components of the hepatic microsomal electron transport system, i.e. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity or cytochrome P-450 content, indicating that the modulation and control mechanisms of the microsomal heme oxygenase system differ from those governing the microsomal electron transport system. Methemalbumin treatment resulted in noncompetitive inhibition of the binding of both Type I and Type II drugs in rat liver microsomal preparations. In addition to the antibody inhibition studies, the temporal relationship demonstrated among the decrease in magnitude of binding spectra of hexobarbital, the increase in heme oxygenase activity, the decrease in measurable cytochrome P-450 content, and the reversal of these parameters during the recovery phase following a single injection of methemalbumin strongly indicates the involvement of the same components of the microsomal electron transport system in both the drug metabolism and heme oxygenase systems in liver."

https://openalex.org/W2020637219,"Spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with heat-killed rough pneumococci (strain R36A) or spleen cells from normal mice immunized in vitro with the same antigen produce direct hemolytic plaques against sheep erythrocytes coated with pneumococcal C polysaccharide or conjugated with phosphorylcholine. Formation of plaques is specifically inhibited by phosphorylcholine or by antiserum to mouse immunoglobulin A myeloma protein which binds phosphorylcholine. Thus, the myeloma proteins and normal BALB/c antibodies share similar idiotypic determinants. This experimental system is suitable for probing the role of the antigen receptor in the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1981503766,"Protein separation has been achieved by electrical field-flow fractionation, a heretofore unrealized separation technique. Some advantages of this method relative to electrophoresis are the low voltage required, the lack of adverse heating and support effects, and the existence of the method as an elution technique. A comparison of theoretical and experimental retention shows good agreement."

https://openalex.org/W1573305046,"Abstract An abnormal prothrombin was identified with immunochemical methods in the plasma from dicoumarol-treated oxen. During dicoumarol treatment this abnormal prothrombin increased in concentration, while the concentration of normal prothrombin decreased. In contrast with normal prothrombin, this abnormal prothrombin is not adsorbed to barium citrate, and it remains apparently unchanged in samples in which normal prothrombin has been activated. After removal of normal prothrombin from the plasma by adsorption to barium citrate, the dicoumarol-induced prothrombin was purified by a procedure involving ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-Sephadex, and hydroxylapatite and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The purified material was homogenous by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. It has the same main antigenic determinants as normal prothrombin but no prothrombin activity. The electrophoretic mobility of the abnormal prothrombin, unlike that of normal prothrombin, does not vary with the concentration of calcium in the buffer."

https://openalex.org/W2094665754,"Comparable depression of synaptic transmission in the avian ciliary ganglion resulted from either section or localized colchicine treatment of the ciliary nerves. Both colchicine treatment and axotomy produced similar changes in RNA distribution in the cell bodies as well. Colchicine did not directly affect transmission, and action potential propagation along the ciliary nerves was normal. Interference with axoplasmic transport of material in both cases is postulated to signal the observed chromatolytic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2090473114,"Reduction and alkylation of purified hepatitis-associated Australia antigen (hepatitis B antigen) resulted in a total loss of serologic activity. The reduced and alkylated protein formed a single band with a sedimentation coefficient of 31S on analytical ultracentrifugation, and no subunits were detected by Sephadex gel filtration. Although this preparation induced a delayed hypersensitivity response when injected into guinea pigs, it failed to stimulate humoral antibody formation. The data suggest that hepatitis B antigen is a conformational antigen critically dependent upon the disulfide bonds of the protein moiety."

In this respect, the activity of the two normal human lymphocyte polymerases closely resembles the activity of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase 1. The viral and cellular DNA polymerases are equally active with the nonspecific template, poly(rA) . poly(dT). Criteria for distinguishing the activity of viral reverse transcriptase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1662472353,"Abstract The binding of phytohemagglutinins from Phaseolus vulgaris (erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA) and leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA)) and from Lens culinaris (lentil-PHA) to human platelet cell surfaces has been demonstrated. Each platelet binds on an average 500,000 to 600,000 molecules of E-PHA with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.5 x 10-7 m. These values were 250,000 to 350,000 molecules bound for L-PHA and 300,000 to 400,000 molecules bound for lentil-PHA with dissociation constants of 4 x 10-7 m and 1.4 x 10-7 m, respectively. Both E-PHA and lentil-PHA can be released from the platelet surface using appropriate oligosaccharide haptene inhibitors, indicating that the phytohemagglutinins do not enter the cells. When E-PHA and L-PHA bind to platelets the cells are aggregated, adenylate cyclase is inhibited, and a protein designated as thrombin-sensitive protein is released from the particulate fraction of the cell. Thus, binding of these compounds to the platelet surface mimics thrombin-induced aggregation and the release reaction. Lentil-PHA binds tightly to platelets but the cells do not aggregate and there is no inhibition of adenylate cyclase or release of thrombin-sensitive protein. Thrombin induces platelet aggregation, adenylate cyclase inhibition, and thrombin-sensitive protein release even when platelets are saturated with lentil-PHA. After incubation of platelets with either thrombin or L-PHA, there is an apparent 2-fold increase in the number of receptor sites for lentil-PHA, suggesting that these compounds produce a conformational change in the platelet surface exposing increased numbers of lentil-PHA receptor sites."
https://openalex.org/W1536861153,"Immunological techniques have been developed for the quantification and isolation of polysomes involved in ovalbumin synthesis. For the quantification of ovalbumin polysomes, two methods have been developed; one is based on the binding of 125I-anti-ovalbumin, the other is based on the immunoprecipitation of polysomes. There is a good correlation between the relative rate of ovalbumin synthesis and the extent of 125I-anti-ovalbumin binding to ribosomes or the amount of RNA extracted from polysome immunoprecipitates. With special care to exclude ribonuclease activity, RNA can be obtained from precipitated polysomes in an undegraded state. Such RNA can direct the synthesis of complete ovalbumin chains in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system from rabbit reticulocytes. RNA extracted from polysomes not precipitated by anti-ovalbumin antibody is incapable of directing ovalbumin synthesis. Recovery of messenger RNA activity is essentially quantitative, and the specific activity of ovalbumin mRNA is increased 2.5-fold over that obtained from total polysomes. Nascent chains obtained from immunoprecipitated polysomes are of the size of ovalbumin and smaller, in contrast to nascent chains from total polysomes which contain larger size classes. The results in total indicate that ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes can be immunoprecipitated quantitatively in an undegraded state, and that ovalbumin mRNA can be extracted from such immunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitation of polysomes may potentially be a general method for isolation of specific polysomes, including their mRNA content."

The concentration of the naphthalenes (determined by liquid chromatography) correlates with the effective storm-water runoff content of the river. These data suggest a multiplicity of sources ranging from indigenous biological materials to automobile exhaust condensate."
https://openalex.org/W2037626730,"The segregation of the human peptidase-C phenotype in five different series of human-mouse hybrid clones was examined. The chromosome constitution of these hybrids was determined by quinacrine mustard fluorescence, Giemsa banding, and constitutive heterochromatin staining. That the clones could be classified without exception either as human peptidase C positive/ A-1 positive (14 clones), or as peptidase C negative/ A-1 negative (12 clones) indicates that peptidase C can be assigned to the human A-i chromosome. Data from an extensive series of human-mouse clones used provide support for the syntenic association between peptidase C and phosphoglucomutase-1 and by inference a linkage of both to Rh factor group."

Silver grains are found unilaterally over nerve tracts containing efferent fibers from the tectum, a result that suggests intercellular migration of labeled molecules. The low background and high specific grain density obtained with [(3)H]proline radioautography indicate the usefulness of this technique for the elucidation of neuroanatomical connections in the visual system."
https://openalex.org/W1546842811,"Abstract The rates of biosynthesis of purines from glycine have been examined in an established line of rat hepatoma cells in continuous culture. The presence of 10-4 m adenine in the culture medium causes a prompt 4-fold to 5-fold decline in the rate of [14C]glycine incorporation into purines, and the capacity for de novo purine biosynthesis decays with a half-time of approximately 4 hours. Upon removal of adenine, the rate promptly increases, but the increase can be prevented by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Neither cycloheximide nor actinomycin D prevents the decline in purine synthesis caused by adenine. Cycloheximide or actinomycin D alone causes a fall in the rate of purine formation, and the rate decays with a half-time of about 2 hours. The presence of 5-azacytidine, a pyrimidine analog which does not significantly inhibit RNA synthesis but is probably incorporated into RNA molecules, also causes the rate to decay with a similar half-time. The intracellular accumulation of α-N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (in the presence of 6.4 x 10-6 m azaserine in the culture medium) is repressed and derepressed by the addition and removal, respectively, of exogenous adenine. The kinetics of derepression and the inhibition by cycloheximide and 5-azacytidine of the rate of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide accumulation suggest that the regulation in the first third of the pathway is responsible for the control of the entire pathway by adenine. Under the conditions employed, the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of the precursor, glycine, do not change. The first three enzymes committed to de novo purine synthesis, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate glutamyl amidotransferase, glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, are not repressed or derepressed by the presence or absence of adenine in the culture medium. The identity of the repressible macromolecule(s) is unknown at present but it appears not to be specifically committed to purine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1520320672,"To test the immunological prediction that there should be two amino acid sequence differences between the lysozymes of the bobwhite quail and the chicken, the sequences of these two lysozymes have now been compared. Lysozyme purified from bobwhite quail egg white was reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. The resulting 18 peptides were separated and their compositions determined. Four of them differed in composition from the corresponding chicken egg white lysozyme peptides. The compositional differences could be accounted for by four amino acid substitutions. The positions at which the substitutions relative to chicken lysozyme occur were found by analysis and sequential degradation of these four tryptic peptides to be serine for threonine40, valine for isoleucine55, lysine for arginine68, and threonine for serine91. It is remarkable that three of the four interchanges appear from the three-dimensional model of chicken lysozyme to have occurred at buried positions. The remaining interchange, lysine for arginine68, has occurred at an exposed position and in a region shown by others to bear an antigenic determinant. The implications of the bobwhite quail sequence information with respect to the sequence-immunology correlation, lysozyme evolution, and the phylogeny of phasianoid birds are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1543784792,"Abstract The formation of complexes of rabbit hemopexin with a representative group of porphyrins was investigated to determine the stoichiometry and estimated dissociation constants (Kd) as well as the effect of pH on these interactions. In a 1:1 molar ratio, rabbit apohemopexin (RHx) binds iron-protoporphyrin IX (heme), iron-deuteroporphyrin IX (deuteroheme), iron-mesoporphyrin IX (mesoheme), and cobalt-deuteroporphyrin IX. The estimated Kd values are heme ≃ mesoheme ≃ deuteroheme ≤10-8 m; and cobalt-deuteroporphyrin ≤10-7 m. The relative affinity of RHx was shown to be deuteroheme g nickel-deuteroporphyrin IX g deuteroporphyrin IX, and cobalt-deuteroporphyrin g nickel-deuteroporphyrin, by displacement of ligands with lower affinity employing difference spectrophotometry or gel electrophoresis. The binding strength was influenced more by the presence and nature of the metal chelated to the porphyrin nitrogens than by the substitutions in positions 2,4 of the porphyrin ring. The pH dependence of the association and dissociation of the deuteroheme-RHx complex showed 50% saturation at pH 4.9 ± 0.1 and 10.7 ± 0.1. At pH values from 6 to 9.5, binding was equimolar, whereas none occurred below pH 4.0 or above pH 11.2. The circular dichroism spectrum of RHx exhibits a prominent positive maximum at 231 nm, which is tentatively ascribed to tryptophan. The ellipticity at 231 nm increases approximately 50% upon formation of the deuteroheme-RHx complex. This band is abolished both by N-bromosuccinimide treatment and by lowering the pH to 2 or raising it to 11."

In contrast, two active antitumor agents, arabinosylcytosine and 5-azacytidine, which are either incorporated into polynucleotides or affect DNA polymerase, produce chromatid breakage during G(2) phase. All of these agents except guanazole also induce breakage in S phase."

https://openalex.org/W1581161429,"Abstract Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction in fetal rat liver cells in culture by phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene proceeds just as well in 10% heat-inactivated, boiled, or dialyzed calf serum as in regular 10% calf serum in the growth medium. After the hepatocytes are attached, the serum-containing medium can be replaced with serum-free, completely defined medium for several days, so that the influence of various hormones or other endogenous compounds on the basal and inducible hydroxylase activities can be evaluated. Significant stimulatory effects are produced by testosterone, glucagon, and prostaglandins; significant decreases are seen with 17-β-estradiol, insulin, and dexamethasone. No significant effects are found with adrenocorticotropic hormone, human growth hormone, thyroxine, prolactin, derivatives of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, and numerous other endogenous compounds such as fatty acids and alkyl polyamines, alone and in combinations. The kinetics of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction by 1.0 mm norepinephrine or by other biogenic amines of similar structure is the same as that by phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene. The effects of phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene, and biogenic amines with either a phenyl or indolen ucleus on the hydroxylase induction are additive or synergistic when two or three of these types of inducers are combined in the culture medium. From the use of an aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor added prior to the biogenic amines, we conclude that the amine, rather than any metabolite, is directly involved in causing hydroxylase induction. The effect of norepinephrine is greater than that of phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene in retarding the normal rate of degradation of induced hydroxylase activity in the presence or the absence of protein synthesis. Either phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene or norepinephrine as a second inducer can direct at some posttranscriptional level a further rise in hydroxylase activity after treatment of the hepatocytes with the first inducer."

https://openalex.org/W1569720396,"Abstract The evaluation of numerous anti-κ chain antisera through immunochemical studies of κ light chains for which complete or partial sequence data were available has resulted in the localization of three distinct regions in the variant half of the light chain which are associated with specific antigenic sites. The residue at position 9 appears to be associated with an antigenic site which, in general, may be termed a group-related antigenic site. The residues at positions 45 and 94 through 96 are associated with two distinct antigenic sites which are recognized specifically by numerous antisera and are responsible for certain intergroup similarities and intragroup differences among κ chains. Many of the antisera readily distinguish among proteins which have been structurally assigned to the same subgroup. The localization of distinct regions which markedly influence the nature of the antigenicity of the light chain molecule provides a molecular basis for the observed heterogeneity among κ chains and contributes to the knowledge of the tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1549581599,Abstract Antisera against thioredoxin from Escherichia coli and phage T4 were prepared by immunization of rabbits. Both proteins were strongly immunogenic and produced specific precipitating antibodies with titers from 2 to 6 mg of antibody per ml of serum. The thioredoxin antibody of the immune rabbit serum is contained in the IgG-fraction. Antibodies against E. coli thioredoxin specifically inhibited the oxidation-reduction activity of the protein in the presence of thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. No cross-reactivity with T4 thioredoxin was observed in precipitin reactions or assays of oxidation-reduction activity. Cross-reaction with yeast thioredoxin was observed in oxidation-reduction assays and calculated to be around 25%. Yeast thioredoxin did not precipitate with antibodies against E. coli thioredoxin but inhibited the rate of precipitation of E. coli thioredoxin-antithioredoxin indicating identity of at least one single antigenic determinant in the two thioredoxins. Antibodies against T4 thioredoxin specifically inhibited T4 thioredoxin oxidation-reduction activity and showed no cross-reaction with E. coli or yeast thioredoxin in precipitin tests or enzymatic assays. The results showed the absence of common antigenic determinants in E. coli and T4 thioredoxin despite the fact that both proteins are substrates for the specific enzyme thioredoxin reductase of E. coli.

Antibodies were purified by adsorption on specific solid immunoadsorbents, followed by preparative liquid isoelectric focusing at either pH 5 to 8 or pH 7 to 10. The focused anti-Ap antibody fractions were refocused in pH gradients extending only 0.5 pH unit on either side of their respective isoelectric points. A number of focused antibody fractions demonstrated electrophoretic, structural, and functional features characteristic of homogeneous antibody populations. Amino-terminal sequences of the kappa light chains, obtained by mild reduction and alkylation followed by gel filtration, were determined for nine focused fractions of anti-Ap antibody from one rabbit, seven focused fractions of anti-Rp antibody from a second rabbit, and two focused fractions of anti-Rp antibody from a third rabbit. Amino acid sequence analyses extended for 6 to 39 positions (a few included the first hypervariable region) depending upon the quantity of light chain obtained from the focused fractions. Sequences obtained from light chains isolated from serum prior to immunization immunoglobulins or from specifically purified unfractionated antibodies were heterogeneous (2 to 4 residues at most positions), while those from the major focused antibody fractions were as homogeneous, for most of the first 25 to 30 positions, as human kappa Bence-Jones proteins sequenced by the same methods. The light chains from the focused antibodies demonstrated significant microheterogeneity and nonidentity within limited areas (positions 31 to 34). Focused antibody light chains had sequences representative of either the Vkii or Vkiii subgroups. This approach, therefore, permits structural studies to be performed on the homogeneous antibody constitutents of heterogeneous antibody preparations and demonstrates that the heterogeneity is relatively restricted to limited areas."

This RNA turned over very rapidly, 70 to 75% being degraded during a 40-min chase. There were also pulse-labeled peaks corresponding to the discrete mitochondrion-specific fractions previously described in steady state-labeled samples, the 17 S and 13 S ribosomal components, and a 4 S fraction. The ribosomal peaks were labeled considerably less rapidly than the 21 S and 25 S fractions but more rapidly than the 4 S fraction. In addition, 13 S RNA was labeled significantly more rapidly than 17 S RNA. Pulse-labeled ribosomal RNA also turned over rapidly, approximately 50% being degraded during a 40-min chase, whereas steady state-labeled ribosomal RNA was relatively stable. The significance of this apparent wastage of nascent mitochondrial ribosomal RNA is unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2412152571,"Abstract A method is described for the isolation of a hitherto unknown class of dialyzable proteins from Cohn Fraction VI of normal human plasma. The isolated protein fraction, which was shown to contain primarily basic, γ2-, γ1-, and β-globulins, revealed on ultracentrifugation a single symmetrical refractive index gradient sedimenting with a coefficient of 0.6 S and was further distinguished by the absence of carbohydrate. Purification of one of its components, a γ2-globulin, was achieved by chromatography on DEAE-, triethylaminoethyl, and CM-celluloses in conjunction with diafiltration. The resulting preparation appeared monodisperse on paper and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.9 and 4.3. The homogeneous γ2-globulin was characterized in terms of its major physicochemical and chemical properties. The molecular weight was determined to be 5100. This low molecular weight protein possesses a single polypeptide chain as deduced from its sole amino-terminal (phenylalanine) and carboxyl-terminal (lysine) amino acid residues. Moreover, this globulin is distinguished by its lack of histidine, arginine, tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine. Sequential Edman degradation established the first 6 residues as Phe-Gln-Val-Val-Asp-Tyr. Analysis of the circular dichroism spectrum of this protein showed the presence of approximately 60% β structure and 40% random coil. It should be pointed out that the techniques employed by certain investigators, namely the widespread usage of nonvolatile buffers, insufficient amounts of starting material, and dialysis have precluded up to now the isolation of low molecular weight plasma constituents especially since they are present in small amounts. Furthermore, while the role of these hitherto unknown plasma proteins has as yet not been established, it is believed that the discovery of this new class of plasma globulins deserves special attention in that the information gained from their study may prove to have considerable biochemical and physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2078892701,"Atomic absorption spectroscopy, electron microprobe analysis, and dithizone staining of trophozoites and cysts of Entamoeba invadens demonstrate that these cells have a high concentration of zinc (approximately 10(-6) microgram per cell or 1 percent of their dry weight). In the cysts of this organism, the zinc is confined to the chromatoid bodies, which previous work has shown to contain crystals of ribosomes. The chemical state and function of this zinc are unknown."
