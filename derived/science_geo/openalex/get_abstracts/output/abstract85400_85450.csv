https://openalex.org/W1570650398,"Human diferric transferrin binds to the surface of K562 cells, a human leukemic cell line. There are about 1.6 X 10(5) binding sites per cell surface, exhibiting a KD of about 10(-9) M. Upon warming cells to 37 degrees C there is a rapid increase in uptake to a steady state level of twice that obtained at 0 degree C. This is accounted for by internalization of the ligand as shown by the development of resistance to either acid wash or protease treatment of the ligand-cell association. After a minimum residency time of 4-5 min, undegraded transferrin is released from the cell. Internalization is rapid but is dependent upon cell surface occupancy; at occupancies of 20% or greater the rate coefficient is maximal at about 0.1-0.2 min-1. In the absence of externally added ligand only 50% of the internalized transferrin completes the cycle and is released to the medium with a rate coefficient of 0.05 min-1. The remaining transferrin can be released from the cell only by the addition of ligand, suggesting a tight coupling between cell surface binding, internalization, and release of internalized ligand. There is a loss of cell surface-binding capacity that accompanies transferrin internalization. At low (less than 50%) occupancy this loss is monotonic with the extent of internalization. Even at saturating levels of transferrin, the loss of surface receptors upon internalization never exceeds 60-70% of the initial binding capacity. This suggests that receptors enter the cell with ligand but are replaced so as to maintain a constant, albeit reduced, receptor number on the cell surface. In the absence of ligand, the cell surface receptor number returns at 37 degrees C. Neither sodium azide nor NH4Cl blocks internalization of ligand. However, they both prevent the release of transferrin from the cell thus halting the transferrin cycle. Excess ligand can overcome the block due to NH4Cl but not azide although the cycle is markedly slower. Iron is delivered to these cells by transferrin at 37 degrees C with a rate coefficient of 0.15 to 0.2 min-1. The iron is released from the transferrin and the majority is found in intracellular ferritin. There is a large internal receptor pool comprising 70 to 80% of the total cell receptors and this may be involved in maintaining the steady state iron uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1653242653,"Exposure of NG108-15 hybrid cells to islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, caused strong ADP-ribosylation of one of the membrane proteins with a molecular weight of 41,000. This ADP-ribosylation was paralleled by decreases in the inhibition of cAMP accumulation in intact cells or associated with reversal of the inhibition of GTP-dependent membrane adenylate cyclase, via alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic muscarinic, or opiate receptors. The affinity of these receptors for agonists was lowered by guanyl-5'-yl beta-gamma-imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) reflecting their coupling to the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in this cell line. This effect of Gpp(NH)p was lost in membranes of IAP-treated cells; in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, the affinity for agonist was lower in treated than in nontreated cells. In contrast, the function of these receptors to bind antagonists remained unaltered in IAP-treated cells. Thus, IAP treatment of NG108-15 cells caused specific uncoupling of negative signal transduction from inhibitory receptors to the adenylate cyclase catalytic unit via the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, as a result of ADP-ribosylation of one of the subunits of the regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1494010101,"This paper describes the visualization of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor by ligand blotting. Preparations of detergent-solubilized membranes are subjected to one- or two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, after which the proteins are transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The paper is incubated with native LDL and then with an 125I-labeled antibody against LDL, and the bound antibody is visualized by autoradiography. The success of LDL blotting depends on the omission of sulfhydryl reducing agents from the electrophoresis system. Intrachain disulfide bonds allow the receptor to retain its binding activity even after electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. In identifying LDL receptors, the ligand blotting technique is as sensitive as immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against the LDL receptor; it can therefore be used to identify receptors when no anti-receptor antibodies are available. We use this technique to show that the LDL receptor of the rabbit adrenal gland has the same molecular weight as the LDL receptor of the bovine adrenal cortex and human fibroblasts. The ligand blotting technique may be generally applicable for visualization of other plasma membrane receptors after SDS-gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1489674043,"The effects of the steroid glycoside digitonin on cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were studied as a way to gain access to the intracellular sites of calcium action in stimulus-secretion coupling. Chromaffin cells treated with digitonin secreted catecholamines by an exocytotic mechanism when exposed to free calcium concentrations of greater than 1 microM. At free calcium concentrations of less than 100 microM, an apparently saturable release of catecholamines was observed with a half-maximal effect (EC50) of 3-4 microM. Catecholamine release at these low calcium concentrations was limited to 10-15% of the cellular content, was partially dependent on the presence of MgATP, and was inhibited by magnesium (EC50 = 6 mM). At calcium concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mM, a second, apparently saturable component of catecholamine release from digitonin-treated chromaffin cells was observed (EC50 = 0.3 mM). This release at the higher calcium concentrations was unaffected by the addition of MgATP, magnesium, antipsychotic drugs known to bind and inactivate calmodulin, or calcium channel blockers, but was temperature-dependent and was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (EC50 = 140 microM). Strontium and manganese can also evoke catecholamine secretion from digitonin-treated chromaffin cells. The results suggest that digitonin will be a useful preparation in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the secretory process."
https://openalex.org/W1618030109,"Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm as larger precursor polypeptides which are imported into the organelle in an energy-dependent step. The proteolytic conversion of these precursors to their mature size involves a neutral matrix-located protease which has been purified 100-fold from yeast mitochondria. It cleaves the precursors to several imported proteins of the matrix, the mitochondrial inner membrane and the intermembrane space, but is inactive against all mature mitochondrial proteins or against all nonmitochondrial proteins tested so far. As shown in the subsequent report (Cerletti, N., Bohni, P. C., and Suda, K. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4944-4949), processing of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit V precursor with the partially purified protease yielded the correct mature NH2 terminus. Precursors to cytochrome b2 and cytochrome c1 (which are imported into the intermembrane space and the outer face of the inner membrane, respectively) are cleaved to intermediate forms which can also be detected as transient forms in vivo. The protease activity has a pH optimum of 7.5 and is inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, EDTA, or nucleoside triphosphates, but not by serine-protease inhibitors or by small peptide inhibitors. Its activity can be restored after chelation by excess Co2+ or Zn2+. The enzyme is coded in the nucleus and is, thus, imported into mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1495154814,"Experimental conditions were established under which tunicamycin inhibits glycosylation by 80-90% but reduces protein biosynthesis by only 10-20% in cultured neuroblastoma cells. Growth in the presence of tunicamycin (1 micrograms/ml) reduces the number of sodium channels, as measured by high affinity saxitoxin (STX) binding to 20-28% of control values over a 60-h period without affect on the KD for STX. Neurotoxin-activated 22Na+ influx mediated by the sodium channel was similarly reduced without affect on the KD for batrachotoxin. Comparison of STX binding by intact cells or homogenates showed that tunicamycin reduces cell surface STX receptors without accumulation of an intracellular pool of binding sites. Tunicamycin caused a similar reduction in cell surface STX receptors in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, suggesting that its action is not entirely due to acceleration of sodium channel degradation. The action of tunicamycin is at least partially reversible. After washout, STX receptors appear at an initial rate of approximately 1900/cell/h. Protein synthesis is required for the appearance of new sodium channels. After inhibition of sodium channel biosynthesis by either cycloheximide or tunicamycin, the number of high affinity STX receptor sites is reduced with a half-time of 26 h. Thus, at steady state, neuroblastoma cells which contain 50,000 +/- 15,000 STX receptors degrade and replace 1330 +/- 400 STX receptor sites/h. Our results show that glycosylation is an essential process in the maintenance of the normal steady state of biosynthesis and degradation of sodium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1623589579,"Hepatocytes from juvenile male rats (80-110 g) showed a 12-fold elevation of cAMP in response to epinephrine, which was mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. In these cells, either alpha 1- or beta 2-adrenergic stimulation alone activated phosphorylase and glucose release although the alpha 1-phosphorylase response was 10-fold more sensitive to epinephrine and resulted in more rapid (by 10-20 s) activation of the enzyme. This suggests that the beta 2-adrenergic response is functionally unimportant for glycogenolysis, even in juvenile rats. beta 2-Adrenergic stimulation did, however, produce an increase in the rate of gluconeogenesis from [U-14C] lactate in these cells. Aging in the male rat was associated with attenuation of the beta 2-adrenergic cAMP response coupled with the emergence of an alpha 1-receptor-mediated accumulation of cAMP. The order of potency displayed by the alpha 1-adrenergic/cAMP system to adrenergic agonists and antagonists was identical with that of the alpha 1-adrenergic/Ca2+ system. These data suggest that, in maturity, hepatic alpha 1-receptors become linked to 2 separate transduction mechanisms, namely Ca2+ mobilization and cAMP generation. Calcium depletion of hepatocytes from adult, but not juvenile, male rats increased the alpha 1-component of the cAMP response to epinephrine, but under these conditions, alpha 1-activation of phosphorylase occurred more slowly than in calcium-replete cells. Blockade of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors did not significantly modify catecholamine effects on hepatocyte cAMP or phosphorylase a levels in male rats at any age studied, suggesting a lack of functional significance for these receptors in the regulation of glycogenolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1548298803,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases Na+ uptake in several cell types through an electroneutral, amiloride-sensitive pathway putatively identified as Na+/H+ countertransport. The inferred cytosolic alkalinization resulting from this process has been proposed to be an important component of mitogenic stimulation. We studied the effect of EGF on the Na+/H+ exchange system of A431 cells, a cell line having a very high EGF receptor density but which is not mitogenically stimulated by EGF. We demonstrate that EGF rapidly activates net Na+ influx in A431 cells. Amiloride inhibits the EGF-dependent Na+ uptake (65% inhibition at 3 mM, ID50 approximately 0.3 mM) and inhibits much less the EGF-independent uptake. EGF is known to enhance 45Ca+ accumulation in A431 cells (Sawyer, S. T., and Cohen, S. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 6280-6286). The following findings indicate that EGF-dependent 22Na+ and 45Ca2+ uptake are two independent processes. 1) EGF effectively stimulates an amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ uptake in the absence of external Ca2+. 2) EGF-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake is not inhibited by amiloride. A new fluorescence technique is described for intracellular pH determination based on the introduction of fluorescein-labeled dextran into the cell cytoplasm. Using this method, the presence of amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange in A431 cells is documented. Although the lack of pH sensitivity of fluorescein fluorescence above pH 7.3-7.4 prevents a direct assessment of an EGF-induced increase of intracellular pH, the combined results of 22Na+ flux and intracellular pH measurements suggest that EGF activates Na+/H+ exchange in A431 cells. We conclude that enhanced Na+/H+ exchange may not necessarily be coupled to mitogenic triggering in different cell types, although the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange may constitute a primary event in the mechanism of EGF action."
https://openalex.org/W1675445134,"The direct actions of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in target cells are initiated by the binding of hormone to specific receptor sites. The aims of this study were to characterize the receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 in cultured rat osteoblast-like (OB) cells and to determine whether these receptors are regulated by either the culture cycle itself or glucocorticoid treatment. The 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor in rat OB cells exhibited the same apparent binding affinity (Kd = 0.1 nM) and sedimentation coefficient (3.2 S) as mouse OB cells and receptors in other target organs. However, the receptor concentration in rat OB cells was substantially lower than mouse OB cells (approximately 20%). The concentration of receptors in rat OB cells did not show a correlation with the rate of DNA synthesis and therefore did not exhibit an endogenous rhythm in receptor concentration as was previously seen in mouse OB cells. Also in contrast to mouse cells, where glucocorticoids caused a decrease in receptor level, dexamethasone induced a marked increase in receptor binding throughout the culture cycle. This increase was due to an increase in receptor number with no change in receptor affinity. The change was glucocorticoid-specific, dose-dependent with half-maximal stimulation occurring between 1.3 and 13 nM and exhibited a latent period of at least 4 h. The independence of receptor concentration from DNA synthesis rate was established by assessing receptors after stimulating cell proliferation with epidermal growth factor and inhibiting it with hydroxyurea. Neither treatment altered basal 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor concentration or prevented the marked increase in receptor levels elicited by dexamethasone. We conclude that although the biochemical characteristics of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors are indistinguishable in rat and mouse OB cells, there are genuine species differences in the regulation of the receptor number as it relates to DNA synthesis rate and response to glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W1508340483,"The iron chelate of 1-formylisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone is one of the most potent inhibitors known for mammalian ribonucleotide reductase. In this study, we show that the target for the drug is the tyrosine free radical of the M2 subunit of the enzyme. The radical is destroyed by the drug in a reaction which requires oxygen. After removal of the drug, the tyrosine radical and ribonucleotide reductase activity can be regenerated by incubation of the enzyme with dithiothreitol. We propose that the iron chelate of the drug binds at the active site of the enzyme, and then the ferrous form of the chelate reacts with molecular oxygen in a redox process that, via a 1-electron reduction, leads to destruction of the M2 tyrosine radical."
https://openalex.org/W1495646181,"Incubation of intact rat adipocytes with physiological concentrations of insulin stimulates binding of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) to its receptor by 3- to 10-fold. The effect is temperature- and dose-dependent, with 0.1 nM insulin giving half-maximal stimulation. Scatchard analysis of IGF-II binding to intact adipocytes indicates that this effect is due to an apparent increase in receptor affinity, from Kd = 63 nM in the absence of insulin to Kd = 5.8 nM in the presence of 10 nM insulin, with no apparent change in the number of cell surface binding sites (220,000/cell). Scatchard analysis of 125I-IGF-II binding to isolated membrane fractions demonstrated that all IGF-II receptors in plasma membranes and low density microsomes from control cells are converted during homogenization to the high affinity form (Kd = 2 to 6 nM) seen in insulin-treated intact adipocytes. No significant difference in affinity was observed between plasma membranes from control or insulin-treated adipocytes or between low density microsomes from control or insulin-treated cells. However, in apparent contrast to the results obtained in intact adipocytes, the number of binding sites is increased in the plasma membrane fraction from insulin-treated cells by an average of 60%, while the number of receptors is decreased by 40% in low density microsomes from insulin-treated cells compared to control cells. These results were confirmed by direct visualization of the Mr = 270,000 IGF-II receptor band on dodecyl sulfate gels following affinity labeling with 125I-IGF-II and the cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate. Scatchard analysis of the total cellular membranes showed no difference in the total number of binding sites between control and insulin-treated cells. These results demonstrate that insulin has two effects on the IGF-II receptor in adipocytes. 1) It rapidly increases the apparent affinity of the receptor in the intact cell without changing the apparent number of receptors on the cell surface; and 2) it induces a redistribution of the high affinity IGF-II receptor between plasma membranes and low density microsomes upon homogenization of cells and preparation of membranes. The latter effect closely parallels the insulin-induced membrane redistribution of the glucose transporter that occurs in the rat adipocyte by an unknown mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1569991216,"A ferritin receptor has been detected on isolated rat hepatocytes and has been partially purified from rat liver using affinity chromatography. Isolated hepatocytes exhibit approximately 30,000 ferritin binding sites/cell with a binding association constant (Ka) of 1 x 10(8) mol-1 liter. A binding assay has been developed which utilizes a hepatic ferritin receptor coupled to a microparticulate support to facilitate separation of bound and free ligand. This method yielded a Ka of 3 x 10(8) mol-1 liter for the purified hepatic ferritin receptor. Binding of ferritin to the insolubilized receptor was partially inhibited by human lactoferrin but unaffected by 200-fold molar excess of bovine albumin, rat transferrin, or human asialoorosomucoid."
https://openalex.org/W1553193714,"The precursor form of Neurospora crassa mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier synthesized in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system can be imported into isolated mitochondria. If the mitochondrial transmembrane potential is abolished, import does not occur but the precursor binds to the mitochondrial surface. Upon reestablishment of the membrane potential, the bound precursor is imported. This occurs without dissociation of the bound precursor from the mitochondrial surface. We conclude that the binding observed represents an interaction with receptor sites and thus is an early step in the import pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1580909913,"Metronidazole, ronidazole, secnidazole, benznidazole, and misonidazole are reduced by intact Tritrichomonas foetus cells to nitro anion radicals that can be detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. This activity appears to be related to the cellular content of reducing substrates, since nitro anion radical formation is stimulated in the presence of glucose and pyruvate. The nitro anion radicals could not be detected under aerobic conditions. Anaerobic homogenates of T. foetus also reduce metronidazole to the nitro anion radical when pyruvate, NADH, or NADPH is added as the ultimate source of reducing equivalents. Free radical formation may be the basic cause of nitroimidazole toxicity in trichomonads."
https://openalex.org/W1664897469,"In normal human monocyte macrophages 125I-labeled beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (125I-beta-VLDL), isolated from the plasma of cholesterol-fed rabbits, and 125I-human low density lipoprotein (LDL) were degraded at similar rates at protein concentrations up to 50 micrograms/ml. The high affinity degradation of 125I-labeled human LDL saturated at approximately 50 micrograms/ml; however, 125I-labeled rabbit beta-VLDL high affinity degradation saturated at 100-120 micrograms/ml. The activity of the beta-VLDL receptor was 3-fold higher than LDL receptor activity on freshly isolated normal monocyte macrophages, but with time-in-culture both receptor activities decreased and were similar after several days. The degradations of both beta-VLDL and LDL were Ca2+ sensitive, were markedly down regulated by sterols, and were up regulated by preincubation of the cells in a lipoprotein-free medium. The beta-VLDL receptor is genetically distinct from the LDL receptor as indicated by its presence on monocyte macrophages from a familial hypercholesterolemic homozygote. Human thoracic duct lymph chylomicrons as well as lipoproteins of Sf 20-5000 from fat-fed normal subjects inhibited the degradation of 125I-labeled rabbit beta-VLDL as effectively as nonradioactive rabbit beta-VLDL. We conclude: 1) the beta-VLDL receptor is genetically distinct from the LDL receptor, and 2) intestinally derived human lipoproteins are recognized by the beta-VLDL receptor on macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1552550319,"The function of intracellular asialoglycoprotein receptors during the endocytosis of asialo-orosomucoid in isolated hepatocytes was assessed by following changes in the occupancy of intracellular receptors. Unoccupied total cellular (inside and surface) or surface receptors were quantified at 0 degrees C by the binding of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid in the presence or absence, respectively, of digitonin. Freshly isolated cells had about 17% of their total receptors on the surface. After incubation at 37 degrees C, the receptor distribution changed to 25 to 50% on the cell surface and 50 to 75% inside the cell. At 37 degrees C, the average total number of receptors/cell was 4.5 x 10(5). Dissociation constants, determined from equilibrium binding studies in the presence or absence of digitonin to assess total or surface receptors, were identical (5.4 +/- 1.4 and 5.6 +/- 1.1 x 10(-9) M, respectively). In the presence of asialo-orosomucoid at 37 degrees C, there was both a time- and a concentration-dependent decrease in surface and intracellular receptor activity. This receptor activity decrease was reversed by removing asialo-orosomucoid from the medium or by washing the digitonin-permeabilized cells with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid prior to quantification of receptor activity. Within 1 to 2 h in the presence of excess asialo-orosomucoid, a steady state was attained in which approximately 70% of the intracellular receptors were occupied. The kinetics of receptor activity recovery on the cell surface after internalization of a pulse of ligand is different than the rate of recovery of internal receptor activity. The results suggest that all of the internal asialoglycoprotein receptors are functional and participate during endocytosis. Internal receptors may be functionally equivalent to those on the surface or they may serve a reservoir or routing function for internalized ligand."

The structural gene consists of 1293 base pairs, which specify a protein of 431 amino acids.

The translation start of the structural gene of glycogen synthase, glg A, starts immediately after termination of the glg C gene."
https://openalex.org/W1519784931,"The Ca2+ content of hepatocytes from juvenile male rats (80-110 g) or adult female rats (135-155 g) displayed a biphasic dose-response curve to epinephrine. Low concentrations (less than or equal to 10(-7) M) caused efflux of Ca2+ from the cells, while higher concentrations (10(-6) M and 10(-5) M) induced net Ca2+ uptake which correlated with a large beta 2-adrenergic-mediated increase in cAMP (Morgan, N. G., Blackmore, P. F., and Exton, J. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5103-5109). Calcium accumulation could be induced in cells from older male rats (180-230 g) by combining a Ca2+-mobilizing hormone with either exogenous cAMP or glucagon (10(-8) M). Readdition of Ca2+ in the presence of glucagon to cells treated with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid also resulted in enhanced Ca2+ accumulation compared with controls. Addition of vasopressin plus glucagon to the medium perfusing male rat livers also led to cell Ca2+ accumulation, as evidenced by uptake of Ca2+ from the perfusate. Incubation of hepatocytes with antimycin A, oligomycin, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone prevented net Ca2+ accumulation suggesting that mitochondria play a role in the uptake response. This was confirmed by isolation of mitochondria from cells incubated under conditions which promote Ca2+ accumulation. Within 5 min of incubation, the Ca2+ content of these mitochondria was increased 2-fold relative to controls, an effect which was inhibited by oligomycin. These studies demonstrate that a rise in hepatic cAMP can reverse hormonally induced Ca2+ mobilization and point to a major role for the mitochondria in this effect."
https://openalex.org/W1522075655,"We have investigated the effect of temperature on the content of surface asialoglycoprotein receptors on isolated rat hepatocytes. Receptor was determined by measuring the specific binding of 125I- or [3H] asialo-orosomucoid at 0 degrees C. As reported previously, the receptor number/cell increases 2-3-fold within 30-60 min when freshly isolated cells are warmed from 0-37 degrees C (Weigel, P. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6111-6120). This increase in receptor number is not inhibited by cycloheximide and also occurs on cells which have first been treated with EDTA to expose a population of cryptic receptors on the cell surface. The rate and extent of the receptor number increase on the cell surface are proportional to the temperature above about 17 degrees C. If cells are first equilibrated at 37 degrees C and then transferred to a lower temperature, the surface receptor number decreases at a rate and to an extent dependent on the temperature. The surface receptor number can be modulated up and down by successive temperature change cycles between 25 and 37 degrees C. In this temperature range, the number of surface receptors/cell is dependent on the final temperature but independent of the pathway to that temperature and is, therefore, a function of state with respect to temperature. The results demonstrate that temperature changes reversibly modulate the number of receptors on the hepatocyte surface. We conclude that, in the absence of ligand, surface receptors can either recycle or can be reversibly internalized or sequestered to prevent access to ligand. The results may also explain why different laboratories have reported a wide range of values for the number of receptors per hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1601544702,"Diadenosine tetraphosphatase, an enzyme splitting diadenosine tetraphosphate to AMP and ATP, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from a permanent cell line derived from a leukemic child. The purification procedure consisted of fractionation by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by Sephacryl 200 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and finally a differential membrane filtration. The enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of Mr = 17,500 as determined by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme was calculated as 20,000 from gel filtration data. The apparent Km for Ap4A was 0.5 microM as determined by two independent kinetic assays. None of the following compounds were substrates of the enzyme: diadenosine triphosphate, NAD, nucleoside 5'-phosphates (AMP, ATP, GDP, GTP, and UTP). The enzyme had optimal activity in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, showing no activity in the presence of EDTA."
https://openalex.org/W1494248838,"We have examined the expression of two embryonic myosin HC mRNAs using two cDNA clones (110 and 251) which we have previously constructed from RNA isolated from 14-day-old embryonic chick skeletal muscle. Sequence divergence in the 3' nontranslated regions enabled us to analyze the differential expression of the mRNAs corresponding to the two clones using the S1 nuclease mapping procedure. Clone 251 mRNA is expressed primarily in embryonic fast muscle, where its transcripts appear to be the predominant species. This mRNA is minimally expressed in the posthatching period, but it is not detected in adult leg and breast muscle. Messenger RNA for clone 110 is also primarily expressed in embryonic fast muscle. However, in the posthatching and adult stages of development, it continues to be expressed at a low level in leg muscle but not in breast muscle. The differential expression of these mRNAs during development strongly indicates that they correspond to two different genes coding for embryonic myosin HCs. Other myosin HC mRNAs which were partially homologous to the clone 110 or 251 mRNAs were also identified by S1 nuclease mapping. Using the probes from these two clones, a minimum of four other developmentally expressed forms were detected. Two of these correspond to neonatal myosin HCs, while the other two code for different adult myosin HCs present in leg and in breast muscle, respectively. The results therefore suggest a much greater diversity of myosin HC mRNAs expressed during development than previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1490054060,"A procedure has been developed for obtaining yeast cytochrome c peroxidase with the heme iron in the Fe(IV) state, without the concomitant formation of the protein free radical that occurs in the ES compound resulting from the oxidation of ferric peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide. In this procedure, ferrous peroxidase, prepared either by photochemical reduction or by trapping the dithionite-reduced enzyme with carbon monoxide, is oxidized with a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide. The resulting Fe(IV) enzyme oxidizes ferrocyanide monophasically, with a rate constant of 4 x 10(3) M-1 S-1. The optical spectrum of the free radical was obtained as the difference between the spectra of the ES and Fe(IV) compounds. EPR spectra of ES compound prepared with [16O]-and [17O]hydrogen peroxide are identical, demonstrating that no fragment of the oxidant is associated with the free radical. The heme in the Fe(IV) enzyme is stable and does not oxidize the free radical site either intra- or intermolecularly. On the other hand, previous results from the presteady state kinetics of reduction and reductive titrations of the ES compound with ferrocyanide imply that the heme and free radical sites exchange oxidizing equivalents, in particular that the radical site once reduced can be reoxidized, either intra- or intermolecularly, by the ferryl heme. To resolve these contradictions, we propose a catalytic mechanism for cytochrome c peroxidase in which the radical site can exist in two conformations having very different reduction potentials and in which a significant flow of oxidizing equivalents between heme and free radical sites occurs only (i) during the hydrogen peroxide oxidation of the resting Fe(III) enzyme to form compound ES and (ii) within the initial transient intermediate formed upon the one-electron reduction of this oxidized product."
https://openalex.org/W1499845281,"The aspartate transcarbamylase activity of mammalian cells is carried by a large multifunctional protein, CAD, that catalyzes the first three steps in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Controlled proteolysis of CAD cleaved the polypeptide chain into several separate structural domains which carried the individual activities of the complex. The aspartate transcarbamylase activity was associated with a 40,000-dalton proteolytic fragment, which kinetic studies showed was released in one of the first proteolytic cleavages. The species was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sephadex. The isolated species, designated the aspartate transcarbamylase domain, had a molecular weight under denaturing conditions of 40,000 +/- 1,500, a pI = 9.4, and a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 6.2. The sedimentation coefficient suggested that the isolated domain was an oligomer consisting of two or three identical copies of the 40,000-dalton proteolytic fragment. The aspartate saturation curve obtained at a saturating concentration of carbamyl phosphate gave Km = 2.1 X 10(-2)M and Vmax = 119.5 mumol/min/mg, corresponding to a turnover number of 4,780 min-1. Like the aspartate transcarbamylase activity of CAD, the activity was strongly inhibited by high concentrations of aspartate. The corresponding parameters from the carbamyl phosphate saturation curve were Km = 2.07 X 10(-5)M, Vmax = 52.5 mumol/min/mg, and a turnover number of 2,153 min-1. The similarity of these parameters to those obtained from a steady state kinetic study of CAD indicated that the tertiary structure of this region of the polypeptide chain was largely preserved in the isolated species. In the absence of stabilizing agents, the half-life of aspartate transcarbamylase activity of CAD was 60.2 h, while that of the isolated domain was 10.6 h. This result suggested that there were interactions with other regions of the molecule which stabilized the structure of the aspartate transcarbamylase domain in the intact complex."
https://openalex.org/W1541371426,"A new rhombic EPR signal was recently discovered in the partially reduced type 2 copper-depleted Rhus vernicifera laccase (Reinhammar, B. (1983) J. Inorg. Biochem., in press). The signal originates from one of the type 3 Cu(II) ions that becomes EPR-detectable as a result of the selective reduction of the other copper ion in the exchange-coupled Cu(II)-Cu(II) pair. The 14N and 1H and 63,65Cu electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) of this uncoupled Cu(II) now have been collected and represent the first ENDOR measurements of a type 3 copper site. The data indicate that the copper is coordinated by at least three nitrogenous ligands, at least one of which is an imidazole. H/D exchange suggests a nearby H2O or OH-, perhaps as a fourth ligand. A similar EPR signal is seen for CuB of reduced cytochrome c oxidase under turnover conditions. The 14N ENDOR, and, therefore, the structure, of this site corresponds extremely closely to that of the laccase type 3 (Cu(II)."
https://openalex.org/W1620006026,"A Mr = 38,000 phosphoprotein phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16) was purified to near homogeneity from bovine cardiac muscle. The enzyme, classified as a type 2 phosphatase, was not inhibited by the heat-stable protein, inhibitor-2. Activity on peptide substrates was stimulated considerably by Mn2+ ions. The individual and combined effects of divalent cations, ATP, and fluoride were studied in detail employing the phosphonanopeptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala-Gln-Leu as the substrate. ATP and fluoride inhibited enzyme activity completely in the absence of divalent cations. Mg2+ either reduced or completely prevented this inhibition depending upon whether Mn2+ was present. Quantitative analysis of the results revealed that ATP and fluoride do not inhibit by chelation of an essential metal (e.g. Mn2+). Rather, a plausible model for the combined effects of Mg2+, Mn2+, ATP, and fluoride on phosphatase activity must assume that each of these factors acts by binding to individual sites on the enzyme and not to each other."
https://openalex.org/W1553332075,"The binding of arsenite to the molybdenum center of milk xanthine oxidase is re-examined. The Kd for the arsenite complex has been determined to be 24 microM from equilibrium binding studies and this value has been confirmed by determination of the association and dissociation rate constants for the interaction of arsenite with xanthine oxidase. Formation of the complex is not prevented by prior reaction of the enzyme with thiol reagents such as 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or methyl methanethiosulfonate. Binding of arsenite to the enzyme perturbs both the oxidation-reduction potentials and the electron paramagnetic resonance signal of the molybdenum center observed after partial reduction of the enzyme with sodium dithionite. The EPR signal of the partially reduced arsenite-complexed enzyme is further modified in two different ways by the addition of xanthine or salicylate. Other purine and pteridine substrates and products for the enzyme yield EPR signals indistinguishable from that generated by xanthine, whereas aromatic aldehydes and carboxylic acids give signals similar to that observed in the presence of salicylate. It is thus clear that while arsenite prevents enzyme turnover, it does not preclude binding of substrate and product molecules. Binding of arsenite at the molybdenum center of xanthine oxidase does not disturb the oxidation-reduction potentials of the iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme, but evidence is presented to suggest that the midpoint potential of the FAD site is decreased by approximately 15 mV. A structure for the arsenite complex is proposed to provide a framework in which to interpret the EPR signals in a quantitative fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1598925718,"Di(adenosine-5')oligophosphate nucleotides of general structure ApnA (n = 2-6) inhibited phosphorylation of immunoglobulin G from tumor-bearing rabbits (TBR IgG) by pp60src protein kinase purified from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat tumor cells. Ap4A, a nucleotide associated with eukaryotic cell proliferation, was one of the most effective inhibitors in the series, causing 50% inhibition of TBR IgG phosphorylation at 15 microM. Ap4A inhibited pp60src-dependent phosphorylation of TBR IgG in solution and immunoprecipitates, as well as the phosphorylation of tubulin, microtubule-associated proteins, and vinculin. Under similar assay conditions, Ap4A did not inhibit phosphorylation of histone H2b by cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Ap4A appears to interact noncovalently with the enzyme, because removal of pp60src by immunoprecipitation from solutions containing Ap4A restored activity to uninhibited levels. A 100-fold increase in ATP (4-400 nM) caused a 13-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration of Ap4A (2.5-33 microM), consistent with the interpretation that Ap4A competes for an ATP-binding site on the pp60src molecule. The simplest explanation of these results is that Ap4A binds to the phosphodonor site for ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1604293050,"Abstract Studies of the interaction of rat asialotransferrin with rat hepatocytes at 4 degrees C showed that the protein binds to two types of receptor on these cells--to 31,000 transferrin receptors with a Ka of 1.9 x 10(7) liters . mol-1 and to 110,000 asialoglycoprotein receptors with a Ka of 1.4 x 10(6) liters . mol-1. The uptake of the protein by the cells at 37 degrees C is mediated by both receptors simultaneously. Binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor was abolished by the addition of excess asialoorosomucoid and, under these conditions asialotransferrin, taken into the cells via the transferrin receptor, was subsequently released from the cells undegraded, an event also observed when the uptake of holotransferrin was examined in similar studies. Addition of excess unlabeled transferrin prevented uptake of asialotransferrin via the transferrin receptor and internalization was then mediated solely by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Ligand subsequently released from the cells after endocytosis via this receptor was found to be degraded, with 80% soluble in trichloroacetic acid, a proportion similar to that observed during release of asialoorosomucoid from the cells. These results indicate that rat asialotransferrin is processed by the asialoglycoprotein uptake pathway in the same way as observed with other ligands. Release from the cells of undegraded asialotransferrin occurred only after endocytosis via the transferrin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1550953696,"The beta origin of replication of plasmid R6K, one of three active R6K origins of replication, requires most or all of a 1962-base pair (bp) sequence for activity. The nucleotide sequence of a portion of this functional beta origin was determined in an earlier study (Stalker, D., Kolter, R., and Helinski, D. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 161, 33-43). In this work, the sequence of the remaining portion of this 1964-bp segment was obtained. In addition to its activity as an origin of replication, this sequence also contains sufficient information for autonomous replication in Escherichia coli. A 277-bp region containing seven 22-bp direct repeats is present at one end of the beta origin segment (Stalker, D., Kolter, R., and Helinski, D. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 1150-1154) while the other end contains a 140-bp sequence that includes a relaxation complex site. The 277-bp direct repeat region is required for activity of the beta origin. The start of the beta origin of replication as mapped by electron microscopy (Crosa, J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11075-11077) lies approximately 1000 bp away from the 277-bp region. The pi structural gene, which makes up most of the sequence between the direct repeats and the beta origin, is required in cis for beta origin activity. The pi protein also is required for beta origin activity but can be provided in trans. The nucleotide sequence just beyond the pi structural gene and within or near the start of beta origin of replication contains an open reading frame for a 151-amino acid protein. Deletions ranging from 94 bp to 1590 bp were obtained within the 1964-bp beta origin region. In every case, the deletion results in loss of origin activity even when the deleted sequence plus adjacent regions are provided in trans. These observations suggest a requirement for a specific secondary structure over an extensive region for beta origin activity."
https://openalex.org/W1559210673,"In isolated hepatic membranes, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) selectively stimulated the phosphorylation of the 170,000-dalton EGF receptor (p170) by 13.6 +/- 2.0- and 10.9 +/- 1.1-fold, respectively. The stimulation by maximally effective concentrations of the two substances was similar in rapidity of onset (less than 30 s at 0 degree C), time course of phosphorylation, and tyrosine residue specificity. These maximal effects were not additive when the substances were combined, indicating that the same kinase/substrate combination is activated by each. The lectin concanavalin A, which inhibits EGF receptor binding, blocked the effect of EGF but not Me2SO. In membranes solubilized with Triton X-100, EGF stimulated p170 phosphorylation by 40- to 55-fold. Me2SO also stimulated phosphorylation, indicating that it acts directly on the protein. However, the effect of the solvent was reduced by half. Additionally, Me2SO blocks the effect of EGF in the solubilized preparation. A room temperature preincubation after addition of either substance was necessary for maximal stimulation of p170 phosphorylation in solubilized membranes. With EGF, 30-40 min was necessary; with Me2SO, only 10 min was required. Thus, a secondary process appears to be involved in EGF receptor/kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1566550662,"The sensory transducers of Escherichia coli are integral membrane proteins that mediate the tactic response of cells to chemical stimuli. Adaptation to environmental stimuli is correlated with methylation of the transducer proteins. Two transducer genes, tsr and tar, exhibit extensive homologies while no homology has been detected between a third transducer, trg, and those genes. The Tsr and Tar proteins have been shown to contain multiple sites for methylation as well as two sites for another modification that requires an active cheB gene product and is designated the CheB-dependent modification. In this study, covalent modifications of the Trg protein were characterized by analysis of tryptic peptides. We found that methylation occurred at several sites on the Trg protein and that the protein contained at least three sites for CheB-dependent modification, two of which were located on a tryptic peptide that contains both methionine and lysine. This tryptic peptide is analogous to the methionine- and lysine-containing methyl-accepting peptides isolated from the Tsr and Tar proteins and like those peptides may contain several methyl-accepting sites. We estimated the pKa of the group created by the CheB-dependent modification on the methionine- and lysine-containing peptide of Trg to be between pH 2.2 and 5.8. This result supports the idea that the CheB-dependent modification is an enzymatic deamidation of glutamine to glutamic acid."
https://openalex.org/W169971741,"Gyrase bound to duplex DNA in the absence of ATP is seen by electron microscopy as a nearly spherical particle frequently located at the intersection of two duplex DNA strands. Such looped structures with gyrase situated at the base of the loops are observed with both linear and circular DNA substrates, and two or three individual DNA molecules bound to the same protein are also seen at high DNA concentrations. Addition of the nonhydrolyzable beta,gamma-imido analog of ATP to the gyrase . DNA reaction mixture prior to sample fixation for microscopy reduces the frequency of gyrase molecules found at DNA intersections. Looped structures similar to those of the gyrase . DNA complex are also seen with the complex of DNA and the A subunit of gyrase. When negatively supercoiled DNA which has been partially relaxed by gyrase in the absence of ATP is fixed for electron microscopic examination, intermediate forms are observed that contain both supercoiled and relaxed loops in a single DNA molecule, with the enzyme located at the common base of the loops. These results suggest that gyrase possesses multiple DNA-binding sites, a feature which allows the enzyme to hold DNA in constrained loops. The relation of these observations to the mechanism of gyrase action is discussed."

The secondary structure of the Bacillus protein is considerably more resistant to the effects of increasing temperature and urea concentration than the homologous protein (NS1 and NS2) from Escherichia coli. Proton magnetic resonance experiments show that the protein has a well folded, compact tertiary structure. The DNA binding protein has been crystallized from several precipitants as monoclinic needles and triclinic plates. The monoclinic form diffracts to at least 3.5 A and oscillation data from the native crystals have been collected. The protein is able to bind to both single- and double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Upon binding, several changes occur in the protein NMR spectrum which may be used for further analysis of the mechanism of interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1555451635,"Abstract The cytoplasmically made subunit V was isolated from enzymically active yeast cytochrome c oxidase and its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be (formula; see text) In order to exclude that this NH2 terminus had been generated by proteolysis during the lengthy isolation of the subunit, subunit V was directly immunoprecipitated from yeast cells that had been pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine; radiochemical sequencing revealed methionine at position 12, in agreement with the sequence given above. When the precursor to subunit V was synthesized in vitro in the presence of either [35S]methionine, [3H]leucine, or [3H]histidine and then incubated either with isolated yeast mitochondria or the partially purified matrix protease (Bohni, P. C., Daum, G., and Schatz, G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4937-4943), it was converted to a polypeptide co-migrating with mature subunit V on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Radiochemical sequence analysis of the processed in vitro product showed that it contained histidine, leucine, and methionine in positions 4, 6, and 12, respectively, exactly as the authentic mature protein. In contrast, the unprocessed precursor contained methionine only at position 9, but not at position 12; thus, the precursor has a NH2 terminus different from the mature polypeptide. Similarly, if the in vitro synthesized cytochrome b2 precursor is incubated with isolated mitochondria, it is converted to a polypeptide which co-migrates with mature cytochrome b2 and, like the latter, contains leucine and methionine in positions 4 and 6, respectively. These data show that isolated yeast mitochondria convert the precursors to polypeptides which have the NH2 terminus of the authentic mature polypeptides. In the case of cytochrome c oxidase subunit V, correct NH2-terminal processing was also demonstrated with the purified matrix protease."
https://openalex.org/W1595683668,"We had found that yeasts had intracellular endodeoxyribonucleases that cut phage DNA into a set of double-stranded fragments with discrete chain lengths. We purified one of them to apparent homogeneity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and designated it Endo.Sce I. Sequence analysis around 5 cleavage sites in plasmid DNA and phage DNA revealed that Endo.Sce I cuts a defined phosphodiester bond in each strand of double helix at the cleavage sites and produces free cohesive ends consisting of 4 nucleotides protruding at 3'-termini. However, unlike in the case of prokaryotic type II-restriction endonucleases, (i) Endo.Sce I seems to consist of two nonidentical subunits, (ii) no common palindrome or consensus sequence including more than 5 base pairs is detected at or near these cleavage sites, and (iii) Endo.Sce I can cut the DNA isolated from the cells that produced Endo.Sce I. All of the 5 cleavage sites are included in inverted repeats, but these inverted repeats are variable in size, nucleotide sequence, and distance between repeating units. An inverted repeat itself is not a structure recognized by Endo.Sce I. This study shows that Endo.Sce I is the first example of eukaryotic site-specific endonuclease and has properties, as described above, which distinguish it from prokaryotic restriction endonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2117644194,"Escherichia coli strains have been isolated with a transposon 10 insertion or an amber mutation inactivating the galP gene, which specifies the galactose-H+ (GalP) transport system. Comparison of the membrane proteins between these strains and their GalP+ parents by dual isotope analysis showed that a component of Mr = 34-39,000 was consistently absent from the GalP- mutants. Galactose, methyl-beta-D-galactoside, and talose protected the GalP transport system from inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. A membrane protein of Mr = 34-38,000 was modified by N-([2-3H]ethyl)maleimide at the binding site of these sugars. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the membrane proteins has resolved a component of Mr = 35-38,000 (average apparent pI = 5.7) present in parent strains (GalP+) but not in the GalP- mutants. These observations identified a protein of apparent Mr = 37,000 as the product of the galP gene of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1483080836,"[3H]Dihydroalprenolol was used to study beta-adrenergic binding sites in plasma membranes isolated from rabbit liver. Specific binding was measured at 25 degrees C as the difference between total binding and binding in the presence of 2 microM dl-propranolol or 10 microM l-isoproterenol. Binding was saturable and stereoselective. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) was 434 +/- 41 fmol/mg of protein. The Kd for this binding as determined by Scatchard analysis was 1.39 +/- 0.09 nM. This value agreed well with the Kd value (1.27 +/- 0.12 nM) determined by kinetic analysis. The potency order for the displacement of bound [3H]dihydroalprenolol was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine, indicative of beta 2-receptors. Use of beta 1- and beta 2-subtype-selective inhibitors also supported the interpretation that the binding characteristics are those of beta 2-receptors. Computer-aided analysis of this inhibition indicated that the beta-receptors in this membrane are predominantly, if not exclusively, of the beta 2-subtype. That these receptors are responsible for mediating catecholamine stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis was deduced from the inhibition of agonist-stimulated glycogenolysis, in isolated hepatocytes, by beta-receptor subtype-selective antagonists. Thus, the hydrochloride of (t-butylamino-3-ol-2-propyl)oximino-9 fluorene, a beta-antagonist which has higher affinity at beta 2-sites than at beta 1-sites, was 3 orders of magnitude more potent in inhibiting isoproterenol-stimulated glycogenolysis than either atenolol or practolol, both of which are beta 1-selective antagonists. These results resemble the inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in plasma membranes. The glycogenolytic effects of catecholamines occurred with the potency order isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. Thus, both by radioligand binding studies and by metabolic studies, the functional adrenergic receptor in the rabbit liver is shown to be of the beta 2-subtype."
https://openalex.org/W1601968364,"Rat parotid gland secretion cannot be activated through beta-adrenergic stimulation of adenylate cyclase until after 2 weeks postnatal. We have studied the relationship of the levels of putative guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory components (G/F) of the cyclase system to the onset of hormone responsiveness. The effect of sympathetic denervation on the components of this system during development of secretory function also has been examined. Nucleotide-dependent, hormone-stimulated, and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities in parotid membranes are present at low levels at birth and increase 2-fold between 14 and 18 days postnatal while beta-adrenergic receptor levels remain constant. G/F proteins, regulatory for adenylate cyclase activation, were quantitated by ADP-ribosylation in the presence of cholera toxin. Labeling of two cholera toxin-specific substrates occurs at low levels in neonatal rats and increases sharply at the critical 14-18-day period. This provides a plausible explanation for the increase in adenylate cyclase sensitivity at this time, although increases in cyclase catalytic units and/or coupling efficiency of receptor and cyclase may also be involved. In previous studies we found that animals chemically sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine at birth developed elevated levels of membrane-bound beta-adrenergic receptors. The functional consequence is that treated animals show a shift (1.7-fold) toward increased sensitivity in the dose-response curve for adenylate cyclase activation by isoproterenol. However, the levels of maximal hormone- and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities do not change, suggesting that some component distal to the receptor is limiting under both control and treated conditions, or that there are deficiencies in coupling of the receptor pool."
https://openalex.org/W1534709317,"The phosphorylation of cardiac membrane proteins has been studied in preparations of newborn chick hearts. Membranes were isolated from 32P-loaded tissue after treatment with or without the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol and/or the muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist oxotremorine. The phosphorylation of a low molecular weight membrane protein was enhanced by isoproterenol as early as 10 s after adding the drug. This phosphoprotein had a molecular weight of approximately 26,000 or 14,000 depending on the conditions used to solubilize the membranes prior to electrophoresis. It is most probably phospholamban/calciductin. The apparent molecular weight of the protein observed at 26,000 increased by approximately 1,000 as phosphorylation increased. The phosphorylation of this protein was abolished by short term treatment of the isoproterenol-treated tissue with the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine. Effects of oxotremorine were observed within 30 s and were maximal between 2-5 min. The oxotremorine-induced decrease in phosphorylation was accompanied by a decrease in molecular weight. This phosphoprotein was found in a membrane fraction enriched in cardiac sarcolemma as well as in another containing sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The phosphorylation of this membrane component may play a role in the effects of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic agonists on cardiac contractile force."

https://openalex.org/W1584264335,"The effect of endogenous ligand on transferrin binding to receptor was investigated using a Triton X-100 extract of acetone powder from human placentae as the source of transferrin receptor. This extract contained 2.0 +/- 0.4 micrograms of endogenous transferrin per mg of protein. The studies showed that it is necessary to account for the concentration of endogenous transferrin when calculating the specific binding and the association constant (Ka) of transferrin to the receptor. The attempts to remove endogenous transferrin from the extract by washing with agents such as 2.0 M KSCN and glycine/NaOH, pH 10.0, with 1 M NaCl or by immunoabsorption with anti-transferrin were unsuccessful in that substantial amounts (10%) of endogenous ligand remained. Under the assumption that endogenous and exogenous transferrin have similar affinity of binding to the receptor, the effect of endogenous ligand on specific binding could be accurately determined by measuring the amounts of transferrin in the placental extract by radioimmunoassay and then accounting for it in the total transferrin concentration in the experiments. The Ka value corrected for endogenous transferrin present, 2.39 +/- 0.35 X 10(9) M-1 (n = 6), was approximately 3 times higher than the value obtained without consideration of endogenous transferrin, 0.87 +/- 0.20 X 10(9) M-1 (n = 5). From these studies, it appears that a true Ka value for ligand-receptor binding cannot readily be determined experimentally in the presence of substantial amounts of endogenous ligand but that the endogenous ligand must be quantitatively measured and the amounts present corrected for in the calculation of the Ka value."
https://openalex.org/W1597114778,"ATP-citrate lyase from rat liver and adipose tissue is phosphorylated by either ATP-citrate lyase kinase or catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to 0.5-0.6 mol/subunit. We previously demonstrated that the site phosphorylated by ATP-citrate lyase kinase (peptide B) is different from that phosphorylated by catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (peptide A) (Ramakrishna, S., Pucci, D. L., and Benjamin, W.B. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10213-10216). ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation by both protein kinases added simultaneously was increased synergistically. When ATP-citrate lyase was first phosphorylated by catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, the net phosphorylation of the fragments subsequently phosphorylated by lyase kinase increased about 6-fold. However, when ATP-citrate lyase was first phosphorylated by lyase kinase, there was no effect on the subsequent phosphorylation of the enzyme by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Alkaline phosphatase-dephosphorylated ATP-citrate lyase was phosphorylated by catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to 0.9-1.0 mol/subunit. However, dephospho-ATP-citrate lyase was not phosphorylated by lyase kinase. The addition of both protein kinases simultaneously phosphorylated ATP-citrate lyase up to 2 mol/subunit. Phosphorylation of dephospho-ATP-citrate lyase first by catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and ATP enabled the lyase to be phosphorylated by lyase kinase. Peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis of dephospho-ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylated by catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and/or lyase kinase conclusively showed that phosphorylation of ATP-citrate lyase by ATP-citrate lyase kinase was completely dependent on peptide A phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation when both protein kinases were added simultaneously was due to increased phosphorylation at peptide B."
https://openalex.org/W2116095919,"Neurospora mtDNA contains a repetitive, 18 nucleotide palindromic sequence (5'-CCCTGCAGTACTGCAGGG-3') that contains two closely spaced PstI sites (CTGCAG) in the arms of the palindrome (Yin, S., Heckman, J., and RajBhandary, U. L. (1981) Cell 26, 325-332). In the present study, DNA sequence analysis was carried out to determine whether PstI palindromes are present in an apparently distinct genetic element, the 3.6-kilobase mitochondrial plasmid from Neurospora crassa strain Mauriceville-1c (FGSC 2225). The plasmid contains a cluster of closely spaced PstI sites extending over a 0.4-kilobase region (Collins, R. A., Stohl, L. L., Cole, M. D., and Lambowitz, A. M. (1981) Cell 24, 443-452). The DNA sequence shows that the cluster consists of eight PstI sites organized in five palindromic elements. Two of the elements are identical with the canonical sequence found in mtDNA, whereas the remaining three elements differ from the canonical sequence by a few nucleotides. The occurrence of the PstI palindromes in two otherwise unrelated DNA species is consistent with the hypothesis that they are related to mobile DNA sequences that either propagate or were once capable of propagating within mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1540310867,"The activation of a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase by an endogenous protease is described. The H4 phosphotransferase (Masaracchia, R. A., Kemp, B., and Walsh, D. A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7109-7117) from lymphosarcoma cells was isolated in a nonactive form. Activation required ATP and Mg2+ and was shown to be time-dependent. Although Mn2+ was capable of substituting for Mg2+ in the protein kinase reaction, no activation was observed when Mn2+ replaced Mg2+. The protein substrate histone H4 inhibited phosphotransferase activation at concentrations greater than 60 microM. The inhibition was complete in the presence of 100 microM H4. Comparable concentrations of bovine serum albumin did not inhibit the activation. The selective dependence on Mg2+ suggested separate activating and phosphotransferase activities. This was confirmed by heat denaturation in which the activation reaction was shown to be more sensitive to heat inactivation than was the phosphotransferase reaction. The activating enzyme was separated from the protein kinase by column chromatofocusing in the pH range 7-4. The pI of the activating enzyme was greater than 7.0. The pI values of the activated and nonactivated phosphotransferase were 4.8 and 5.3, respectively. The apparent molecular weight of the nonactivated phosphotransferase was 68,000; the activated enzyme was eluted from an S-200 Sephadex column with an apparent Mr = 52,000.

https://openalex.org/W1581480840,"Human blood monocytes incorporated the methyl group from methionine into their neutral lipids. The major methylated product was identified as ubiquinone-50 in monocytes, lymphocytes, and a variety of human tumor cell lines by several analytical procedures including TLC or high performance liquid chromatography and as ubiquinone-45 in a mouse tumor cell line. Up to three methyl groups were shown to be derived from methionine by mass spectrometry. The rate of synthesis of ubiquinone-50 by monocytes as assessed by measuring labeled methyl group incorporation was shown to be linear over a 3-h period. Degradation of ubiquinone proceeded slowly; 80% of the labeled compound persisted after 18 h. The dependence of ubiquinone-50 synthesis upon methionine concentration was established in monocytes, with an estimated apparent Km for methionine of about 20 microM. The tumor promoter, tetradecanoate phorbol acetate, a potent stimulator of superoxide anion (O2-) production in phagocytic cells, inhibited ubiquinone-50 synthesis at nanomolar concentrations in monocytes, but not in lymphocytes, under conditions where oxidation of methionine takes place. Degradation of the labeled ubiquinone was unaffected. Formylmethionylleucyl-phenylalanine, a chemoattractant peptide which stimulates O2- production in phagocytic cells, also inhibited ubiquinone-50 synthesis. The degree of inhibition by either stimulus was increased when the methionine concentration in the medium was low. These findings demonstrate that in human monocytes ubiquinone-50 biosynthesis is regulable and that methionine concentration modulates both its rate of synthesis and the inhibitory effects of two stimuli of O2- production."

The efficiency of the experimental approach is enhanced by the use of RNase-deficient yeast strains. Thus, this system can be used to study structural aspects affecting transcription at these loci."
https://openalex.org/W1511063222,"Binding sites for alpha-thrombin on cultured Chinese hamster lung cells were identified using photoactivatable cross-linking conjugates of diisopropylphosphorofluoridate-inactivated alpha-thrombin. A series of photoaffinity reagents was synthesized that permitted systematic variation of the extent of thrombin modification and of steric factors affecting the ability of the photoaffinity reagent to contact thrombin receptors. The reagents were synthesized with a tritium label to accurately determine the number of photoaffinity molecules linked to each thrombin. Also, they were synthesized with different length spacer arms between the photoreactive cross-linking group (a nitroarylazide) and the end which linked to alpha-thrombin (a succinimide ester). By calculating the percentage of the thrombin surface that would be accessed by modifying it with a fixed molar excess of each reagent, it was possible to select the photoaffinity reagents that would be most effective for cross-linking 125I-labeled diisopropylphosphorofluoridate-inactivated alpha-thrombin to its cellular binding sites. The validity of this selection procedure was confirmed in experiments in which an Mr = 150,000 cellular component was labeled. This component had the properties of a specific binding site for thrombin since labeling was readily competed for by nonlabeled alpha-thrombin. The cross-linking achieved was due to the photoactivatable reagent since no detectable cross-linked complex was formed in the absence of photoactivation or with 125I-labeled diisopropylphosphorofluoridate-inactivated alpha-thrombin that was not conjugated with the photoaffinity reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1539793494,"The fluorescent maleimide derivatives, 2-(4'-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene 6-sulfonic acid (Mal-ANS) and N-(1-pyrene)-maleimide (Mal-pyrene), both alkylate sulfhydryl groups on the alpha subunit of the (Na,K)-ATPase to inhibit (Na,K)-ATPase and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activities and phosphoenzyme formation. Reaction of the enzyme with Mal-pyrene, but not with Mal-ANS, also inhibits MgPi- and Mg.ATP.Na-supported [3H]ouabain-binding to the enzyme. Mal-pyrene and Mal-ANS react, in part, with different sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme protein. On the average, the sulfhydryl groups which react with Mal-pyrene are located in a more shielded or hydrophobic environment than are those which react with Mal-ANS. It is the reaction of Mal-pyrene with sulfhydryl groups, which are not accessible to Mal-ANS, that results in the decreased [3H]ouabain-binding capacity of the (Na,K)-ATPase. The results indicate that phosphorylation of (Na,K)-ATPase is not required for Mg.ATP.Na-stimulated ouabain binding, and suggest that the ATP and sodium sites which modulate the interaction of ouabain with the (Na,K)-ATPase may be different from those which promote phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1551572892,"It was previously observed that the hydrolysis of GTP by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (in contrast to skeletal muscle SR: (a) was identical in rate with total ATP hydrolysis; (b) gave a similar nonlinear substrate response; (c) was not Ca2+ dependent; and (d) stimulated Ca2+ accumulation but not Ca2+ translocation. Evidence was presented that both the ATPase and GTPase are effected by the same enzyme and represent different hydrolysis cycles (Van Winkle, W. B., Tate, C. A., Bick, R. J., and Entman, M. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2268-2274). In the present paper, we report that purification of the NTPase from both muscle sources resulted in an alteration in the NTP concentration response compatible with a single high affinity binding site for ATP only in cardiac SR and for both substrates in skeletal muscle SR. As is the case with native skeletal muscle SR, purified skeletal muscle NTPase hydrolyzed GTP in a manner qualitatively similar to ATP (but with no Ca2+-independent NTPase) but with reduced velocity. In contrast, there was no GTPase activity or Ca2+-independent ATPase activity in the purified cardiac NTPase. Inclusion of oxalate or the ionophore, A23187, in assays with cardiac SR and ATP as the substrate increased the total ATPase activity but had no effect on GTPase activity. Furthermore, the nucleotide-dependent uptake of oxalate by cardiac SR was only apparent with ATP and not with GTP. In the presence of Ca2+, ATP was a potent inhibitor (noncompetitive, Ki of 2-5 microM) of GTPase activity, whereas it was a weaker competitive inhibitor in the absence of Ca2+. We suggest that GTPase and basic ATPase represent similar alternative enzyme cycles for the CaATPase enzyme that are inhibited by the presence of ATP plus Ca2+ but are rendered inactive during the purification of cardiac NTPase."
