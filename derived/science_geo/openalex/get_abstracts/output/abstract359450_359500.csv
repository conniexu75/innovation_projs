The molecular weight of the substance, kindly supplied by Prof. Meyer, has been determined from sedimentation and diffusion experiments. The dried substance was dissolved in a buffer solution of pH 8.4, with a molarity of 0.2 in sodium chloride, 0.02 in boric acid and 0.005 in borate."

https://openalex.org/W2027326165,"IT is well established1 that the intracellular respiratory complex catalysing the aerobic oxidation of succinate (the succinic oxidase system) includes the cytochrome system in addition to the specific enzyme responsible for the activation of succinate (that is, succinic dehydrogenase). Thus the transport of electrons from succinate to molecular oxygen proceeds through a chain of electron carriers of successively higher oxidation-reduction potential2. Four such carriers have been identified spectroscopically, namely, cytochromes b, c, a and a3. Cytochrome a3 is probably identical with cytochrome oxidase3. The purpose of the .present communication is to present evidence for the existence of an additional carrier. This evidence was obtained by studying the mechanism of the action of certain reducing agents (particularly the dithiol 2,3 dimercaptopropanol (B.A.L.)) on the succinic oxidase system of heart muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2033775618,"THE cultivated sugar-canes belong to two main groups : (1) the thin and hardy types of north Indian canes botanically classified under Saccharum Barberi Jesw. and Saccharum sinense Roxb.; and (2) the thick or noble types, Saccharum officinarum. The origin of these noble canes is still obscure, and Barber1 and Jesweit2 were of opinion that it was in the mountainous islands of the Malayan Archipelago, New Guinea and Polynesia. It is considered that these types of cane were introduced into India only very recently and are referred to as ‘the introduced canes', while the north Indian canes are held to be indigenous to India and any mention of sugar-cane in India in early historical records or mythological legends is believed to refer only to north Indian canes."

On the assumption that a similar process may take place in the soil, investigations on this problem were commenced at the Research Station, Cheshunt, and an attempt made to devise a method whereby antibiotic substances will be produced abundantly in the soil for the purpose of controlling soil-borne diseases. Blair1, Garrett2, Millard and Taylor3., West and Hildebrand4., Sanford5, and others, have reported that organic manuring reduced the incidence of certain soil-borne diseases and have suggested that microbial antagonism may be one of the important factors."

https://openalex.org/W4245332345,"DEFINITION AND USE IN WAR THE term Operational research' came into prominence during the War to describe what to the Services was a new type of thinking process used to arrive at answers to questions arising out of the operations of war. This thinking process has, however, already to some extent been used in industry under other names. It has been applied to market problems, cost accounting, quality control and works efficiency; in other words, to the operations of industry1. It has also been applied to agriculture and medicine. Its successful application during the War is already stimulating and extending its peace-time application."

https://openalex.org/W1975034471,"It is well known that the isolated skin of the frog is able to transport salt from its outside to the inside when bathed with frog Ringer on both sides1. In view of the fact that cortical hormones play an important part in the reabsorption of sodium chloride in the kidney, an investigation was made to learn whether the skin of hypophysectomized frogs, in which cortical secretion presumably is considerably decreased, is still able actively to transport salt. In specimens of Rana temporaria the adenohypophysis was removed, and the animals, together with un-operated controls, were kept without food in water at 10°–15° C. Three operated animals, two males and one female, of healthy appearance, were used in the experiments. The operations were carried out in November. The secretion of the skin of the operated frogs was very markedly reduced. This effect of hypophysectomy on the toad has already been described by Aubrun2."
https://openalex.org/W2033133786,"WHILE the main band-systems of the molecules O2, S2, Se2 and Te2 of the sixth periodic group have been the subject of numerous publications, there is little known about the systems of these molecules lying in the far ultra-violet. In all cases such systems have been found in absorption, but they have been analysed only partially for their complex structure. The absorption bands of Te2 and Se2 between 2500 and 1950 A. and 1950 and 1750 A. respectively have been photographed by Choong Shin-Piaw1. His analysis is incomplete and violates the empirical rule of Mecke–Birge. Choong Shin-Piaw believed all the molecules Te2, Se2 and S2 to show the same peculiarity, and referred to the results published by Wieland, Wehrli and Miescher2 on S2. Yet these authors emphasized the provisional character of their interpretation."

No such suggestion was intended. I had always imagined that the historic photographic plate was enclosed in some sort of light-proof wrapping, and might be legitimately, if briefly, described as a packet of photographic material."

https://openalex.org/W2038119835,"Bacteria have usually been prepared for observation in the electron microscope by growth in liquid media, a drop of the suspension being allowed to dry on a collodion-covered specimen grid. Smiles1 has employed an adaptation of the impression technique used in optical microscopy for obtaining material from a surface culture: a glass slide pressed on to the agar removes a film of bacteria, which is allowed to dry partially, and then removed by stripping with a collodion film. Hillier and Baker2 have described a more direct method, in which the collodion film is formed on the agar surface and then floated off in water. Unfortunately, most bacteria, however mounted, prove to be too opaque to an electron beam of the energy usually employed (50–60 kV.) to show appreciable internal structure."

https://openalex.org/W2080458130,"The control of the relapsing fever tick, Ornithodoros moubata Murray, which is widespread and alarmingly abundant in many townships and labour camps in East Africa, has hitherto proved uneconomic, owing to the marked resistance of the species to the common insecticides, and the consequent heavy dosage required. I have recently had occasion to carry out trials on a practical scale with a number of ‘Gammexane’ formulations, and the results have been so promising that it was thought opportune to bring the details of a simple method of treatment to the notice of all who are interested in the control of ticks."

Sligo where sheep pine and die, and cattle show pronounced ill-health, the administration of cobalt to the stock restores-health and increases productivity to a remarkable degree. The herbage is definitely deficient in cobalt. The stock on this particular farm are confined to it, while the stock from neighbouring farms in which the pronounced cobalt deficiency symptoms do not appear have alternative pastures."
https://openalex.org/W2046559296,"From all that is known about the renal function of new-born infants, it is now clear that their glomerular filtration-rates are considerably lower than those of adults, and also their clearances of urea and sodium chloride1. These discoveries have an important bearing on clinical practice, but much more information is required about the way in which the kidney of an infant reacts to changes in the internal environment. Accordingly, some experiments have been made to study the response of the kidney in new-born infants to a considerable rise in the osmotic pressure of the body. The children used for these experiments had all been born with inoperable meningo-myelocoeles. Healthy adults have been used as controls."

https://openalex.org/W2049278777,"PROTEIN mixtures such as those found in blood have been widely used in the study of antibody-antigen reactions. It is difficult to prepare pure samples of single proteins from such naturally occurring mixtures. On the other hand, preparations of certain plant virus proteins, derived from a single infectious unit, can be isolated in quantities sufficient for experimental work in a state which fulfils all the usual criteria of homogeneity. As they are also good antigens, they would appear to be especially suitable objects for the study of antibody-antigen reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2017033685,"REVIEWING some of the literature on Tyrogly-phid mites, Lapage1 directed attention to their role in pulmonary acariasis of man, in addition to destruction of stored food-products. The Oribatids are allied to these cheese- and flour-mites and to the well-known harvest- and chigger-mites, and have been, until a few years ago, of comparatively little economic significance. Otherwise known as moss-mites and beetle-mites, they have been studied for many years and from all over the world. They are mostly microscopic in size, free-living and terrestrial, although a few are aquatic and crawl on weeds. Their activity is greater in darkness, when they swarm out in search of food, and progression is normally slow. They havda shiny chitinous body-wall, a wing-like extension (the pteromorpha) at the antero-lateral corner of the abdomen on each side, a pair of peculiarly shaped sense-organs (the pseudo-sbigmatic organs), and no eyes."

https://openalex.org/W2002937764,"THE outstanding difficulty in obtaining the equation of motion of a spinning particle in a meson field which will take account of the reaction of the emitted meson field and is free from singularities is well known. The equation of motion was first obtained by Heisenberg1 for a dipole of finite extension and is therefore not relativistically invariant. The relativistically invariant equations of motion for a point dipole which have been developed by Bhabha and Corben2 and by Bhabha3 are extremely complicated and involve a number of arbitrary constants which are not determined uniquely. These equations in their final form are free from singularities, and have been proved to involve only the contribution of the so-called radiation field, denned as half the retarded minus the advanced field, which is finite on the world line. However, the equations are established by proving that the singular terms are perfect differentials and can therefore be subtracted away."
https://openalex.org/W2041153289,"IN a recent memoir, “The Visual Perception of Fine Detail”, Prof. H. Hartridge has discussed the way in which “the image formed on the retina is clarified and improved before it reaches the higher centres of the brain”, and considers in particular the reason why objects in white light are not seen surrounded by the coloured fringes which are certainly produced by the aberrations of the dioptric system of the eye (Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., B, 232, 519; 1947). To throw light on this question, observations were made of the changes in apparent colour of coloured test objects, in some cases monochromatic stimuli, when their angular size was greatly reduced and when other factors—the brightness of the background, the proximity of other coloured objects, the pupil size, etc.—were modified."

https://openalex.org/W2412834636,"WHAT is ‘Operational research'? Is it an activity of major importance to industry? Can it be carried out effectively by co-operative organisations such as research associations? How does one set about organising operational research? These questions were examined at a conference on January 13 and 14 attended by representatives of most of the research associations and of a number of establishments of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The conference was organised by the Committee of Directors of Research Associations under the chairmanship of Mr. B. H. Wilsdon, and was held at Ashorne Hill, through the courtesy of the British Iron and Steel Federation. The conference showed that it was possible to make a reasonably clear definition of the subject, and that operational research in one form or another had proceeded with growing emphasis in certain of the research associations very successfully for a considerable number of years. The research associations generally find themselves very suitably placed for an extension of this type of activity, in view of the wideness of the fields they survey and the close contacts they have with the executives in the industries they serve."

https://openalex.org/W2083385803,"ŒSTROGENIC substances are usually extracted from the urine of pregnant women, pregnant mares or stallions with organic solvents not miscible in water. There are certain disadvantages inherent in this method: large extraction vessels are required ; in view of the great bulk of the initial liquid containing the strogenic substances in low concentration and the relatively small total interface between the urine and the solvent, a relatively large volume of the latter has to be used ; this in turn involves the use of a large distillation apparatus and a high fuel consumption for the evaporation of the solvent from the extract. Moreover, a high proportion of ballast substances which later require separation accompanies the Œstrogenic substances in the extract."
https://openalex.org/W4238856530,"THE statistical survey of scientific and technical research in British industry recently made by the Industrial Research Secretariat of the Federation of British Industries, while admittedly incomplete, is a valuable supplement to the survey of expenditure on research and development which formed the subject of the Third Report of the Select Committee on Estimates for the Session 1946–47 (132–1. London: H.M. Stationery Office, 1947. 6s. net). The Federation's report is based on the 471 replies received to about nine hundred copies of a questionnaire circulated to industrial firms known or thought likely to be carrying out research. It is estimated that the survey covers some seventy-five per cent of the industrial research effort of Great Britain, although probably not more than fifty per cent of the firms carrying out research. On this assumption the total annual expenditure by industry on research and development within its own establishments is of the order of thirty million pounds, which represents about two thirds of one per cent of the total annual value of British manufacture."
