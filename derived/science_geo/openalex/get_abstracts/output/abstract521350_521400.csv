https://openalex.org/W2025865461,"Genome-wide association mapping studies (GWAS) are frequently used to detect QTL in diverse collections of crop germplasm, based on historic recombination events and linkage disequilibrium across the genome. Generally, diversity panels genotyped with high density SNP panels are utilized in order to assay a wide range of alleles and haplotypes and to monitor recombination breakpoints across the genome. By contrast, GWAS have not generally been performed in breeding populations. In this study we performed association mapping for 19 agronomic traits including yield and yield components in a breeding population of elite irrigated tropical rice breeding lines so that the results would be more directly applicable to breeding than those from a diversity panel. The population was genotyped with 71,710 SNPs using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), and GWAS performed with the explicit goal of expediting selection in the breeding program. Using this breeding panel we identified 52 QTL for 11 agronomic traits, including large effect QTLs for flowering time and grain length/grain width/grain-length-breadth ratio. We also identified haplotypes that can be used to select plants in our population for short stature (plant height), early flowering time, and high yield, and thus demonstrate the utility of association mapping in breeding populations for informing breeding decisions. We conclude by exploring how the newly identified significant SNPs and insights into the genetic architecture of these quantitative traits can be leveraged to build genomic-assisted selection models."

For this reason, data on antimicrobial use on 495 pig farms from entire Germany were collected and analyzed. In Germany, each application and dispensing of medicines to food-producing animals is documented in detail obligatorily by the veterinarian. This information was collected retrospectively for the year 2011. The analyses undertook separate examinations on the age groups sow, piglet, weaner and fattening pig; both the route of administration and indication per active ingredient, and active ingredient class, were evaluated. In total, 20,374 kg of antimicrobial substances were used in the study population. Tetracyclines were used in highest amounts, followed by beta-lactams, trimethoprim-sulfonamides and macrolides. Concerning the frequency of using an active substance per animal, polypeptides were most commonly administered. In all age groups, respiratory infections were the main indication for using antimicrobials, followed by intestinal diseases in piglets, weaners and fattening pigs and diseases of reproductive organs in sows. Over a period of 100 days, the median number of treatment days with one antimicrobial substance for piglets was 15 days, for weaners about 6 days, for fattening pigs about 4 days and for sows about 1 day. A multifactorial ANOVA was conducted to investigate which factors are associated with the treatment frequency. The factors “veterinarian” and “age group” were related to the treatment frequency, just as the interaction between “veterinarian” and “farm size” as well as the interaction between “veterinarian” and “age group”."

Although most bees nest in the ground, considerable effort has centered on installing 'bee hotels'--also known as nest boxes or trap nests--which artificially aggregate nest sites of above ground nesting bees. Campaigns to 'save the bees' often promote these devices despite the absence of data indicating they have a positive effect. From a survey of almost 600 bee hotels set up over a period of three years in Toronto, Canada, introduced bees nested at 32.9% of sites and represented 24.6% of more than 27,000 total bees and wasps recorded (47.1% of all bees recorded). Native bees were parasitized more than introduced bees and females of introduced bee species provisioned nests with significantly more female larva each year. Native wasps were significantly more abundant than both native and introduced bees and occupied almost 3/4 of all bee hotels each year; further, introduced wasps were the only group to significantly increase in relative abundance year over year. More research is needed to elucidate the potential pitfalls and benefits of using bee hotels in the conservation and population dynamics of wild native bees."
https://openalex.org/W2110157263,"Global warming poses particular challenges to migratory species, which face changes to the multiple environments occupied during migration. For many species, the timing of migration between summer and winter grounds and also within-season movements are crucial to maximise exploitation of temporarily abundant prey resources in feeding areas, themselves adapting to the warming planet. We investigated the temporal variation in the occurrence of fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in a North Atlantic summer feeding ground, the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada), from 1984 to 2010 using a long-term study of individually identifiable animals. These two sympatric species both shifted their date of arrival at a previously undocumented rate of more than 1day per year earlier over the study period thus maintaining the approximate 2-week difference in arrival of the two species and enabling the maintenance of temporal niche separation. However, the departure date of both species also shifted earlier but at different rates resulting in increasing temporal overlap over the study period indicating that this separation may be starting to erode. Our analysis revealed that the trend in arrival was strongly related to earlier ice break-up and rising sea surface temperature, likely triggering earlier primary production. The observed changes in phenology in response to ocean warming are a remarkable example of phenotypic plasticity and may partly explain how baleen whales were able to survive a number of changes in climate over the last several million years. However, it is questionable whether the observed rate of change in timing can be maintained. Substantial modification to the distribution or annual life cycle of these species might be required to keep up with the ongoing warming of the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2029896179,"Crowd evacuations are paradigmatic examples for collective behaviour, as interactions between individuals lead to the overall movement dynamics. Approaches assuming that all individuals interact in the same way have significantly improved our understanding of pedestrian crowd evacuations. However, this scenario is unlikely, as many pedestrians move in social groups that are based on friendship or kinship. We test how the presence of social groups affects the egress time of individuals and crowds in a representative crowd evacuation experiment. Our results suggest that the presence of social groups increases egress times and that this is largely due to differences at two stages of evacuations. First, individuals in social groups take longer to show a movement response at the start of evacuations, and, second, they take longer to move into the vicinity of the exits once they have started to move towards them. Surprisingly, there are no discernible time differences between the movement of independent individuals and individuals in groups directly in front of the exits. We explain these results and discuss their implications. Our findings elucidate behavioural differences between independent individuals and social groups in evacuations. Such insights are crucial for the control of crowd evacuations and for planning mass events."
https://openalex.org/W2148959485,"Diabetes peer support, where one person with diabetes helps guide and support others, has been proposed as a way to improve diabetes management. We have tested whether different diabetes peer support strategies can improve metabolic and/or psychological outcomes.People with type 2 diabetes (n = 1,299) were invited to participate as either 'peer' or 'peer support facilitator' (PSF) in a 2x2 factorial randomised cluster controlled trial across rural communities (130 clusters) in England. Peer support was delivered over 8-12 months by trained PSFs, supported by monthly meetings with a diabetes educator. Primary end point was HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, diabetes distress, blood pressure, waist, total cholesterol and weight. Outcome assessors and investigators were masked to arm allocation. Main factors were 1:1 or group intervention. Analysis was by intention-to-treat adjusting for baseline.The 4 arms were well matched (Group n = 330, 1:1(individual) n = 325, combined n = 322, control n = 322); 1035 (79·7%) completed the mid-point postal questionnaire and 1064 (81·9%) had a final HbA1c. A limitation was that although 92.6% PSFs and peers were in telephone contact, only 61.4% of intervention participants attended a face to face session. Mean baseline HbA1c was 57 mmol/mol (7·4%), with no significant change across arms. Follow up systolic blood pressure was 2·3 mm Hg (0.6 to 4.0) lower among those allocated group peer-support and 3·0 mm Hg (1.1 to 5.0) lower if the group support was attended at least once. There was no impact on other outcomes by intention to treat or significant differences between arms in self-reported adherence or medication.Group diabetes peer support over 8-12 months was associated with a small improvement in blood pressure but no other significant outcomes. Long term benefits should be investigated.ISRCTN.com ISRCTN6696362166963621."
https://openalex.org/W2057489873,"Purpose This study investigated the relationship between 2-year-old children’s exposure to TV and language delay. Methods The subjects of this study were 1,778 toddlers (906 males and 872 females) who participated in the Panel Study on Korean Children conducted in 2010. The linguistic ability of the toddlers was measured with the K-ASQ (Korean-Ages and Stages Questionnaire). The relationship between the amount of young children’s exposure to TV and language delay was analyzed with Poisson regression. Results The average daily TV watching time of 2-year-old Korean toddlers in this study was 1.21 hours. After all confounding variables were adjusted, toddlers with over 2 hours and less than 3 hours of TV watching time had 2.7 times more risk (RR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.13–6.65) of language delay than those with less than 1 hour of TV watching time. Those with more than 3 hours of TV watching time had approximately 3 times (RR = 3.03, 95% CI: 1.12–8.21) more risk (p<0.05). In addition, the risk of language delay increased proportionately with the increase in toddlers’ TV watching time (p = 0.004). Conclusion Two-year-old Korean toddlers’ average daily TV watching time of more than 2 hours was related with language delay."
https://openalex.org/W2003873799,"Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic multisymptom illness with a central nervous system component such as memory deficits, neurological, and musculoskeletal problems. There are ample data that demonstrate that exposure to Gulf War (GW) agents, such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and pesticides such as permethrin (PER), were key contributors to the etiology of GWI post deployment to the Persian GW. In the current study, we examined the consequences of acute (10 days) exposure to PB and PER in C57BL6 mice. Learning and memory tests were performed at 18 days and at 5 months post-exposure. We investigated the relationship between the cognitive phenotype and neuropathological changes at short and long-term time points post-exposure. No cognitive deficits were observed at the short-term time point, and only minor neuropathological changes were detected. However, cognitive deficits emerged at the later time point and were associated with increased astrogliosis and reduction of synaptophysin staining in the hippocampi and cerebral cortices of exposed mice, 5 months post exposure. In summary, our findings in this mouse model of GW agent exposure are consistent with some GWI symptom manifestations, including delayed onset of symptoms and CNS disturbances observed in GWI veterans."
https://openalex.org/W2004535211,"All entomological traps have a capturing bias, and amber, viewed as a trap, is no exception. Thus the fauna trapped in amber does not represent the total existing fauna of the former amber forest, rather the fauna living in and around the resin producing tree. In this paper we compare arthropods from a forest very similar to the reconstruction of the Miocene Mexican amber forest, and determine the bias of different trapping methods, including amber. We also show, using cluster analyses, measurements of the trapped arthropods, and guild distribution, that the amber trap is a complex entomological trap not comparable with a single artificial trap. At the order level, the most similar trap to amber is the sticky trap. However, in the case of Diptera, at the family level, the Malaise trap is also very similar to amber. Amber captured a higher diversity of arthropods than each of the artificial traps, based on our study of Mexican amber from the Middle Miocene, a time of climate optimum, where temperature and humidity were probably higher than in modern Central America. We conclude that the size bias is qualitatively independent of the kind of trap for non-extreme values. We suggest that frequent specimens in amber were not necessarily the most frequent arthropods in the former amber forest. Selected taxa with higher numbers of specimens appear in amber because of their ecology and behavior, usually closely related with a tree-inhabiting life. Finally, changes of diversity from the Middle Miocene to Recent time in Central and South America can be analyzed by comparing the rich amber faunas from Mexico and the Dominican Republic with the fauna trapped using sticky and Malaise traps in Central America."
https://openalex.org/W2035703208,"Aim To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in northeast area of China with a population-based study. Methods A population of 3173 (aged from 20 to 80 years old) was stratified by geographical location and age in Liaoning province, China. Prediabetes and diabetes were diagnosed according to the guideline of American Diabetes Association. Retinal photographs were obtained by using digital non-mydriatic camera for the presence and grading of DR according to the modified ETDRS Airlie house classification. Blood samples and comprehensive questionnaires were obtained for evaluation of laboratory results and risk factors. Results The prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was 20.7% and 10.4%, respectively. Among diabetes patients, DR prevalence was 11.9%. Age, obesity, total cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, living in rural areas and diabetes family history are all risk factors for prediabetes and diabetes. Waist-to-hip circumference rate served as a better obesity index to estimate diabetes risk compared with body mass index and waist circumference. Among all risk factors that we investigated, only the length of diabetes history was associated with the incidence of DR. However, DR prevalence in the newly discovered patients in rural areas was significantly higher than that in urban areas. Conclusion According to this study, 1 in 10 people has diabetes, 2 in 10 people have prediabetes, and 1 in 10 diabetics has DR in Liaoning province. In rural areas, diabetes was poorly recognized with limited medical resources, which probably resulted in more diabetes patient at a high risk of DR."

We made a transgenic mouse in which the adiponectin (Adipoq) promoter drives expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in adipocytes to potentially increase adipose tissue lipid storage. These mice (Adipoq-LPL) have improved glucose and insulin tolerance as well as increased energy expenditure when challenged with a high fat diet (HFD). To identify the mechanism(s) involved, we determined whether the Adipoq-LPL mice diverted dietary lipid to adipose tissue to reduce peripheral lipotoxicity, but we found no evidence for this. Instead, characterization of the adipose tissue of the male mice after HFD challenge revealed that the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and a number of PPARγ-regulated genes were higher in the epididymal fat pads of Adipoq-LPL mice than control mice. This included adiponectin, whose mRNA levels were increased, leading to increased adiponectin serum levels in the Adipoq-LPL mice. In many respects, the adipose phenotype of these animals resembles thiazolidinedione treatment except for one important difference, the Adipoq-LPL mice did not gain more fat mass on HFD than control mice and did not have increased expression of genes in adipose such as glycerol kinase, which are induced by high affinity PPAR agonists. Rather, there was selective induction of PPARγ-regulated genes such as adiponectin in the adipose of the Adipoq-LPL mice, suggesting that increasing adipose tissue LPL improves glucose metabolism in diet-induced obesity by improving the adipose tissue phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2078043130,"Groundbreaking studies showed that differentiated somatic cells of mouse and human origin could be reverted to a stable pluripotent state by the ectopic expression of only four proteins. The resulting pluripotent cells, called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, could be an alternative to embryonic stem cells, which are under continuous ethical debate. Hence, iPS cell-derived functional cells such as neurons may become the key for an effective treatment of currently incurable degenerative diseases. However, besides the requirement of efficacy testing of the therapy also its long-term safety needs to be carefully evaluated in settings mirroring the clinical situation in an optimal way. In this context, we chose the long-lived common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) as a non-human primate species to generate iPS cells. The marmoset monkey is frequently used in biomedical research and is gaining more and more preclinical relevance due to the increasing number of disease models. Here, we describe, to our knowledge, the first-time generation of marmoset monkey iPS cells from postnatal skin fibroblasts by non-viral means. We used the transposon-based, fully reversible piggyback system. We cloned the marmoset monkey reprogramming factors and established robust and reproducible reprogramming protocols with a six-factor-in-one-construct approach. We generated six individual iPS cell lines and characterized them in comparison with marmoset monkey embryonic stem cells. The generated iPS cells are morphologically indistinguishable from marmoset ES cells. The iPS cells are fully reprogrammed as demonstrated by differentiation assays, pluripotency marker expression and transcriptome analysis. They are stable for numerous passages (more than 80) and exhibit euploidy. In summary, we have established efficient non-viral reprogramming protocols for the derivation of stable marmoset monkey iPS cells, which can be used to develop and test cell replacement therapies in preclinical settings."

The patients presenting with corpus callosum infarctions were selected and further allocated into genu and/or body and splenium infarction groups. Proportion, lesion patterns, clinical features, risk factors and etiology of corpus callosum infarction were analyzed.Out of 1,629 cases, 59 patients (3.6%) with corpus callosum infarctions were identified by diffusion weighted imaging, including 7 patients who had ischemic lesions restricted to the corpus callosum territory. Thirty six patients had lesions in the splenium (61.0%). Corpus callosum infarction patients suffered from a broad spectrum of symptoms including weakness and/or numbness of the limbs, clumsy speech, and vertigo, which could not be explained by lesions in corpus callosum. A classical callosal disconnection syndrome was found in 2 out of all patients with corpus callosum infarctions. Statistical differences in the risk factor and infarct pattern between the genu and/or body group and splenium group were revealed.Corpus callosum infarction and the callosal disconnection syndrome were generally rare. The most susceptible location of ischemic corpus callosum lesion was the splenium. Splenium infarctions were often associated with bilateral cerebral hemisphere involvement (46.2%). The genu and/or body infarctions were associated with atherosclerosis. The most common cause of corpus callosum infarction probably was embolism."

Inhibition of carrageenan-induced inflammation reversed the increase in Ser(P)307-IRS1 but did not completely reverse the carrageenan-induced decline in Ser(P)473-AKT. To identify the additional mechanism responsible for the decrease in Ser(P)473-AKT, studies were performed in human HepG2 cells and in C57BL/6J mice. Following carrageenan, expression of GRB10 (growth factor receptor-bound 10 protein), an adaptor protein that binds to the insulin receptor and inhibits insulin signaling, increased significantly. GRB10 silencing blocked the carrageenan-induced reduction of the insulin-stimulated increase in Tyr(P)-IRS1 and partially reversed the decline in Ser(P)473-AKT. The combination of GRB10 silencing with BCL10 silencing and the reactive oxygen species inhibitor Tempol completely reversed the decline in Ser(P)473-AKT. After carrageenan, GRB10 promoter activity was enhanced because of activation by GATA2. A direct correlation between Ser(P)473-AKT and Ser(P)401-GATA2 was evident, and inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked Ser401-GATA2 phosphorylation and the increase in GRB10 expression. Studies indicated that carrageenan inhibited insulin signaling by two mechanisms: through the inflammation-mediated increase in Ser(P)307-IRS1, a negative regulator of insulin signaling, and through a transcriptional mechanism leading to increase in GRB10 expression and GRB10-inhibition of Tyr(P)-IRS1, a positive regulator of insulin signaling. These mechanisms converge to inhibit the insulin-induced increase in Ser(P)473-AKT. They provide internal feedback, mediated by Ser(P)473-AKT, Ser(P)401-GATA2, and nuclear GATA2, which links the opposing effects of serine and tyrosine phosphorylations of IRS1 and can modulate insulin responsiveness.

Recently, c-Cbl was identified as a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting degradation of active β-catenin and negatively regulating angiogenesis through Wnt signaling (16Chitalia V. Shivanna S. Martorell J. Meyer R. Edelman E. Rahimi N. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets active β-catenin: a novel layer of Wnt signaling regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23505-23517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar to β-catenin, Wnt activation also results in the nuclear translocation of c-Cbl ensuring its persistent interaction and degradation of active β-catenin (16Chitalia V. Shivanna S. Martorell J. Meyer R. Edelman E. Rahimi N. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets active β-catenin: a novel layer of Wnt signaling regulation.J. Biol.

Although these biochemical events represent important determinants of nuclear β-catenin regulation, the molecular mechanisms of these Wnt-mediated events have remained elusive. Among several post-translational modifications on c-Cbl, phosphorylation particularly at three tyrosine residues at the carboxyl terminus, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774, regulates its interactions in response to upstream signaling events (17Swaminathan G. Tsygankov A.Y. The Cbl family proteins: ring leaders in regulation of cell signaling.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We set out to examine the role of c-Cbl phosphorylation in β-catenin degradation and posited that Wnt activation mediates c-Cbl phosphorylation to regulate its nuclear translocation and down-regulation of nuclear β-catenin. Our data demonstrate that Wnt activation promotes phosphorylation of c-Cbl at Tyr-731, a critical event enhancing c-Cbl dimerization and binding to β-catenin. This mechanism regulates nuclear translocation of c-Cbl and leads to modulation of nuclear β-catenin and angiogenesis. Primary human aortic endothelial cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Promocell, Germany) pooled from three donors were grown in endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM-2) (Promocell). EGM-2 was prepared by supplementing endothelial basal medium (EBM-2) with fetal bovine serum (2%), hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), fibroblast growth factor-1 (10 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml), insulin-like growth factor (20 ng/ml), ascorbic acid (1 μg/ml), and heparin (90 μg/ml). These primary human cells were tested for Mycoplasma, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV-1 using ELISA. The cells were characterized by CD31, von Willebrand factor, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-Ac-LDL uptake, and smooth muscle actin using immunofluorescence and were used over eight passages.

The embryos were grown at 28 °C for 3 days. The images of fish under same light exposure setting were obtained from 10 randomly selected fish per group at every experiment and analyzed for the length of the tail vessels. The vessels were marked from the junction of the body and the tail going caudally using Image-Pro and averaged per group, as described previously (20Hartsough E.J. Meyer R.D. Chitalia V. Jiang Y.

The tail vessel plexus was marked and measured for fluorescent intensity using ImageJ. Embryos harvested at 24 h post-fertilization were subjected to total RNA extraction using RNAshredder and RNeasy as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg measured by Nanodrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for cDNA preparation. RT-PCR was conducted using TaqMan probes (ABI) with D. rerio vegfa and D. rerio actin. ECs serum-starved for 12–16 h and exposed to Wnt3a ligand for 3 h were treated with the cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1 mm for 30 min at room temperature (as recommended by manufacturer Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by quenching using Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min. The lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and probed using FLAG tag antibody and probed with FLAG antibody. Monomer is considered as loading control, and dimers were normalized to monomers using ImageJ. The antibodies, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, cellular fractionation, GST purification, and ubiquitination assays and in vitro tube formation assay are as described previously (16Chitalia V.

As phosphorylation at tyrosine 700, 731, and 774 regulates c-Cbl's binding to other interactors (17Swaminathan G. Tsygankov A.Y.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we examined their role in β-catenin regulation. Wnt activation in ECs resulted in phosphorylation of c-Cbl tyrosine 731 (Fig. 1A), which was also detected in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1B). Point mutants (Tyr to Phe as phospho-inactive) were employed to further examine its biological relevance. In the Wnt-off phase, c-Cbl Y731F did bind to β-catenin. However, unlike wild-type c-Cbl and Y700F and Y774F mutants, the interaction of Y731F and β-catenin reduced substantially with Wnt activation, despite an increase in β-catenin levels (Fig. 1C). Inactivation of Tyr-731 phosphorylation also abrogated c-Cbl's Wnt-mediated nuclear translocation (Fig. 1D and data not shown). These data underscore the importance of c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation in the Wnt-mediated c-Cbl nuclear translocation and β-catenin binding. c-Cbl exists as monomers and dimers, whereas its dimerization is known to regulate interactions with other proteins (16Chitalia V. Shivanna S. Martorell J. Meyer R. Edelman E. Rahimi N. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets active β-catenin: a novel layer of Wnt signaling regulation.J. Biol.

The Cbl interactome and its functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Because Tyr-731 phosphorylation enhances binding with β-catenin, we posited that Tyr-731 phosphorylation modulates binding with β-catenin through dimerization. This hypothesis was addressed using a set of constructs with combinations of point mutants (phospho-inactive, Y731F, and phospho-mimetic, Y731E) and ubiquitin-binding domain deletion (dUBA) or artificial dimerization motif (dimer), which is known to increase c-Cbl dimerization (16Chitalia V. Shivanna S. Martorell J. Meyer R. Edelman E. Rahimi N. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets active β-catenin: a novel layer of Wnt signaling regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23505-23517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two orthogonal approaches, DSS, a cross-linking agent and a stabilizer of protein-protein interactions, and immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were used. The data showed that c-Cbl existed predominantly as monomers at baseline (expected 120 kDa) (Fig. 2, A and B) (23Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. Leucine zipper-mediated homodimerization of the adaptor protein c-Cbl. A role in c-Cbl's tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Wnt induction resulted in a 1.8–2-fold increase in the dimerized species, an event compromised by phospho-inactivating mutation at Tyr-731 (Fig. 2, A–C). IP assays showed that the deletion of UBA in Y731F (F/dUBA) abrogated dimerization in both the phases of Wnt signaling, supporting the necessary role of UBA in c-Cbl dimerization (Fig. 2C). c-Cbl dimerization could be rescued by the artificial dimerization domain (F/dimer), only in the Wnt-off but not in the Wnt-on phase (Fig. 2C, 1st box). In contrast, the phosphomimicking Y731E mutant exhibited enhanced dimerization at baseline, even more than the wild-type c-Cbl in both phases of Wnt signaling (Fig. 2C, 2nd box). These data suggest that dimerization is necessary but not sufficient in the Wnt-on phase and that Tyr-731 phosphorylation enhances c-Cbl's dimerization in the Wnt-on phase. As c-Cbl phosphorylation mediates its protein-protein interactions (17Swaminathan G. Tsygankov A.Y. The Cbl family proteins: ring leaders in regulation of cell signaling.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Schmidt M.H. Dikic I. The Cbl interactome and its functions.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of c-Cbl phosphorylation on c-Cbl-β-catenin binding using immunoprecipitation of endogenous β-catenin by different c-Cbl constructs (Fig. 2D). Although phospho-inactive Y731F c-Cbl bound β-catenin in the Wnt-off phase, its binding was substantially abrogated in the Wnt-on phase (Figs. 1C and 2D), which could not be rescued even with the artificial dimerization domain in Y731F (F/dimer) in the Wnt-on phase (box on Fig. 2D), underscoring a need for intact Tyr-731 in the Wnt-on phase for β-catenin binding. The phospho-mimetic c-Cbl Y731E showed binding to β-catenin more than wild-type c-Cbl. Taken together with the dimerization pattern, these data suggest that in the Wnt-on phase, c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation augments c-Cbl-β-catenin binding through its dimerization. As binding to β-catenin regulates c-Cbl's nuclear translocation, we posited that the c-Cbl phosphorylation and dimerization regulates its Wnt-mediated nuclear translocation. Indeed, the nuclear translocation of c-Cbl mutants corresponded to their β-catenin binding pattern (Fig. 2E). Phospho-mimetic c-Cbl Y731E mutant alone or with functional dimerization and β-catenin binding abilities (E and E/dimer) localized to the nucleus even in the Wnt-off phase. The phospho-inactive mutants of c-Cbl Y731F showed no Wnt-mediated nuclear translocation, even when combined with the artificial dimerization motif (F/dimer). Collectively, these data indicate that in the Wnt-on phase, c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation is required to enhance c-Cbl dimerization, binding to β-catenin, and c-Cbl's nuclear translocation. Because binding of c-Cbl with β-catenin is required for β-catenin degradation (16Chitalia V. Shivanna S. Martorell J. Meyer R. Edelman E. Rahimi N. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets active β-catenin: a novel layer of Wnt signaling regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23505-23517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Tyr-731 phosphorylation is critical for c-Cbl-β-catenin binding in the Wnt-on phase, we posited that c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation status regulates β-catenin degradation. To this effect, we examined endogenous β-catenin in both phases of Wnt signaling. The data showed that β-catenin regulation by different c-Cbl mutants is commensurate to their β-catenin binding pattern. In the Wnt-off phase, wild-type and all c-Cbl phosphomutants significantly down-regulated β-catenin. However, in the Wnt-on phase, Y731F lost this ability (Fig. 3A) and could not be rescued even by the artificial dimerization (F/dimer) (Fig. 3B and data not shown) in both the cytosol and nuclear fractions (box in Fig. 3B). However, Y731E and E/dimer suppressed β-catenin in both the phases of Wnt signaling. c-Cbl-mediated β-catenin ubiquitination also followed its binding pattern (data not shown). In the Wnt-off phase, Y731F ubiquitinated β-catenin in an UBA-dependent manner. However, in the Wnt-on phase, even the artificial dimerization domain was not sufficient to rescue the ability of Y731F to ubiquitinate β-catenin. Collectively, these data underscore the critical role of Tyr-731 phosphorylation in down-regulation of β-catenin in the Wnt-on phase. Having shown that c-Cbl suppresses angiogenesis through Wnt signaling by degrading β-catenin and inhibiting pro-angiogenic Wnt target genes, IL-8 and VEGF (16Chitalia V. Shivanna S. Martorell J. Meyer R. Edelman E. Rahimi N. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets active β-catenin: a novel layer of Wnt signaling regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23505-23517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the c-Cbl phosphorylation status regulates the pro-angiogenic Wnt targets and angiogenesis. Of all phosphomutants, Y731F lost the inhibitory effect on VEGF, IL-8 levels, and in vitro tube formation (Fig. 4, A–E and data not shown). In contrast, Y731E inhibited VEGF, IL-8 levels, and in vitro tube formation more than the wild-type c-Cbl, an ability compromised by the deletion of UBA (E/dUBA). However, the addition of an artificial dimerization motif in Y731F (F/dimer) could not rescue the regulation of VEGF, IL-8, and in vitro angiogenesis (Fig. 4, B–D). These data indicate that although necessary, c-Cbl dimerization is not sufficient for its anti-angiogenic effect and that Tyr-731 phosphorylation regulates angiogenesis through its dimerization. The Fli-eGFP transgenic zebrafish model is a well established tool to examine angiogenesis in vivo, where the ECs are genetically engineered to express enhanced GFP (20Hartsough E.J. Meyer R.D.

In line with its dominant negative role, zebrafish injected with 70Z showed a significant increase in the length and early bifurcation of tail vessels and caudal vessel plexus and an increase in β-catenin (Fig. 5, A–D, and Table 1).

In line with the specific effect on β-catenin, c-Cbl 70ZG306E enhanced angiogenesis (Table 1 and data not shown). β-Catenin MO significantly abrogated 70Z-induced β-catenin levels, an increase in tail vessel length and caudal vessel plexus (Fig. 5, A–D, and Table 2). The effect on zebrafish VEGFa, a target of Wnt, followed the pattern of β-catenin regulation. c-Cbl inhibited and 70Z up-regulated vegfa in a β-catenin-dependent manner (Fig. 5E). All these data indicate that c-Cbl regulates angiogenesis through β-catenin.TABLE 2Number of injected Fli-eGFP zebrafish with 70Z and β-catenin MOCapped RNA% phenotype in total no. of live zebrafishLacZ + control MO2.3 (n = 84)70Z + control MO79 (n = 82)70Z + β-catenin MO67 (n = 102) Open table in a new tab We next examined the role of c-Cbl phosphorylation on zebrafish angiogenesis. Phospho-inactive c-Cbl Y731F, which increased β-catenin, also enhanced it, and the phosphomimicking c-Cbl Y731E substantially reduced angiogenesis and zebrafish vegfa mRNA (Fig. 5, F and G, and Table 3). The ability of Y731E to inhibit angiogenesis was significantly compromised by dUBA (E/dUBA). But the artificial dimerization motif in Y731F (F/dimer) failed to rescue this effect, confirming that UBA is not sufficient for c-Cbl's anti-angiogenic effect and that Tyr-731 regulates angiogenesis through dimerization.TABLE 3Number of injected Fli-eGFP zebrafish with c-Cbl constructsCapped RNA% phenotype in total no. of live zebrafish injectedLacZ2 (n = 56)c-Cbl Y731F78 (n = 89)c-Cbl Y731E82 (n = 91)Y731E/dUBA71 (n = 83)Y731F/dimer73 (n = 106) Open table in a new tab c-Cbl binding to β-catenin is a critical determinant of its regulation of transcriptionally active nuclear β-catenin. This study implicates Wnt-mediated Tyr-731 phosphorylation of c-Cbl as an important post-translational modification regulating its binding to active β-catenin in the Wnt-on phase. In doing so, we uncovered an intriguing interplay of c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation and dimerization under different states of Wnt activity. Dependence of β-catenin regulation on c-Cbl dimerization changed with Wnt status. In the Wnt-off phase, the abrogation of dimerization compromised the binding of both Y731F and Y731E to β-catenin (Fig. 2, B and C) underscoring the dimerization as a necessary requirement for β-catenin binding (16Chitalia V. Shivanna S. Martorell J. Meyer R. Edelman E. Rahimi N. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets active β-catenin: a novel layer of Wnt signaling regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23505-23517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also, c-Cbl dimerization was sufficient for its binding to β-catenin, as the artificial dimerization motif rescued the binding of both Y731F and Y731E (F/dimer and E/dimer) to β-catenin (Fig. 2C). In contrast, despite the intact dimerization domain, Y731F lost binding to β-catenin in the Wnt-on phase. The phosphomimicking Y731E mutant showed enhanced β-catenin binding even at baseline. These data implicate c-Cbl dimerization and Tyr-731 phosphorylation status as predominant determinants of c-Cbl-β-catenin binding in the Wnt-off and the Wnt-on phase, respectively. However, in the Wnt-on phase, c-Cbl dimerization is also important. In the Wnt-on phase, deletion of UBA in Y731E (E/dUBA) substantially abrogated its binding to β-catenin strongly suggesting that Tyr-731 phosphorylation regulates c-Cbl-β-catenin binding through its dimerization. Overall, the data support the notion that in the Wnt-off phase, c-Cbl dimerization is independent of c-Cbl's phosphorylation status and is necessary and sufficient for the c-Cbl-β-catenin interaction. However, in the Wnt-on phase, Wnt-mediated Tyr-731 phosphorylation through its dimerization enhances c-Cbl-β-catenin binding (Fig. 6). These observations beg an interesting question. How does c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation enhance dimerization, β-catenin binding, and c-Cbl nuclear translocation with Wnt activation? There can be different explanations. It is possible that Wnt-mediated Tyr-731 phosphorylation results in a conformational change to enhance c-Cbl dimerization. In turn, dimerization of c-Cbl bestows stoichiometric and/or kinetic advantages for binding to a rapidly expanding pool of active β-catenin molecules during the Wnt-on phase. It is also possible that similar to β-catenin, at baseline c-Cbl can be a part of a multiprotein complex tethered to a yet unknown partner precluding its translocation into the nucleus. Tyr-731 phosphorylation could alter c-Cbl's binding with this putative inhibitory partner, relinquishing it to translocate into the nucleus along with β-catenin. This may also explain why basal c-Cbl-β-catenin binding is insufficient for c-Cbl nuclear translocation during the Wnt-on phase. Although the above models warrant further investigation, the current data uncover Wnt-mediated c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation regulating its dimerization as a novel mechanism of β-catenin regulation. The phosphorylation and dimerization of c-Cbl are intertwined events. Bartkiewicz et al. (23Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. Leucine zipper-mediated homodimerization of the adaptor protein c-Cbl.

Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. APS facilitates c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Mol. Cell.

The authors ascribed it to a reduced number of c-Cbl molecules integrated into EGF receptor complex due to a lack of dimerization, suggesting phosphorylation as a function of dimerization (23Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. Leucine zipper-mediated homodimerization of the adaptor protein c-Cbl. A role in c-Cbl's tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although their data indicate that c-Cbl dimers are targets of phosphorylation (23Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. Leucine zipper-mediated homodimerization of the adaptor protein c-Cbl. A role in c-Cbl's tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it was not clear whether phosphorylation in turn influenced dimerization. The present data show phosphorylation of c-Cbl Tyr-731 as an upstream event in Wnt signaling. However, as an extension of their model, the data also show that Wnt-mediated c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation enhances c-Cbl dimerization (Fig. 2, A–C). Thus, c-Cbl dimerization and phosphorylation remain closely interdependent events. Phosphorylation in canonical Wnt signaling employs GSK-3β and CK1, serine and threonine kinases (9MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Wnt/β-catenin signaling: components, mechanisms, and diseases.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar). Because Wnt3a mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl (Fig. 1, A and B), this indicates a possibility of cross-talk. Wnt stimulation increases VEGF secretion (Fig. 4, A and B), which can potentially initiate VEGF signaling. Engagement of VEGF ligand to the VEGFR-2 receptor activates VEGFR-2 signaling, which is known to phosphorylate tyrosine on c-Cbl (27Rahimi N. A role for protein ubiquitination in VEGFR-2 signalling and angiogenesis.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), generating a negative feedback loop. Therefore, Tyr-731 phosphorylation may be a result from the participation of kinases other than those employed in canonical Wnt signaling and underscores nonlinearity in signaling events activated by Wnt ligands. The above data along with our previous work and that of others (10Chitalia V.C. Foy R.L. Bachschmid M.M. Zeng L. Panchenko M.V. Zhou M.I. Bharti A. Seldin D.C. Lecker S.H. Dominguez I. Cohen H.T.

The dimerized species of c-Cbl mediates β-catenin binding and degradation. Wnt-on phase is characterized by hypophosphorylated β-catenin, a species that is degraded by c-Cbl, but not the other E3 ligases such as β-TrCP or Jade-1. β-Catenin molecules translocates into the nucleus to activate transcription of Wnt target genes (active β-catenin). In parallel, Wnt activation phosphorylates Tyr-731 on c-Cbl to increase its dimerization through the UBA domain, binding with β-catenin and c-Cbl nuclear translocation. c-Cbl, thus “chases” and degrades the active β-catenin in the nucleus (Fig. 6). This study describes Wnt-mediated c-Cbl Tyr-731 phosphorylation as a critical determinant of its binding, and regulation of nuclearly active β-catenin and can be further explored as a biomarker in angiogenesis and cancer. c-Cbl modulating Wnt signaling is consistent with its tumor suppressor activity. The germ line c-Cbl mutations have developmental and functional consequences (28Niemeyer C.M. Kang M.W. Shin D.H. Furlan I. Erlacher M. Bunin N.J. Bunda S. Finklestein J.Z. Sakamoto K.M. Gorr T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2006531207,"Human defensins play multiple roles in innate immunity including direct antimicrobial killing and immunomodulatory activity. They have three disulfide bridges which contribute to the stability of three anti-parallel β-strands. The exact role of disulfide bridges and canonical β-structure in the antimicrobial action is not yet fully understood. In this study, we have explored the antimicrobial activity of human β-defensin 4 (HBD4) analogs that differ in the number and connectivity of disulfide bridges. The cysteine framework was similar to the disulfide bridges present in μ-conotoxins, an unrelated class of peptide toxins. All the analogs possessed enhanced antimicrobial potency as compared to native HBD4. Among the analogs, the single disulfide bridged peptide showed maximum potency. However, there were no marked differences in the secondary structure of the analogs. Subtle variations were observed in the localization and membrane interaction of the analogs with bacteria and Candida albicans, suggesting a role for disulfide bridges in modulating their antimicrobial action. All analogs accumulated in the cytosol where they can bind to anionic molecules such as nucleic acids which would affect several cellular processes leading to cell death. Our study strongly suggests that native disulfide bridges or the canonical β-strands in defensins have not evolved for maximal activity but they play important roles in determining their antimicrobial potency."
https://openalex.org/W1981945723,"Background Host association patterns in Ectoedemia (Lepidoptera: Nepticulidae) are also encountered in other insect groups with intimate plant relationships, including a high degree of monophagy, a preference for ecologically dominant plant families (e.g. Fagaceae, Rosaceae, Salicaceae, and Betulaceae) and a tendency for related insect species to feed on related host plant species. The evolutionary processes underlying these patterns are only partly understood, we therefore assessed the role of allopatry and host plant family shifts in speciation within Ectoedemia. Methodology Six nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers with a total aligned length of 3692 base pairs were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among 92 species belonging to the subgenus Ectoedemia of the genus Ectoedemia, representing a thorough taxon sampling with a global coverage. The results support monophyletic species groups that are congruent with published findings based on morphology. We used the obtained phylogeny to explore host plant family association and geographical distribution to investigate if host shifts and allopatry have been instrumental in the speciation of these leafmining insects. Significance We found that, even though most species within species groups commonly feed on plants from one family, shifts to a distantly related host family have occasionally occurred throughout the phylogeny and such shifts are most commonly observed towards Betulaceae. The largest radiations have occurred within species groups that feed on Fagaceae, Rosaceae, and Salicaceae. Most species are restricted to one of the seven global biogeographic regions, but within species groups representatives are commonly found in different biogeographic regions. Although we find general patterns with regard to host use and biogeography, there are differences between clades that suggest that different drivers of speciation, and perhaps drivers that we did not examine, have shaped diversity patterns in different clades."

https://openalex.org/W2133463060,"Background A community based drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) program has been incrementally implemented in Khayelitsha, a high HIV and TB burden community in South Africa. We investigated loss from treatment (LFT), and post treatment outcomes of DR-TB patients in this setting. Methodology LFT, defined as interruption of treatment for ≥2 consecutive months was assessed among patients initiating DR-TB treatment for the first time between January 2009 and July 2011. Patients were traced through routine data sources to identify those who subsequently restarted treatment and those who died. Additional information on patient status and survival after LTF was obtained from community DR-TB counselors and from the national death registry. Post treatment outcomes were observed until July 2013. Results Among 452 patients initiating treatment for the first time within the given period, 30% (136) were LFT, with 67% retention at 18 months. Treatment was restarted in 27 (20%) patients, with additional resistance recorded in 2/25 (8%), excluding two with presumed DR-TB. Overall, 34 (25%) patients died, including 11 who restarted treatment. Males and those in the age category 15-25 years had a greater hazard of LFT; HR 1.93 (95% CI 1.35-2.75), and 2.43 (95% CI 1.52-3.88) respectively. Older age (>35 years) was associated with a greater hazard of death; HR 3.74 (1.13- 12.37) post treatment. Overall two-year survival was 62%. It was lower (45%) in older patients, and was 92% among those who received >12 months treatment. Conclusion LFT was high, occurred throughout the treatment period and was particularly high among males and those aged 15-25 years. Overall long term survival was poor. High rates of LFT should however not preclude scale up of community based care given its impact in increasing access to treatment. Further research is needed to support retention of DR-TB patients on treatment, even within community based treatment programs."
https://openalex.org/W1980550994,"Reduced physical performance has been observed following the half-time period in team sports players, likely due to a decrease in muscle temperature during this period. We examined the effects of a passive heat maintenance strategy employed between successive exercise bouts on core temperature (Tcore) and subsequent exercise performance. Eighteen professional Rugby Union players completed this randomised and counter-balanced study. After a standardised warm-up (WU) and 15 min of rest, players completed a repeated sprint test (RSSA 1) and countermovement jumps (CMJ). Thereafter, in normal training attire (Control) or a survival jacket (Passive), players rested for a further 15 min (simulating a typical half-time) before performing a second RSSA (RSSA 2) and CMJ's. Measurements of Tcore were taken at baseline, post-WU, pre-RSSA 1, post-RSSA 1 and pre-RSSA 2. Peak power output (PPO) and repeated sprint ability was assessed before and after the simulated half-time. Similar Tcore responses were observed between conditions at baseline (Control: 37.06±0.05°C; Passive: 37.03±0.05°C) and for all other Tcore measurements taken before half-time. After the simulated half-time, the decline in Tcore was lower (-0.74±0.08% vs. -1.54±0.06%, p<0.001) and PPO was higher (5610±105 W vs. 5440±105 W, p<0.001) in the Passive versus Control condition. The decline in PPO over half-time was related to the decline in Tcore (r = 0.632, p = 0.005). In RSSA 2, best, mean and total sprint times were 1.39±0.17% (p<0.001), 0.55±0.06% (p<0.001) and 0.55±0.06% (p<0.001) faster for Passive versus Control. Passive heat maintenance reduced declines in Tcore that were observed during a simulated half-time period and improved subsequent PPO and repeated sprint ability in professional Rugby Union players."
https://openalex.org/W1999633512,"The cerebellum plays important roles in motor coordination and learning. However, motor learning has not been quantitatively evaluated clinically. It thus remains unclear how motor learning is influenced by cerebellar diseases or aging, and is related with incoordination. Here, we present a new application for testing human cerebellum-dependent motor learning using prism adaptation. In our paradigm, the participant wearing prism-equipped goggles touches their index finger to the target presented on a touchscreen in every trial. The whole test consisted of three consecutive sessions: (1) 50 trials with normal vision (BASELINE), (2) 100 trials wearing the prism that shifts the visual field 25° rightward (PRISM), and (3) 50 trials without the prism (REMOVAL). In healthy subjects, the prism-induced finger-touch error, i.e., the distance between touch and target positions, was decreased gradually by motor learning through repetition of trials. We found that such motor learning could be quantified using the ""adaptability index (AI)"", which was calculated by multiplying each probability of [acquisition in the last 10 trials of PRISM], [retention in the initial five trials of REMOVAL], and [extinction in the last 10 trials of REMOVAL]. The AI of cerebellar patients less than 70 years old (mean, 0.227; n = 62) was lower than that of age-matched healthy subjects (0.867, n = 21; p < 0.0001). While AI did not correlate with the magnitude of dysmetria in ataxic patients, it declined in parallel with disease progression, suggesting a close correlation between the impaired cerebellar motor leaning and the dysmetria. Furthermore, AI decreased with aging in the healthy subjects over 70 years old compared with that in the healthy subjects less than 70 years old. We suggest that our paradigm of prism adaptation may allow us to quantitatively assess cerebellar motor learning in both normal and diseased conditions."

Mathematical models prove valuable tools to study the proof-of-concept, efficacy and underlying mechanisms of such treatment approaches. The effects of parameter value uncertainties for two models of tumor development under angiogenic signaling and anti-angiogenic treatment are studied. Data fitting is performed to compare predictions of both models and to obtain nominal parameter values for sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the success of different cancer treatments depends on tumor size and tumor intrinsic parameters. In particular, we show that tumors with ample vascular support can be successfully targeted with conventional cytotoxic treatments. On the other hand, tumors with curtailed vascular support are not limited by their growth rate and therefore interruption of neovascularization emerges as the most promising treatment target."
https://openalex.org/W2078208738,"Understanding the cytoskeletal functionality and its relation to other cellular components and properties is a prominent question in biophysics. The dynamics of actin cytoskeleton and its polymorphic nature are indispensable for the proper functioning of living cells. Actin bundles are involved in cell motility, environmental exploration, intracellular transport and mechanical stability. Though the viscoelastic properties of actin-based structures have been extensively probed, the underlying microstructure dynamics, especially their disassembly, is not fully understood. In this article, we explore the rich dynamics and emergent properties exhibited by actin bundles within flow-free confinements using a microfluidic set-up and epifluorescence microscopy. After forming entangled actin filaments within cell-sized quasi two-dimensional confinements, we induce their bundling using three different fundamental mechanisms: counterion condensation, depletion interactions and specific protein-protein interactions. Intriguingly, long actin filaments form emerging networks of actin bundles via percolation leading to remarkable properties such as stress generation and spindle-like intermediate structures. Simultaneous sharing of filaments in different links of the network is an important parameter, as short filaments do not form networks but segregated clusters of bundles instead. We encounter a hierarchical process of bundling and its subsequent disassembly. Additionally, our study suggests that such percolated networks are likely to exist within living cells in a dynamic fashion. These observations render a perspective about differential cytoskeletal responses towards numerous stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2313408878,"Attenuated live infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) vaccines are widely used in the poultry industry to control outbreaks of disease. Natural recombination between commercial ILTV vaccines has resulted in virulent recombinant viruses that cause severe disease, and that have now emerged as the dominant field strains in important poultry producing regions in Australia. Genotype analysis using PCR—restriction fragment length polymorphism has shown one recombinant virus (class 9) has largely replaced the previously dominant class 2 field strain. To examine potential reasons for this displacement we compared the growth kinetics and transmission potential of class 2 and class 9 viruses. The class 9 ILTV grew to higher titres in cell culture and embryonated eggs, but no differences were observed in entry kinetics or egress into the allantoic fluid from the chorioallantoic membrane. In vivo studies showed that birds inoculated with class 9 ILTV had more severe tracheal pathology and greater weight loss than those inoculated with the class 2 virus. Consistent with the predominance of class 9 field strains, birds inoculated with 102 or 103 plaque forming units of class 9 ILTV consistently transmitted virus to in-contact birds, whereas this could only be seen in birds inoculated with 104 PFU of the class 2 virus. Taken together, the improved growth kinetics and transmission potential of the class 9 virus is consistent with improved fitness of the recombinant virus over the previously dominant field strain."
https://openalex.org/W2026475796,"Rationale Oxygen therapy improves survival and function in severely hypoxemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients based on two landmark studies conducted over 40 years ago. We hypothesize that oxygen users in the current era may be very different. We examined trends and subject characteristics associated with oxygen therapy use from 2001–2010 in the United States. Methods We examined Medicare beneficiaries with COPD who received oxygen from 2001 to 2010. COPD subjects were identified by: 1) ≥2 outpatient visits >30 days apart within one year with an encounter diagnosis of COPD; or 2) an acute care hospitalization with COPD as the primary or secondary discharge diagnosis. Oxygen therapy and sustained oxygen therapy were defined as ≥1 and ≥11 claims for oxygen, respectively, in the durable medical equipment file in a calendar year. Primary outcome measures were factors associated with oxygen therapy and sustained oxygen therapy over the study period. Results Oxygen therapy increased from 33.7% in 2001 to 40.5% in 2010 (p-value of trend <0.001). Sustained oxygen therapy use increased from 19.5% in 2001, peaked in 2008 to 26.9% and declined to 18.5% in 2010. The majority of subjects receiving oxygen therapy and sustained oxygen therapy were female. Besides gender, factors associated with any oxygen use or sustained oxygen therapy were non-Hispanic white race, low socioeconomic status and ≥2 comorbidities. Conclusions Any oxygen use among fee-for service Medicare beneficiaries with COPD is high. Current users of oxygen are older females with multiple comorbidities. Decline in sustained oxygen therapy use after 2008 may be related to reimbursement policy change."
https://openalex.org/W1995335407,"We studied the spatial arrangement of L- and M-cone driven electroretinograms (ERGs) reflecting the activity of magno- and parvocellular pathways. L- and M-cone isolating sine wave stimuli were created with a four primary LED stimulator using triple silent substitution paradigms. Temporal frequencies were 8 and 12 Hz, to reflect cone opponent activity, and 30, 36 and 48 Hz to reflect luminance activity. The responses were measured for full-field stimuli and for different circular and annular stimuli. The ERG data confirm the presence of two different mechanisms at intermediate and high temporal frequencies. The responses measured at high temporal frequencies strongly depended upon spatial stimulus configuration. In the full-field conditions, the L-cone driven responses were substantially larger than the full-field M-cone driven responses and also than the L-cone driven responses with smaller stimuli. The M-cone driven responses at full-field and with 70° diameter stimuli displayed similar amplitudes. The L- and M-cone driven responses measured at 8 and 12 Hz were of similar amplitude and approximately in counter-phase. The amplitudes were constant for most stimulus configurations. The results indicate that, when the ERG reflects luminance activity, it is positively correlated with stimulus size. Beyond 35° retinal eccentricity, the retina mainly contains L-cones. Small stimuli are sufficient to obtain maximal ERGs at low temporal frequencies where the ERGs are also sensitive to cone-opponent processing."
https://openalex.org/W2004229825,"Cell-cell adhesion is paramount in providing and maintaining multicellular structure and signal transmission between cells. In the skin, disruption to desmosomal regulated intercellular connectivity may lead to disorders of keratinization and hyperproliferative disease including cancer. Recently we showed transgenic mice overexpressing desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) in the epidermis develop hyperplasia. Following microarray and gene network analysis, we demonstrate that Dsg2 caused a profound change in the transcriptome of keratinocytes in vivo and altered a number of genes important in epithelial dysplasia including: calcium-binding proteins (S100A8 and S100A9), members of the cyclin protein family, and the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin A (CSTA). CSTA is deregulated in several skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and loss of function mutations lead to recessive skin fragility disorders. The microarray results were confirmed by qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. CSTA was detected at high level throughout the newborn mouse epidermis but dramatically decreased with development and was detected predominantly in the differentiated layers. In human keratinocytes, knockdown of Dsg2 by siRNA or shRNA reduced CSTA expression. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of CSTA resulted in cytoplasmic localization of Dsg2, perturbed cytokeratin 14 staining and reduced levels of desmoplakin in response to mechanical stretching. Both knockdown of either Dsg2 or CSTA induced loss of cell adhesion in a dispase-based assay and the effect was synergistic. Our findings here offer a novel pathway of CSTA regulation involving Dsg2 and a potential crosstalk between Dsg2 and CSTA that modulates cell adhesion. These results further support the recent human genetic findings that loss of function mutations in the CSTA gene result in skin fragility due to impaired cell-cell adhesion: autosomal-recessive exfoliative ichthyosis or acral peeling skin syndrome."

We investigated the kinetics of MT markers during anti-HCV and anti-HIV treatments, and if baseline plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) could predict anti-HCV treatment outcome. Methods Plasma from 78 HIV-infected patients was evaluated for LPS, LBP and sCD14. The patients starting anti-HCV treatment (with ongoing antiretroviral (ART) treatment) were categorized into sustained viral responders (SVR; n = 21) or non-responders (NR; n = 15) based on treatment outcome. ART starting subjects—were categorized into chronically HCV-infected (CH; n = 24) and mono-infected (HIV; n = 18), based on the HCV infection status. Samples were collected before start (at baseline) of pegylated-interferon-alpha/ribavirin (peg-IFN/RBV) or antiretroviral-therapy and two years after treatment start (at follow up). χ2–test, non-parametric statistics and logistic regression were applied to determine the associations with treatment response and changes of the soluble markers. Results Plasma levels of LPS and sCD14 were elevated in all subjects before antiviral-treatment but remained unchanged at follow-up. Elevated levels of LBP were present in patients with HIV and HIV/HCV co-infection and were reduced by ART. Additionally, higher levels of LBP were present at baseline in NR vs. SVR. Higher levels of LBP at baseline were associated with non-response to peg-IFN/RBV treatment in both bivariate (OR: 0.19 95% CI: 0.06–0.31, p = 0.004) and multivariate analysis (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.1–1.86, p = 0.07). Conclusion In HIV/HCV co-infected patients high baseline LBP levels are associated with non-response to peg-IFN/RBV therapy. Plasma LBP (decreased by ART) may be a more relevant MT marker than LPS and sCD14."

Here we demonstrate that a single naturally occurring 2’-O-methylation within a synthetic 18s rRNA derived RNA sequence prevents IFN-α production, however secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 is not impaired. By analysing TLR-deficient plasmacytoid dendritic cells and performing HEK293 genetic complementation assays we could demonstrate that the single 2’-O-methylation containing RNA still activated TLR8 but not TLR7. Therefore this specific 2’-O-ribose methylation in rRNA converts a TLR7 / TLR8 ligand to an exclusively TLR8-specific ligand. Interestingly, other modifications at this position such as 2’-O-deoxy or 2’-fluoro had no strong modulating effect on TLR7 or TLR8 activation suggesting an important role of 2’-O-methylation for shaping differential TLR7 or TLR8 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1967297170,"We have recently shown that a critical regulatory node in the platelet signaling network lies immediately downstream of platelet receptors for thrombin and TxA2. This node is comprised of a scaffold protein (spinophilin, SPL), a protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1), and either of the two members of the Regulators of G protein Signaling family predominantly expressed in platelets (RGS10 or RGS18). The SPL/RGS/SHP-1 complex is present in resting platelets, dissociating when thrombin or TxA2, but not ADP or collagen, activate SHP-1 and release RGS10 and RGS18 to dampen signaling. Here we demonstrate an additional regulatory role for spinophilin, showing that dissociation of SHP-1 from spinophilin is followed by an increase in the binding of spinophilin to PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase whose binding site maps to a region close to the SHP-1 binding site. The increase in PP1 binding to spinophilin is limited to platelet agonists that cause dissociation of the complex and is selective for the α and γ isoforms of PP1. Studies in cell culture show that SHP-1 and PP1 can compete for binding to spinophilin and that binding inhibits PP1 activity since over-expression of wild type spinophilin, but not spinophilin with a disabled PP1 binding site, causes an increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain, a well-characterized PP1 substrate. Collectively, these results indicate that in addition to regulating RGS protein availability in resting platelets, spinophilin can serve as a time-dependent, agonist- and isoform-selective regulator of PP1, inhibiting its activity when decay of the SPL/RGS/SHP-1 complex releases SHP-1 from spinophilin, exposing a binding site for PP1."
https://openalex.org/W2046691399,"Ebolaviruses can cause severe hemorrhagic fever that is characterized by rapid viral replication, coagulopathy, inflammation, and high lethality rates. Although there is no clinically proven vaccine or treatment for Ebola virus infection, a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine is effective in mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primates when given pre-infection. In this work, we report that VLPs protect Ebola virus-infected mice when given 24 hours post-infection. Analysis of cytokine expression in serum revealed a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in mice given VLPs post-exposure compared to infected, untreated mice. Using knockout mice, we show that VLP-mediated post-exposure protection requires perforin, B cells, macrophages, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Protection was Ebola virus-specific, as marburgvirus VLPs did not protect Ebola virus-infected mice. Increased antibody production in VLP-treated mice correlated with protection, and macrophages were required for this increased production. However, NK cells, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha were not required for post-exposure-mediated protection. These data suggest that a non-replicating Ebola virus vaccine can provide post-exposure protection and that the mechanisms of immune protection in this setting require both increased antibody production and generation of cytotoxic T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023750739,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. While the pathways that are deregulated in MB remain to be fully characterized, amplification and/or overexpression of the MYCN gene, which is has a critical role in cerebellar development as a regulator of neural progenitor cell fate, has been identified in several MB subgroups. Phenotypically, aberrant expression of MYCN is associated with the large-cell/anaplastic MB variant, which accounts for 5-15% of cases and is associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcome. To better understand the role of MYCN in MB in vitro and in vivo and to aid the development of MYCN-targeted therapeutics we established tumor-derived neurosphere cell lines from the GTML (Glt1-tTA/TRE-MYCN-Luc) genetically engineered mouse model. A fraction of GTML neurospheres were found to be growth factor independent, expressed CD133 (a marker of neural stem cells), failed to differentiate upon MYCN withdrawal and were highly tumorigenic when orthotopically implanted into the cerebellum. Principal component analyzes using single cell RNA assay data suggested that the clinical candidate aurora-A kinase inhibitor MLN8237 converts GTML neurospheres to resemble non-MYCN expressors. Correlating with this, MLN8237 significantly extended the survival of mice bearing GTML MB allografts. In summary, our results demonstrate that MYCN plays a critical role in expansion and survival of aggressive MB-propagating cells, and establish GTML neurospheres as an important resource for the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

Here we tried to establish a rat RIC model of liver transplantation (LT), optimize the applicable protocols and investigate the protective mechanism.The RIC model was developed by a standard tourniquet. Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned randomly to the sham operated control (N), standard rat liver transplantation (OLT) and RIC groups. According to the different protocols, RIC group was divided into 3 subgroups (10 min×3, n = 6; 5 min×3, n = 6; 1 min×3, n = 6) respectively. Serum transaminases (ALT, AST), creatine kinase (CK), histopathologic changes, malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and expressions of p-Akt were evaluated.Compared with the OLT group, the grafts subjected to RIC 5min*3 algorithm showed significant reduction of morphological damage and improved the graft function. Also, production of reactive oxygen species (MDA) and neutrophil accumulation (MPO) were markedly depressed and p-Akt was upregulated.In conclusion, we successfully established a novel model of RIC in rat LT, the optimal RIC 5min*3 algorithm seemed to be more efficient to alleviate IRI of the liver graft in both functional and morphological categories, which due to its antioxidative, anti-inflammation activities and activating PI3K Akt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2066645844,"Understanding how an invasive plant can colonize a large range of environments is still a great challenge in freshwater ecology. For the first time, we assessed the relative importance of four factors on the phosphorus uptake and growth of an invasive macrophyte Elodea nuttallii (Planch.) St. John. This study provided data on its phenotypic plasticity, which is frequently suggested as an important mechanism but remains poorly investigated. The phosphorus uptake of two Elodea nuttallii subpopulations was experimentally studied under contrasting environmental conditions. Plants were sampled in the Rhine floodplain and in the Northern Vosges mountains, and then maintained in aquaria in hard (Rhine) or soft (Vosges) water. Under these conditions, we tested the influence of two trophic states (eutrophic state, 100 μg x l(-1) P-PO4(3-) and hypertrophic state, 300 μg x l(-1) P-PO4(3-)) on the P metabolism of plant subpopulations collected at three seasons (winter, spring and summer). Elodea nuttallii was able to absorb high levels of phosphorus through its shoots and enhance its phosphorus uptake, continually, after an increase of the resource availability (hypertrophic > eutrophic). The lowest efficiency in nutrient use was observed in winter, whereas the highest was recorded in spring, what revealed thus a storage strategy which can be beneficial to new shoots. This experiment provided evidence that generally, the water trophic state is the main factor governing P uptake, and the mineral status (softwater > hardwater) of the stream water is the second main factor. The phenological stage appeared to be a confounding factor to P level in water. Nonetheless, phenology played a role in P turnover in the plant. Finally, phenotypic plasticity allows both subpopulations to adapt to a changing environment."
https://openalex.org/W2086239583,"A direct and continuous approach to determine simultaneously protein and phosphate concentrations in cells and kinetics of phosphate release from physiological substrates by cells without any labeling has been developed. Among the enzymes having a phosphatase activity, tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) performs indispensable, multiple functions in humans. It is expressed in numerous tissues with high levels detected in bones, liver and neurons. It is absolutely required for bone mineralization and also necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis. We provided the proof of concept that infrared spectroscopy is a reliable assay to determine a phosphatase activity in the osteoblasts. For the first time, an overall specific phosphatase activity in cells was determined in a single step by measuring simultaneously protein and substrate concentrations. We found specific activities in osteoblast like cells amounting to 116 ± 13 nmol min-1 mg-1 for PPi, to 56 ± 11 nmol min-1 mg-1 for AMP, to 79 ± 23 nmol min-1 mg-1 for beta-glycerophosphate and to 73 ± 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 for 1-alpha-D glucose phosphate. The assay was also effective to monitor phosphatase activity in primary osteoblasts and in matrix vesicles. The use of levamisole – a TNAP inhibitor- served to demonstrate that a part of the phosphatase activity originated from this enzyme. An IC50 value of 1.16 ± 0.03 mM was obtained for the inhibition of phosphatase activity of levamisole in osteoblast like cells. The infrared assay could be extended to determine any type of phosphatase activity in other cells. It may serve as a metabolomic tool to monitor an overall phosphatase activity including acid phosphatases or other related enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2057351866,"Primate affiliative relationships are differentiated, individual-specific and often reciprocal. However, the required cognitive abilities are still under debate. Recently, we introduced the EMO-model, in which two emotional dimensions regulate social behaviour: anxiety-FEAR and satisfaction-LIKE. Emotional bookkeeping is modelled by providing each individual with partner-specific LIKE attitudes in which the emotional experiences of earlier affiliations with others are accumulated. Individuals also possess fixed partner-specific FEAR attitudes, reflecting the stable dominance hierarchy. In this paper, we focus on one key parameter of the model, namely the degree of partner selectivity, i.e. the extent to which individuals rely on their LIKE attitudes when choosing affiliation partners. Studying the effect of partner selectivity on the emergent affiliative relationships, we found that at high selectivity, individuals restricted their affiliative behaviours more to similar-ranking individuals and that reciprocity of affiliation was enhanced. We compared the emotional bookkeeping model with a control model, in which individuals had fixed LIKE attitudes simply based on the (fixed) rank-distance, instead of dynamic LIKE attitudes based on earlier events. Results from the control model were very similar to the emotional bookkeeping model: high selectivity resulted in preference of similar-ranking partners and enhanced reciprocity. However, only in the emotional bookkeeping model did high selectivity result in the emergence of reciprocal affiliative relationships that were highly partner-specific. Moreover, in the emotional bookkeeping model, LIKE attitude predicted affiliative behaviour better than rank-distance, especially at high selectivity. Our model suggests that emotional bookkeeping is a likely candidate mechanism to underlie partner-specific reciprocal affiliation."
https://openalex.org/W1999684824,"Background P120 catenin (p120ctn), a regulator of cell adhesion, has previously been found in many malignancies, and suggested a role in invasion, metastasis and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between altered localization of p120ctn and clinical-pathological characteristics in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods Immunohistochemical staining for p120ctn was performed on tissue samples from 118 patients with ESCC. The expression of p120ctn was scored for intensity and cellular localization by Image-pro Plus 6.0. Correlations between immunohistochemical staining of p120ctn and pathological characteristics and clinical prognosis were determined using SPSS 18.0 software. Results Membrane expression of p120ctn in ESCCs was lower than that in adjacentnormal esophageal epithelial tissues (P = 0.041), while overall cellular expression of p120ctn was not different between the two tissue types (P = 0.787). Furthermore, neither overall cellular expression nor localized membrane expression was associated with histological and clinical variables. The high ratio of membrane expression to overall cellular expression (M/C) of p120ctn was inversely associated with lymph node invasion (P = 0.001), tumor differentiation (P = 0.012) and advanced tumor stage (P = 0.005); however, it was poorly associated with T stage (P = 0.274). The high M/C ratio of p120ctn was inversely correlated with poor survival; the 5-year OS (overall survival) and the 5-year DFS (disease free survival) for the high M/C ratio group were significantly higher than those of the low M/C ratio group (41.0% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.000; 44.1% vs. 24.9%, P = 0.007). Both the M/C ratio of p120ctn and N status were independent variables for the prediction of overall survival (P = 0.007 and P = 0.027). The M/C of p120ctn predicted a 0.49-fold risk of ESCC death (p = 0.007, 95% CI 0.29–0.83). Conclusions The reduced M/C ratio of p120ctn acted as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patient survival and for the migration and invasive behavior of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1969747507,"Oligomeric macromolecules in the cell self-organize into a wide variety of geometrical motifs such as helices, rings or linear filaments. The recombinase proteins involved in homologous recombination present many such assembly motifs. Here, we examine in particular the polymorphic characteristics of RecA, the most studied member of the recombinase family, using an integrative approach that relates local modes of monomer/monomer association to the global architecture of their screw-type organization. In our approach, local modes of association are sampled via docking or Monte Carlo simulations. This enables shedding new light on fiber morphologies that may be adopted by the RecA protein. Two distinct RecA helical morphologies, the so-called “extended” and “compressed” forms, are known to play a role in homologous recombination. We investigate the variability within each form in terms of helical parameters and steric accessibility. We also address possible helical discontinuities in RecA filaments due to multiple monomer-monomer association modes. By relating local interface organization to global filament morphology, the strategies developed here to study RecA self-assembly are particularly well suited to other DNA-binding proteins and to filamentous protein assemblies in general."
https://openalex.org/W1997287906,"To identify optimal cut-off points of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for two-step strategy in screening abnormal glucose metabolism and estimating prevalence in general Chinese population. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 7913 people aged 20 to 74 years in Harbin. Diabetes and pre-diabetes were determined by fasting and 2 hour post-load glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test in all participants. Screening potential of FPG, cost per case identified by two-step strategy, and optimal FPG cut-off points were described. The prevalence of diabetes was 12.7%, of which 65.2% was undiagnosed. Twelve percent or 9.0% of participants were diagnosed with pre-diabetes using 2003 ADA criteria or 1999 WHO criteria, respectively. The optimal FPG cut-off points for two-step strategy were 5.6 mmol/l for previously undiagnosed diabetes (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of FPG 0.93; sensitivity 82.0%; cost per case identified by two-step strategy ¥261), 5.3 mmol/l for both diabetes and pre-diabetes or pre-diabetes alone using 2003 ADA criteria (0.89 or 0.85; 72.4% or 62.9%; ¥110 or ¥258), 5.0 mmol/l for pre-diabetes using 1999 WHO criteria (0.78; 66.8%; ¥399), and 4.9 mmol/l for IGT alone (0.74; 62.2%; ¥502). Using the two-step strategy, the underestimates of prevalence reduced to nearly 38% for pre-diabetes or 18.7% for undiagnosed diabetes, respectively. Approximately a quarter of the general population in Harbin was in hyperglycemic condition. Using optimal FPG cut-off points for two-step strategy in Chinese population may be more effective and less costly for reducing the missed diagnosis of hyperglycemic condition."
https://openalex.org/W2035805509,"Objective Statins treatment may modify the levels of zinc and selenium, minerals that can improve vascular function and reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in atherosclerotic patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin, alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation, on lipid profile, antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients. Material and Methods A double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients (n = 76) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc (30 mg/d) and selenium (150 μg/d) supplementation. The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention: anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL(-)) concentrations, activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes. Significance was determined using an α of 5% (two-tailed). Results We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP independently of mineral supplementation. Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(-). Similarly, the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments. Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups. Conclusion Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients. The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin. Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients.

Methods Following ex-vivo stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with M. tuberculosis-specific antigens early secretory antigenic target (ESAT)-6 and culture filtrate protein (CFP)-10, immune responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot IFN-γ release assay (EliSpot-IGRA) and a novel dual cytokine detecting fluorescence-linked immunospot (FluoroSpot) in 18 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, 10 persons with previously cured tuberculosis, 25 individuals with LTBI and 16 healthy controls. Results Correlation of IFN- γ+ spot-forming cells in EliSpot-IGRA and FluoroSpot were R2 = 0.67 for ESAT-6 and R2 = 0.73 for CFP-10. The number of IL-2- IFN- γ+ producing cells was higher in patients with tuberculosis compared with past tuberculosis (CFP-10-induced p = 0.0068) or individuals with LTBI (ESAT-6-induced p = 0.0136). A cutoff value of >16 CFP-10-induced IFN-γ+ secreting cells/200.000 PBMC in the EliSpot-IGRA discriminated with highest sensitivity and specificity (89% and 76%, respectively). However, overlap in cytokine responses precludes distinction between the cohorts on an individual basis. Conclusions Combined analysis of IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion by antigen specific T-cells does not allow a reliable differentiation between different states of M. tuberculosis infection in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2024218106,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the smallest DNA virus and the major cause of acute and chronic hepatitis. The 3.2 kb HBV viral genome generates four major species of unspliced viral transcript as well as several alternatively spliced RNAs. A 2.2 kb singly-spliced RNA is the most abundant spliced RNA and is widely expressed among all HBV genotypes. The expression of the singly-spliced RNA, as well as that of its encoded protein HBSP, is strongly associated with hepatopathology during HBV infection. Here, we report a novel inhibitory role of a p21.5 protein, which is encoded by a 2.2 kb singly-spliced RNA, in the modulation of HBV replication. We show that overexpression of the singly-spliced RNA is able to efficiently inhibit HBV replication. Furthermore, a mutation in the ATG start codon of the precore region completely abolishes the inhibitory effect of the singly-spliced RNA, indicating that a viral protein (p21.5) derived from the singly-spliced RNA is the mediator of the inhibition. Furthermore, p21.5 is able to form a homodimer that interacts with core dimers forming hybrid viral assembly components. Sucrose gradient fractionation revealed that co-expression of p21.5 resulted in a spread distribution pattern of core proteins ranging from low to high sucrose densities. When compared with p22, p21.5 is almost ten times more efficient at destabilizing HBV nucleocapsid assembly in Huh7 cells overexpressing either p21.5 or p22 protein. Moreover, in vivo expression of p21.5 protein by tail vein injection was found to decrease the amount of nucleocapsid in the livers of HBV-expressing BALB/c mice. In conclusion, our study reveals that the HBV 2.2 kb singly-spliced RNA encodes a 21.5 kDa viral protein that significantly interferes with the assembly of nucleocapsids during HBV nucleocapsid formation. These findings provide a possible strategy for elimination of HBV particles inside cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042827907,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the ovarian hormones and the use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP) on cardiac vagal withdrawal at the onset of dynamic exercise. Thirty physically active women aged 19-32 years were divided into two groups: OCP users (n = 17) and non-OCP users (n = 13). Participants were studied randomly at three different phases of the menstrual cycle: early follicular (day 3.6 ± 1.2; range 1-5), ovulatory (day 14.3 ± 0.8; range 13-16) and midluteal (day 21.3 ± 0.8; range 20-24), according to endogenous (in non-OCP users) or exogenous (in OCP users) estradiol and progesterone variations. The cardiac vagal withdrawal was represented by the cardiac vagal index (CVI), which was obtained by the 4-s exercise test. Additionally, resting heart rate, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were obtained. The CVI was not significantly different between the three phases of the menstrual cycle in either the non-OCP users (early follicular: 1.58 ± 0.1; ovulatory: 1.56 ± 0.1; midluteal: 1.58 ± 0.1, P > 0.05) or OCP users (early follicular: 1.47 ± 0.1; ovulatory: 1.49 ± 0.1; midluteal: 1.47 ± 0.1, P > 0.05) (mean ± SEM). Resting cardiovascular responses were not affected by hormonal phase or OCP use, except that the SBP was higher in the OCP users than non-OCP users in all phases of the cycle (P < 0.05). In summary, our results demonstrate that cardiac vagal withdrawal at the onset of dynamic exercise was not impacted by the menstrual cycle or OCP use in physically active women."
https://openalex.org/W2002623011,"HIV-1 infection is characterized by an ongoing replication leading to T-lymphocyte decline which is paralleled by the switch from CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor usage. To predict coreceptor usage, several computer algorithms using gp120 V3 loop sequence data have been developed. In these algorithms an occupation of the V3 positions 11 and 25, by one of the amino acids lysine (K) or arginine (R), is an indicator for CXCR4 usage. Amino acids R and K dominate at these two positions, but can also be identified at positions 9 and 10. Generally, CXCR4-viruses possess V3 sequences, with an overall positive charge higher than the V3 sequences of R5-viruses. The net charge is calculated by subtracting the number of negatively charged amino acids (D, aspartic acid and E, glutamic acid) from the number of positively charged ones (K and R). In contrast to D and E, which are very similar in their polar and acidic properties, the characteristics of the R guanidinium group differ significantly from the K ammonium group. However, in coreceptor predictive computer algorithms R and K are both equally rated. The study was conducted to analyze differences in infectivity and coreceptor usage because of R-to-K mutations at the V3 positions 9, 10 and 11. V3 loop mutants with all possible RRR-to-KKK triplets were constructed and analyzed for coreceptor usage, infectivity and neutralization by SDF-1α and RANTES. Virus mutants R9R10R11 showed the highest infectivity rates, and were inhibited more efficiently in contrast to the K9K10K11 viruses. They also showed higher efficiency in a virus-gp120 paired infection assay. Especially V3 loop position 9 was relevant for a switch to higher infectivity when occupied by R. Thus, K-to-R exchanges play a role for enhanced viral entry efficiency and should therefore be considered when the viral phenotype is predicted based on V3 sequence data."

To this end, we investigated the size and composition of the bud bank of Miscanthus sacchariflorus (Maxim.) Hack. immediately after flooding (November), in winter (January), in spring (March), and before flooding (May) in the wetlands of Dongting Lake. We then examined the sprouting capacity of axillary buds after sediment burial at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm. Total bud density of M. sacchariflorus ranged from 2524 buds m(-2) in November to 4293 buds m(-2) in March. Rhizome segments with inactive axillary buds, which represented the majority of the bud population (88.7% in November, 93.3% in May), did not sprout during the 140 days of the experiment (n = 250). The sprouting ratio was the highest for active axillary buds buried at 0 cm (64%) and decreased when buried at 10-20 cm (34%-40%). Due to the large number of active axillary buds in the bud bank (211-277 buds m(-2) from November to the following March), M. sacchariflorus could completely replace its aboveground shoot population, except in May (142 buds m(-2)). Increasing burial depth delayed bud emergence and reduced the growth period of shoots; however, burial depth did not affect the resulting plant height and only reduced the accumulated biomass at 20 cm. Therefore, the belowground bud bank and its strong sprouting capacity are important factors in the maintenance of local populations and colonization of new habitats for M. sacchariflorus after burial disturbances. The present methodology, which combined measurements of bud bank demography and sprouting capacity, may reflect the regeneration potential of clonal plants after burial disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2072551458,"Protein-DNA interactions play a significant role in gene regulation and expression. In order to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) of double sex (DSX)-an important transcription factor in sex determination, we applied the DNA adenine methylation identification (DamID) technology to the fat body tissue of Drosophila, followed by deep sequencing (DamID-Seq). One feature of DamID-Seq data is that induced adenine methylation signals are not assured to be symmetrically distributed at TFBS, which renders the existing peak calling algorithms for ChIP-Seq, including SPP and MACS, inappropriate for DamID-Seq data. This challenged us to develop a new algorithm for peak calling. A challenge in peaking calling based on sequence data is estimating the averaged behavior of background signals. We applied a bootstrap resampling method to short sequence reads in the control (Dam only). After data quality check and mapping reads to a reference genome, the peaking calling procedure compromises the following steps: 1) reads resampling; 2) reads scaling (normalization) and computing signal-to-noise fold changes; 3) filtering; 4) Calling peaks based on a statistically significant threshold. This is a non-parametric method for peak calling (NPPC). We also used irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) analysis, as well as ChIP-Seq data to compare the peaks called by the NPPC. We identified approximately 6,000 peaks for DSX, which point to 1,225 genes related to the fat body tissue difference between female and male Drosophila. Statistical evidence from IDR analysis indicated that these peaks are reproducible across biological replicates. In addition, these peaks are comparable to those identified by use of ChIP-Seq on S2 cells, in terms of peak number, location, and peaks width."

Materials and Methods We analysed individual patient randomised controlled trial data (n=98) using a binary logistic regression model based on age, gender, baseline disability scores [physician-observed: expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and patient reported: multiple sclerosis impact scale 29 (MSIS-29)], and the time intervals between symptom onset or referral and treatment. Results Based on two a priori selected cut-off points (improvement in EDSS ≥ 0.5 and ≥ 1.0), we found that variables which predicted better response to corticosteroids after 6 weeks were younger age and lower MSIS-29 physical score at the time of relapse (model fit 71.2% - 73.1%). Conclusions This pilot study suggests two clinical variables which may predict the majority of the response to corticosteroid treatment in patients undergoing an MS relapse. The study is limited in being able to clearly distinguish factors associated with treatment response or spontaneous recovery and needs to be replicated in a larger prospective study."

https://openalex.org/W2002038860,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) are a set of neurological disorders including HIV encephalopathy and HIV dementia, which are associated with HIV-1 infection, and specifically with the HIV Tat protein, which is present in the brain of HIV-1–infected patients. Tat is thought to inhibit neuronal communication by acting directly on neurotransmitter transporters such as the human dopamine transporter, hDAT. hDAT transports dopamine from the presynaptic cleft into presynaptic neurons during neurotransmission. Curiously, cocaine blocks this clearance of dopamine by acting directly on hDAT, so HANDs are further exacerbated in HIV-1–positive patients who abuse cocaine. To probe the mechanism of Tat action on hDAT, Yuan et al. used a hDAT homology model to dock Tat onto the transporter and performed MD simulations to probe the conformational state of hDAT bound to Tat. They found that of the three known conformational states of hDAT, Tat binds only the outward-open structure with favorable binding energies. The authors predicted that Tat binding would block the entry pathway of the dopamine substrate, thereby inhibiting dopamine clearance from the presynaptic cleft. As well, the authors were able to identify key intramolecular interactions between Tat and key hDAT residues, including a cation-π interaction involving Y470 of hDAT and two hydrogen-bonding interactions involving hDAT residues Y88 and K92. These interactions persisted throughout the MD simulations. To obtain experimental evidence for the mode of binding predicted by the computational experiments, the authors monitored the effect of Tat on dopamine uptake by hDAT bearing mutations of the key residues they defined. This mutational analysis verified the role of the aromatic ring of hDAT Y470 and therefore the existence of a cation-π interaction with Tat and the role of hydrogen bonding at Y88 and K92. These results suggest a mechanism for how infection by HIV-1 leads to HANDs."

Methods A total of 311 pregnant women with abnormal 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results were enrolled in this study. Maternal glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA), islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) and insulin autoantibodies (IAA) were tested in fasting blood both on the day following the routine OGTT and before delivery. The birth weight, Apgar score, blood glucose and outcomes of each neonate were later evaluated and recorded. Results 1. In this study, 33.9% of the pregnant women with gestational hyperglycemia had detectable levels of one or more types of anti-islet cell antibodies in the third trimester. The proportion of women who produced GADA and/or ICA was significantly higher in the group of women with gestational hyperglycemia than in the control group (P<0.05). The groups similarly differed in the proportion of women who tested positive for any anti-islet cell antibody (P<0.05). 2. Of the patients in our study, those who produced GADA exhibited an increase in uterine and umbilical arterial pulsatility indexes (PIs) during the third trimesters compared with the control group (P˂0.05). Additionally, an increased frequency of fetal growth restriction (FGR) was observed in the infants of women who produced IAA during pregnancy compared with those without autoantibodies (P˂0.05). 3. The rate of newborn admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was significantly associated with the presence of maternal ICA during the third trimester (OR, 6.36; 95% CI, 1.22–33.26). 4. The incidence of neonatal asphyxia was associated with the presence of maternal GADA in both the second (OR, 10.44; 95% CI, 1.46–74.92) and the third (OR, 8.33; 95% CI, 1.45–47.82) trimesters. Conclusion Approximately one-third of the women with gestational hyperglycemia produced anti-islet cell antibodies. The incidence of FGR was higher in women with gestational hyperglycemia who produced IAA than in those without autoantibodies. Maternal ICA production in the third trimester was a risk factor for the subsequent admission of newborns to the NICU. Furthermore, the presence of maternal GADA placed the neonate at increased risk for asphyxia."
