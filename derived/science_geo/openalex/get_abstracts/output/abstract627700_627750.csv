https://openalex.org/W2911596708,"Carbon-hydrogen (C-H) and carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds are the main constituents of organic matter. Recent advances in C-H functionalization technology have vastly expanded our toolbox for organic synthesis1. By contrast, C-C activation methods that enable editing of the molecular skeleton remain limited2-7. Several methods have been proposed for catalytic C-C activation, particularly with ketone substrates, that are typically promoted by using either ring-strain release as a thermodynamic driving force4,6 or directing groups5,7 to control the reaction outcome. Although effective, these strategies require substrates that contain highly strained ketones or a preinstalled directing group, or are limited to more specialist substrate classes5. Here we report a general C-C activation mode driven by aromatization of a pre-aromatic intermediate formed in situ. This reaction is suitable for various ketone substrates, is catalysed by an iridium/phosphine combination and is promoted by a hydrazine reagent and 1,3-dienes. Specifically, the acyl group is removed from the ketone and transformed to a pyrazole, and the resulting alkyl fragment undergoes various transformations. These include the deacetylation of methyl ketones, carbenoid-free formal homologation of aliphatic linear ketones and deconstructive pyrazole synthesis from cyclic ketones. Given that ketones are prevalent in feedstock chemicals, natural products and pharmaceuticals, these transformations could offer strategic bond disconnections in the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules."

There is increasing evidence to suggest that all aspects of employment, from hiring to performance evaluation to promotion, are affected by gender and cultural background. In higher education, bias in performance evaluation has been posited as one of the reasons why few women make it to the upper echelons of the academic hierarchy. With unprecedented access to institution-wide student survey data from a large public university in Australia, we investigated the role of conscious or unconscious bias in terms of gender and cultural background. We found potential bias against women and teachers with non-English speaking backgrounds. Our findings suggest that bias may decrease with better representation of minority groups in the university workforce. Our findings have implications for society beyond the academy, as over 40% of the Australian population now go to university, and graduates may carry these biases with them into the workforce."
https://openalex.org/W2913977338,"This study trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) incorporating an attention mechanism to predict daily sepsis, myocardial infarction (MI), and vancomycin antibiotic administration over two week patient ICU courses in the MIMIC-III dataset. These models achieved next-day predictive AUC of 0.876 for sepsis, 0.823 for MI, and 0.833 for vancomycin administration. Attention maps built from these models highlighted those times when input variables most influenced predictions and could provide a degree of interpretability to clinicians. These models appeared to attend to variables that were proxies for clinician decision-making, demonstrating a challenge of using flexible deep learning approaches trained with EHR data to build clinical decision support. While continued development and refinement is needed, we believe that such models could one day prove useful in reducing information overload for ICU physicians by providing needed clinical decision support for a variety of clinically important tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2898175534,"Natural hazards are becoming increasingly expensive as climate change and development are exposing communities to greater risks. Preparation and recovery are critical for climate change resilience, and social media are being used more and more to communicate before, during, and after disasters. While there is a growing body of research aimed at understanding how people use social media surrounding disaster events, most existing work has focused on a single disaster case study. In the present study, we analyze five of the costliest disasters in the last decade in the United States (Hurricanes Irene and Sandy, two sets of tornado outbreaks, and flooding in Louisiana) through the lens of Twitter. In particular, we explore the frequency of both generic and specific food-security related terms, and quantify the relationship between network size and Twitter activity during disasters. We find differences in tweet volume for keywords depending on disaster type, with people using Twitter more frequently in preparation for Hurricanes, and for real-time or recovery information for tornado and flooding events. Further, we find that people share a host of general disaster and specific preparation and recovery terms during these events. Finally, we find that among all account types, individuals with “average” sized networks are most likely to share information during these disasters, and in most cases, do so more frequently than normal. This suggests that around disasters, an ideal form of social contagion is being engaged in which average people rather than outsized influentials are key to communication. These results provide important context for the type of disaster information and target audiences that may be most useful for disaster communication during varying extreme events."
https://openalex.org/W2912326250,"Bone is the most frequent site of prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis; however, little is known about the role of the most common cell in bone, the osteocyte (OCy), in cancer biology. In this study we explored the crosstalk between PCa cells and OCys to determine if it contributes to PCa progression. PCa cells induced OCys to promote PCa proliferation, migration and invasion. A chemokine screen revealed that PCa cell induced OCys to produce growth-derived factor 15 (GDF15). Knockdown of GDF15 in OCys demonstrated that PCa cells conferred the ability on OCys to promote PCa proliferation, migration and invasion through GDF15. Consistent with this finding was the observation that the GDF15 receptor, GFRAL, was expressed on multiple PCa cell lines. Transcription factor array screening of PCa cells exposed to OCys with or without knockdown of GDF15 revealed that GDF15 in OCys promoted early growth response 1 (EGR1) expression in the PCa cells. Knockdown of EGR1 expression in PCa cells revealed it was required for the OCy-derived GDF15-mediated induction of in vitro PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Subcutaneous co-injection of PCa cells and OCys into mice revealed that OCys promoted tumor growth in vivo, which was diminished by knockdown of GDF15 in the OCys. Knockdown of GDF15 in the tibiae diminished growth of PCa cancer cells injected into the tibiae, which was accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation and EGR1 expression. These results shed light on a novel mechanism through which PCa cells educate OCys to promote progression of PCa bone metastasis. They also suggest that targeting of GDF15-based and EGR1-based signaling pathways should be further explored for their potential to diminish progression of PCa bone metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2913394589,"Introduction Improving maternal health remains one of the targets of sustainable development goals. A maternal death can occur at any time during pregnancy, but delivery is by far the most dangerous time for both the woman and her baby. Delivery at a health facility can avoid most maternal deaths occurring from preventable obstetric complications. The influence of both individual and community factors is critical to the use of health facility delivery services. In this study, we aim to examine the role of individual and community factors associated with health facility-based delivery in Bangladesh. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from the Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey. The sample size constitutes of 28,032 women who had delivered within five years preceding the survey. We fitted logistic random effects regression models with the community as a random effect to assess the influence of individual and community level factors on use of health facility delivery services. Results Our study observed substantial amount of variation at the community level. About 28.6% of the total variance in health facility delivery could be attributed to the differences across the community. At community level, place of residence (AOR 1.48; 95% CI 1.35–1.64), concentration of poverty (AOR 1.15; 95% CI 1.03–1.28), concentration of use of antenatal care services (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00–1.23), concentration of media exposure (AOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07–1.34) and concentration of educated women (AOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.23) were found to be significantly associated with health facility delivery. At individual level, maternal age, educational status of the mother, religion, parity, delivery complications, individual exposure to media, individual access to antenatal care and household socioeconomic status showed strong association with health facility-based delivery. Conclusion Our results strongly suggest factors at both Individual, and community level influenced the use of health facility delivery services in Bangladesh. Thus, any future strategy to improve maternal health in Bangladesh must consider community contexts and undertake multi-sectorial approach to address barriers at different levels. At the individual level the programs should also focus on the need of the young mother, the multiparous the less educated and women in the poorest households."
https://openalex.org/W2895914618,"A bilingual advantage in a form of a better performance of bilinguals in tasks tapping into executive function abilities has been reported repeatedly in the literature. However, recent research defends that this advantage does not stem from bilingualism, but from uncontrolled factors or imperfectly matched samples. In this study we explored the potential impact of bilingualism on executive functioning abilities by testing large groups of young adult bilinguals and monolinguals in the tasks that were most extensively used when the advantages were reported. Importantly, the recently identified factors that could be disrupting the between groups comparisons were controlled for, and both groups were matched. We found no differences between groups in their performance. Additional bootstrapping analyses indicated that, when the bilingual advantage appeared, it very often co-occurred with unmatched socio-demographic factors. The evidence presented here indicates that the bilingual advantage might indeed be caused by spurious uncontrolled factors rather than bilingualism per se. Secondly, bilingualism has been argued to potentially affect working memory also. Therefore, we tested the same participants in both a forward and a backward version of a visual and an auditory working memory task. We found no differences between groups in either of the forward versions of the tasks, but bilinguals systematically outperformed monolinguals in the backward conditions. The results are analysed and interpreted taking into consideration different perspectives in the domain-specificity of the executive functions and working memory."

Here, R-115, an oncolytic herpes simplex virus retargeted to human erbB-2, fully virulent in its target cells, and armed with murine interleukin-12 was evaluated in a murine model of glioblastoma. We show that a single R-115 injection in established tumors resulted, in about 30% of animals, in the complete eradication of the tumor, otherwise invariably lethal. The treatment also induced a significant improvement in the overall median survival time of mice and a resistance to recurrence from the same neoplasia. Such a high degree of protection was unprecedented; it was not observed before following treatments with the commonly used, mutated/attenuated oncolytic viruses. This is the first study providing the evidence of benefits offered by a fully virulent, retargeted, and armed herpes simplex virus in the treatment of glioblastoma and paves the way for clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W2912087339,"Facial image comparison practitioners compare images of unfamiliar faces and decide whether or not they show the same person. Given the importance of these decisions for national security and criminal investigations, practitioners attend training courses to improve their face identification ability. However, these courses have not been empirically validated so it is unknown if they improve accuracy. Here, we review the content of eleven professional training courses offered to staff at national security, police, intelligence, passport issuance, immigration and border control agencies around the world. All reviewed courses include basic training in facial anatomy and prescribe facial feature (or ‘morphological’) comparison. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of four representative courses by comparing face identification accuracy before and after training in novices (n = 152) and practitioners (n = 236). We find very strong evidence that short (1-hour and half-day) professional training courses do not improve identification accuracy, despite 93% of trainees believing their performance had improved. We find some evidence of improvement in a 3-day training course designed to introduce trainees to the unique feature-by-feature comparison strategy used by facial examiners in forensic settings. However, observed improvements are small, inconsistent across tests, and training did not produce the qualitative changes associated with examiners’ expertise. Future research should test the benefits of longer examination-focussed training courses and incorporate longitudinal approaches to track improvements caused by mentoring and deliberate practice. In the absence of evidence that training is effective, we advise agencies to explore alternative evidence-based strategies for improving the accuracy of face identification decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2950705251,"The mechanisms by which noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) affect central and peripheral neural circuits that subserve pain and autonomic physiology are not clear, and thus remain an area of intense investigation. Effects of nVNS vs sham stimulation on subject responses to five noxious thermal stimuli (applied to left lower extremity), were measured in 30 healthy subjects (n = 15 sham and n = 15 nVNS), with fMRI and physiological galvanic skin response (GSR). With repeated noxious thermal stimuli a group × time analysis showed a significantly (p < .001) decreased response with nVNS in bilateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), left dorsoposterior insular cortex, bilateral paracentral lobule, bilateral medial dorsal thalamus, right anterior cingulate cortex, and right orbitofrontal cortex. A group × time × GSR analysis showed a significantly decreased response in the nVNS group (p < .0005) bilaterally in SI, lower and mid medullary brainstem, and inferior occipital cortex. Finally, nVNS treatment showed decreased activity in pronociceptive brainstem nuclei (e.g. the reticular nucleus and rostral ventromedial medulla) and key autonomic integration nuclei (e.g. the rostroventrolateral medulla, nucleus ambiguous, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve). In aggregate, noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation reduced the physiological response to noxious thermal stimuli and impacted neural circuits important for pain processing and autonomic output."

Religiosity influences, mitigates and provides resilience against engaging in risky behaviours among young people but few South African studies have explored potential associations between religiosity, AOD use and risky sex. We report the prevalence of religiosity and association between religiosity and AOD use and risky sexual behaviours among learners in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Methods Between May and August 2011, a cross sectional survey was conducted among 20 227 learners from 240 public schools randomly selected through a stratified multistage sampling design to determine the prevalence of AOD use and sexual risk behaviours. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the association between religiosity, AOD use and risky sexual behaviours. Results The learners were aged 10–23 years. Almost three quarters (74%) of learners reported high religiosity (defined as attending religious services or activities at least 1–2 times a month). More female than male learners had high religiosity. The prevalence of past 30 day reported alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use was 23%, 19% and 8% respectively. Compared to learners with low religiosity, those with high religiosity were less likely to engage in AOD use: specifically alcohol use, (AOR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.76–0.97), tobacco use (AOR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.67–0.87), cannabis use (AOR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.48–0.68) in the last 30 days. They were also less likely to engage in risky sexual behaviours (AOR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.81–0.99). Conclusion Religiosity was associated with lower odds of reported AOD use and risky sexual behaviours among learners in the Western Cape. This calls for further exploration on how to incorporate religiosity into AOD use and risky sexual behaviour interventions."

https://openalex.org/W2913930724,"Plastids are organelles responsible for essential aspects of plant development, including carbon fixation and synthesis of several secondary metabolites. Chloroplast differentiation and activity are highly regulated by light, and several proteins involved in these processes have been characterised. Such is the case of the GOLDEN 2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors, which induces the expression of genes related to chloroplast differentiation and photosynthesis. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome harbours two copies of this gene, SlGLK1 and SlGLK2, each with distinct expression patterns. While the former predominates in leaves, the latter is mainly expressed in fruits, precisely at the pedicel region. During tomato domestication, the selection of fruits with uniform ripening fixed the mutation Slglk2, nowadays present in most cultivated varieties, what penalised fruit metabolic composition. In this study, we investigated how SlGLK2 is regulated by light, auxin and cytokinin and determined the effect of SlGLK2 on tocopherol (vitamin E) and sugar metabolism, which are components of the fruit nutritional and industrial quality. To achieve this, transcriptional profiling and biochemical analysis were performed throughout fruit development and ripening from SlGLK2, Slglk2, SlGLK2-overexpressing genotypes, as well as from phytochrome and hormonal deficient mutants. The results revealed that SlGLK2 expression is regulated by phytochrome-mediated light perception, yet this gene can induce chloroplast differentiation even in a phytochrome-independent manner. Moreover, auxin was found to be a negative regulator of SlGLK2 expression, while SlGLK2 enhances cytokinin responsiveness. Additionally, SlGLK2 enhanced chlorophyll content in immature green fruits, leading to an increment in tocopherol level in ripe fruits. Finally, SlGLK2 overexpression resulted in higher total soluble solid content, possibly by the regulation of sugar metabolism enzyme-encoding genes. The results obtained here shed light on the regulatory network that interconnects SlGLK2, phytohormones and light signal, promoting the plastidial activity and consequently, influencing the quality of tomato fruit."

Its amyloid aggregates are the major component of Lewy bodies, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). AS is particularly exposed to oxidation of its methionine residues, both in vivo and in vitro. Oxidative stress has been implicated in PD and oxidized α-synuclein has been shown to assemble into soluble, toxic oligomers, rather than amyloid fibrils. However, the structural effects of methionine oxidation are still poorly understood. In this work, oxidized AS was obtained by prolonged incubations with dopamine (DA) or epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), two inhibitors of AS aggregation, indicating that EGCG promotes the same final oxidation product as DA. The conformational transitions of the oxidized and non-oxidized protein were monitored by complementary biophysical techniques, including MS, ion mobility (IM), CD, and FTIR spectroscopy assays. Although the two variants displayed very similar structures under conditions that stabilize highly disordered or highly ordered states, differences emerged in the intermediate points of transitions induced by organic solvents, such as trifluoroethanol (TFE) and methanol (MeOH), indicating a lower propensity of the oxidized protein for forming either α- or β-type secondary structures. Furthermore, oxidized AS displayed restricted secondary-structure transitions in response to dehydration and slightly amplified tertiary-structure transitions induced by ligand binding. This difference in susceptibility to induced folding could explain the loss of fibrillation potential observed for oxidized AS.

Protein oxidation on methionine residues to give sulfoxide is thought to affect protein function mainly via structural effects (5Schildknecht S. Gerding H.R. Karreman C. Drescher M. Lashuel H.A. Outeiro T.F. Di Monte D.A. Leist M. Oxidative and nitrative α-synuclein modifications and proteostatic stress: implications for disease mechanisms and interventions in synucleinopathies.J. Neurochem. 2013; 125 (23452040): 491-51110.1111/jnc.12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The modification causes, indeed, a remarkable loss of hydrophobic character of the methionine side chain, which could affect secondary and tertiary structure (7Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. Methionine oxidation inhibits fibrillation of human α-synuclein in vitro.FEBS Lett. 2002; 517 (12062445): 239-24410.1016/S0014-5793(02)02638-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, methionine oxidation results in a lower intrinsic propensity for helical structures as shown on poly-Met polymers (15Rodriguez A.R. Kramer J.R. Deming T.J. Enzyme-triggered cargo release from methionine sulfoxide containing copolypeptide vesicles.Biomacromolecules. 2013; 14 (23980867): 3610-361410.1021/bm400971pCrossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To interpret the biological responses to AS oxidation, it is important to understand the effect of methionine oxidation per se on AS conformational transitions, dissecting it from other, frequently associated processes like protein–protein and protein–membranes interactions or other AS covalent modifications. Based on CD spectroscopy, fully oxidized (oMet4) AS appears to be slightly more disordered than non-oxidized (oMet0) AS, with very minor losses of intrinsically formed helical segments (7Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. Methionine oxidation inhibits fibrillation of human α-synuclein in vitro.FEBS Lett. 2002; 517 (12062445): 239-24410.1016/S0014-5793(02)02638-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the spectra are almost superimposable and imprinted to a general character of highly disordered protein (7Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. Methionine oxidation inhibits fibrillation of human α-synuclein in vitro.FEBS Lett. 2002; 517 (12062445): 239-24410.1016/S0014-5793(02)02638-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Binolfi A.

On the other hand, both proteins are highly helical in the presence of a strong molar excess of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with oMet4 AS displaying a similar helical content as oMet0 AS (17De Franceschi G.D.

Nevertheless, a conceivable hypothesis is that oxidation impacts on AS propensity to acquire ordered secondary/tertiary structure (7Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. Methionine oxidation inhibits fibrillation of human α-synuclein in vitro.FEBS Lett. 2002; 517 (12062445): 239-24410.1016/S0014-5793(02)02638-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could be at the basis of different propensities of reduced and oxidized AS to populate the amyloidogenic conformer that triggers fibrillation. An indication of different conformational transitions of the two protein variants derives from NMR analysis of the helicity induced by N-terminal acetylation in the first 10 residues of the protein. The comparison of oMet4 and oMet0 AS indicates that oxidation inhibits the acetylation-induced conformational transition in the N-terminal residues (18Maltsev A.S. Chen J. Levine R.L. Bax A. Site-specific interaction between α-synuclein and membranes probed by NMR-observed methionine oxidation rates.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135 (23398174): 2943-294610.1021/ja312415qCrossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This work focuses on the characterization of AS oxidation products to test the hypothesis that methionine oxidation affects AS conformational transitions, despite the similar secondary structure displayed by oMet4 and oMet0 AS in highly disordered or highly helical states. Oxidation is monitored upon prolonged incubations with DA or EGCG. Both ligands inhibit AS fibrillation and induce formation of oligomers (10Leong S.L. Pham C.L. Galatis D. Fodero-Tavoletti M.T.

Biol. 2008; 15 (18511942): 558-56610.1038/nsmb.1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The two ligands bind AS with distinct conformational selectivity, forming noncovalent and non-oxidized complexes upon short incubation time (20Konijnenberg A. Ranica S. Narkiewicz J. Legname G.

New insights into the mechanisms of polyphenols beyond antioxidant properties: lessons from the green tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin 3-gallate.Redox Biol. 2014; 2 (24494192): 187-19510.1016/j.redox.2013.12.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), after a long incubation time. Here, AS oxidation is monitored by electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS) and the monomeric, soluble, fully oxidized product is analyzed by CD, FTIR spectroscopy, and native MS, under conditions that promote either α- or β-type secondary structure. AS susceptibility to covalent modifications in the presence of DA or EGCG has been investigated by incubating the protein with either ligand at 37 °C under mild agitation. 2 mm DA and 200 μm EGCG were used as previously characterized conditions enabling effective detection of AS-ligand noncovalent complexes (20Konijnenberg A. Ranica S. Narkiewicz J. Legname G. Grandori R. Sobott F. Natalello A. Opposite structural effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate and dopamine binding to α-synuclein.Anal. Chem. 2016; 88 (27467405): 8468-847510.1021/acs.analchem.6b00731Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken at different time points, purified from salts and free ligand, and analyzed by ESI-MS under denaturing conditions for intact protein detection. The data reported in Fig. 1, A–C, show that, under prolonged incubation, both ligands induce stepwise mass shifts of 16 Da in AS peaks, corresponding to progressive oxidation states. Up to 4 oxidations per AS molecule can be detected, which correspond to the number of methionine residues in the molecule. The species distributions evolve toward an almost homogeneous, 4-oxidized population after 72 h, with still ∼10% of 3-oxidized protein detectable in the presence of DA and ∼20% in the presence of EGCG (Fig. 1, D and E). No covalent adducts with the ligands are detectable under these conditions. These results indicate that both ligands can induce AS oxidation. To map the modification sites and describe their individual kinetics, chymotryptic peptides from the same samples as above were analyzed by ESI-MS (Fig. 2). Three oxidized methionine residues (positions 1, 116, and 127, Table S1) were identified in samples incubated with either DA or EGCG by ESI-MS/MS, indicating that the modification corresponds to sulfoxidation (Fig. S1). Likely, the fourth modification involves the peptide containing Met-5, which could not be identified in either oxidized or non-oxidized forms and is presumably lost during the purification procedure, due to its very small size. Quantification of the oxidation extent was obtained by the peak–height ratios between the oxidized and non-oxidized forms of each detected peptide (Fig. 2, A–C, and Fig. S2). To retrieve direct evidence on the oxidation state of all four methionine residues, tryptic digests were analyzed as well (Fig. 2). This procedure generates an N-terminal peptide containing Met-1 and Met-5 and a C-terminal peptide containing Met-116 and Met-127. The extent of oxidation at positions 1 and 5 could be assessed from the MS/MS data, as the ratio between peptide spectrum matches of the oxidized and non-oxidized form of the N-terminal peptide (Fig. 2, Figs. S3–S5, and Table S1). The use of the MS/MS spectral counts method in place of the MS precursor–ion peak–height made it possible to exactly calculate the contribution of single oxidation events on either Met-1 or Met-5, thus enabling measurement of the oxidation rate of individual methionine residues (Fig. S5). This would not be possible using peak–height or peak–area calculations on the precursor ion, because the latter has the same m/z value whether the single oxidation concerns Met-1 or Met-5. The C-terminal tryptic peptide, instead, is too large to yield high-quality MS/MS spectra by collision-induced dissociation, hindering accurate sequence assignment and quantification of the oxidation levels. Thus, the extent of oxidation at positions 116 and 127 was better calculated from MS data of the respective chymotryptic peptides (Fig. 2, A–C, Fig. S2). The list of the identified peptides by tryptic and chymotryptic digestions is reported in Table S1. The resulting, position-specific oxidation profiles are reported in Fig. 2, D and E. It can be noticed that oxidation kinetics at positions 1, 5, and 116 are quite similar and reach a plateau around 40 h incubation under the conditions employed here, with either ligand. Oxidation of Met-127, instead, is slightly but systematically delayed relative to the others. It is interesting to note that this residue belongs to the 125YEMPS129 motif, which has been implicated in long-range interactions with the central NAC (non-amyloid-β component) region and interaction with DA and its oxidation products (22Coskuner O.

These local structural features are likely at the basis of the different oxidation kinetics of the Met-127 residue. The conformational response of oMet0 and oMet4 AS to organic solvents has been studied by far-UV CD. Under non-denaturing conditions, the two species display a typical spectra of intrinsically disordered proteins, characterized by a large amount of random coil (minimum at 200 nm), with a small α-helical component (shoulder at 222 nm) (7Uversky V.N. Yamin G. Souillac P.O. Goers J. Glaser C.B. Fink A.L. Methionine oxidation inhibits fibrillation of human α-synuclein in vitro.FEBS Lett. 2002; 517 (12062445): 239-24410.1016/S0014-5793(02)02638-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The addition of either TFE (Fig. 3, B and C) or MeOH (Fig. 3, E and F) induces, respectively, the acquisition of α- or β-type secondary structures by oMet0, as previously described (27Natalello A. Benetti F. Doglia S.M. Legname G. Grandori R. Compact conformations of α-synuclein induced by alcohols and copper.Proteins. 2011; 79 (21120859): 611-62110.1002/prot.22909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, oMet4 AS displays a lower propensity to form ordered secondary structure relative to oMet0 AS, with higher concentrations of organic solvent being required to observe similar effects. Moreover, the final secondary structure displayed by the two proteins at high solvent concentrations (15% TFE and 40% MeOH), which correspond to the post-transition spectra of oMet0 AS (27Natalello A. Benetti F. Doglia S.M. Legname G. Grandori R. Compact conformations of α-synuclein induced by alcohols and copper.Proteins. 2011; 79 (21120859): 611-62110.1002/prot.22909Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), are not identical. In both cases, oMet4 AS shows a lower content of ordered secondary structure, particularly in the case of methanol-induced β-strands, as indicated by the lower intensity of the signal at 215 nm. AS incubation in the presence of DA is known to induce formation of soluble, SDS-resistant oligomers. SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that higher-order species are detectable, particularly upon EGCG treatment. Their amount in the samples used here for CD titrations (Fig. 3D) is below 15%, as assessed from densitometry analysis (data not shown). The absence of bands in the pellet lanes of the gel rules out the presence of aggregates that become soluble in SDS and the comparable intensity of monomeric AS suggests that no significant amount of material is lost in the pellet of the final sample clarification after SDS solubilization. Some faint bands (∼8%) can be detected at slightly lower molecular weight, likely due to some proteolytic degradation. In conclusion, the observed structural features can be ascribed to soluble, monomeric AS, which is the largely predominant species in the analyzed samples. Dynamic equilibrium with SDS-sensitive oligomeric species cannot be ruled out, although it has not been described before, for AS under similar conditions. Secondary structure of oMet0 and oMet4 AS has been analyzed also by FTIR spectroscopy. The absorption and second-derivative spectra of AS samples, measured in the form of protein films, are reported in Fig. 4, A and B, for the Amide I band, which is mainly due to the stretching vibration of the peptide bond (28Barth A.

The main spectral component around 1657 cm−1 can be assigned to random coil with possible contribution of α-helical structures. Two additional peaks are evident around 1696 and 1627 cm−1. In agreement with a previous study, these peaks can be assigned to β-sheet structures induced by solvent evaporation and protein–protein interactions in the film (29Vitali M. Rigamonti V.

The oMet4 protein displays a lower intensity of such component (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating a lower content of ordered β-structures compared with oMet0 AS. The secondary structure of oMet0 and oMet4 AS has also been studied here by conventional FTIR measurements of the proteins in D2O solution (30Ami D. Ricagno S. Bolognesi M. Bellotti V. Doglia S.M.

Recent studies have revealed that autophagy can be induced not only by nitrogen starvation but also by many other stimuli. However, questions persist regarding the types of conditions that induce autophagy, as well as the particular kinds of autophagy that are induced under these specific conditions. In experimental studies, abrupt nutrient changes are often used to induce autophagy. In this study, we investigated autophagy induction in batch culture on low-glucose medium, in which growth of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells is clearly reflected exclusively by carbon source state. In this medium, cells pass sequentially through three stages: glucose-utilizing, ethanol-utilizing, and ethanol-depleted phases. Using GFP cleavage assay by immunoblotting methods, fluorescence microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy ultrastructural analysis, we found that bulk autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum-phagy are induced starting at the ethanol-utilizing phase, and bulk autophagy is activated to a greater extent in the ethanol-depleted phase. Furthermore, we found that mitophagy is induced by ethanol depletion. Microautophagy occurred after glucose depletion and involved incorporation of cytosolic components and lipid droplets into the vacuolar lumen. Moreover, we observed that autophagy-deficient cells grow more slowly in the ethanol-utilizing phase and exhibit a delay in growth resumption when they are shifted to fresh medium from the ethanol-depleted phase. Our findings suggest that distinct types of autophagy are induced in yeast cells undergoing gradual changes in carbon source availability.

Our findings suggest that distinct types of autophagy are induced in yeast cells undergoing gradual changes in carbon source availability. Autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic intracellular degradation system by which cytoplasmic components are delivered to the vacuolar (lysosomal) lumen and degraded by the vacuolar hydrolytic enzymes. During autophagy, the autophagosome, a key double-membrane structure, encloses various cellular components, including cytosolic proteins and organelles. Subsequently, the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vacuolar membrane, leading to release of the inner spherical structure, called the autophagic body, into the vacuolar lumen (1Nakatogawa H. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dynamics and diversity in autophagy mechanisms: lessons from yeast.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 (19491929): 458-46710.1038/nrm2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Finally, the autophagic body disintegrates, and its contents are degraded by a variety of hydrolases. Although it was initially thought that autophagy exclusively entailed bulk engulfment of the cytoplasm, many types of autophagy that selectively degrade targets have been discovered (2Gatica D. Lahiri V. Klionsky D.J. Cargo recognition and degradation by selective autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 (29476151): 233-24210.1038/s41556-018-0037-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In addition, it is widely recognized that autophagy is involved in a variety of physiological processes. The types of autophagy described above are categorized as macroautophagy. Two other types of autophagy have been described: microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (3Mizushima N. Komatsu M. Autophagy: renovation of cells and tissues.Cell. 2011; 147 (22078875): 728-74110.1016/j.cell.2011.10.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3920) Google Scholar). In microautophagy, substrates are directly enwrapped by the vacuolar membrane and delivered to the vacuolar lumen (4Oku M. Sakai Y. Three distinct types of microautophagy based on membrane dynamics and molecular machineries.Bioessays. 2018; 40 (29708272)e1800008Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In chaperone-mediated autophagy, which has been characterized in higher eukaryotes, substrates for degradation directly translocate across the lysosomal membrane. Of these three types of autophagy, macroautophagy has been studied most extensively; accordingly, hereafter we will mostly refer to macroautophagy as autophagy. Over the past 3 decades, a number of ATG genes, which play important roles on autophagy, have been identified, and the functions and structures of their protein products have been studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Nakatogawa H. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Dynamics and diversity in autophagy mechanisms: lessons from yeast.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Fifteen Atg proteins, Atg1–10, Atg12–14, Atg16, and Atg18, play essential roles in autophagy, and these proteins are referred to as the core machinery for membrane formation. In starvation-induced autophagy, three Atg proteins, Atg17, Atg29, and Atg31, are additionally required. Most of the components of the core machinery are assembled at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) 2The abbreviations used are: PASpre-autophagosomal structureBODIPY4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indaceneERendoplasmic reticulumETCelectron transport chainFCCPcarbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneLDlipid dropletROSreactive oxygen speciesTCAtricarboxylic acid. in close proximity to the vacuole (6Suzuki K.

Although we have learned a great deal about the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, several questions remain regarding the effects of autophagy on intracellular environments. In general, autophagy plays crucial roles in ensuring the supply of amino acids under nitrogen starvation (17Onodera J. Ohsumi Y. Autophagy is required for maintenance of amino acid levels and protein synthesis under nitrogen starvation.J. Biol.

However, many kinds of stimuli and starvation conditions induce autophagy (18Horie T. Kawamata T. Matsunami M. Ohsumi Y.

To elucidate the physiological roles of autophagy, it is necessary to address a fundamental issue regarding autophagy: what kinds of conditions induce which kinds of autophagy? pre-autophagosomal structure 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene endoplasmic reticulum electron transport chain carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone lipid droplet reactive oxygen species tricarboxylic acid. Carbon compounds are used for energy production and as basic building blocks of cells. In eukaryotes, glycolysis in the cytosol and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondria play pivotal roles in energy production (22Frankel D.G. Yeast Intermediary Metabolism. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2011Google Scholar). Glucose is one of the most important carbon compounds because many organisms utilize it as a primary carbon source. In many eukaryotes, glucose is assimilated in the presence of oxygen to produce ATP through glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the ETC. However, in the presence of oxygen the yeast S. cerevisiae exclusively uses glycolysis to obtain ATP from glucose (23Fiechter A. Fuhrmann G.F. Käppeli O. Regulation of glucose metabolism in growing yeast cells.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1981; 22 (7036694): 123-18310.1016/S0065-2911(08)60327-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24van Dijken J.P.

Therefore, if the yeast is cultured in glucose-containing medium, ethanol accumulates in the medium until the glucose is depleted. After glucose depletion, the yeast begins to use ethanol to generate ATP in the mitochondria (25Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Molecular Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor & Francis, Inc., Philadelphia, PA1999Google Scholar). This phenomenon is referred to as the “Crabtree effect” and can be explained by glucose repression, a phenomenon in which the presence of glucose suppresses respiration, the use of alternative carbon sources, and gluconeogenesis (26Kayikci Ö. Nielsen J. Glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Yeast Res. 2015; 15 (26205245)fov06810.1093/femsyr/fov068Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For these reasons, S. cerevisiae cultured in glucose-containing medium undergoes two growth phases (diauxie) separated by a period of growth arrest: during the first phase, when glucose is used, growth is rapid, whereas during the second phase, when ethanol is used, growth is slower. The growth arrest is called the “diauxic shift” (25Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Molecular Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor & Francis, Inc., Philadelphia, PA1999Google Scholar). During the diauxic shift, the mitochondria are developed to produce ATP (27Ohlmeier S. Kastaniotis A.J. Hiltunen J.K. Bergmann U. The yeast mitochondrial proteome, a study of fermentative and respiratory growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (14597615): 3956-397910.1074/jbc.M310160200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Based on these unique features, S. cerevisiae is a good model organism in which to examine biological processes related to carbon source state. In various studies, abrupt nutrient depletion has been used to induce autophagy. However, such drastic changes are not common; rather, more gradual changes are likely to occur in natural environments. Accordingly, investigation of autophagy occurring during continuous nutrient changes may lead to a better understanding of the functions of autophagy in natural habitats. In this study, we found that yeast growth in batch culture on synthetic medium with low-glucose is reflected exclusively by carbon source state. Using this medium, we investigated autophagy induction in each phase. We found that distinct cellular components are degraded via macroautophagy and microautophagy after glucose depletion. In particular, we discovered that mitophagy is induced by ethanol depletion after respiratory growth. Our findings suggest that distinct types of autophagy are induced under gradual changes of carbon source availability in yeast. The yeast S. cerevisiae exhibits diauxie when cultured in glucose-containing medium. Although many reports have described diauxic growth in S. cerevisiae, there is little detailed information about the relationships among cell density, glucose, and ethanol concentration in batch culture. To investigate this issue, we cultured prototrophic WT cells (X2180-1B strain) in standard SD medium containing 0.5% casamino acids (SDCA medium) and measured those parameters in detail (Fig. 1A). The cells grew logarithmically while utilizing glucose and producing ethanol. When glucose was exhausted, cell proliferation was temporarily arrested, and at the same time, ethanol concentration reached a maximum. After a while, the cells restarted their growth, causing the ethanol concentration to gradually decrease. Ethanol-utilizing growth did not follow a logarithmic pattern, as reported previously (18Horie T. Kawamata T. Matsunami M. Ohsumi Y. Recycling of iron via autophagy is critical for the transition from glycolytic to respiratory growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28320861): 8533-854310.1074/jbc.M116.762963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Stahl G. Salem S.N. Chen L. Zhao B. Farabaugh P.J.

Cell. 2004; 3 (15075263): 331-33810.1128/EC.3.2.331-338.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To our surprise, ethanol was not depleted even when ethanol-utilizing growth was almost arrested. This result suggests that growth arrest is not caused by depletion of ethanol in SDCA medium, but instead by other factors. There are at least two approaches to making yeast growth directly reflect carbon source availability: increasing the concentrations of other nutrients or decreasing glucose concentration. As shown in Fig. 1A, the OD600 reached 8–9 by the time that glucose was depleted in SDCA medium. We considered that the effects of high cell density would interfere with yeast growth in the ethanol-utilizing phase even if we increased the levels of other nutrients in SDCA medium. To avoid those effects, we lowered the glucose concentration. When we cultured WT cells in synthetic medium containing 0.2% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids (SD0.2CA medium), the cells temporarily stopped their growth at an OD600 of ∼1.2 (Fig. 1B). After the growth arrest, the cells restarted their growth by using ethanol. In contrast to the growth pattern in SDCA medium, ethanol-utilizing growth was logarithmic in SD0.2CA medium (Fig. 1D). During growth, the oxygen consumption rate was higher in SD0.2CA medium than in SDCA medium in the absence or presence of FCCP, an uncoupling reagent, suggesting that respiratory potential is higher in SD0.2CA medium than in SDCA medium (Fig. 1C). Importantly, arrest of ethanol-utilizing growth in SD0.2CA medium occurred at the time when ethanol was exhausted. Furthermore, we confirmed that the yeast did not show significant growth on SCA medium, which did not contain glucose, in our experimental duration (Fig. S1A). Because OD600 exceeds 10 in SDCA medium, we considered that nitrogen sources are enough for yeast growth in SD0.2CA medium. As expected, ammonium was not depleted during cultivation, and extra ammonium did not improve the yeast growth (Fig. S1, B and C). Therefore, we concluded that SD0.2CA is a suitable model medium in which yeast growth is reflected exclusively by carbon source availability. In SD0.2CA medium, three stages of yeast growth became obvious: glucose-utilizing, ethanol-utilizing, and ethanol-depleted (stationary) phases (Fig. 1E). Hereafter, we primarily used SD0.2CA medium to analyze the effects of carbon source availability. We examined induction of autophagy during growth in low-glucose medium using GFP-Atg8–expressing cells. When autophagy is induced, GFP-Atg8 is delivered to the vacuolar lumen via the autophagic pathway; the GFP moiety is released from GFP-Atg8 by vacuolar proteases, and free GFP is detected by immunoblot analysis (29Cheong H. Klionsky D.J. Biochemical methods to monitor autophagy-related processes in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 451 (19185709): 1-2610.1016/S0076-6879(08)03201-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Endogenous expression of GFP-Atg8 did not alter the growth features observed in WT cells cultured in low-glucose medium (data not shown). We found that cleavage of GFP-Atg8 occurred in the ethanol-utilizing and ethanol-depleted phases but not in the glucose-utilizing phase (Fig. 2A). The cleavage depended strongly on ATG2 (Fig. 2A). In addition, we confirmed that GFP-Atg8 was delivered to the vacuolar lumen in WT but not atg2Δ cells (Fig. 2B). In a deletion mutant of ATG15, which encodes a putative lipase responsible for disintegration of autophagic bodies (30Teter S.A. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Fischer A.M. Klionsky D.J. Degradation of lipid vesicles in the yeast vacuole requires function of Cvt17, a putative lipase.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (11085977): 2083-208710.1074/jbc.C000739200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we observed autophagic bodies moving around randomly (Movie S1). These autophagic bodies were not observed when ATG2 was simultaneously deleted (Movie S1). These results indicate that autophagy is induced after glucose depletion, i.e. in the ethanol-utilizing and ethanol-depleted phases. Moreover, our findings suggest that autophagy is activated to a greater extent in the ethanol-depleted phase than the ethanol-utilizing phase (Fig. 2A). Next, we sought to determine which substrates are degraded during growth in low-glucose medium. We performed the cleavage assay using WT cells expressing Pgk1-GFP (a cytosolic protein), Sec63-GFP (an ER membrane protein), Om45-GFP (a mitochondrial outer membrane protein), Pex11-GFP (a peroxisome membrane protein), or Osw5-GFP (a lipid droplet (LD) protein). Cells were collected from each culture at the indicated time points (Fig. 3A), and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 3, B–F). The cytosol started to be degraded in the ethanol-utilizing phase, and its rate of degradation increased in the ethanol-depleted phase (Fig. 3B). A similar pattern was observed in the ER degradation, although the degradation rate was very low (Fig. 3C). On the contrary, the mitochondria were degraded only in the ethanol-depleted phase (Fig. 3D). In contrast to these organelles, degradation of peroxisomes and LDs was not detected during the experiment period (total cultivation time, 100 h) (Fig. 3, E and F). Rather, the amount of Pex11-GFP increased during the ethanol-utilizing and the ethanol-depleted phases, and Osw5-GFP increased during the ethanol-utilizing phase. We ascertained that Sec63-GFP and Om45-GFP were delivered to the vacuolar lumen (Fig. 3G), suggesting that the ER and mitochondria are degraded in the vacuole. Electron microscopic observation of atg15Δ cells confirmed that the cytosol, ER, and mitochondria were incorporated into autophagic bodies (Fig. 3H). To determine whether autophagy was involved in the degradation of these organelles, we cultured autophagy-defective mutants expressing Pgk1-GFP, Sec63-GFP, or Om45-GFP in SD0.2CA medium, lysed the cells, and performed the cleavage assay on these lysates (Fig. 4). Cytosolic components, ER, and mitochondria were not degraded in cells lacking ATG2, suggesting that these cellular components are degraded by the autophagic pathway. Degradation of the cytosol was highly dependent on ATG17, but not ATG11 (Fig. 4A). A similar pattern was observed for degradation of the ER (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that cytosolic components and the ER are degraded in an Atg17-dependent manner under our experimental condition. Importantly, double-deletion of ATG39 and ATG40 diminished ER degradation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that ER-phagy receptors are required for ER degradation under these conditions. In contrast, degradation of the mitochondria was highly dependent on ATG11 but only partially dependent on ATG17 (Fig. 4C). In addition, mitochondrial degradation was not detected in cells lacking ATG32 (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that mitophagy occurs in the ethanol-depleted phase. In summary, bulk autophagy and ER-phagy were induced after glucose depletion, whereas mitophagy was induced in the ethanol-depleted phase. The possible roles of Atg17 and Atg11 are discussed below (see “Discussion”). Our findings suggest that autophagy is activated to a greater extent in the ethanol-depleted phase in SD0.2CA medium (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, the degradation rates of cytosolic components and the ER were higher in the ethanol-depleted phase than in the ethanol-utilizing phase (Fig. 3, B and C). The mitochondria were targets of autophagy during the ethanol-depleted phase (Fig. 3D). However, mitochondrial degradation was not observed during prolonged cultivation in SDCA medium (Fig. 5), suggesting that the mitochondrial degradation is induced not by long-term cultivation, but rather by ethanol depletion. It has been reported so far that mitophagy can be induced by prolonged cultivation on a nonfermentable carbon source or by shifting from a nonfermentable carbon source to nitrogen starvation medium containing glucose (12Okamoto K. Kondo-Okamoto N. Ohsumi Y. Mitochondria-anchored receptor Atg32 mediates degradation of mitochondria via selective autophagy.Dev.

Mechanisms and physiological roles of mitophagy in yeast.Mol. Cells. 2018; 41 (29370687): 35-44PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to those conditions, we propose that mitophagy is also induced by ethanol depletion after ethanol-utilizing growth. The prototrophic WT yeast cells can synthesize the amino acids required for growth by themselves. However, as described above, we used medium containing casamino acids, acid hydrolysate of casein, to support the yeast growth. To evaluate effects of the presence of amino acids, we used low-glucose medium without casamino acids (SD0.2 medium). Growth feature in SD0.2 medium was similar to that in SD0.2CA medium; yeast growth is correlated with concentration of glucose and ethanol (Fig. 6A). However, there were two different aspects between those two conditions. In SD0.2 medium, the yeast growth was slower (Figs. 1B and 6A), and biomass was accumulated less in the ethanol-depleted phase (Fig. 6B), indicating that amino acids are used in the prototrophic yeast. Using SD0.2 medium, in which ammonium was not depleted during cultivation (Fig. 6C), we repeated GFP cleavage assay of GFP-Atg8, Pgk1-GFP, Sec63-GFP, and Om45-GFP (Fig. 6, D–G). Regarding time points when autophagy is induced, results similar to SD0.2CA medium were obtained; bulk autophagy and ER-phagy were induced after glucose depletion, and mitophagy was induced in ethanol-depleted phase. We also ascertained that the degradation was dependent on ATG2. However, we noticed that some different points were observed in the ethanol-depleted phase between SD0.2CA medium and SD0.2 medium. In SD0.2CA medium, the longer the ethanol-depleted phase was, the greater the amount of free GFP accumulated (Fig. 3, B–D). In contrast, in SD0.2 medium, such accumulation was not observed (Fig. 6, E–G). In particular, ER degradation was reduced in the ethanol-depleted phase (Fig. 6F). It should be noted that the GFP cleavage assay only gives an indication of the amount of free GFP moieties in vacuoles at a certain time, which is determined by both influx from autophagy and degradation by vacuolar hydrolytic enzymes. Therefore, it cannot be reliably used as a quantitative measure to analyze or discuss data obtained under different conditions. Nevertheless, the results described above raised a possibility that the presence of amino acids may sustain autophagy activity during the ethanol-depleted phase. As described above, it is considered that cleavage of GFP-Atg8 is not observed in autophagy-defective mutants. However, we detected a significant amount of free GFP, even in atg2Δ cells expressing GFP-Atg8, in both the ethanol-utilizing and ethanol-depleted phases (Fig. 2A). Hence, we investigated how cleavage of GFP-Atg8 occurred in atg2Δ cells. Initially, we sought to determine whether the GFP-Atg8 cleavage occurred in deletion mutants of the other core ATG genes in the ethanol-depleted phase (Fig. 7A). GFP-Atg8 cleavage was hardly detected in single deletion mutants of ATG3, ATG4, ATG5, ATG7, ATG10, ATG12, and ATG16, which encode components of the ATG conjugation system. In contrast, free GFP was clearly detected in single deletion mutants of ATG1, ATG2, ATG9, ATG13, ATG14, and ATG18. Because all components of the ATG conjugation system are required for the GFP-Atg8 cleavage, this result suggests that lipidation of Atg8 is essential for its delivery to the vacuolar lumen. Therefore, assuming that"

Malate and pyruvate were diverted to produce aspartate, thereby potentially explaining the failure to accumulate lactate. We conclude that PDH-KO cells maintain proliferative capacity by utilizing glutamine to supply high rates of AcCoA-independent flux through the bottom portion of the TCA cycle while accumulating pyruvate and aspartate that rescue their redox defects.

During quiescence, energy in the form of ATP is produced largely by the mitochondrial TCA cycle coupled with the electron transport chain (ETC) and Oxphos. The entry-level substrate for the TCA cycle, namely acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), is derived anaerobically from the stepwise conversion of glucose to pyruvate (glycolysis). Following transport into the mitochondria, pyruvate is converted to AcCoA by the multisubunit enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (PDC) in a three-step coordinated reaction that also yields CO2 and a molecule of NADH for subsequent use as an electron donor (4Patel K.P.

PDC is the critical link between glycolysis and the TCA cycle as evidenced by its complex regulation and, most tellingly, by individuals with genetic deficiencies in one of its component activities. PDC deficiency, the severity of which is determined by the underlying PDC mutations, presents in early childhood and is marked by variable degrees of metabolic acidosis resulting from the conversion of accumulated pyruvate to lactate (4Patel K.P.

Importantly, no cases of complete PDC deficiency have ever been identified, strongly suggesting that some residual enzyme activity is necessary for survival. This is supported by the finding that total body inactivation of the gene encoding the α subunit of PDH (pdha1) in mice is embryonic lethal (7Johnson M.T. Mahmood S. Hyatt S.L. Yang H.S. Soloway P.D.

Recently, we showed that total inactivation of the pdha1 gene in hepatocytes does not affect their long-term regenerative capacity. Additionally, the growth of malignant hepatoblastomas (HBs) in pdha1−/− (KO) livers is only modestly impaired, although it is accompanied by significant metabolic acidosis as a result of excess lactate accumulation (9Jackson L.E.

These results demonstrated unequivocally and somewhat surprisingly that even under the most demanding proliferative stresses, communication between glycolysis and the TCA cycle can be severed while only minimally affecting normal and transformed cell replication. The above findings raised several important questions that are now explored here. Among these are whether the liver is unique in its ability to sustain high levels of normal and neoplastic proliferation in PDC’s absence. Others include how cells metabolically adapt following PDC loss and whether and to what extent they accumulate glycolytic intermediates. Answers to such questions could explain how cells normally achieve metabolic re-equilibration to accommodate nutritional and neoplastic challenges. We address these and additional questions by exploring the consequences of pdha1 inactivation in rat fibroblasts in which the c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein, fused to the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor, can be conditionally activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) (11Eilers M.

We demonstrate that these so-called Rat1a–MycER cells undergo significant metabolic re-programming that compensates for the loss of PDC activity, restores normal levels of AcCoA, and allows them to proliferate as well as their wildtype (WT) counterparts. Short-term MycER activation also results in distinct metabolic responses in the two cell types. Together, these findings point to major similarities and differences in the ways that hepatocytes and fibroblasts cope with the loss of PDH and emphasize the flexibility that can be marshaled in response to what should be a devastating metabolic deficit. A CRISPR-Cas9–based approach was used to target the pdha1 gene in Rat1a–MycER fibroblasts (11Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M.

Over half of the randomly selected, stably transfected clones showed absence of PDHα1 protein expression and are hereafter referred to as “knockout” (KO) cells (Fig. S1A). To minimize clonal variability, we combined five randomly selected clones from each group for all subsequent studies.

In keeping with this overall theme, the short-term (8 h) activation of MycER in WT cells was accompanied by an ∼2.5-fold up-regulation of PDC activity that correlated with the loss of PDHα1 phosphorylation (Fig. S1, B and C). However, only a modest increase in PDP2 and no discernible change in PDK1 were observed (Fig. S1C). Because PDK1 and PDP2 are themselves regulated by metabolites such as ATP, ADP, NADH, and AcCoA (6Sugden M.C. Holness M.J. Recent advances in mechanisms regulating glucose oxidation at the level of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by PDKs.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

PDH has been reported to localize to the nucleus under some conditions, where its regional generation of AcCoA may allow for the selective acetylation of histone and gene expression changes (16Sutendra G. Kinnaird A. Dromparis P. Paulin R. Stenson T.H. Haromy A. Hashimoto K. Zhang N. Flaim E. Michelakis E.D. A nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is important for the generation of acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation.Cell. 2014; 158 (24995980): 84-9710.1016/j.cell.2014.04.046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although we also found a significant amount of nuclear PDH in WT cells, neither its level nor its phosphorylation were significantly altered by MycER activation (Fig. S1D). WT and KO cells grew at identical rates (Fig. S1E), although the latter cells were ∼15% smaller (Fig. S1F). This may reflect a compensatory change by which cells conserve energy through the reduction of biomass (see below) (17Sarin M. Wang Y. Zhang F. Rothermund K. Zhang Y. Lu J. Sims-Lucas S. Beer-Stolz D. Van Houten B.E. Vockley J. Goetzman E.S. Graves J.A. Prochownik E.V.

The rates of glucose uptake by WT and KO cells were compared using the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG as a surrogate. KO cells showed significantly higher time-dependent rates of 2-NBDG uptake than WT cells but no further increase in response to MycER activation (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, WT cells increased 2-NBDG uptake by ∼20% following MycER activation (Fig. 1B). Mice bearing KO HB tumors manifest high levels of lactate production and metabolic acidosis that contribute to their eventual demise (9Jackson L.E. Kulkarni S. Wang H. Lu J. Dolezal J.M. Bharathi S.S. Ranganathan S. Patel M.S. Deshpande R. Alencastro F. Wendell S.G. Goetzman E.S. Duncan A.W. Prochownik E.V. Genetic dissociation of glycolysis and the TCA cycle affects neither normal nor neoplastic proliferation.Cancer Res. 2017; 77 (28883002): 5795-580710.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This undoubtedly reflects the conversion of accumulated pyruvate to lactate rather than AcCoA. However, initial attempts to demonstrate higher lactate production by logarithmically growing KO fibroblasts were unsuccessful. This could have been the result of the diversion of excess KO cell pyruvate into other pathways and/or intracellular conditions that inhibit lactate production or its consumption (18Coulson C.J. Rabin B.R. Inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by high concentrations of pyruvate: the nature and removal of the inhibitor.FEBS Lett. 1969; 3 (11947042): 333-33710.1016/0014-5793(69)80171-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize these contributions, we grew both cell lines to confluency, progressively reduced the serum concentration to further inhibit cell proliferation, and measured lactate levels in culture supernatants 3 days later. Under these conditions, KO cells produced significantly more lactate than WT cells that correlated inversely with serum concentrations (Fig. 1C). Thus, KO cells do excrete more lactate but only during times of proliferative arrest and cellular stress. In contrast, KO cells had lower oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) (Fig. 1D), implying that they were less able to maintain a mitochondrial proton gradient. Consistent with this idea, KO cells contained lower levels of NAD+ and NADH (Fig. 1E), suggesting that their attenuated proton gradient was due to a deficiency of reducing equivalents. Unlike WT cells, which rapidly increased NADH levels in response to MycER activation, KO cells showed no such response, although both cell types decreased their NAD+/NADH ratios in response to Myc activation (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these findings suggested that the increased NADH content of WT cells in response to MycER activation originated with the PDH reaction, which generates NADH as a by-product of the intra-mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate to AcCoA. We performed additional respirometry studies using various substrates and inhibitors. At baseline, intact KO cells again showed lower OCRs than their WT counterparts, thus underscoring a pre-existing deficit in one or more TCA cycle substrates and/or a greater reliance on glycolysis as an energy source (Fig. S2A). Following digitonin permeabilization, the KO cell response to malate was also markedly diminished (Fig. S2B). In keeping with the fact that mitochondria are impermeable to oxaloacetate (19Haslam J.M. Griffiths D.E. Factors affecting the translocation of oxaloacetate and l-malate into rat liver mitochondria.Biochem. J. 1968; 109 (4235143): 921-92810.1042/bj1090921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neither WT nor KO cells demonstrated any response to this substrate (data not shown). These findings suggested either that malate was inefficiently entering the mitochondria via the malate–α-ketoglutarate shuttle, that it was not being converted to oxaloacetate, that oxaloacetate was not being converted to citrate following condensation with AcCoA, or that malate and/or oxaloacetate were being diverted for non-TCA cycle functions. The equivalent citrate synthase activity of WT and KO cells argued that the latter’s attenuated response to exogenous malate was not due to reduced activity of this enzyme (Fig. S2C). Despite their markedly reduced malate response, KO cells utilized exogenous palmitoylcarnitine and engaged in FAO as well as WT cells when glucose was absent, and glycolytic intermediates were depleted as a result of cell permeabilization (Fig. S2D). These results indicated that the metabolic defect of KO cells was partially attenuated via the utilization of alternative substrates such as fatty acids. To better define how KO cells compensated for the absence of glycolytically-derived AcCoA to power the ETC, we quantified OCRs following the sequential addition of a broader range of TCA cycle and anaplerotic substrates. A reduced KO cell response to malate was again noted, and the expected absence of a pyruvate response was confirmed (Fig. 2, A and B). Unexpectedly, KO cells demonstrated an exaggerated response to glutamate (Fig. 2C), suggesting its preferential use as an anaplerotic substrate. Given that three NADH molecules and one FADH2 molecule are generated during glutamine's stepwise conversion to oxaloacetate, whereas malate provides only a single NADH molecule, increased glutaminolysis might better address the presumed redox deficit arising from the loss of the NADH-generating PDH reaction. Finally, because the production of glutamine-derived intermediates is AcCoA-independent, this could potentially reduce, if not entirely eliminate, the reliance of KO cells on this latter substrate. In neither WT nor KO cells was the glutamate response Myc-responsive. Unlike the indistinguishable palmitoylcarnitine responses of WT and KO cells when TCA substrates were absent (Fig. S2D), KO cells were significantly more reliant on FAO when they were present (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that, unlike WT cells whose AcCoA supply could derive from both glycolysis and FAO, most if not all KO cell AcCoA was derived from FAO as recently demonstrated for KO hepatocytes and HBs (9Jackson L.E. Kulkarni S. Wang H. Lu J. Dolezal J.M. Bharathi S.S. Ranganathan S. Patel M.S. Deshpande R. Alencastro F. Wendell S.G. Goetzman E.S. Duncan A.W. Prochownik E.V.

Addition of the Complex I inhibitor rotenone followed by succinate to drive Complex II indicated that both complexes contributed nearly equally to the production of mitochondrial-reducing equivalents and that neither was significantly altered in KO cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, given the proper substrates, KO cells are capable of proceeding beyond the malate block (Fig. 2B). Glutaminolysis supports cell growth by providing TCA cycle intermediates while also serving as a source of critical amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids (20Dang C.V. Glutaminolysis: supplying carbon or nitrogen or both for cancer cells?.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9 (20948290): 3884-388610.4161/cc.9.19.13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Hsieh A.L.

Moreover, the lactate generated by the Warburg effect can itself enhance glutaminolysis as can Myc in some instances (23Pérez-Escuredo J. Dadhich R.K. Dhup S. Cacace A. Van Hée V.F. De Saedeleer C.J.

Consistent with their increased utilization of glutamate as an energy source (Fig. 2C), KO cells had 2.5–3-fold higher glutamine uptake than WT cells and further increased this in response to MycER activation (Fig. 2G). These cells also grew faster and showed reduced apoptosis when cultured in limiting amounts of glutamine, most likely reflecting their more efficient uptake and utilization of this amino acid (Fig. 2, H and I). Increased KO cell glutaminolysis (Fig. 2, C and G) could have two nonmutually exclusive explanations. First, glutamate could enter the TCA cycle following conversion to α-ketoglutarate, eventually furnishing fumarate and reducing equivalents in the form of NADH and FADH2. Less likely, glutamate could be utilized more indirectly in a noncanonical pathway involving reductive carboxylation, in which α-ketoglutarate is converted to citrate and then to AcCoA in a cytoplasmic reaction catalyzed by ATP citrate lyase. The AcCoA could then be used as a source of the de novo synthesis of fatty acid synthesis (25Metallo C.M. Gameiro P.A. Bell E.L. Mattaini K.R. Yang J. Hiller K. Jewell C.M. Johnson Z.R. Irvine D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2914105975,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes a chronic infection that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The HCV life cycle is closely associated with host factors that promote or restrict viral replication, the characterization of which could help to identify potential therapeutic targets. To this end, here we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis and identified ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) as a cellular factor essential for HCV replication. We found that RRM2 is up-regulated in response to HCV infection in quiescent hepatocytes from humanized chimeric mouse livers. To elucidate the molecular basis of RRM2 expression in HCV-infected cells, we used HCV-infected hepatocytes from chimeric mice and hepatoma cells infected with the HCV strain JFH1. Both models exhibited increased RRM2 mRNA and protein expression levels. Moreover, siRNA-mediated silencing of RRM2 suppressed HCV replication and infection. Of note, RRM2 and RNA polymerase nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) partially co-localized in cells and co-immunoprecipitated, suggesting that they might interact. RRM2 knockdown reduced NS5B expression, which depended on the protein degradation pathway, as NS5B RNA levels did not decrease and NS5B protein stability correlated with RRM2 protein levels. We also found that RRM2 silencing decreased levels of hPLIC1 (human homolog 1 of protein linking integrin-associated protein and cytoskeleton), a ubiquitin-like protein that interacts with NS5B and promotes its degradation. This finding suggests that there is a dynamic interplay between RRM2 and the NS5B-hPLIC1 complex that has an important function in HCV replication. Together, these results identify a role of host RRM2 in viral RNA replication."

This study describes the successful containment of a hospital outbreak caused by NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae Sequence Type (ST) 307 using active surveillance. The outbreak began when a patient was transferred from a local hospital. After 48 hours in our hospital, a tracheal aspirate was positive for a meropenem resistant and carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae. All patients in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) and the neurology wards were subject to contact precautions. The hospital surfaces and devices, healthcare workers, and patients from these wards were screened by cultures. Fecal swabs were placed into broth and PCR for blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM, which were performed directly from the broth after 12 hours. PCRs were also performed on DNA extracted from carbapenemase-producing species from subcultured broths. Five and nine days later, two more patients’ rectal swabs tested positive. Molecular assays identified K. pneumoniae blaNDM-1 onto a 130-kb conjugative plasmid (IncY, IncFIIs, and IncFIIY), ST307. After the three patients were discharged, monitoring continued, and after three weeks with negative results, rectal swabbing ended. In conclusion, it was possible to contain a hospital outbreak caused by NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae ST307 through epidemiological and microbiological surveillance. With the methodology used, the detection of NDM-type genes in fecal samples was obtained in approximately 15 hours after obtaining the fecal sample."
https://openalex.org/W2911926846,"Insect chitin deacetylases (CDAs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from chitin and modify this polymer during its synthesis and reorganization. CDAs are essential for insect survival and therefore represent promising targets for insecticide development. However, the structural and biochemical characteristics of insect CDAs have remained elusive. Here, we report the crystal structures of two insect CDAs from the silk moth Bombyx mori: BmCDA1, which may function in cuticle modification, and BmCDA8, which may act in modifying peritrophic membranes in the midgut. Both enzymes belong to the carbohydrate esterase 4 (CE4) family. Comparing their overall structures at 1.98–2.4 Å resolution with those from well-studied microbial CDAs, we found that two unique loop regions in BmCDA1 and BmCDA8 contribute to the distinct architecture of their substrate-binding clefts. These comparisons revealed that both BmCDA1 and BmCDA8 possess a much longer and wider substrate-binding cleft with a very open active site in the center than the microbial CDAs, including VcCDA from Vibrio cholerae and ArCE4A from Arthrobacter species AW19M34-1. Biochemical analyses indicated that BmCDA8 is an active enzyme that requires its substrates to occupy subsites 0, +1, and +2 for catalysis. In contrast, BmCDA1 also required accessory proteins for catalysis.

Data about the biochemical characteristics and structure–function relationship of insect CDAs remain scarce. In this study, two CDAs from Bombyx mori, BmCDA1 and BmCDA8, were crystallized and resolved, providing the first insight into the structural characteristics, activity profiles, and deacetylation mode of insect CDAs. The structures revealed that insect CDAs possess several unique structural features that distinguish them from other known CE4 enzymes. This work will also assist the development of specific agrochemicals for pest control. BmCDA1 is composed of an N-terminal signal region (residues 1–23), a chitin-binding domain (residues 24–122), a low-density lipoprotein receptor domain (residues 123–161), and a catalytic domain (CAD, residues 162–539) (Fig. 1A). Our experiments showed that full-length recombinant BmCDA1 was not stable and underwent autocleavage when incubated with the crystallization reagent. Thus, the truncated form of BmCDA1 (BmCDA1-CAD, residues 162–539) was cloned, expressed, and purified for crystallization. Diffraction data were collected to 1.98 and 2.4 Å on native and SeMet protein crystals, respectively, and the structure was solved using the SeMet single-wavelength anomalous diffraction technique. BmCDA1-CAD was crystallized in the trigonal space group I4 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). The overall structure of BmCDA1-CAD consists of two regions: a CE4-conserved NodB homology subdomain and C-terminal loops (Fig. 1A). The NodB homology domain is a (β/α)7 barrel (residues 162–471) composed of seven parallel β-strands arranged in a barrel that is surrounded by six α-helices. Notably, the (β/α)7 barrel contains one loop insertion (residues 331–402) between β5 and α5. The C-terminal loops (residues 472–539) consist of α8, a pair of antiparallel β-strands (β9 and β10), and several loops. These structural elements, the loop insertion of the (β/α)7 barrel and the C-terminal loops, appear to be unique because they are not present in any of the other CE4 structures determined to date.Table 1Data collection and structural refinement statisticsSe-BmCDA1-CADNative-BmCDA1-CADBmCDA8Data collection Wavelength (Å)0.9794520.977760.97775 Resolution (Å)2.33–50 (2.33–2.41)1.98–50 (1.98–2.01)2.30–50 (2.30–2.34) Temperature (K)100100100 Space groupI4I4P3221 a, b, c (Å)134.941, 134.941, 77.120136.006, 136.006, 77.209115.017, 115.017, 106.510 α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 120 Unique reflections29,817 (2917)49,155 (2407)36,623 (1815) Completeness (%)99.9 (98.8)100 (100)100 (100) Rsym (%)7.7 (20)15.2 (83.5)15.4 (75.1) Redundancy15.0 (14.6)13.5 (12.7)11.2 (10.5) I/σ(I)15.9 (14.2)4.3 (2.5)3.0 (2.1) CC½0.9910.8260.834 Wilson B factor (Å2)26.8623.5937.59Statistics for refinement Resolution (Å)2.396–42.67 (2.396–2.482)1.98–47.78 (1.98–2.05)2.399–39.07 (2.399–2.485) No. of reflections27317 (2673)49077 (4834)28971 (2523) Completeness (%)99.8 (99.14)99.81 (99.42)89.7 (79.67) Rwork/Rfree (%)16.27 (18.17)/19.09 (23.56)16.66 (23.89/18.96 (26.97)16.97 (21.18)/18.88 (23.79) Average B factor (Å2)36.230.5543.67 Protein atoms3095 (35.64)3075 (29.33)2907 (43.31) Ligand43 (54.45)43 (50.66)29 (62.94) Water molecules236 (40.22)399 (37.84)170 (46.43) Other atoms000 RMSD Bond angles (°)1.030.991.02 Bond length (Å)0.010.010.013 Ramachandran plot (%) Favored region96.396.897.8 Allowed region3.73.22.2 Outliers000 Protein Data Bank code5ZNS5ZNT5Z34 Open table in a new tab The active site of BmCDA1-CAD is located at the top center of the (β/α)7 barrel and contains a metal-binding triad conserved across the CE4 family, namely, a zinc ion coordinated by Asp206, His261, and His265 (Figs. 1B and 2A). Like most CE4 family members, BmCDA1-CAD contains an active site shaped by five motifs, motifs 1–5 (Fig. 1B). Motif 1 (TFDD) contains the catalytic base Asp205 and the zinc-binding residue Asp206. Motif 2 (HSITH) contains two zinc-binding residues, His261 and His265. Motif 3 (RAPYL) contains the canonical Arg306 responsible for stabilizing the catalytic base Asp205. Structure-based sequence alignment indicates that motif 4 (AMVDS) is less conserved because most CE4 enzymes possess a motif 4 with the sequence DXXD(W/Y) (Fig. 1B). As the residue Trp/Tyr forms one wall of the active pocket, the replacement of Trp/Tyr by Ser results in an open active site for BmCDA1. Motif 5 (YFH) is also less conserved because motif 5 of most CDAs contains LXH. The canonical Leu contributes to form a hydrophobic patch (21Blair D.E. Schüttelkopf A.W. MacRae J.I. van Aalten D.M. Structure and metal-dependent mechanism of peptidoglycan deacetylase, a streptococcal virulence factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Taken together, the differences in motif 4 and motif 5 confer BmCDA1 a more open and wider active pocket. A long substrate-binding cleft was observed on the surface of BmCDA1-CAD (Fig. 2C), with only one solvent-exposed hydrophobic residue (Tyr242) that might aid in substrate binding. The substrate-binding cleft is shallow and open when compared with the other microbial CDAs because of the lack of several loops that give microbial CDAs their characteristically deep and narrow substrate-binding cleft (Fig. S1). BmCDA8 (residues 19–381) lacking the N-terminal signal peptide was expressed, purified, and crystallized. Diffraction data were collected to 2.4 Å. The structure was resolved by molecular replacement with BmCDA1-CAD as the search model. BmCDA8 was crystallized in the trigonal space group P3221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). Residues 19–22 were not included in the final structure because of a lack of interpretable electron density. BmCDA8 showed 37% sequence identity with BmCDA1-CAD. The overall architecture of BmCDA8 was similar to that of BmCDA1-CAD (Fig. 2A), corresponding to an root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.31 Å for 345 equivalent Cα atoms. Similar to BmCDA1, BmCDA8 (residues 23–381) consists of two regions: a CE4-conserved NodB homology subdomain and C-terminal loops. The active site of BmCDA8 is located at the top center of the (β/α)7 barrel (Fig. 2A). The conserved metal-binding triad is Asp63–His117–His121 coordinated with a zinc ion, and the active site is shaped by motifs 1–5 (Figs. 1B and 2A).

The aims of this study were to: characterize the pathology and prevalence of tuberculosis in New Zealand marine mammals; use molecular diagnostic methods to confirm and type the causal agent; and to explore relationships between type and host characteristics. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 30 pinnipeds and one cetacean. Most affected pinnipeds had involvement of the pulmonary system, supporting inhalation as the most common route of infection, although ingestion was a possible route in the cetacean. PCR for the RD2 gene confirmed M. pinnipedii as the causal agent in 23/31 (74%) cases (22 using DNA from cultured organisms, and one using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue), including the first published report in a cetacean. RD2 PCR results were compared for 22 cases where both cultured organisms and FFPE tissues were available, with successful identification of M. pinnipedii in 7/22 (31.8%). In cases with moderate to large numbers of acid-fast bacilli, RD2 PCR on FFPE tissue provided a rapid, inexpensive method for confirming M. pinnipedii infection without the need for culture. VNTR typing distinguished New Zealand M. pinnipedii isolates from M. pinnipedii isolated from Australian pinnipeds and from common types of M. bovis in New Zealand. Most (16/18) M. pinnipedii isolates from New Zealand sea lions were one of two common VNTR types whereas the cetacean isolate was a type detected previously in New Zealand cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2914339701,"Background We assessed the capacity of HIV self-testing to promote testing among untested men who have sex with men (MSM) and determined the most benefited subpopulations. Methods An online questionnaire was disseminated on several gay websites in Spain from September 2012 to April 2013. We used Poisson regression to estimate factors associated with the intention to use self-testing if already available. Among those who reported intention of use, we assessed several aspects related to the testing and linkage to care process by type of barrier reported: low perceived risk (LR), structural barriers (SB) and fear of testing positive (FTP). Results Of 2589 never-tested MSM, 83% would have used self-testing if already available. Intention of use was associated with age ≥30 (adj.PR, 95%CI: 1.05, 1.01–1.10), having had protected (adj.PR, 95%CI: 1.15, 1.02–1.30) or unprotected (adj.PR, 95%CI: 1.21, 1.07–1.37) anal intercourse and reporting FTP (adj.PR, 95%CI: 1.12, 1.05–1.20) or SB to access HIV testing (adj.PR, 95%CI: 1.23, 1.19–1.28). Among those who reported intention of using a self-testi, 78.3% declared it their preferred option (83.8% in the SB group; p<0.001), and 56.8% would always use this testing option (60.9% among the SB group; p = 0.001). In the case of obtaining a positive self-test, 69.3% would seek confirmatory testing, 15.3% would self-test again before taking any decision and 13.0% reported not being sure of what they would do. Conclusion HIV self-testing in Spain has the potential of becoming a highly used testing methodology for untested MSM and could represent the gateway to testing especially among older, at risk MSM who report SB or FTP as main barriers to testing."

Attrition rates were 63.4% and in total 47 children completed the programme and questionnaires assessing posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth and behaviour problems both at baseline and follow-up; 23 in the treatment group and 24 in the control group. Adjusted mean differences were analysed using ANCOVA with bootstrapping.Results showed that both hyperarousal symptoms (d = 0.61) and avoidance symptoms (d = 0.41) decreased more in the treatment group compared to the control group. There was no significant effect of the intervention found for reported levels of behavioural problems and posttraumatic growth.In spite of severe challenges implementing and executing this pioneering study in underprivileged areas of South Africa, support was found for creative arts in psychotherapy reducing hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms, but not for other symptoms. Valuable lessons were learned on feasibility of implementing this intervention in a developing context."
https://openalex.org/W2912185103,"While exposure to radiation can be lifesaving in certain settings, it can also potentially result in long-lasting adverse effects, particularly to hematopoietic and immune cells. This study investigated hematopoietic recovery and immune function in rhesus macaques Cross-sectionally (at a single time point) 2 to 5 years after exposure to a single large dose (6.5 to 8.4 Gray) of total body radiation (TBI) derived from linear accelerator-derived photons (2 MeV, 80 cGy/minute) or Cobalt 60-derived gamma irradiation (60 cGy/min). Hematopoietic recovery was assessed through measurement of complete blood counts, lymphocyte subpopulation analysis, and thymus function assessment. Capacity to mount specific antibody responses against rabies, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and tetanus antigens was determined 2 years after TBI. Irradiated macaques showed increased white blood cells, decreased platelets, and decreased frequencies of peripheral blood T cells. Effects of prior radiation on production and export of new T cells by the thymus was dependent on age at the time of analysis, with evidence of interaction with radiation dose for CD8+ T cells. Irradiated and control animals mounted similar mean antibody responses to proteins from tetanus and rabies and to 10 of 11 serotype-specific pneumococcal polysaccharides. However, irradiated animals uniformly failed to make antibodies against polysaccharides from serotype 5 pneumococci, in contrast to the robust responses of non-irradiated controls. Trends toward decreased serum levels of anti-tetanus IgM and slower peak antibody responses to rabies were also observed. Taken together, these data show that dose-related changes in peripheral blood cells and immune responses to both novel and recall antigens can be detected 2 to 5 years after exposure to whole body radiation. Longer term follow-up data on this cohort and independent validation will be helpful to determine whether these changes persist or whether additional changes become evident with increasing time since radiation, particularly as animals begin to develop aging-related changes in immune function."
https://openalex.org/W2914445256,"By definition, perception is a multisensory process that unfolds in time as a complex sequence of exploratory activities of the organism. In such a system perception and action are integrated, and multiple energy arrays are available simultaneously. Perception of affordances interweaves sensory and motor activities into meaningful behavior given task constraints. The present contribution offers insight into the manner in which perception and action usher the organism through competent functional apprehension of its surroundings. We propose that the tensegrity structure of the body, manifested via multifractality of exploratory bodily movements informs perception of affordances. The affordance of stand-on-ability of ground surfaces served as the experimental paradigm. Observers viewed a surface set to a discrete angle and attempted to match it haptically with a continuously adjustable surface occluded by a curtain, or felt an occluded surface set to a discrete angle then matched it visually with a continuously adjustable visible surface. The complex intertwining of perception and action was demonstrated by the interactions of multifractality of postural sway with multiple energy arrays, responses, and changing geometric task demands."
https://openalex.org/W2912758057,"Aims Elevated levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) are associated with adverse outcomes in numerous patient populations. Their value in prediction of stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is in debate. Methods The study population included 2898 consecutive patients presenting with AF to the emergency department of the Department of Cardiology, Heidelberg University Hospital. Associations between hsTnT and stroke risk were assessed using multivariable Cox regression. Results Elevated hsTnT levels (>14 ng/L) were associated with increased risk of stroke. Even after adjustment for various risk factors, elevated hsTnT remained independently associated with stroke risk in patients with AF, adjusted hazard ratio 2.35 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26–4.36] (P = 0.007). These results were consistent across important subgroups (age, renal function, ejection fraction, CHA2DS2-VASc score and main admission diagnosis). For hsTnT, area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.659 [95% CI: 0.575–0.742], compared to 0.610 [95% CI: 0.526–0.694] for the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Inclusion of hsTnT in the multivariable model for stroke risk prediction consisting of all variables of the CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with a significant improvement of its discriminatory power. Conclusion Elevated hsTnT levels are significantly associated with higher risk of stroke and provide prognostic information independent of CHA2DS2-VASc score variables. Measurement of hsTnT may improve prediction of stroke risk in patients presenting to an emergency department with AF as compared to risk stratification based only on clinical variables."
https://openalex.org/W2913413500,"Objectives To examine whether post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) defined by fatigue, cognitive complaints and widespread pain following the treatment of Lyme disease is associated with small fiber neuropathy (SFN) manifesting as autonomic and sensory dysfunction. Methods This single center, retrospective study evaluated subjects with PTLDS. Skin biopsies for assessment of epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD), sweat gland nerve fiber density (SGNFD) and functional autonomic testing (deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver and tilt test) were performed to assess SFN, severity of dysautonomia and cerebral blood flow abnormalities. Heart rate, end tidal CO2, blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) from middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler were monitored. Results 10 participants, 5/5 women/men, age 51.3 ± 14.7 years, BMI 27.6 ± 7.3 were analyzed. All participants were positive for Lyme infection by CDC criteria. At least one skin biopsy was abnormal in all ten participants. Abnormal ENFD was found in 9 participants, abnormal SGNFD in 5 participants, and both abnormal ENFD and SGNFD were detected in 4 participants. Parasympathetic failure was found in 7 participants and mild or moderate sympathetic adrenergic failure in all participants. Abnormal total CBFv score was found in all ten participants. Low orthostatic CBFv was found in 7 participants, three additional participants had abnormally reduced supine CBFv. Conclusions SFN appears to be associated with PTLDS and may be responsible for certain sensory symptoms. In addition, dysautonomia related to SFN and abnormal CBFv also seem to be linked to PTLDS. Reduced orthostatic CBFv can be associated with cerebral hypoperfusion and may lead to cognitive dysfunction. Autonomic failure detected in PTLDS is mild to moderate. SFN evaluation may be useful in PTLDS."
https://openalex.org/W2952070651,"Explorative visualization techniques provide a first summary of microbiome read count datasets through dimension reduction. A plethora of dimension reduction methods exists, but many of them focus primarily on sample ordination, failing to elucidate the role of the bacterial species. Moreover, implicit but often unrealistic assumptions underlying these methods fail to account for overdispersion and differences in sequencing depth, which are two typical characteristics of sequencing data. We combine log-linear models with a dispersion estimation algorithm and flexible response function modelling into a framework for unconstrained and constrained ordination. The method is able to cope with differences in dispersion between taxa and varying sequencing depths, to yield meaningful biological patterns. Moreover, it can correct for observed technical confounders, whereas other methods are adversely affected by these artefacts. Unlike distance-based ordination methods, the assumptions underlying our method are stated explicitly and can be verified using simple diagnostics. The combination of unconstrained and constrained ordination in the same framework is unique in the field and facilitates microbiome data exploration. We illustrate the advantages of our method on simulated and real datasets, while pointing out flaws in existing methods. The algorithms for fitting and plotting are available in the R-package RCM."
https://openalex.org/W2950061224,"Humans can estimate numerosities-such as the number sheep in a flock-without deliberate counting. A number of biases have been identified in these estimates, which seem primarily rooted in the spatial organization of objects (grouping, symmetry, etc). Most previous studies on the number sense used static stimuli with extremely brief exposure times. However, outside the laboratory, visual scenes are often dynamic and freely viewed for prolonged durations (e.g., a flock of moving sheep). The purpose of the present study is to examine grouping-induced numerosity biases in stimuli that more closely mimic these conditions. To this end, we designed two experiments with limited-dot-lifetime displays (LDDs), in which each dot is visible for a brief period of time and replaced by a new dot elsewhere after its disappearance. The dynamic nature of LDDs prevents subjects from counting even when they are free-viewing a stimulus under prolonged presentation. Subjects estimated the number of dots in arrays that were presented either as a single group or were segregated into two groups by spatial clustering, dot size, dot color, or dot motion. Grouping by color and motion reduced perceived numerosity compared to viewing them as a single group. Moreover, the grouping effect sizes between these two features were correlated, which suggests that the effects may share a common, feature-invariant mechanism. Finally, we find that dot size and total stimulus area directly affect perceived numerosity, which makes it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about grouping effects induced by spatial clustering and dot size. Our results provide new insights into biases in numerosity estimation and they demonstrate that the use of LDDs is an effective method to study the human number sense under prolonged viewing."
https://openalex.org/W2911438923,"Biogeography, systematics and taxonomy are complementary scientific disciplines. To understand a species' origin, migration routes, distribution and evolutionary history, it is first necessary to establish its taxonomic boundaries. Here, we use an integrative approach that takes advantage of complementary disciplines to resolve an intriguing scientific question. Populations of an unknown moss found in the Canary Islands (Tenerife Island) resembled two different Californian endemic species: Orthotrichum shevockii and O. kellmanii. To determine whether this moss belongs to either of these species and, if so, to explain its presence on this distant oceanic island, we combined the evaluation of morphological qualitative characters, statistical morphometric analyses of quantitative traits, and molecular phylogenetic inferences. Our results suggest that the two Californian mosses are conspecific, and that the Canarian populations belong to this putative species, with only one taxon thus involved. Orthotrichum shevockii (the priority name) is therefore recognized as a morphologically variable species that exhibits a transcontinental disjunction between western North America and the Canary Islands. Within its distribution range, the area of occupancy is limited, a notable feature among bryophytes at the intraspecific level. To explain this disjunction, divergence time and ancestral area estimation analyses are carried out and further support the hypothesis of a long-distance dispersal event from California to Tenerife Island."

Both Shh and N-Myc are important signals to mediate normal neuronal development. N-Myc amplification in NB leads to overexpression at both the N-Myc mRNA and protein levels (8Kohl N.E. Gee C.E.

A recent finding uncovered that Shh induces INSM1, a neuroendocrine (NE) factor in NB via the N-Myc activation pathway (12Chen C. Breslin M.B. Lan M.S.

Strong evidence supports that the cross-talk of Shh, N-Myc, and INSM1 plays a crucial role in NB cell proliferation. Shh signaling induces INSM1 and promotes NB cell growth. INSM1 is a newly discovered target gene activated by N-Myc. Therefore, the current study focuses on INSM1 to explore novel signaling pathways underlying NB growth. Human NB is the most common childhood extracranial tumor arising from the sympathetic nervous system (1Brodeur G.M. Neuroblastoma: biological insights into a clinical enigma.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3 (12612655): 203-21610.1038/nrc1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar) and amplification of N-Myc occurs in roughly 30% of NB patients and strongly correlates with advanced stage disease and poor outcome (5Brodeur G.M.

An INSM1 promoter-driven luciferase screening platform was used and identified an inhibitor (5′-iodotubercidin, 5′-IT) of adenosine kinase (ADKi). Treatment of NB with 5′-IT down-regulates INSM1 and inhibits NB cell growth. ADKi inhibits adenosine kinase (ADK) signaling and modulates intra- and extracellular adenosine metabolism, which is critical for NB tumor cell growth. insulinoma-associated-1 neuroblastoma Sonic Hedgehog neuroendocrine adenosine kinase inhibitor adenosine deaminase adenosine receptor 5′-iodotubercidin extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 N6-cyclopentyladenosine retinoic acid N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester trichostatin A RAC-α-serine/threonine protein kinase phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium luciferase 2 nucleoside transporter knockdown reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography lymphoid enhancer–binding factor 1 AMP-activated protein kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase adenosine receptor-3. The primary function of ADK is to regulate intracellular/extracellular adenine nucleotide pools mediated through the adenosine receptor (AR), inosine formation, and/or energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. The mechanistic connection between ADKi and neuroblastoma (NB) tumor cell growth remains unclear. In this study, for the first time we demonstrate that 5′-iodotubercidin (5′-IT) blockage of the adenosine kinase (ADK) pathway inhibits INSM1 expression and promotes the AR signaling pathway contributing to the suppression of NB tumor cell viability. 5′-IT increases the intra- and extracellular adenosine levels that triggers the ARA3 signaling pathway resulting in the inhibition of intracellular cAMP affecting NB tumor cell growth. 5′-IT modulates cAMP via ARA3 leading to the activation of GSK3β and β-catenin phosphorylation. Additionally, 5′-IT and INSM1 suppression inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of these two signaling pathways resulted in LEF-1, INSM1, N-Myc, and cyclin D1 down-regulation while activating caspase-3 and p53 to promote apoptosis. In a previous study, multiple signaling pathways were identified that regulate NB tumor cell growth in the context of two oncogenic proteins, N-Myc and INSM1 (12Chen C. Breslin M.B. Lan M.S. INSM1 increases N-myc stability and oncogenesis via a positive-feedback loop in neuroblastoma.Oncotarget. 2015; 6 (26456864): 36700-36712Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, stable cell lines in BE2-M17 or IMR-32 containing an INSM1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene was developed. Using this luciferase-based screening platform, we screened nine compounds previously selected for INSM1 functional study in our laboratory with a medium range of concentrations versus DMSO control (Fig. 1A). The screening results showed only marginal effects on INSM1 promoter activity when treated with retinoic acid (RA, 2 μm), GANT61 (20 μm), 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5′-AZ) (10 μm), DAPT (10 μm), GANT58 (20 μm), or ZM336372 (10 μm). LY294002 (20 μm) or trichostatin (TSA, 0.4 μm), suppresses ∼60% of the INSM1 promoter activity, whereas 5′-IT (1 μm) suppresses the INSM1 promoter activity over 80%. LY294002 is a strong nonselective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (13Maira S.M. Stauffer F. Schnell C. García-Echeverría C. PI3K inhibitors for cancer treatment: where do we stand?.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37 (19143644): 265-27210.1042/BST0370265Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). TSA selectively inhibits the class I and II mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of enzymes and cell cycle progression (14Li Q.Q. Hao J.J. Zhang Z. Hsu I. Liu Y. Tao Z. Lewi K. Metwalli A.R. Agarwal P.K. Histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced cell death in bladder cancer is associated with chromatin modification and modifying protein expression: a proteomic approach.Int. J. Oncol. 2016; 48 (27082124): 2591-260710.3892/ijo.2016.3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 5′-IT is an adenosine kinase (ADK) inhibitor that displays potent suppressive effects on INSM1 promoter activity. A 5′-IT dose-response study on INSM1-promoter activity showed incremental suppression (0.25–1.0 μm) in BE2-M17 and IMR-32 cells (Fig. 1B). 5′-IT treatment of BE2-M17 and/or IMR-32 cells down-regulated INSM1 expression in a real-time PCR and Western blotting analyses (Fig. 1, C and D). Inversely, overexpression of INSM1 or N-Myc in BE2-M17 cells partially restores cell viability from 5′-IT–induced cell death (Fig. 1E). This result strongly suggests that INSM1 and/or N-Myc expression is critically important for NB cell survival, which responds to 5′-IT treatment. Both IMR-32 and BE2-M17 showed 50% cell viability at 0.5 μm, but little or no effect was observed in glioblastoma (U87MG), or myelogenous leukemia (K562) cells (Fig. 2A). However, 5′-IT inhibits ADK and perturbs adenosine balance in cell metabolism that poses varying degrees of tumor cell cytotoxicity including NB. We performed the reporter assay in the presence or absence of cycloheximide in a shorter time point (3 or 6 h) with 5′-IT (1 μm) treatment (Fig. 2B). Cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) alone suppresses INSM1 promoter activity greatly, whereas 5′-IT suppresses INSM1 promoter activity significantly in 3 or 6 h. Suppression of INSM1 promoter activity by cycloheximide suggests that INSM1 promoter activity is depended upon de novo protein synthesis. Comparison of the cycloheximide alone and cycloheximide + 5′-IT showed significant enhanced inhibition in BE2-M17 but not IMR-32 cells in 3 h. However, after 6 h treatment, both cell lines showed significant inhibitory enhancement suggesting that 5′-IT acts on INSM1 promoter activity more than de novo protein synthesis. The effect of 5′-IT on the INSM1 expression (3 h) precedes the growth inhibition (>24 h).Figure 2ADK knockdown and cytotoxic effect of 5′-IT in different cell types. A, K562 (myelogenous leukemia), U87MG (glioblastoma), IMR-32, and BE2-M17 (NB) cells were treated with different doses of 5′-IT for 72 h.

ADK-KD suppressed ADK expression and the INSM1-promoter activity similar to 5′-IT treatment. However, 5′-IT only blocked the ADK signaling pathway, but did not down-regulate ADK protein levels directly (Fig. 2C, upper right). Furthermore, the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay revealed that knockdown of ADK expression also decreased cellular viability consistent with 5′-IT inhibition of the ADK signaling pathway (Fig. 2D). How the ADK inhibitor (ADKi, 5′-IT) affects NB tumor cell growth was further investigated. The first step of this study is to dissect the functional effects of adenosine imbalance using specific inhibitors to block alternative signaling pathways controlling intra- and extracellular adenosine levels to establish how they contribute to the down-regulation of INSM1 leading to reduced NB tumor cell growth. Other studies have revealed that activation of the AMPK inhibits the proliferation of human endothelial cells (15Peyton K.J. Liu X.M. Yu Y. Yates B. Durante W. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase inhibits the proliferation of human endothelial cells.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 2012; 342 (22700432): 827-83410.1124/jpet.112.194712Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the NB system, 5′-IT exhibits an inhibitory effect in contrast to facilitating NB tumor cell growth. Therefore, the 5′-IT blockage of the ADK pathway (AMPK) does not contribute to the negative effect on NB tumor cell growth. Other mechanisms that control NB cell viability via 5′-IT treatment could include increases of intracellular adenosine levels direct toward the formation of intracellular inosine through adenosine deaminase (ADA) or by directing a re-balance of the intra- and extracellular adenosine levels through the nucleoside transporter (NT). BE2-M17 or IMR-32 cells were treated with the ADA inhibitor (pentostatin) alone (Fig. 3A). ADA inhibitor alone has little cytotoxic effects to the cells. However, a combination of the ADA inhibitor with 5′-IT shows an opposite effect on BE2-M17 versus IMR-32 cells. Pentostatin slightly restores BE2-M17 cell viability in contrast to the slight decreases in IMR-32 cell viability suggesting that perturbation of intracellular adenosine levels through the ADA pathway could either reduce or enhance 5′-IT cytotoxicity (Fig. 3B). The NT inhibitor (dipyridamole) alone has no significant effects on cell viability. When an NT inhibitor (dipyridamole) and 5′-IT were used, the result shows a moderate lessening of 5′-IT cytotoxicity and increase in INSM1 promoter activity in both cell lines (Fig. 3, C and D). Addition of NT inhibitor in 5′-IT–treated cells also restores the down-regulated INSM1 protein expression partially in BE2-M17 cells (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that blockage of NT could reduce adenosine export and 5′-IT cytotoxicity. Using reverse phase HPLC analysis, intracellular adenosine concentration (nmol/mg protein) increased upon 5′-IT treatment for 24 h (Fig. 3F). Additionally, 5′-IT treatment blocks the extracellular ADK signaling pathway, which facilitates extracellular adenosine interaction with the adenosine receptor-3 (ARA3) pathway. The control medium adenosine concentration at the 5-min time point reached ∼4.5 μm, which is higher than the ARA3 activated concentration (EC50: 0.29 μm) (16Fredholm B.B. Irenius E. Kull B. Schulte G. Comparison of the potency of adenosine as an agonist at human adenosine receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61 (11226378): 443-44810.1016/S0006-2952(00)00570-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Clearly, 5′-IT treatment facilitates the usage of extracellular adenosine to activate ARA3 faster than the control group in a time period between 5 and 30 min (Fig. 3G). An interesting observation reveals that human NB tumor cells (BE2-M17 and IMR-32) do not express ARA2a, but express a moderate level of ARA1 and ARA3, and high level of ARA2b adenosine receptors. ARA1 is coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins that lead to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (17van Calker D. Müller M. Hamprecht B. Adenosine regulates via two different types of receptors, the accumulation of cyclic AMP in cultured brain cells.J. Neurochem. 1979; 33 (228008): 999-100510.1111/j.1471-4159.1979.tb05236.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). ARA2b is known to be a low-affinity AR playing a major role in inflammation (18Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Adenosine A2b receptors evoke interleukin-8 secretion in human mast cells: an enprofylline-sensitive mechanism with implications for asthma.J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96 (7560091): 1979-198610.1172/JCI118245Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), whereas ARA3 is the only adenosine subtype to be overexpressed in inflammatory and cancer cells (19Fishman P. Madi L. Bar-Yehuda S. Barer F. Del Valle L. Khalili K. Evidence for involvement of Wnt signaling pathway in IB-MECA mediated suppression of melanoma cells.Oncogene. 2002; 21 (12037688): 4060-406410.1038/sj.onc.1205531Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because ARA1, ARA3, or ARA2b exhibit opposite effects of either inhibiting or activating adenylate cyclase, they are destined to modulate the cAMP signaling pathway. An agonist for ARA1 (N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA)), ARA3 (2-Cl-IB-MECA), or ARA2b (BAY606583) was tested with or without 5′-IT in NB tumor cells. In combination with low dose 5′-IT (0.5 μm) and CPA (100 μm), 2-Cl-IB-MECA (20 μm) or BAY606583 (20 μm), only 2-Cl-IB-MECA exhibits an additive killing effect (Fig. 4B). In contrast, CPA or BAY606583 lessens 5′-IT cytotoxicity (Fig. 4, A and C). This result suggests that 5′-IT induces an intra- and extracellular adenosine imbalance that facilitates further interaction with ARA3. INSM1 promoter activity is inhibited by 5′-IT alone or showed and enhanced inhibitory effect in the presence of ARA3 agonist (2-Cl-IB-MECA). Alternatively, the ARA1 agonist (CPA), or ARA2b agonist (BAY606583) lessens the inhibitory effect with 5′-IT on the NB cells suggesting that ARA3 signaling mediated the post-5′-IT effects (Fig. 4D). Similarly, INSM1 protein inhibition is consistent with 5′-IT or 5′-IT + 2-Cl-IB-MECA treatment (Fig. 4E). In contrast to 5′-IT treatment, exogenously added 8-bromo-cAMP does not change INSM1 protein expression (Fig. 4F). Stimulation of the ARA3 signaling pathway mediates suppression of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP levels. BE2-M17 or IMR-32 cells were treated with forskolin (as a stimulator of adenylyl cyclase) for 30 min, followed by treatment with 5′-IT (1.0 μm) in the presence of 100 μm Ro-20-1724 (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) for an additional 30 min. Following treatment, cAMP content of the acid cell extracts was measured using a cAMP ELISA kit normalized with total cellular protein concentration. Because endogenous cAMP before or after 5′-IT treatment was too low to be reliably detected, forskolin was used to increase the baseline levels of cAMP in the cells. Therefore, cells were pre-treated with forskolin before the addition of 5′-IT. Forskolin stimulation of cAMP was completely suppressed by 5′-IT treatment (Fig. 4G). 5′-IT down-regulates cAMP and INSM1 promoter activity. We measured INSM1 promoter activity using BE2-M17 and IMR-32 cells by adding forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP (exogenous cAMP), 5′-IT, 5′-IT + forskolin, or 5′-IT + 8-bromo-cAMP. Forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP slightly increases INSM1 promoter activity, whereas 5′-IT alone, 5′-IT and forskolin, or 5′-IT and 8-bromo-cAMP overrides INSM1 promoter activity. Addition of forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP does not inhibit the INSM1 expression (Fig. 4, F and H). 5′-IT–treated BE2-M17 cells trigger ARA3 signaling leading to suppression of cAMP. Suppression of cAMP decreased AKT and GSK3β phosphorylation thus resulting in increased GSK3β activity triggering β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation (Fig. 5, A and C). Inversely, exogenously added forskolin activated adenylyl cyclase that stimulates cAMP, AKT, and GSK3β phosphorylation that peaked at 10 min (Fig. 5B). β-Catenin phosphorylation and LEF-1 expression were down-regulated upon 5′-IT treatment (Fig. 5C). Additionally, 5′-IT also down-regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation that is critical for cell proliferation and cross-talk with the AKT pathway (Fig. 5D). Blockage of the ERK1/2 pathway (U0126) inhibits INSM1 protein expression similar to the effect of 5′-IT supporting cross-talk between the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (Fig. 5E). 5′-IT induces apoptosis via down-regulation of INSM1 and cyclin D1 in addition to the observed activation of both p53 and caspase-3 (Fig. 5, F and G). These results suggest that the inhibition of ADK and ERK1/2 pathways resulted in INSM1 suppression, which plays a critical role in the inhibition of NB cell proliferation and induction of programmed cell death. Due to the importance of the transcriptional regulator INSM1 on the proliferation of NB cells, an INSM1 promoter-driven luciferase screening platform was used to target associated signaling pathways that lead to the down-regulation of INSM1 expression in NB. A novel ADKi, 5′-IT, was identified that exhibited potent inhibition of INSM1 expression and NB tumor cell growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying how 5′-IT suppressed the ADK pathway that contributes to the inhibition of NB cell growth was further investigated. Three different pathways associated with adenosine perturbation via ADK inhibition were tested. These pathways include the balance of adenosine and AMPK toward the energy-sensing pathway, increase of intracellular adenosine that triggers inosine formation via ADA, or a re-balance of the intra- and extracellular adenosine levels through the NT (Fig. 6). Adenosine was shown to induce apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells via activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (20Saitoh M. Nagai K. Nakagawa K. Yamamura T. Yamamoto S. Nishizaki T. Adenosine induces apoptosis in the human gastric cancer cells via an intrinsic pathway relevant to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67 (15130776): 2005-201110.1016/j.bcp.2004.01.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase inhibits the proliferation of human endothelial cells (15Peyton K.J. Liu X.M. Yu Y. Yates B. Durante W. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase inhibits the proliferation of human endothelial cells.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 2012; 342 (22700432): 827-83410.1124/jpet.112.194712Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, blockage of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway by 5′-IT promotes beta-cell proliferation and cell growth (21Annes J.P. Ryu J.H. Lam K. Carolan P.J. Utz K. Hollister-Lock J. Arvanites A.C. Rubin L.L. Weir G. Melton D.A. Adenosine kinase inhibition selectively promotes rodent and porcine islet beta-cell replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, it is unlikely that blockage of the AMPK signaling pathway contributes to NB cell death. Using the ADA inhibitor (pentostatin) that targets the inosine synthesis pathway reveals that 5′-IT alters adenosine concentration and could only slightly reduce or enhance the 5′-IT cytotoxicity in the NB cells. Whereas the NT inhibitor (dipyridamole) blocks adenosine export and consistently lessened the 5′-IT cytotoxicity to the NB cells. An interesting observation in our work reveals that 5′-IT re-balances intracellular adenosine and directs extracellular adenosine to trigger the ARA3 signaling pathway. The observation was confirmed by HPLC analyses of intra- and extracellular adenosine concentration as well as using 5′-IT and ARA3 agonist for combined treatment of NB cells. Our data suggests that agonist activation of the ARA3 signaling pathway potentiates the observed ADKi effect and INSM1 inhibition leading to reduced cell viability of NB cells.

A second objective was to evaluate the accuracy of self-reported pressure relief frequency within each measurement epoch. A wheelchair in-seat activity monitor was used to measure weight shifts and other in-seat movement. The data was classified into multiple in-seat activity metrics using machine learning. Seventeen full-time wheelchair users with spinal cord injury were measured within multiple epochs, each lasting more than 1 week. Across all in-seat activity metrics, no consistent pattern of activity changes emerged. None of the in-seat activity metric changed in any one direction across a majority of subjects. Subjects tended to over-estimate their frequency of performing pressure reliefs. Self-reported pressure relief behaviors are not reliable, and therefore, cannot be used to evaluate preventative behaviors either clinically or within research. This study had the capability of fully investigating in-seat movements of wheelchair users. The results indicated that in-seat movement does not reflect a routine, either in pressure reliefs, weight shifts or other functional in-seat movements. This study has illustrated the complexity of assigning causation of pressure ulcer occurrence to seated behaviors of wheelchair users and identifies the need for improved clinical techniques designed to develop routine behaviors to prevent pressure ulcers."
https://openalex.org/W2914383177,"The epidemiology of HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) determined by Sanger capillary sequencing, has been widely studied. However, much less is known about HIVDR detected using next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. We aimed to determine the presence, persistence and effect of pre-treatment HIVDR variants detected using NGS in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve participants from rural Coastal Kenya.In a retrospective longitudinal study, samples from HIV-1 infected participants collected prior [n = 2 time-points] and after [n = 1 time-point] ART initiation were considered. An ultra-deep amplicon-based NGS assay, calling for nucleotide variants at >2.0% frequency of viral population, was used. Suspected virologic failure (sVF) was defined as a one-off HIV-1 viral load of >1000 copies/ml whilst on ART.Of the 50 eligible participants, 12 (24.0% [95% CI: 13.1-38.2]) had at least one detectable pre-treatment HIVDR variant against Protease Inhibitors (PIs, n = 6 [12%]), Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs, n = 4 [8.0%]) and Non-NRTIs (n = 3 [6.0%]). Overall, 15 pre-treatment resistance variants were detected (frequency, range: 2.3-92.0%). A positive correlation was observed between mutation frequency and absolute load for NRTI and/or NNRTI variants (r = 0.761 [p = 0.028]), but not for PI variants (r = -0.117 [p = 0.803]). Participants with pre-treatment NRTI and/or NNRTI resistance had increased odds of sVF (OR = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.0-36.9; p = 0.054).Using NGS, pre-treatment resistance variants were common, though observed PI variants were unlikely transmitted, but rather probably generated de novo. Even when detected from a low frequency, pre-treatment NRTI and/or NNRTI resistance variants may adversely affect treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2912969974,"Presently, China has the largest high-speed rail (HSR) system in the world. However, our understanding of the network structure of the world's largest HSR system remains largely incomplete due to the limited data available. In this study, a publicly available data source, namely, information from a ticketing website, was used to collect an exhaustive dataset on the stations and routes within the Chinese HSR system. The dataset included all 704 HSR stations that had been built as of June, 2016. A classical set of frequently used metrics based on complex network theory were analyzed, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. The frequency distributions of all three metrics demonstrated highly consistent bimodal-like patterns, suggesting that the Chinese HSR network consists of two distinct regimes. The results indicate that the Chinese HSR system has a hierarchical structure, rather than a scale-free structure as has been commonly observed. To the best of our knowledge, such a network structure has not been found in other railway systems, or in transportation systems in general. Follow-up studies are needed to reveal the formation mechanisms of this hierarchical network structure."

We used the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila as a model to evaluate the toxic effects of this indole alkaloid in eukaryotic microorganisms. Koumine inhibited T. thermophila growth and viability in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, this drug produced oxidative stress in T. thermophila cells and expressions of antioxidant enzymes were significantly elevated at high koumine levels (p < 0.05). Koumine also caused significant levels of apoptosis (p < 0.05) and induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner. Mitophagic vacuoles were present in cells indicating induction of autophagy by this drug. Expression of ATG7, MTT2/4, CYP1 and HSP70 as well as the MAP kinase pathway gene MPK1 and MPK3 were significantly altered after exposed to koumine. This study represents a preliminary toxicological evaluation of koumine in the single celled eukaryote T. thermophila."
https://openalex.org/W2913005111,"To clarify cues for age perception, the three-dimensional head and face forms of Japanese women were analyzed. It is known that age-related transformations are mainly caused by changes in soft tissue during adulthood. A homologous polygon model was created by fitting template meshes to each study participant to obtain three-dimensional data for analyzing whole head and face forms. Using principal component analysis of the vertices coordinates of these models, 26 principal components were extracted (contribution ratios >0.5%), which accounted for more than 90% of the total variance. Among the principal components, five had a significant correlation with the perceived ages of the participants (p < 0.05). Transformations with these principal components in the age-related direction produced aged faces. Moreover, the older the perceived age, the larger the ratio of age-manifesting participants, namely participants who had one or more age-related principal component score greater than +1.0 σ in the age-related direction. Therefore, these five principal components were regarded as aging factors. A cluster analysis of the five aging factors revealed that all of the participants fell into one of four groups, meaning that specific combinations of factors could be used as cues for age perception in each group. These results suggest that Japanese women can be classified into four groups according to age-related transformations of soft tissue in the face."
https://openalex.org/W2912583187,"Impulse control disorders (ICD) may occur in Parkinson's disease (PD) although it remains to be understood if such deficits may occur even in the absence of a formal ICD diagnosis. Moreover, studies addressing simultaneously distinct neurobehavioral domains, such as cognitive, proactive and reactive motor impulsivity, are still lacking. Here, we aimed to investigate if reactive, proactive and cognitive impulsivity involving risk taking are concomitantly affected in medicated PD patients, and whether deficits were dependent on response strategies, such as speed accuracy tradeoffs, or the proportion of omission vs. commission errors. We assessed three different impulsivity domains in a sample of 21 PD patients and 13 matched controls. We found impaired impulsivity in both reactive (p = 0.042) and cognitive domains (p = 0.015) for the PD patients, irrespective of response strategy. For the latter, effect sizes were larger for the actions related with reward processing (p = 0.017, dCohen = 0.9). In the proactive impulsivity task, PD patients showed significantly increased number of omissions (p = 0.041), a response strategy which was associated with preserved number of commission errors. Moreover, the number of premature and proactive response errors were correlated with disease stage. Our findings suggest that PD ON medication is characterized compared to healthy controls by impairment across several impulsivity domains, which is moderated in the proactive domain by the response strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2913952302,"Previous research suggesting an association between maternal prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake and infant cognition has yet to assess whether there is a critical trimester for the observed effects. We used a comprehensive Food Frequency Questionnaire to estimate DHA levels during both the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, in a sample of 125 pregnant women. Infants were assessed at 4.5 months and 9 months post-partum using specific tests of visual acuity, habituation, and visual attention. Based on maternal DHA levels during pregnancy, mothers were subdivided into high, medium, and low groups, and their infants compared for task performance using one-way ANOVAs with maternal DHA groups. On the 9 month visual acuity test, infants whose mothers were in the medium DHA group performed significantly better than those with mothers in the low or high DHA groups (p = 0.008). However, no significant finding was found for any of the other cognitive assessment measures. Despite a number of studies reporting a positive effect of higher DHA levels on cognitive development, this study fails to support those conclusions. We can, however, conclude that it appears to be DHA intake in the third trimester specifically, which is influencing the development of visual acuity towards the end of the first postnatal year."
https://openalex.org/W2911875416,"The identification and measurement of tumours is a key requirement in the study of tumour development in mouse models of human cancer. Disease burden in autochthonous tumours, such as those arising in the lung, can be seen with non-invasive imaging, but cannot be accurately measured using standard tools such as callipers. Lung imaging is further complicated in the mouse due to instabilities arising from the rapid but cyclic cardio-respiratory motions, and the desire to use free-breathing animals. Female A/JOlaHsd mice were either injected (i.p.) with PBS 0.1ml/10g body weight (n = 6), or 10% urethane/PBS 0.1ml/10g body weight (n = 12) to induce autochthonous lung tumours. Cardio-respiratory synchronised bSSFP MRI, at 200 μm isotropic resolution was performed at 8, 13 and 18 weeks post induction. Images from the same mouse at different time points were aligned using threshold-based segmented masks of the lungs (ITK-SNAP and MATLAB) and tumour volumes were determined via threshold-based segmentation (ITK-SNAP).Scan times were routinely below 10 minutes and tumours were readily identifiable. Image registration allowed serial measurement of tumour volumes as small as 0.056 mm3. Repetitive imaging did not lead to mouse welfare issues. We have developed a motion desensitised scan that enables high sensitivity MRI to be performed with high throughput capability of greater than 4 mice/hour. Image segmentation and registration allows serial measurement of individual, small tumours. This allows fast and highly efficient volumetric lung tumour monitoring in cohorts of 30 mice per imaging time point. As a result, adaptive trial study designs can be achieved, optimizing experimental and welfare outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2914988111,"Purpose Intensive care unit (ICU)-related mortality for lung cancer is ranked highest among the solid tumors and little information exists on the role of intensivists on clinical outcomes. This study aimed to elucidate the intensivist’s contribution toward clinical outcomes. Materials and methods Data of advanced lung cancer patients, including stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, admitted to the ICU from 2005 to 2016 were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine variables associated with ICU and in-hospital mortality. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) for time-series was used to assess the intensivist’s impact. Results Of 264 patients, 85 (32.2%) were admitted to the ICU before and 179 (67.8%) after organized intensive care introduction in 2011. Before and after 2011, the changes observed were as follows: ICU mortality rate, 43.5% to 40.2%, respectively (p = 0.610); hospital mortality rate, 82.4% to 65. 9% (p = 0.006). The duration of ICU and hospital stay decreased after 2011 (14.5±16.5 vs. 8.3 ± 8.6, p < 0.001; 36.6 ± 37.2 vs. 22.0 ± 19.6, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, admission after 2011 was independently associated with decreased hospital mortality (Odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.21–0.77, p = 0.006). In ARIMA models, intensivist involvement was associated with significantly reduced hospital mortality. (Estimate -17.95, standard error 5.31, p = 0.001) Conclusion In patients with advanced lung cancer, organized intensive care could contribute to improved clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2951588658,"Leaf tooth can indicate several systematically informative features and is extremely useful for circumscribing fossil leaf taxa. Moreover, it can help discriminate species or even higher taxa accurately. Previous studies extract features that are not strictly defined in botany; therefore, a uniform standard to compare the accuracies of various feature extraction methods cannot be used. For efficient and automatic retrieval of plant leaves from a leaf database, in this study, we propose an image-based description and measurement of leaf teeth by referring to the leaf structure classification system in botany. First, image preprocessing is carried out to obtain a binary map of plant leaves. Then, corner detection based on the curvature scale-space (CSS) algorithm is used to extract the inflection point from the edges; next, the leaf tooth apex is extracted by screening the convex points; then, according to the definition of the leaf structure, the characteristics of the leaf teeth are described and measured in terms of number of orders of teeth, tooth spacing, number of teeth, sinus shape, and tooth shape. In this manner, data extracted from the algorithm can not only be used to classify plants, but also provide scientific and standardized data to understand the history of plant evolution. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the extraction method, we used simple linear discriminant analysis and multiclass support vector machine to classify leaves. The results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy that is superior to that of other methods."
https://openalex.org/W2912737211,"Making economic decisions in a natural foraging situation that involves the use of tools may require an animal to consider more levels of relational complexity than merely deciding between an immediate and a delayed food option. We used the same method previously used with Goffin´s cockatoos to investigate the orangutans’ flexibility for making the most profitable decisions when confronted with five different settings that included one or two different apparatuses, two different tools and two food items (one more preferred than the other). We found that orangutans made profitable decisions relative to reward quality, when the task required the subjects to select a tool over an immediately accessible food reward. Furthermore, most subjects were sensitive to work-effort when the immediate and the delayed option (directly accessible by using a tool) led to the same outcome. Most subjects continued to make profitable decisions that required taking into account the tool functionality. In a final multidimensional task design in which subjects had to simultaneously focus on two apparatuses, two reward qualities and two different tools, the orangutans chose the functional tool to access the high quality reward."

Upon β-secretase–mediated cleavage of the β C-terminal fragment (β-CTF) from the Aβ precursor protein, the γ-secretase complex produces the Aβ peptides associated with AD. The familial T43I mutation within the transmembrane domain of the β-CTF (also referred to as C99) increases the ratio between the Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides largely due to a decrease in Aβ40 formation. Aβ42 is the principal component of amyloid deposits within the brain parenchyma, and an increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is correlated with early-onset AD. Using NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, here we addressed how the T43I substitution influences the structure of C55, the minimal sequence containing the entire extracellular and transmembrane (TM) domains of C99 needed for γ-secretase processing. 13C NMR chemical shifts indicated that the T43I substitution increases helical structure within the TM domain of C55. These structural changes were associated with a shift of the C55 dimer to the monomer and an increase in the tilt of the TM helix relative to the membrane normal in the T43I mutant compared with that of WT C55. The A21G (Flemish) mutation was previously found to increase secreted Aβ40 levels; here, we combined this mutation in the extracellular domain of C99 with T43I and observed that the T43I/A21G double mutant decreases Aβ40 formation.

They found a correlation between the dissociation constant for the TM peptide dimer and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio observed in AD patients, suggesting that processing of the APP monomer results in an increase in Aβ42. More recent studies indicated that mutations in the four-residue stretch from Thr43 to Val46 decreased homodimerization and increased the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in the context of the β-CTF (11Yan Y. Xu T.H. Harikumar K.G. Miller L.J. Melcher K. Xu H.E. Dimerization of the transmembrane domain of amyloid precursor protein is determined by residues around the γ- secretase cleavage sites.J. Biol.

However, it is not clear how four sequential residues in the C99 sequence can decrease homodimerization because only two residues at most might lie in the dimer interface. Here, we focus on the Austrian T43I mutation, which is located in the TM cluster of mutations to establish the structural changes that occur upon mutation. Recent NMR studies suggest that the region near the γ-secretase cut site does not form a stable α-helix in the WT protein (23Itkin A. Salnikov E.S. Aisenbrey C. Raya J. Glattard E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Bechinger B.

One possibility is that it is unraveled to facilitate cleavage in the dimer or binding to the γ-secretase complex. It is known that the TM helix must unravel to undergo proteolysis. We propose that in the monomer, backbone hydrogen-bonding interactions favor α-helix formation, which impedes enzyme–substrate interactions, substrate unraveling, and proteolysis. T43I causes the largest increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio within the cluster of TM FAD mutations (14Kumar-Singh S. De Jonghe C. Cruts M. Kleinert R. Wang R. Mercken M. De Strooper B. Vanderstichele H.

This site is roughly midway between the extracellular and intracellular boundaries. On the extracellular side of Thr43, there are several GXXXG motifs that mediate dimerization of the TM domain in membrane bilayers (24Sato T. Tang T.C. Reubins G. Fei J.Z. Fujimoto T.

On the intracellular side of Thr43 is a cluster of β-branched amino acids (Val44, Ile45, and Val46) whose mutation results in early onset AD. To better understand the influence of the T43I mutation on γ-secretase processing, we also combine it in a single construct with the A21G mutation located in the extracellular cluster of FAD mutants. We have previously shown that the A21G mutation lengthens the TM helix, stabilizes the TM dimer, and destabilizes β-sheet structure in the extracellular region of the β-CTF (8Tang T.C. Hu Y.

These structural changes are associated with an increase in the total amount of Aβ peptide released upon γ-secretase cleavage as well as with an increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (8Tang T.C. Hu Y.

By combining an extracellular FAD mutation (A21G) and a TM FAD mutation (T43I), we can probe whether the two clusters of FAD mutations act independently or synergistically in γ-secretase processing. We characterize the influence of the T43I and A21G mutations on the structure of C55, a 55-residue peptide that includes the extracellular and TM regions of C99. We have previously shown that the extracellular and TM structures are similar in C55 and C99 and that differences in the amounts of Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 produced using WT or selected mutant sequences are similar (8Tang T.C. Hu Y. Kienlen-Campard P. El Haylani L. Decock M. Van Hees J. Fu Z. Octave J.N. Constantinescu S.N. Smith S.O. Conformational changes induced by the A21G Flemish mutation in the amyloid precursor protein lead to increased Aβ production.Structure. 2014; 22 (24462250): 387-39610.1016/j.str.2013.12.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The similarity in processing likely stems from the fact that the intracellular domain of C99 is unstructured and removed in the initial Ε-cleavage of C99, yielding a product that is the same as C55 after Ε-cleavage. Structural measurements using solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy are carried out in detergent micelles and in membrane bilayers, respectively. Chemical shift measurements upstream and downstream of the point of mutation provide evidence for global changes in structure, whereas measurements of interhelical dipolar couplings assess the dimerization state of WT C55, the T43I mutant, and the A21G/T43I double mutant of C55. FTIR measurements also provide information on the global secondary structure of these mutants in membrane bilayers. There are two mutations at Thr43 that have been described in the literature, the T43A Iranian (13Pasalar P. Najmabadi H. Noorian A.R. Moghimi B. Jannati A. Soltanzadeh A. Krefft T. Crook R. Hardy J. An Iranian family with Alzheimer's disease caused by a novel APP mutation (Thr714Ala).Neurology. 2002; 58 (12034808): 1574-157510.1212/WNL.58.10.1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and T43I Austrian mutations (14Kumar-Singh S. De Jonghe C. Cruts M. Kleinert R. Wang R. Mercken M. De Strooper B. Vanderstichele H. Löfgren A. Vanderhoeven I. Backhovens H. Vanmechelen E. Kroisel P.M. Van Broeckhoven C. Nonfibrillar diffuse amyloid deposition due to a γ42-secretase site mutation points to an essential role for N-truncated Aβ42 in Alzheimer's disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9 (11063718): 2589-259810.1093/hmg/9.18.2589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These introduce different size side chains at position 43, and both result in early onset AD. To better understand the dependence of amino acid type at position 43 on processing, we analyzed the distribution of secreted Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 produced by the expression and processing of WT C99 and a series of Thr43 mutants in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures, which are widely used as they generally produce more Aβ peptides through γ-secretase processing than primary neurons. The mutants within the TM of C99 selected for study comprise substitutions of Thr to hydrophobic or weakly polar amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The amino acid substitutions chosen are conservative and transfected DNA constructs express at comparable levels in CHO cells. The observed FAD mutations in cluster 2 tend to all be conservative and involve substitutions with different hydrophobic side chains. This observation suggests that nonconservative mutations prevent C99 processing. The overall production of Aβ peptides is generally decreased by substitution of Thr43. The familial AD Thr43 mutations, T43I and T43A, exhibit decreased total Aβ production (i.e. Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42) by ∼65 and 45%, respectively. Mutation of T43I and T43V dramatically decreases the level of Aβ40 and increases Aβ42. The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is highest for T43I. These results are dramatically different from those of the A21G mutant and other sites in the adjacent LVFF sequence in which mutation leads to an increase in total Aβ production (8Tang T.C. Hu Y. Kienlen-Campard P. El Haylani L. Decock M. Van Hees J. Fu Z. Octave J.N. Constantinescu S.N. Smith S.O. Conformational changes induced by the A21G Flemish mutation in the amyloid precursor protein lead to increased Aβ production.Structure. 2014; 22 (24462250): 387-39610.1016/j.str.2013.12.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Tian Y.

Biol. 2010; 17 (20062056): 151-15810.1038/nsmb.1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Serine and valine are perhaps the most similar amino acids to threonine. Both have roughly the same molecular volume as threonine. Serine has a β-hydroxyl group, whereas valine has a β-methyl group. The T43S mutation results in a similar loss of total Aβ production (∼50%), as observed for T43I and T43A, but has almost no effect on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The T43V mutation closely resembles T43I in total production and has the second highest increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Together, these results suggest that loss of the β-hydroxyl group of Thr43 has a crucial influence on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Of the amino acids tested, glycine and phenylalanine are structurally the most different from threonine. Aβ production is blocked by the T43F mutation, which places a large hydrophobic residue at position 43, whereas T43G exhibits a striking increase in Aβ38 relative to Aβ40 and Aβ42. Overall, the changes in γ-secretase processing are not correlated with the size or character of the amino acid at position 43, other than loss of the β-hydroxyl group. The T43F mutant exhibited the lowest amount of soluble Aβ40 of the mutants tested, whereas T43M generated a level of Aβ40 close to WT. It is interesting to note here that phenylalanine substitutions at Val44, Ile45, Val46, Ile47, and Thr48 have very different influences on total Aβ and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (26Bolduc D.M.

One general correlation of the Thr43 mutants is a decrease in the total Aβ produced as observed previously for T43A and T43I (27Xu T.H. Yan Y. Kang Y. Jiang Y. Melcher K. Xu H.E. Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations increase amyloid precursor protein resistance to γ-secretase cleavage and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio.Cell Discov. 2016; 2 (27625790): 1602610.1038/celldisc.2016.26Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A large decrease in Aβ40 secretion is the primary cause of an increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio for the T43I mutation. C55 is the minimal sequence containing the entire extracellular and TM domains of C99 needed for γ-secretase processing (8Tang T.C. Hu Y. Kienlen-Campard P. El Haylani L. Decock M. Van Hees J. Fu Z.

https://openalex.org/W2913052603,"TLRs have been proven to be essential mediators for the early innate immune response. Overactivation of TLR-mediated immune signaling promotes deterioration of cardiovascular diseases; however, the role of TLRs in the heart under physiologic conditions remains neglected. Here, we show that Tlr3 deficiency induced the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of Kv4.2/4.3 proteins and consequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Knockout of Tlr3 resulted in a prolonged QT interval (the space between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave) in mice with no significant signs of inflammation and tissue abnormality in cardiac muscles. Prolongation of action potential duration resulted from the depression of transient outward potassium channel (Ito) currents in Tlr3-deficient ventricular myocytes mirrored the change in QT interval. Mechanistically, we found that Tlr3 was exclusively localized in the ER of cardiomyocytes where it interacted with Kv4.2/4.3 subunits of Ito channel. Thus, our data indicated that TLR3 directly regulates Ito channel protein dynamics to maintain cardiac repolarization, which may implicate a new molecular surveillance system for cardiac electrophysiological homeostasis.-Gao, X., Gao, S., Guan, Y., Huang, L., Huang, J., Lin, L., Liu, Y., Zhao, H., Huang, B., Yuan, T., Liu, Y., Liang, D., Zhang, Y., Ma, X., Li, L., Li, J., Zhou, D., Shi, D., Xu, L., Chen, Y.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2914139191,"The 30-amino acid peptide Y-P30 corresponds to the N-terminus of the primate-specific, sweat gland-derived dermcidin prepropeptide. Previous work has revealed that Y-P30 enhances the interaction of pleiotrophin and syndecans-2/3, and thus represents a natural ligand to study this signaling pathway. In immature neurons, Y-P30 activates the c-Src and p42/44 ERK kinase pathway, increases the amount of F-actin in axonal growth cones, and promotes neuronal survival, cell migration and axonal elongation. The action of Y-P30 on axonal growth requires syndecan-3 and heparan sulfate side chains. Whether Y-P30 has the potential to influence dendrites and dendritic protrusions has not been explored. The latter is suggested by the observations that syndecan-2 expression increases during postnatal development, that syndecan-2 becomes enriched in dendritic spines, and that overexpression of syndecan-2 in immature neurons results in a premature morphological maturation of dendritic spines. Here, analysing rat cortical pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons in organotypic cultures, we show that Y-P30 does not alter the development of the dendritic arborization patterns. However, Y-P30 treatment decreases the density of apical, but not basal dendritic protrusions at the expense of the filopodia. Analysis of spine morphology revealed an unchanged mushroom/stubby-to-thin spine ratio and a shortening of the longest decile of dendritic protrusions. Whole-cell recordings from cortical principal neurons in dissociated cultures grown in the presence of Y-P30 demonstrated a decrease in the frequency of glutamatergic mEPSCs. Despite these differences in protrusion morphology and synaptic transmission, the latter likely attributable to presynaptic effects, calcium event rate and amplitude recorded in pyramidal neurons in organotypic cultures were not altered by Y-P30 treatment. Together, our data suggest that Y-P30 has the capacity to decelerate spinogenesis and to promote morphological, but not synaptic, maturation of dendritic protrusions."

However, the nature of care coordination and collaboration between caregivers (providers) may also be important in determining patient outcomes. Using data from patients admitted to intensive care units at a large tertiary care hospital, we modeled the caregivers that provided medical service to a specific patient as patient-centric subnetwork embedded within larger caregiver networks of the institute. The caregiver networks were composed of caregivers who treated either a cohort of patients with particular disease or any patient regardless of disease. Our model can generate patient-specific caregiver network features at multiple levels, and we demonstrate that these multilevel network features, in addition to patient-level features, are significant predictors of length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality."
