https://openalex.org/W2048104258,"An understanding of interstellar shock waves is crucial in determining the structure of the interstellar medium. By causing the gas to radiate, interstellar shocks provide astronomers with valuable diagnostics on both the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and the energy source that produced the shock. The complexity of the interstellar plasma-its degree of ionization, its molecular content, the presence of small dust grains and cosmic rays, and the magnetic field-leads to a rich variety of structures for interstellar shocks, which are being actively investigated both observationally and theoretically."
https://openalex.org/W2149872312,"Degenerate bodies composed primarily of dense hydrogen and helium plasmas range from giant planets to the so far hypothetical brown dwarfs. More massive objects begin their lives as nondegenerate stars and may end as white dwarfs, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen, or as neutron stars, with solid crusts of iron or heavier elements and cores of neutron matter. The physical properties of dense plasmas that are necessary to construct theoretical models of such degenerate stars include the equation of state, transport properties, and nuclear reaction rates."
https://openalex.org/W1974834131,"A laser method based upon carbon ion implantation and pulsed laser melting of copper has been used to produce continuous diamond thin film. Carbon ions were implanted with ion energies in the range of 60 to 120 keV, and doses of 1.0 × 1018 to 2.0 × 1018 ions cm-2. The ion-implanted specimens were treated with nanosecond excimer laser pulses with the following parameters: energy density, 3.0 to 5.0 J cm-2; wavelength, 0.308 μm; pulse width, 45 nanoseconds. The specimens were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering/ion channeling, Auger, and Raman spectroscopy. The macroscopic Raman spectra contained a strong peak at 1332 cm-1 with full width at half maximum of 5 cm-1, which is very close to the quality of the spectra obtained from single-crystal diamond. The selected area electron diffraction patterns and imaging confirmed the films to be defect-free single crystal over large areas of up to several square micrometers with no grain boundaries. Low voltage SEM imaging of surface features indicated the film to be continuous with presence of growth steps."
https://openalex.org/W1989096702,"Molecular dynamics simulations of tethered membranes indicate that an attraction between the monomers leads to a well-defined sequence of folding transitions with decreasing temperature. With insights gained from Landau theory and simulations of bimembranes, the folding transitions are found to be intimately linked to the unbinding of membranes. Finite-size effects, mainly due to the loss of entropy from edge fluctuations, play an important role in hindering folding transitions."

https://openalex.org/W1997189855,"There are two states of the solar wind: quasi-stationary and transient. After 30 years of measurements by interplanetary spacecraft, the differences in the physical properties of the two types of wind are fairly well determined, but the physical processes involved in their accelerations are not yet understood in detail. The solar wind exists in part because the upper solar atmosphere, called the corona, is very hot, but the heating mechanisms are also not well understood. Recent research suggests a link between the heating and acceleration mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2065525608,"Before direct exploration by spacecraft, Jupiter was the only planet other than Earth that was known to have a magnetic field, as revealed by its nonthermal radio emissions. The term ""magnetosphere"" did not exist because there was no clear concept of such an entity. The space age provided the opportunity to explore Earth's neighborhood in space and to send instruments to seven of the other eight planets. It was found that interplanetary space is pervaded by a supersonic ""solar wind"" plasma and that six planets, including Earth, have magnetic fields of sufficient strength to deflect this solar wind and form a comet-shaped cavity called a magnetosphere. Comparative study of these magnetospheres aims to elucidate both the general principles and characteristics that they share in common, and the specific environmental factors that cause the important, and sometimes dramatic, differences in behavior between any two of them. A general understanding of planetary magnetospheres holds the promise of wide applicability in astrophysics, which, for the indefinite future, must rely solely on remote sensing for experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W4240471539,"Astrophysical jets are linear structures associated with stars and galaxies which span about seven orders of magnitude in size; the largest jets emanating from galaxies are about 100 times the size of our galaxy and are the largest single objects in the universe. Jets associated with stars are composed of ionized gas moving away from the star with velocities of a few hundred kilometers per second. Extragalactic jets are composed of relativistic particles, magnetic field, and probably additional amounts of cooler ionized plasma either originally ejected in the jet or entired by it out of the surrounding gaseous medium. The initial outflow velocity for extragalactic jets may be relativistic, and average outflow speeds of several thousand kilometers per second are likely. The energy flux carried by extragalactic jets may be in excess of 10(46) ergs per second, depending upon the nature of the jet. A definition of jet properties, deduced from their interaction with the ambient medium, can place essential constraints on models for the central power source in the parent galaxy or quasi-stellar object where they originate."
https://openalex.org/W2084400638,"Two-dimensional cell-like membranes acted on by osmotic pressure differentials are represented by closed, unrestricted random walks. The treatment omits excluded-volume effects, and the pressure that is imposed thus favors an oriented area, so that the shriveled configuration of a vesicle with excess external pressure is inaccessible in this model. Nevertheless, the approach has the decided advantage of yielding analytic expressions in a complete statistical analysis. Results are presented for the average square of the radius of gyration, the asphericity, and the probability distribution of the principal components of the radius of gyration tensor. The analysis is done in both the constant-pressure and constant-area ensembles."

https://openalex.org/W2037823535,We are beset with slogans for complex and controversial public issues that represent significant bodies of scientific knowledge. Public debate and action on these issues rarely adequately reflect such knowledge and seldom feature scientists playing central roles. Examples are assessment of educational effectiveness through assessment of student learning outcomes and the setting of scientific priorities across the full spectrum of scientific disciplines. It is an unfulfilled civic duty of scientists and engineers to engage themselves more fully and actively in public debate and action on important issues.
