This observation appears to demand for its interpretation the existence of two sorts of meson, the source of the observed kinetic energy of the secondary-residing in the mass difference between the two. In view of the importance of this conclusion, we have tried to consider all reasonably imaginable processes to explain the observations without introducing a new elementary particle; processes, that is, in which the energy is derived from the material of the photographic emulsion instead of from the meson. Reasons are given below for the confident rejection of all such processes."

https://openalex.org/W2015067843,"The large, hæmoglobin-bearing larvæ of the genus Chironomus, commonly known as bloodworms, are the most abundant and widespread members of the bottom mud communities in ponds and lakes, but owing to the obscurity of the medium in which they live little is known about their behaviour. The larvae live in U-shaped tubes through which an intermittent irrigation current is maintained1, and are stated to feed on the organic mud around them, eating part of the walls of their burrows or feeding off the surface of the mud2. Alsterberg3, however, considered them to be largely plankton feeders, eating algae brought in by the irrigation current and trapped by the tube walls or the spines of the anterior proleg. But details of their feeding mechanism or respiratory behaviour are unknown. Accordingly, I have watched the behaviour of larvæ of Chironomus plumosus L. under various conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2036879282,"The method of nuclear paramagnetic resonance absorption1 has been used to study the interaction of nuclei in solids, liquids, and gases with their environment. The two important quantities are the relaxation time T1, describing the energy transfer from the nuclear spin system to the whole of the sample, representing the heat reservoir, and the interaction among the nuclei alone, which can be described by a spin-spin relaxation time T2. From the theory of Waller2 one can predict the relaxation time T1 caused by interaction of the nuclei with the lattice vibrations. The time obtained is at least 104 times larger than the experimental values3″4′5."

https://openalex.org/W1996129733,"IN connexion with an investigation on the photoperiodic effect in Sesamum orientale L. (I.P. 7 and I.P. 29) in relation to the variations of the environmental factors of the four seasons: winter (sown on January 1), summer (sown on April 1), monsoon (sown on July 4) and autumn (sown on October 1), it was found that the leaf-forms in both the varieties were extremely variable. The lower leaves are generally ovate lanceolate, and with the onset of flower buds linear lanceolate leaves were produced in addition to a large number of leaves of different shapes with serration and various degrees of split margins depending upon the sowing time and different photoperiods. The variation of leaves was a prominent feature in plants growing in long photoperiods (14 hr.), but was not observed in plants growing in short photoperiods (10 hr.). The control plants of the monsoon sowing exposed to the long photo-periods of Nature (13 hr. 9 min. to 11 hr. 55 min.) also showed clear variations."

However, all observations agree that the true blood sugar accounts for only a fraction, usually considerably less than 30 per cent, of the total reducing value. On the grounds that this fraction is yeast fermentable, and that in a few cases a glucosazone has been obtained, this sugar has been considered as glucose2–."
https://openalex.org/W2083306967,"Previous work from this laboratory has shown that the anticholinesterase group of drugs acts on the central nervous system in cats and man; eserine and the related tertiary compounds are central excitants, prostigmine and the related quaternary compounds are central depressants. Diisopropylfluorophosphonate has an entirely different type of chemical constitution from the hitherto described anti-cholinesterases, and in vitro is a more potent inhibitor of cholinesterase than eserine. It was thought of interest to examine its action on the central nervous system; it proved to be a central excitant like eserine sulphate, but larger doses were required to produce similar effects."

The following simple technique differs from their methods, and has been used with success at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture for work on the cacao thrips, Selenothrips rubrocinctus (Giard). Several other thrips, such as Dinurothrips hookeri Hood, Hercothrips insularis Hood and Heliothrips hœmorrhoidalis (Bouché), have also been reared by this method for life-history studies."

https://openalex.org/W2012522449,"The occurrence in mammalian testes and aqueous extracts of spermatozoa of a substance causing increased spread of fluids injected intradermally was described by Hoffman and Duran-Reynals1, and McClean2. These observations have since been confirmed by numerous workers3, and the ‘spreading factor’ has been shown to be identical with the enzyme hyaluronidase first described by Meyer, Dubos and Smythe4. The work of McClean and Rowlands5, Fekete and Duran-Reynals6, and others has indicated the probable role of seminal hyaluronidase in the fertilization process, namely, solution of the gel cementing the follicle cells around freshly ovulated ova, thereby denuding the latter and so enabling spermatozoa to penetrate them. In human semen, a close correlation has been shown to exist between sperm density and hyaluronidase content, azoo-spermic semen being devoid of the enzyme7,8,9. It has also been shown that a similar relationship holds in the case of the bull, rabbit and boar, though not in the dog or fowl9; in the dog, the hyaluronidase content of semen was found to be small and seemed to vary independently of the sperm density, while in the fowl it was absent altogether from six out of ten samples tested and appeared to be present in the remainder in trivial amounts only."
https://openalex.org/W2046913952,"During whaling operations in the Antarctic, opportunity arose to carry out an ascorbic acid estimation on a fairly fresh sample of whale milk. The sample, about 200 c.c., was drawn from the main duct of one of the mammary glands of a lactating fin whale (Balœonoptera physalus) which had been dead not more than six hours. Fresh whales are not common on a factory, and lactating whales are protected, so that the occurrence of a fairly fresh lactating whale is comparatively rare."

In view of these observations, it surprised us to find that ‘Paludrine’ inhibited the oxidation of glucose, pyruvate and lactate by washed chick red cells parasitized with P. gallinaceum more powerfully than did quinine (Table 1)."

It does not seem possible to make the interaction between electrons and nucleons resulting from Fermi's theory of β-decay responsible for the observed processes, since this interaction gives rise to cross-sections of 10−40 cm.2 only4 and the cross-sections estimated by Collins and collaborators are of the order of 10−32 to 10−33 cm.2."

O.) secured, for purposes of determination, a fragment of a brown calculus of rather unusual origin which is preserved in the Kenya Game Department. Captain A. T. A. Bitchie, chief game warden, said that according to report this ‘stone’ was found in a hippopotamus killed on the Tana River some years ago. It was cut out of the animal by a native skinner, whose employer had passed it to Captain Bitchie. The location of the calculus in the animal was not recorded."

https://openalex.org/W1978467552,"While fighting was still going on in the Pannonian plains north-west of Beograd in 1944, a small group of young medical men and medical students (most of them in uniform) was busy collecting material left behind by the Germans, destined to become the nucleus of the present Laboratory for Experimental Biology and Medicine at Novi Sad, Yugoslavia. In due course they called on me to tell me that they wanted a laboratory for biomedical research. A site for the laboratory was yet to be found. Eventually, a deserted villa on the outskirts of the town was selected; but it was in an appalling condition, and many months of work were necessary to make it suitable for our purpose."
https://openalex.org/W1984558948,"The surface tension of an aqueous solution has long been recognized as one of the more important physical properties controlling its wetting and detergent powers, though early attempts to correlate these powers with equilibrium surface tension met o with limited success. It is becoming generally appreciated that factors other than solute concentration influence surface tension, and that the condition of the surface must also be taken into account. Thus, the surface age involved in many detergent processes does not exceed a few seconds, and much of this time may be required for the establishment of diffusion equilibrium. For dilute solutions of longchain compounds the operative dynamic tension may vary over a range of 40 dynes/cm. and acknowledgment of the time required for surface equilibrium is clearly essential. A further factor, the change in equilibrium surface tension which occurs during change in area of a soluble film, has not previously been considered, but may prove to have considerable significance."

https://openalex.org/W2011028417,"Analysis of the sales of surplus calves to Ministry of Food collecting centres in West Wales during the four years 1943–46 reveals the interesting fact that there is a fall in the percentages sold during the autumn months (September–December) from coastal to inland centres and from centres in the west to those in the east. Autumn deliveries to the milk depots in the region show the same trends: thus factory F in the west received during the month of December (average of the four years 1943–46) 94·6 per cent of its September deliveries, whereas factories C, D and G in the eastern areas received only 53·9, 52·7 and 52·1 per cent respectively. There is therefore considerable evidence that the coastal areas, and particularly West Pembrokeshire, have a higher incidence of autumn calvings."

https://openalex.org/W1967585135,"The insect Cicadella viridis has two symbiotic bacteria, one producing a green pigment, the other B. carotene. The red bacterium is a diagenete1, or dysgonic commensal, of the other partner. However, a pure culture has been grown on media with liver extracts. It thus appeared that if the organism is dependent upon a metabolite present in liver extracts, its quantity present in the latter can be judged by the growth of this organism. For this purpose a basal medium was prepared with the following composition: glucose 2 per cent; peptone 1 per cent; citric acid 0.2 per cent; alkaline sodium phosphate 0.4 per cent; sodium chloride 0.2 per cent; magnesium sulphate 0.1 per cent. Only upon the addition of liver extracts would the bacterium grow. Growth was apparent after 72 hours and was suitable for comparison after seven days."
https://openalex.org/W1988606270,"LARGELY as a result of the War, there is now wider recognition of the possibilities of science and the powers of the trained man of science. This is reflected in the growing interest of contemporary literature in scientific affairs and in the frequency with which the opinion of scientific workers is sought on major matters of State. This improved status of science can only be maintained if men of science adopt a greater sense of responsibility; for the searchlight which is focused on them will necessarily expose their limitations as well as their strength. It is fitting, therefore, that at this time men of science should subject themselves to a searching inquiry of their training and qualifications. No place could be more appropriate as a forum for such a discussion than a meeting of the British Association, where all branches of science are represented and where so many sections of the scientific community assemble. At the recent meeting at Dundee a general discussion, supported by all the sections, took place on “The Education of the Man of Science” and attracted a large and representative audience."

In this respect, the valuable report on expenditure on research and development which has recently come from the Select Committee on Estimates for the Session 1946–47* is exceptional. This important report reviews the total estimated expenditure for 1947–48 in Government research and development, amounting to more than £69 millions. It does not consider the technical problems involved in the detailed planning and conduct of this work. The Committee is concerned rather to inquire whether in drawing up the programme the Government has provided itself with the best scientific advice available in the country, and has secured that this advice can be brought to bear on the formulation and execution of Government policy; whether the administrative organisation has been so planned as to secure the right relationship between the scientific worker and the executive and to obtain the most fruitful results from the money spent; and, above all, whether the scope and balance of the programme is such as will direct the application of scientific knowledge and effort into those fields where it is most likely to yield returns of permanent value to the nation and in such a way as will make the most efficient use of the limited resources of both money and man-power."

This led, in 1943, to the Director of the British Standards Institution going to New York with the object of setting up machinery for co-ordinating the standards of the United Nations as an aid to the war effort and to discuss the formation of a temporary organisation which could act until such time as full international discussions were re-opened."

It is therefore peculiarly appropriate that the British Council should sponsor the publication of an excellent and comprehensive series of articles reviewing the whole field of chemical carcinogenesis*. There are papers by twenty authors from eleven different research centres, representing the main fields of cancer research activity in the United Kingdom. This symposium ranks in importance with, and supplements, the symposium on cancer research published in 1945 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (see Nature, 158, 217; 1946). The planning of the British Council's publication was carried out with the advice of Prof. Alexander Haddow, who has himself contributed three interesting articles, one of them in collaboration with Prof. G. A. R. Kon. “Its intention is not merely to provide a conspectus of our present knowledge, but to indicate also the probable trends of development for the years ahead.”"

In particular, it is still undecided whether or not the capillaries exhibit independent contractility and, if so, whether this is due to the presence of special perivascular contractile cells. Hitherto the capillary bed has been regarded as a network of capillaries of uniform structure fed by arterioles and drained by venules. Recent work, however, particularly by R. Chambers and B. W. Zweifach, has shown that the capillary bed comprises several different types of vessels which can now be separately defined, and each of which plays a particular part in the total functional organisation of the capillary bed."
