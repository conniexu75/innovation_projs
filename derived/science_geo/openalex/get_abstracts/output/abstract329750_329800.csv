https://openalex.org/W2003100455,"The C(13)/C(12) ratio in the carbonate minerals of Orgueil, a carbonaceous chondrite, is 6 percent greater than the ratio in any known terrestrial carbon. The effect may be produced by a chemical isotope fractionation involving processes not common on earth, or it may be the result of incomplete homogenization of substances with different histories of nucleosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1965064006,"The presence of cholesterol in Solanum tuberosum and Dioscorea spiculiflora plants was demonstrated by gas-liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, isolation and mixed melting point, and purification to constant radioactivity after dilution with authentic cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2049464477,"A strategy for waste disposal is proposed in which the repository would be situated in a crystalline rock mass beneath a blanket of sedimentary rocks whose ground-water flow characteristics are well understood. Such an approach exemplifies the concept of multiple barriers to the isolation of radioactive wastes from the biosphere. This strategy has the advantages that (i) ground-water flow within the sedimentary rocks can be investigated and modeled by conventional, well-under-stood theory and technology; (ii) under favorable circumstances, the flow system operates as an active barrier, so that a long migration path and extremely low flow rate to the biosphere can be assured; and (iii) since, in many locations, ground water is nonpotable, the possibility of future human intrusion can be minimized."
https://openalex.org/W2086312738,"If rats are exposed successively to white noise, then to recorded rat squeals, or alternatively to squeals first and then white noise, and if, in both situations, they are allowed to shut off the auditory stimulation by applying pressure on a bar, they will touch the bar more frequently when exposed to white noise. The results indicate that the bar-pressing behavior is the expression of increased activity resulting from the increased stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2051568046,Pollen tetrads in Typha latifolia result from the fusion of the outermost portion of the exine (the tectum) where microspores within the meiotic tetrad are contiguous. Exine stratification is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2057806710,"Marihuana was analyzed for its major constituents, cannabidiolic acid, cannabidiol, tetrahydrocanabinol, and cannabinol, by treating the petroleum ether extract with diazomethane. The methyl esters so produced, together with the unchanged components, were subjected to gas chromatography on a polar silicone column."
https://openalex.org/W1983147986,"The F(19) spectrum of XeF(4) dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride has been observed at two frequencies, yielding a F(19) chemical shift of 175 parts per million to lower field than the solvent and a Xe(129)-F(19) spin-spin coupling constant, confirmed by double irradiation, of 3860 cycles per second. Absence of fast F(19) chemical exchange and collapse of the Xe(131)-F(19) coupling by quadrupole relaxation may be inferred from the spectrum."

 [ Science 140, 207 (12 Apr. 1963)] is scheduled for 23-24 May 1964."
https://openalex.org/W2064953342,"Calorimetric measurements of the heat of reaction of xenon tetrafluoride with aqueous iodide solution give -60 kilocalories per mole for the standard heat of formation, or an average thermochemical bond energy of about 31 kilocalories."
https://openalex.org/W2090303581,"A skeletal fuzz that consists mostly of open space probably covers the moon to a depth of several millimeters or centimeters. The solid part of the fuzz probably consists of randomly oriented linear units, with or without enlarged nodes, which either anastomose in a mesh or are branching."

https://openalex.org/W1989626480,An unknown compound isolated chromatographically from extracts of rhizome tissues of quackgrass which had previously been treated with dalapon resembled phenol. The compound reduced silver nitrate and had an ultraviolet absorption maximum similar to that of phenol and a positive reaction to the LeRosen test. Melting points and infrared absorption maxima for phenylurethane and alpha-naphthylurethane derivatives of the unknown matched those for the same phenol derivatives.
https://openalex.org/W2039090199,"Soils of the Eocene chalk often show interstratification in their clay fractions, though discrete 14- and 18-Å spacings are the rule rather than the exception. It is also frequent that a 16-Å intermediate shows in place of these diffraction maxima. This intermediate is indicative of complex interstratification. It is a unique feature of this body of soils and a strong indication that existing data on random and regular interstratification are both correct and diagnostic. The rare but interesting diffuse basal spacings which are observed at 22 Å are another unusual feature of the clays of this group of soils."
