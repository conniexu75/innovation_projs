https://openalex.org/W1939705865,"Targeted recombinant aequorins represent to date the most specific means of monitoring [Ca2+] in subcellular organelles (Rizzuto, R., Simpson, A. W. M., Brini, M., and Pozzan, T. (1992) Nature 358, 325-328; Brini, M., [Medline] Murgia, M., Pasti, L., Picard, D., Pozzan, T., and Rizzuto, R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 4813-4819; Kendall, J. M., Dormer, R. L., and Campbell, A. K. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 189, 1008-1016). Up until now, however, only limited attention has been paid to the use of recombinant photoproteins for measuring, in mammalian cells, the [Ca2+] in the cytoplasm, a compartment for which effective Ca2+probes are already available. Here we describe this approach in detail, highlighting the advantages, under various experimental conditions, of using recombinant cytosolic aequorin (cytAEQ) instead of classical fluorescent indicators. We demonstrate that cytAEQ is expressed recombinantly at high levels in transiently transfected cell lines and primary cultures as well as in stably transfected clones, and we describe a simple algorithm for converting aequorin luminescence data into [Ca2+] values. We show that although fluorescent indicators at the usual intracellular concentrations (50-100 μM) are associated with a significant buffering of the [Ca2+]ctransients, this problem is negligible with recombinantly expressed aequorin. The large dynamic range of the photoprotein also allows an accurate estimate of the large [Ca2+]cincreases that are observed in some cell types such as neurons. Finally, cytAEQ appears to be an invaluable tool for measuring [Ca2+]cin cotransfection experiments. In particular, we show that when cotransfected with an α1-adrenergic receptor (coupled to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation), cytAEQ faithfully monitors the subpopulation of cells expressing the receptor, whereas the signal of fura-2, at the population level, is dominated largely by that of the untransfected cells. Targeted recombinant aequorins represent to date the most specific means of monitoring [Ca2+] in subcellular organelles (Rizzuto, R., Simpson, A. W. M., Brini, M., and Pozzan, T. (1992) Nature 358, 325-328; Brini, M., [Medline] Murgia, M., Pasti, L., Picard, D., Pozzan, T., and Rizzuto, R. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 4813-4819; Kendall, J. M., Dormer, R. L., and Campbell, A. K.

Apoaequorin is a 21-kDa photoprotein that is linked covalently to a hydrophobic prosthetic group, coelenterazine. Upon Ca2+binding, aequorin undergoes an irreversible reaction, with production of light in the visible range. The fractional rate of aequorin consumption is proportional, in the physiological pCa range, to [Ca2+]. Because of this relationship, the purified photoprotein, microinjected in living cells, has been employed for more than 3 decades as a Ca2+indicator (4Ridgway E.R. Ashley C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Ridgway E.B. Gilkey J.C. Jaffe L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1980; 285: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The need for microinjection or other traumatic means of cell loading has limited the use of this indicator to large and robust cells. Thus, in the last decade, aequorin has been substituted largely by fluorescent Ca2+indicators, such as quin2, fura-2, indo1, etc., which can be loaded easily in virtually all cell types via their intracellularly trappable esters (8Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Nature. 1982; 295: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 9Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, however, the cloning of the aequorin cDNA (10Prasher D. McCann R.O. Cormier M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Inouye S. Noguchi M. Sakaki Y. Takagi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Miyata T. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3154-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) has expanded the possible uses of this Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein. First, the possibility of expressing the transfected gene recombinantly has eliminated the need for traumatic loading procedures, by allowing the endogenous production of the photoprotein in cell systems as diverse as bacteria (12Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), yeasts (13Nakajima-Shimada J. Iida H. Tsuji F.I. Anraku Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), plants (15Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), and mammalian cells (16Button D. Brownstein M. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Sheu Y.-A. Kricka L.J. Pritchett D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, the aequorin cDNA can be engineered to include defined targeting signals, thus determining the specific localization of the Ca2+probe inside the cell (1Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 2Brini M. Murgia M. Pasti L. Picard D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R.

Recombinant apoaequorin can be reconstituted into active photoprotein by simply adding the coenzyme to the incubation medium; aequorin light emission then allows the monitoring of the [Ca2+] in the compartment to which the photoprotein is confined. For subcellular organelles, the possibility of specific targeting confers to recombinant aequorin a clear advantage over the alternative methods presently available (e.g. fluorescent dyes). Similarly, in various cell types (12Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Nakajima-Shimada J. Iida H.

Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), the difficulty in loading fluorescent indicators has made recombinant aequorin the method of choice for monitoring [Ca2+]c.1 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]cytosolic calcium concentrationPCRpolymerase chain reactioncytAEQcytosolic aequorinPBSphosphate-buffered salineHEDTAN-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid. On the contrary, in mammalian cells the possible advantages of recombinantly expressed aequorin, first reported by Button and Brownstein (16Button D. Brownstein M. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and Sheu et al. (17Sheu Y.-A. Kricka L.J. Pritchett D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), are not obvious. Only a direct comparison between the available Ca2+probes may highlight the conditions in which recombinant aequorin can complement, or substitute, the other techniques. To this end, we report here the development of a new cDNA construct that encodes an epitope-tagged aequorin molecule (which can be easily immunolocalized with specific antibodies); the encoded polypeptide is located in the cytosol and allows the monitoring of [Ca2+]cin transiently and stably transfected cells. We also provide a comprehensive picture of the methodology (and of the procedure for calibrating the luminescence data into [Ca2+]cvalues) and a direct comparison between the data obtained, in the same cells, with recombinant aequorin and fura-2. cytosolic calcium concentration polymerase chain reaction cytosolic aequorin phosphate-buffered saline N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid. To include a strong immunological epitope, the coding region of the aequorin cDNA (11Inouye S. Noguchi M. Sakaki Y. Takagi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Miyata T. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3154-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using specifically modified oligonucleotide primers. In particular, the upstream primer included a start codon, a HindIII site, and the nucleotides encoding the nine amino acids of the HA1 hemagglutinin epitope (23Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) and amino acids 2-9 of aequorin. The reverse primer corresponded to a sequence located in the 3′-noncoding region (spanning the authentic EcoRI site of the aequorin cDNA). The PCR product was inserted in the SmaI site of pBS+ (Stratagene) and controlled by DNA sequencing; the whole coding sequence was then excised by double digestion with PstI (a flanking vector site) and EcoRI and subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vectors pMT2 (24Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and pcDNAI (InVitrogen). The recombinant vectors allow the expression of a simply modified aequorin molecule that includes only the epitope in front of the photoprotein (cytAEQ). A silent mutation was introduced in the native HindIII site of the aequorin cDNA, so by digesting the PCR product with HindIII and EcoRI, a fragment can be released which encodes the HA1 epitope and aequorin; this cDNA was also employed for the construction of specifically targeted epitope-tagged aequorins.2 2R.

Noguchi M. Sakaki Y. Takagi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Miyata T. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3154-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and PCR-modified (cytAEQ) aequorin cDNAs. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 75-cm2Falcon flasks. For the transient expression of cytAEQ, the cells were plated onto 13-mm diameter round coverslips, and transfection with 4 μg/well of plasmid DNA was carried out as described (25Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Aequorin measurements were carried out 36 h after transfection, as described (19Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 21Rizzuto R. Brini M. Bastianutto C. Marsault R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa clones stably expressing cytAEQ were generated by cotransfecting the cytAEQ expression vector with the pSV2neo plasmid (26Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) and selecting G418-resistant clones, as described (19Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of rat embryonic cortex neurons were obtained as reported previously (27Villalba M. Martinez-Serrano A. Gomez-Puertas P. Blanco P. Borner C. Villa A. Casado M. Gimenez C. Pereira R. Bogonez E. Pozzan T. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2468-2476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the cells were transfected with cytAEQ on the 4th day of culture, and aequorin measurements were performed as described above. Transfected aequorin was reconstituted by incubating the cells for 2 h with 5 μM coelenterazine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 1% fetal calf serum, at 37°C in 5% CO2atmosphere and aequorin light emission were measured in a purpose-built luminometer (19Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 21Rizzuto R. Brini M. Bastianutto C. Marsault R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cobbold P.H. Lee J.A.C. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U. K.1991: 55-81Google Scholar). The calibration curve of cytAEQ was determined in vitro by exposing cell lysates of cytAEQ-expressing HeLa cells to solutions with known [Ca2+]. For this purpose, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cytAEQ on a 10-cm Petri dish, as described (25Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); 36 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman into 200 μl of a solution containing 150 mM Tris, 0.8 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM EGTA, pH 7.0, and lysed through three cycles of freeze-thawing. After centrifuging for 5 min at 4°C at 12,000 rpm (Eppendorf microcentrifuge), the cell pellet was discarded. The supernatant (cell lysate) was utilized for the experiments, after reconstituting apoaequorin with 5 μM coelenterazine for 2-3 h at 4°C, in the presence of 140 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, as described (25Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The various Ca2+buffers were prepared by supplementing a saline solution (130 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, at 22°C) with 5 mM EGTA (or HEDTA for the [Ca2+] higher than 2 μM) and different amounts of total CaCl2. The free Ca2+concentration of each buffer was calculated by a computer program based on the Ca2+affinity constants of EGTA and HEDTA, as described by Fabiato (29Fabiato A. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U. K.1991: 159-176Google Scholar). For [Ca2+] lower than 2 μM, the [Ca2+] of the buffers was also measured with the fluorescent Ca2+indicator fluo-3. In the experiment, 10 μl of the cell lysate was transferred to the sample chamber of the luminometer, light emission recording was started, and 90 μl of the Ca2+buffers was injected in the chamber. After 1 min, 2.5 μl of a 100 mM CaCl2solution was injected, and recording was continued until all aequorin was consumed, i.e. until light emission returned to basal values. The count number of the sample (L) was that measured immediately after the addition of the Ca2+buffer, and the total number of counts (Lmax) was the integral of counts from that moment to the end of the experiment. All experiments were performed at 22°C. Based on the experimental data, the cytAEQ calibration curve was obtained as explained in the text. [Ca2+]cmeasurements with fura-2 were performed on monolayers of HeLa cells as described previously (18Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 19Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). 36 h after transfection, HeLa cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed two or three times with PBS, and then incubated for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 50 mM NH4Cl. Permeabilization of cell membranes was obtained with a 5-min incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by a 30-min wash with 0.2% gelatin (type IV, from calf skin) in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a wet chamber with a 1:400 dilution in PBS of the anti-HA1 monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (kind gift of J. Pouyssegur, Nice, France). The binding of the antibody was revealed with a rhodamin-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. After each antibody incubation, the cells were washed three to five times with PBS. Fluorescence was then analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope and photographed with a Kodak Technical Pan film. The expression of the recombinant protein and its intracellular localization were verified by immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to the HA1 epitope. HeLa cells were transfected with the cytAEQ expression plasmid and immunostained with the antibody 36 h after transfection. Fig. 2 shows the bright-field image of the cell monolayer (Fig. 2 A) and the corresponding fluorescence image (Fig. 2 B). A subset of transiently transfected cells was clearly immunopositive. The percentage of transfected cells was approximately 10-20%, similar to what was observed with other aequorin plasmids (e.g. mitochondrially targeted or nuclear targeted aequorin expression vectors; not shown). The level of expression was quite variable from cell to cell, as evident in Fig. 2, which includes three positive cells, two strongly and one very weakly labeled. The immunolabeling is diffused through the whole cell body, up to the fine processes. In cells expressing a lower level of recombinant aequorin (in the center and on the right), it is apparent that the nuclear region is more weakly stained, suggesting exclusion from the nucleoplasm; in the rest of the cytosol a granularity can be observed, particularly evident in the regions rich in organelles. Confirming that the expressed protein is confined to the cytosol, a complete release of aequorin, with a time course indistinguishable from that of a cytosolic marker, lactic dehydrogenase, was observed upon digitonin permeabilization of the plasma membrane (data not shown and see Ref. 2). To estimate the concentration of the recombinant protein expressed by the cells, and thus its Ca2+-buffering capacity (see below), we measured the aequorin light output after lysing a coverslip of cells with a Ca2+-rich hypotonic solution and deduced the aequorin content by comparison with the light emission of known amounts of purified photoprotein. The aequorin content was estimated to be about 0.26 ng of aequorin/mg of total protein. Considering that the expressed photoprotein is restricted to the transfected cells, the real content of this subset of cells can be considered to be about 1-2 ng/mg of protein, corresponding to a cytosolic concentration of ≈10−7M. To transform luminescence values into [Ca2+] values we have used the method described by Allen and Blinks (6Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Nature. 1978; 273: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which relies on the relationship between [Ca2+] and the ratio between the light intensity recorded in physiological conditions (L, counts/s) and that which would have been recorded if all of the aequorin in the cell had been suddenly exposed to a saturating [Ca2+] (Lmax). Given that the rate constant of aequorin consumption at saturating [Ca2+] is 1.0 s−1(6Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Nature. 1978; 273: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), a good estimate of Lmax can be obtained from the total aequorin light output recorded from the cells after discharging all of the aequorin. This usually requires the addition of excess Ca2+and detergents, or other permeabilization procedures (see below), at the end of the experiment. As aequorin is being consumed continuously, the value of Lmax is not constant and decreases steadily during the experiment. The value of Lmax to be used for [Ca2+] calculations at every point along the experiment should be calculated as the total light output of the whole experiment minus the light output recorded before that point. The relationship between the ratio (L/ Lmax) and [Ca2+] has been modeled mathematically (30Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1971; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The model preferred by the authors (model B) postulates that each of the Ca2+binding sites has two possible states, T and R, and light is emitted when all of the sites are in the R state. Ca2+is assumed to bind only to the R state and therefore shifts the equilibrium in favor of the R states. This model contains three parameters: KR, the Ca2+association constant; KTR= [T]/[R]; and n, the number of Ca2+binding sites. Experimental data obtained with native aequorin solutions in 150 mM KCl, pH 7.0, and 22°C were perfectly fitted using values of KR= 7 · 106M−1, KTR= 118, n = 3 (30Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1971; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Given that these values were obtained with native aequorin (a mixture of several protein isoforms bound to natural coelenterazine), while cytAEQ represents a single isoform, modified at the amino terminus and reconstituted with a chemically synthesized coelenterazine, we thought it necessary to determine the KR, KTR, and n values from the recombinantly expressed recombinant photoprotein. Fig. 3 shows a calibration of the cytAEQ luminescence/[Ca2+] relationship. Experimental data were obtained by mixing a solution containing cytAEQ with solutions containing different [Ca2+], prepared to give defined pCa values in the final solution. Then, both the count number obtained immediately after the mixing and the total number of counts in the sample were measured to obtain L/Lmax ratios. These data pairs, final pCa and L/Lmax ratios, plotted in Fig. 3, were then used to fit a theoretical curve based on the model mentioned above, obtaining the best values for the parameters KR, KTR, and n. Fitting was made by using a computer routine designed to search for the values of these parameters which minimize the sum Σi[pCai(exp) − pCai(theor)]2extended to all of the experimental data, where pCai(theor) are the pCa values calculated from the model (see Equation 1) when using the ratios L/ Lmax corresponding to each experimental pCai(exp) value. The values we obtained in this way (KR= 7.23 · 106M−1, KTR= 120, n = 2.99) for the fitting of the [Ca2+]/(L/Lmax) relationship of recombinant aequorin are very similar to those of Allen and co-workers (30Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1971; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, and no matter if the model is correct at the molecular level or not, it can confidently be used to transform luminescence values obtained with recombinant aequorin into [Ca2+] values. A straightforward reordering of the equation for model B reported by Allen et al. (30Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1971; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar) provides the algorithm we use to calculate the [Ca2+] values at each point Ca2+(M)=ratio+(ratio⋅KTR)-1KR-(ratio⋅KR)(Eq. 1) where ratio = (L/Lmax)1/n, and KR, KTRand n are the parameters of the model. These parameters should be obtained as the best fit of the model to a calibration curve performed in conditions as close as possible to the experimental ones, particularly in terms of [Mg2+] and ionic strength (31Moisescu D.G. Ashley C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Blinks J.R. Mattingly P.H. Jewell B.R. van Leewen M. Marrer G.C. Allen D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 57: 292-328Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Regarding the temperature, an increase from 22 to 37°C produces essentially a shift of about 0.15 log[Ca2+] units to the left in the log L/Lmax versus log[Ca2+] plot, apart from some minor effects at very high and at very low [Ca2+] values (32Blinks J.R. Mattingly P.H. Jewell B.R. van Leewen M. Marrer G.C. Allen D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 57: 292-328Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). If this correction is taken into account, a calibration made at 22°C can be used for calculating [Ca2+] values of experiments performed at 37°C. In terms of the parameters of the model, the correction is achieved by multiplying KRby 1.4, leaving untouched the other parameters. Aequorin-based Measurement of [Ca2+]c-For the monitoring of [Ca2+]c, HeLa cells were transfected with cytAEQ; 36 h after transfection, aequorin was reconstituted by adding the prosthetic group to the incubation medium as described under “Materials and Methods.” This simple procedure allowed the reconstitution of aequorin in a large number of cell types, ranging from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum to various mammalian cell lines or primary cultures (data not shown), implying that the diffusion of the prosthetic group across cell membranes does not represent, in the use of cytAEQ, a major problem. After reconstitution, the coverslip with the cells was transferred to the measuring apparatus, and aequorin light output was monitored. Fig. 4 shows the luminescence data, at rest and upon stimulation with two inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists, histamine and ATP, and their calibration into [Ca2+]cvalues. At rest, the light output was close to the background levels (4-8 counts/s versus 2-3). Upon stimulation, a sharp increase could be noticed in aequorin light emission, followed by a slowly declining sustained plateau (Fig. 4 A). At the end of the experiment, unconsumed aequorin was discharged by osmotically lysing the cells with a 10 mM CaCl2solution (19Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). By this means, as soon as the photoprotein is released in the chamber containing high [Ca2+] and/or [Ca2+]cis increased, all photons are emitted and collected by the photomultiplier. Lmax corresponds to the total light output collected during the experiment, subtracted of the background luminescence (i.e. that measured with a coverslip of nontransfected cells loaded with coelenterazine). The absolute values of the luminescence peaks were dramatically different with the two agonists: 12,000 and 2,000 counts/s with histamine and ATP, respectively. However, when the crude luminescence data were converted into [Ca2+]cvalues (Fig. 4 B), the difference appeared much smaller (1.7 and 0.9 μM at the peak with histamine and ATP, respectively). It is thus clearly apparent that, as expected from the nonlinear response curve of aequorin and the progressive consumption of the indicator throughout the experiment, the crude luminescence data largely amplify the differences in [Ca2+]. The presentation of the aequorin light signal can thus be misleading: the aequorin signal must be calibrated not only for providing accurate estimates of the absolute [Ca2+]cvalues but also for obtaining a correct qualitative picture of the [Ca2+]cchanges. To compare directly the [Ca2+]cdata obtained with fura-2 and cytAEQ, HeLa cells were transfected with cytAEQ and loaded with fura-2, and [Ca2+]cwas measured with the two indicators in parallel batches of cells. Unlike the situation of Fig. 4, in the experiment presented in Fig. 5 the cytAEQ signal was recorded from cells also loaded with fura-2. It is apparent that the [Ca2+]cestimates are quite similar with the two probes cytAEQ and fura-2, indicating that the two probes, although different in nature and thus requiring distinct calibration procedures, provide a coherent display of the [Ca2+]cchanges occurring in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. The peak rise, as monitored with cytAEQ, appeared somewhat wider compared with that revealed by fura-2. Probably this minor difference reflects the faster and more homogeneous mixing of the solution in the latter"
https://openalex.org/W1517614087,"We have used immunocytochemical analyses to characterize the subcellular distribution of protein kinase C (PKC)-α, -βI, -βII, -γ, -δ, -e, -ζ, and -η in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts that overexpress these different PKC isozymes. Immunofluorescence studies and Western blotting with antibodies specific for individual isoforms revealed that before activation the majority of the PKCs are not membrane-bound and are diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In addition, a fraction of PKC-δ and -η appears membrane-bound and concentrated in the Golgi apparatus. Activation of each isozyme's kinase activity (with the exception of PKC-ζ) by treatment of these cells with the phorbol ester 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate results in isozyme-specific alterations of cell morphology, as well as in a rapid, selective redistribution of the different PKC isozymes to distinct subcellular structures. Within minutes after 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment, PKC-α and -e concentrate at cell margins. In addition, PKC-α accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, PKC-βII associates with actin-rich microfilaments of the cytoskeleton, PKC-γ accumulates in Golgi organelles, and PKC-e associates with nuclear membranes. Our results demonstrate that each activated PKC isozyme specifically associates with a particular cellular structure, presumably containing the substrate for that isozyme. These findings support the hypothesis that PKC substrate specificity in vivo is mediated, at least in part, by the restricted subcellular locale for each PKC isozyme and its target protein."

They are produced via peroxyl radical isomers which undergo endocylcization and subsequent reduction; isoprostanes of the E and F series have been reported. Given the manner of their formation, it has been proposed that measurement of isoprostanes might offer a quantitative index of free radical generation in vivo. Existing indices of this process are of controversial validity when applied to clinical studies. Consequently, our understanding of the role of free radicals in human disease has been confused (3Stampfer M.J. Hennekens C.H. Manson J.E. Colditz G.A. Rosner B. Willett W.C. N. Engl. J.

These effects are prevented by thromboxane receptor antagonists. We have developed a sensitive and specific assay for this compound and have shown its excretion in human urine to be increased during coronary reperfusion and in chronic cigarette smokers, both settings putatively associated with increased free radical generation (11Lawson J.A.

However, activation of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX), as reflected by increased excretion of thromboxane metabolites, also characterizes these conditions (13Fitzgerald D.J. Catella F. Roy L.

COX-dependent formation of 8-epi PGF2α might confound its usefulness as an analytical target reflective of free radical formation in vivo, particularly in the setting of coincident platelet activation.

Human Subjects The study was scrutinized and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Mater Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. All participants signed an informed consent document prior to participation in the study. The volunteers were Caucasian males, aged 21-49 years. All were nonsmokers and abstained from all medication for at least 14 days prior to participation in the study. No abnormality was revealed on clinical examination or on full blood count, platelet count, or routine biochemical screening. Blood was collected, without stasis, into a plastic syringe, using a 21-gauge needle from an antecubital vein after the subject had been sitting for at least 5 min. Samples were drawn into 3.8% sodium citrate in a ratio of 9:1. The samples were taken between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. at least 12 h after the last meal. Platelets were harvested as described previously (15FitzGerald G.A. Oates J.A. Hawiger J. Maas R.L. Roberts L.J. Brash A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 676-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation of the blood sample at 160 × g for 10 min and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) by centrifugation of PRP at 900 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Washed platelets (WP) were isolated from PRP after centrifugation and resuspended in calcium and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution at pH 7.4, containing 10% autologous PPP. Platelet number was adjusted to 3 × 108platelets/ml with PPP or Hank's balanced salt solution. Platelet aggregation was studied either in PRP or in WP by using a PAP-4 model BIO-DATA aggregometer (BIO-DATA Corporation, Hatboro, PA), at 37°C, in siliconized cuvettes with continuous stirring. Platelet aggregation was performed using threshold concentration (TC) of agonists, defined as the lowest concentration that gave an irreversible aggregation tracing with an amplitude between 65 and 85% of maximal. The role of COX was assessed by preincubating PRP or WP for 5 min at 37°C with aspirin (100 μM; Aspidol, Maggioni, Milan, Italy) or indomethacin (10 μM; Sigma) and inhibition of activity confirmed by the absence of an aggregation response to arachidonic acid (1 mM; Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). The mechanism of 8-epi PGF2α formation was also explored under similar conditions using vitamin E (500 μM), mannitol (5 mM), deoxyribose (5 mM; all from Sigma). We also used the thromboxane synthase inhibitors (16Kayama N. Sakaguchi K. Kanero S. Wbota T. Kukuzawa T. Kawamura S. Yoshitioto T. Shozo Y. Prostaglandins. 1981; 21: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Gorman R.R. Johnson R.A. Sjuman C.M. Aiken J.W. Prostaglandins. 1983; 26: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), 1(7-carboxyheptyl)imidazole-HCI (10 μM) and sodium furegrelate (U-63557A, 50 μM) (Cascade Biochem., Berkshire, United Kingdom). Solid-phase Extraction (SPE), Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), and Derivatization Briefly, product formation was stopped at fixed times after addition of the platelet agonists by adding glacial acetic acid and lowering the pH to 3-3.5. Tetra and hepta deuterated internal standards of TxB2and 12-HETE (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI), respectively, were then added to the platelet preparation and the samples applied to a 100-mg octadecylsilyl (ODS) solid-phase extraction column (Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield MI) that had been prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions. The column was then washed with 25% methanol, 75% water and 100% hexane, dried, then eluted with 100% ethyl acetate. The samples were initially derivatized as pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters by adding 10 μl of diisopropylethylamine and 20 μl of 10% PFB Br in acetonitrile and allowing the reaction to proceed for at least 10 min at room temperature. This reaction mixture was dried under nitrogen and applied to a TLC plate (LK6D, 60A Silica Gel Plates Whatman Inc., Clifton NJ). The mobile phase was 100% ethyl acetate. The extractions were then dried under a stream of nitrogen, the trimethylsilyl ether derivative was formed by adding 10 μl of BSTFA Supelco Inc., Bellafonte, PA) and 10 μl of pyridine and allowing the reaction to proceed for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then dried under nitrogen, the sample redissolved in 20 μl of dodecane, and analyzed by GC-MS. 8-Epi PGF2α was measured using an 18O2-labeled internal standard derivatized as the PFB ester as described above. The reaction mixture was dried under nitrogen and applied to a TLC plate (LK6D, 60A Silica Gel Plates). The mobile phase was 80% ethyl acetate and 20% heptane. The extractions were dried under a stream of nitrogen and the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether derivative formed by adding 10 μl of MTBSTFA (Sigma) and 10 μl of pyridine, and allowing the reaction to proceed for 24 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then dried under nitrogen, the sample redissolved in 20 μl of dodecane, and analyzed by GC-MS. For electron impact-mass spectrometry (EI/MS) studies, the methyl ester was formed by dissolving the sample in 100 μl of methanol and 500 μl of a dilute solution of diazomethane in ether and allowing it to stand at room temperature for 30 min. GC-MS All GC-MS studies were performed on a Delsi-Nermag Automass 150 (Delsi-Nermag, Argenteuil, France) equipped with a Varian 1077 split/splitless injector operated in the splitless mode, at 280°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The interface was maintained at 280°C, the ion source at 250°C. The MS was operated in the negative ion, chemical ionization mode, utilizing methane as the reagent gas. The ion source was maintained at 250°C. For electron impact studies, the ionization energy was 70 eV, and the source temperature was 190°C. A 30-μm DB-1 capillary column of 0.25 mm inner diameter with 0.25 μm of coating was utilized. The temperature program was 190−320° at 20°C/min. The retention time was approximately 17 min. A 40-m DB-1 0.18 mm inner diameter, 0.4-μm coating was used for studies aimed at examining the purity of the 8-epi PGF2α , using the same temperature program. The retention time on this system was approximately 1 h. Integration times for selected ion monitoring studies were 500 ms for each of the two ions monitored; m/z 695 for 8-epi PGF2α and m/z 699 for [18O2]8-epi PGF2α . Platelet TXA2was measured as its hydrolysis product, TxB2. A 15-m DB-1 capillary column of 0.25 mm inner diameter with 0.25 μm of coating was used; the temperature program was as above described for 8-epi PGF2α . The retention time was approximately 7 min, and ions monitored were m/z 614 for TxB2and m/z 618 for [2H4]TxB2. A 10-m DB-1 column of 0.25 mm inner diameter with 0.25 μm of coating was used with a temperature program as described above. The retention time was approximately 6 min, and the ions monitored were m/z 391 for 12-HETE and m/z 399 for [2H8]12-HETE. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) A Hewlett-Packard (HP)1050 HPLC in line with an HP 1050 UV detector and a Flo-One Radioactivity detector (Radiomatic Instruments, Meriden, CT) was used for all HPLC experiments. Straight phase (SP) chromatography was performed on an Ultrasphere Si 5-μm column, 4.6 mm inner diameter × 25 cm (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Reverse phase (RP) chromatography utilized an Ultrasphere ODS 5-μm column, 4.6 mm × 25 cm. The flow rate was 1 ml/min in all experiments. Incubation of Arachidonic Acid (AA) with Partially Purified COX-1 AA (10 μg) or [3H8]AA (10 μCi) in 20 μl of methanol was added to 1 ml of Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 2 nM phenol, 1 mM EDTA, and 500 units of COX-1. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 min at 37°C, at which time 150 μl of glacial acetic acid and 3 ml of ether containing 1 mg of triphenyl phosphine was added. After vortexing and centrifugation, the ether was removed, dried under N2, and applied to a TLC plate which was then developed with a mobile phase of 10% methanol, 90% ethyl acetate, 0.1% glacial acetic acid. A 1-cm zone centered on 8-epi PGF2α was scraped, extracted, and further purified by HPLC on an ODS column utilizing a mobile phase of 25% acetonitrile, 75% water, 0.1% glacial acetic acid. The elution volume was 24-26 ml. Ex Vivo Study Four healthy volunteers (age 30 ± 8 years), who had not taken any medication during the previous 2 weeks, were given 1 g of aspirin. All were nonsmokers. Blood samples were taken before aspirin (base line), at 3 h and at 24 h after the ingestion and the serum was analyzed for TxB2and 8-epi PGF2α. Statistical Analysis Data were initially analyzed using analysis of variance. Pairwise comparisons were made using the Student's t test, where appropriate. Data are displayed as mean ± standard deviation. All three products, TxB2, 12-HETE, and 8-epi PGF2α were below the detection levels of their corresponding assays (2 ng/ml, 2 ng/ml, and 2 pg/ml, respectively) in unstimulated PRP and WP. Threshold concentrations of collagen (0.5-2 μg/ml) induced irreversible aggregation in PRP after a lag phase of 30 s. Three min after addition of agonist, the levels of TxB2(130 ± 20 ng/ml) and 8-epi PGF2α (80 ± 15 pg/ml) had risen dramatically (n = 5; p < 0.00 1). Addition of aspirin or indomethacin 5 min prior to agonist completely prevented formation of both TxB2and 8-epi PGF2α . Consistant with this observation, threshold concentrations of peroxide-free arachidonic acid (20-50 μM) also increased TxB2(400 ± 25 ng/ml) and 8-epi PGF2α(350 ± 30 pg/ml) which were both inhibited by the COX inhibitors (n = 4). We studied WP to extend these observations and incorporated measurement of 12-HETE as a non-COX, enzymatic product of arachidonic acid in platelets. Collagen increased all three products in WP coincident with aggregation. Aspirin pretreatment abolished formation of TxB2and 8-epi PGF2α; it also caused 12-HETE formation to fall from 320 to 140 ng/ml (p < 0.001). Formation of the three products appeared related in time; an initial lag phase in the first minute preceded initiation of aggregation, which was maximal 3 min after addition of agonist when product formation had reached a plateau (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the conditions of the assay allowed chromatographic separation of an endogenous peak corresponding to the retention time of authentic 18O2-labeled 8-epi PGF2α from peaks which probably correspond to other F2isoprostanes (Fig. 2, center panel). Although internal standards for the other compounds were not included in the assay, the agonist-induced increments appeared selective for the peak comigrating with the 8-epi PGF2α internal standard irrespective of the platelet agonist (Fig. 2, lower panel). A similar, apparently selective increase in 8-epi PGF2α formation was observed when aggregation was induced by threshold concentration of thrombin (0.1-0.3 unit/ml). The pattern was similar to that observed with collagen, although the rise in 8-epi PGF2α appeared to precede that of the other two products (Fig. 3 A). Again, aspirin completely suppressed TxB2and 8-epi PGF2α and partially suppressed 12-HETE formation. Similar results were obtained with threshold concentrations (1-3 μM) of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Fig. 3 B).Figure 2:Selected ion monitoring of 8-epi PGF2α. The upper trace shows a peak at m/z 699 corresponding to authentic 18O2-labeled internal standard. The center trace (m/z 695) shows the signal before the stimulus, and the small peaks are likely to be isoprostanes. The lower trace shows a peak (m/z 695) corresponding to the retention time of the authentic 8-epi PGF2α. Other isoprostanes are present, but obscured by the intense 8-epi PGF2αsignal. The inset shows the trace magnified four times to reveal the other isoprostanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3:Time course of eicosanoid formation in thrombin stimulated washed platelets (0.1-0.3 unit/ml) (a), and in A23187-stimulated washed platelets (1-3 μM) (b).

Induction of platelet aggregation in a COX-independent manner by using high doses (10 μg/ml) of collagen in the presence of aspirin was unaccompanied by an increase in 8-epi PGF2αor TxB2(Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with high dose thrombin. While COX inhibitors suppressed the increment in 8-epi PGF2αin platelets activated with threshold concentrations of thrombin and collagen, three structurally distinct free radical scavengers, vitamin E, mannitol, and deoxyribose all failed to inhibit its formation (Table I). Aggregation of platelets with threshold concentrations of the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619 (1-3 μM) or of phorbol myristate acetate (100-300 nM) was unassociated with a detectable increment in either TxB2or 8-epi PGF2α.Table I:Effect of aspirin (ASA) and the antioxidants, vitamin E (vit E, 500 μM), mannitol (MN, 5 mM) and deoxyribose (DR, 5 mM) on eicosanoid formation in collagen and thrombin-stimulated washed platelets (n = 5). Open table in a new tab Several lines of evidence are consistent with formation of 8-epi PGF2αin a COX-dependent manner by human platelets. These include (i) coincident kinetics of formation with the COX product, TxA2, in activated platelets; (ii) inhibition of formation coincident with that of TxA2by two structurally distinct COX inhibitors; (iii) dissociation of aggregation and 8-epi PGF2αformation when aggregation occurs in a COX-independent manner; (iv) selective elevation of 8-epi PGF2αas compared to other isoprostanes. Washed platelets were incubated with the selective thromboxane synthase inhibitors 1-(7-carboxyheptyl)imidazole hydrochloride and sodium furegrelate (U-63557A) for 5 min at 37°C, then stimulated with collagen (1 μg/ml) or AA (30 μM). The samples were analyzed for 8-epi PGF2αand TxB2formation. The inhibitors completely prevented TxB2production, but did not prevent the formation of 8-epi PGF2αwhich was elevated an average 6-8-fold for both collagen and AA (Fig. 5, A and B) (18FitzGerald G.A. Reilly I.A.G. Pedersen A.K. Circulation. 1985; 72: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To verify the authenticity of the endogenous peak comigrating with the internal standard in the quantitative GC-MS assay as 8-epi PGF2α, we performed several further experiments. First, AA was incubated with partially purified ram seminal vesicle COX-I using the conditions described above. An internal standard, consisting of [18O2]8-epi PGF2αwas added to the ether, and the mixture was derivatized as the PFB ester, subjected to TLC, and the tBDMS derivative was formed. When subjected to negative ion chemical ionization GC-MS, a product with the molecular weight and retention time of 8-epi PGF2αwas observed (not shown). Second, [3H8]arachidonic acid was incubated with COX-I and the product extracted by SPE, partially purified by TLC, mixed with 10 μg of authentic 8-epi PGF2α, and subjected to HPLC purification using the technique of Morrow et al. (5Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 8-Epi PGF2αwas then monitored by UV absorption at 210 nm; tritiated products were monitored with a Flo-One/Beta radiodetector. Briefly, coelution was demonstrated in three systems: (i) SP HPLC of the underivatized compound, mobile phase: 12% isopropanol, 88% hexane, 0.1% glacial acetic acid, retention time 24.6 min for the unlabeled, and 26 min for the tritiated product; (ii) RP HPLC of the underivatized compound, mobile phase: 28% acetonitrile, 72% water, 0.1% glacial acetic acid, retention time 23.6 min for the unlabeled and 22 min for the tritiated product; and (iii) RP HPLC of the PFB ester, mobile phase: 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, retention time 22.3 min for the unlabeled and 21.9 min for the tritiated product. Retention time differences between the unlabeled material and the products possessing the hydrogen/tritium substitution in eight locations were significant (up to 1.4 min). To account for this variation, the PGF2αwas purified from the incubation and chromatographed with authentic PGF2αin the same three systems. The relative retention times enabled compensation for the isotope effect (Fig. 6). The isotope effect was larger than seen by Morrow et al. (5Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) due to the fact that their standard was labeled with a single tritium. Third, 80 μM AA was incubated with washed human platelets and after addition of 18O2internal standard, SPE, TLC, and PFB, tBDMS derivatization, the zone cochromatographing with 8-epi PGF2αwas injected onto a 40 m DB-1 capillary column with a 0.18-mm inner diameter, 0.4-μm coating. Complete GC-MS conditions are described above. This system yielded a retention time of approximately 1 h; no difference in retention time was observed between the [18O2]8-epi PGF2αinternal standard and the product of the incubation, other than the expected isotope effect (the internal standard eluted 15 s earlier than both the platelet product and authentic 8-epi PGF2α). We applied GC-EI-MS to provide structural elucidation of the compound detected in the negative ion chemical ionization GC-MS assay. Platelets were incubated with [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-d8]arachidonic acid for 3 min at 37°C. The product of this incubation was subjected to extraction and purification as described above, except that the final derivative was the methyl ester TMS ether and mixed with authentic 8-epi PGF2α. This technique is useful for demonstrating identity between two compounds because the mass spectrum will be present in two forms that are identical except for the presence of deuterium in one (Fig. 7). For assignment of structure to the ions, we have referred to the study of Middleditch and Desiderio (19Middleditch B.S. Desiderio D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 55: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) on the mass spectrum of the TMS ether-TMS ester derivative of PGF2α. Although we used the TMS ether-methyl ester, the spectra are analogous in the ions that contain the ester and, since the ester group plays little role in the fragmentation of most ions, most fragments are identical. The presence of eight deuterons alters the GC retention in a predictable fashion, causing the deuterated analog to elute slightly before the natural product. This difference, although only approximately 1 s, allowed the use of reconstructed ion chromatograms (RIC) to ascertain the origin of each individual ion (see Fig. 8). RICs were also useful for demonstrating that several ions present in the spectrum (m/z 361, 437, and 451) had different GC elution profiles, and therefore did not originate from the compounds of interest.Figure 8:Reconstructed ion chromatograms showing the slight isotope effect on the GC retention times of the two compounds. m/z 521 and 592 originate from the 2H8-labeled product, as indicated by their slightly earlier (approximately 1 s) retention time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We interpret the spectrum in the following manner: m/z 584 is the molecular ion of the unlabeled product; its [2H8] analog is m/z 592. m/z 569 represents the loss of 15 (CH3; from TMS); its 2H8analog is m/z 577. m/z 513 is the loss of 71 (C16-20); since this portion of the molecule is not labeled, the analog m/z 521 retains all eight deuterons. m/z 494 represents the loss of 90 (trimethylsilanol, TMSOH); the analog can result from a loss of 90 (m/z 502) or 91 (m/z 501) depending on whether the loss of TMSOH involves a proton or a deuteron. The ion current is divided between these two ions. m/z 479 is the loss of 105 (90+15; TMSOH+CH3). The analog is seen as a loss o"

This interaction promotes both Raf translocation to the plasma membrane and activation of Raf kinase activity. Although substantial experimental evidence has demonstrated that Raf residues 51-131 alone are sufficient for Ras binding, conflicting observations have suggested that the Raf cysteine-rich domain (residues 139-184) may also be important for interaction with Ras. To clarify the role of the Raf cysteine-rich domain in Ras-Raf binding, we have compared the ability of two distinct Raf fragments to interact with Ras using both in vitro Ras binding and in vivo Ras inhibition assays. First, we determined that both Raf sequences 2-140 and 139-186 (designated Raf-Cys) showed preferential binding to active, GTP-bound Ras in vitro. Second, we observed that Raf-Cys antagonized oncogenic Ras(Q61L)-mediated transactivation of Ras-responsive elements and focus-forming activity in NIH 3T3 cells and insulin-induced germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus laevis oocytes in vivo. This inhibitory activity suggests that Raf-Cys can interact with Ras in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that Ras interaction with two distinct domains of Raf-1 may be important in Ras-mediated activation of Raf kinase activity.

Taken together, these results suggest that Ras interaction with two distinct domains of Raf-1 may be important in Ras-mediated activation of Raf kinase activity. Numerous biochemical and genetic studies have positioned Raf downstream of Ras in Ras-dependent signal transduction pathways (1Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that lead to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (2Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several recent investigations have used in vitro protein binding assays and the in vivo yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate a direct physical association between the Ras and Raf proteins, thus identifying Raf as a key downstream target, or effector, of Ras-mediated signal transduction (3Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 4Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J.

This interaction requires the effector domain of Ras (residues 32-40) and a region in the amino-terminal regulatory domain of Raf. The region encompassing Raf-1 amino acids 51-131 has been shown to be sufficient for interaction with Ras (6Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 9Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L. Zhang X.-f. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell.

In addition, a single amino acid mutation (R89L) in this domain of Raf disrupts the interaction with Ras in vitro and prevents Ras-mediated activation of Raf in Sf9 insect cells (11Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). While Raf residues 51-131 clearly define a minimal Ras binding domain, other evidence has suggested that the Raf cysteine-rich domain (residues 139-184) may also be involved in Ras-Raf binding. First, a single point mutation (C168S) in this domain was found to reduce Raf (residues 1-257) binding to Ras in both two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays (5Zhang X. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Second, it was observed that renaturation of Raf-(1-257) in the presence of zinc, which is required for folding of the cysteine-rich domain, led to greater restoration of Ras binding activity (4Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Finally, we and others observed that Raf residues 131-147, which are adjacent to and extend partially into the cysteine-rich domain, are critically important for conferring high affinity binding to Ras in vitro (9Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L. Zhang X.-f. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Ghosh S. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30785-30788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains to be clarified whether the Raf cysteine-rich domain enhances Ras association with Raf residues 51-131 or independently interacts with Ras. To address this question, we have utilized both in vitro and in vivo analyses to characterize Ras interaction with the Raf cysteine-rich domain. We observe that the isolated Raf cysteine-rich domain shows high affinity, guanine nucleotide-dependent binding to Ras in vitro and can function as a dominant inhibitor of Ras signaling and transformation in vivo. Thus, the Raf NH2terminus contains two distinct Ras binding domains that may be important for Ras-mediated activation of Raf kinase activity. To generate mammalian expression vector constructs encoding different Raf fragments, we isolated BamHI- EcoRI DNA fragments from pGEX- raf constructs that encoded the different Raf sequences indicated in Fig. 1(12Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and introduced each into the BamHI site of the pCGN-hyg mammalian expression vector (13Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) (generously provided by M. Ostrowski, Duke). Raf301 encodes a full-length mutant human Raf-1 sequence that contains a single amino acid substitution (K to W) in the ATP binding site, which inactivates its kinase activity (14Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The pAT- rasH bacterial expression plasmid and procedures for expression and purification have been described previously (15DeLoskey R.J. Van Dyk D.E. Van Aken T.E. Campbell-Burk S. Arch. Biochem.

Halkides C.J. Redfield A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7367-7376Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by replacement of GDP bound to Ras. Glutathione S-transferase-Raf proteins were purified as described previously (12Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Purified glutathione S-transferase and glutathione S-transferase-Raf proteins were plated onto 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) coated with 0.025 mg/ml poly-L-lysine and allowed to bind overnight. Wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 130 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 3 mM KCl, pH 7.40 (PBS), which was supplemented with 0.5% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.2% sheep serum (PBSGTS). H-Ras complexed to either GDP or GMPPCP was captured in PBSGTS for 1 h at concentrations ranging from 31 nM to 2 μM. The plates were washed 3 times in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h with an anti-H-Ras antibody (LAO69) (Quality Biotech) diluted 2000-fold in PBSGTS. The wash step was repeated, and the plates were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of sheep anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) in PBSGTS for 30 min, followed by development with the chromogen, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Optical densities (405 nm) were read after 30 min in a Biotech microtiter plate reader. The intensity of the absorbance was directly related to the amount of Ras bound. The concentration of Ras at half-maximal binding was determined as described previously (12Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. DNA transfections were performed as described previously using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (17Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The pB4X-CAT reporter plasmid contains the CAT gene, and CAT is driven by a minimal promoter that contains the ets/AP-1 Ras-responsive promoter element (18Wasylyk C. Imler J.L. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2475-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the pZIP- rasH(Q61L) plasmid DNA encoding H-Ras(Q61L) (50 ng/dish) and either the empty pCGN-hyg vector or the appropriate pCGN- raf construct (5 μg/dish) along with 1 μg of the pB4X-CAT reporter. Forty-eight h after transfection, total cell lysates were prepared, and CAT activity was determined as described previously (19Hauser C.A. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A similar co-transfection analysis was done to assess the ability of each Raf mutant (5 μg/dish) to block Ras(Q61L) (10 ng/dish) transforming activity. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and transformed foci were quantitated after 14-16 days. Oocytes were isolated from primed Xenopus laevis ovaries by procedures described previously (20Wu M. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Casey P. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 315-318Google Scholar). Isolated stage VI oocytes were injected with 200 μg of the indicated glutathione S-transferase-Raf protein (20 oocytes/Raf protein) in a volume of 40 nl. Subsequent to the injection, the oocytes were treated with 1 μM insulin and maintained in modified Barth's solution with Ca2+, between 18 and 20°C, for maturation. Insulin-induced maturation was scored at definite time intervals by counting the number of oocytes undergoing germinal vesicle breakdown manifested by the appearance of a whitish spot at the pigmented animal pole of the oocytes. Although extensive analyses have clearly shown that Raf residues 51-131 alone are sufficient for interaction with Ras, it is presently unclear what the precise role of the cysteine-rich domain (residues 139-184) is in mediating Ras-Raf binding. To address the possibility that this domain can bind Ras, we have conducted both ELISA and direct binding assays (12Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine if Raf-Cys binds directly to Ras in vitro and to assess the dependence of this association on the guanine nucleotide-bound state of Ras. For these assays, we compared the binding activities of a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing Raf-Cys with the binding properties of glutathione S-transferase-Raf-(2-140) (designated Raf-N2), which contains the minimal Raf sequence required for Ras binding (51-131) and includes only the first two residues from the cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows data obtained from an ELISA using various purified recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Raf fragments and Ras. For these experiments we prepared stoichiometric complexes of Ras bound to GMPPCP. This nonhydrolyzable GTP analog eliminates GTP hydrolysis during the course of the experiment and is useful for determining whether various Raf fragments bind to Ras in a GTP-dependent fashion. Binding curves were generated by serially diluting Ras complexed to either GMPPCP or GDP into wells containing 100 pmol of each glutathione S-transferase-Raf protein. We observed that both Raf-Cys and Raf-N2 showed high affinity binding to Ras. In contrast, a Raf fragment lacking the NH2-terminal regulatory domain (containing Raf residues 273-648; designated Raf-C) did not bind to Ras. Furthermore, the concentration dependence of the binding curves demonstrates that much higher concentrations of Ras-GDP relative to Ras-GMPPCP were required to saturate binding to either Raf-N2 or Raf-Cys, and both fragments showed ∼7-fold preferential binding to Ras-GTP relative to Ras-GDP. Therefore, these results indicate that two distinct regions within the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1 are capable of specific interaction with GTP-Ras in vitro. Previous studies have yielded discrepancies between the ability of different Ras and Raf mutants to bind when performed by in vitro versus in vivo two-hybrid analyses (21Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Therefore, we employed three biological assays to determine if Ras-Cys could associate with Ras in vivo and consequently block Ras signaling and transforming activity. We and others have previously shown that kinase-deficient mutants of Raf can block Ras function by antagonizing Ras interaction with its downstream effectors (14Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 22Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, an inhibitory activity of a Raf mutant is a strong indication of an in vivo interaction with Ras that prevents Ras association with full-length, endogenous Ras effectors. We included the well characterized, kinase-deficient Raf301 dominant inhibitory protein as a control for these studies (14Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We first evaluated the ability of each Raf-1 fragment to inhibit oncogenic Ras-mediated stimulation of transcription from a Ras-responsive reporter plasmid (Fig. 3 A). As shown previously (22Cox A.D. Brtva T.R. Lowe D.G. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3281-3288PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), Raf301 reduced Ras-induced transcriptional activation, whereas wild type Raf further stimulated Ras transcriptional activation (data not shown). Additionally, we observed that both Raf-Cys and Raf-N1 reduced activation by oncogenic Ras in vivo. Furthermore, Raf constructs containing both the minimal Ras binding sequence (residues 51-131) and sequences from the cysteine-rich domain (residues 139-184) showed the strongest inhibition of transcriptional activity, possibly due to the cooperative binding of the two independent binding sites. We next determined whether Raf-Cys could also inhibit oncogenic Ras(Q61L) focus-forming activity. Co-transfection of Raf-Cys as well as other Raf fragments that contained overlapping sequences showed >50% inhibition of oncogenic Ras(Q61L) focus-forming activity (Fig. 3 B). One possible explanation for the inhibitory action of these Raf fragments is that they inhibit cell growth in a nonspecific manner. However, we observed that for NIH 3T3 cells transfected with each raf construct, equivalent numbers of hygromycin-resistant colonies are obtained following drug selection of cells transfected with vector only or with vector constructs encoding each of the Raf fragments (data not shown), thus arguing against this possibility. Additionally, we have isolated stably transfected cells that co-express both oncogenic Ras(Q61L) and certain Raf fragments, and these cells show a flatter morphology, which is more characteristic of untransformed NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). Finally, we observed that Raf-Cys and Raf-Cys+ could block insulin-induced germinal vesicle breakdown in X. laevis oocytes (Fig. 3 C). Previous studies have shown that this insulin response is dependent on Ras activity (24Deshpande A.K. Kung H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Korn L.J. Siebel C.W. McCormick F. Roth R.A. Science. 1987; 236: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Garcia A.M. Rowell C. Ackermann K. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18415-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitory activity could be reversed by co-injection of excess oncogenic Ras protein (data not shown). Thus, we have observed that, like the truncated Raf fragment containing the residues corresponding to the minimal Ras binding sequence (residues 51-131), the Raf cysteine-rich domain can inhibit oncogenic Ras transcriptional activation, transforming activity, and oocyte maturation. Taken together, these observations in vivo are consistent with our demonstration that Raf-Cys can bind directly to Ras in vitro and support the possibility that Raf contains a second distinct Ras binding site, which can promote Ras-Raf interaction in vivo. Although Raf-C showed no Ras binding activity in vitro (Fig. 2 A), we did observe that this Raf fragment could inhibit oncogenic Ras-mediated transcription activation (Fig. 3 A), focus-forming activity (Fig. 3 B), and insulin-induced oocyte maturation (Fig. 3 C). Raf-C (residues 273-648) lacks both NH2-terminal Ras binding domains and contains the serine-threonine kinase domain (residues 333-625). However, a previous study has demonstrated that Raf-C lacks transforming activity (27Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that the inhibitory activity of Raf-C is not a consequence of complex formation with Ras but instead that it inhibits Ras transforming activity by complex formation with the Raf substrate, MEK. MEK has been shown to bind to Raf COOH-terminal sequences that include the kinase domain (7Van Aelst L. Barr M. Marcus S. Polverino A. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6213-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, we found that exogenously introduced wild type MEK reversed the inhibitory action of Raf-C but not of Raf-N1 (data not shown). Therefore, Raf-C may function as a dominant inhibitor of MEK activity, thereby inhibiting signaling downstream of Ras. Although previous studies have implicated the Raf cysteine-rich domain in facilitating Ras binding, the precise nature of this role was unclear. Our observations that Raf-Cys shows high affinity, GTP-dependent binding to Ras in vitro and can antagonize Ras function in vivo provide evidence that the cysteine-rich domain constitutes a second Ras binding site in the Raf NH2-terminal regulatory domain. These results provide an explanation for the reduction in Ras binding, observed both in vitro and in vivo, to an amino-terminal Raf fragment, Raf-(1-257), containing a mutation (C168S) that disrupts the integrity of the cysteine-rich domain (5Zhang X.

Our finding is also consistent with the observation that Raf NH2-terminal fragments containing residues 131-147 (which includes residues 139-147 of the Raf cysteine-rich domain) display increased affinity for binding Ras (9Chuang E.

A recent investigation has demonstrated partially reduced coprecipitation and in vitro binding between Ras and a Raf mutant lacking the cysteine-rich domain (28Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J. Morrison D. Decker S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 270: 398-406Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), supporting our finding of two Ras binding sites in Raf. Our observation that the cysteine-rich domain can bind Ras can be reconciled with the report that a single amino acid substitution at Raf residue 89 is sufficient to abolish Ras-Raf interaction (11Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). While it is possible that expression of the isolated cysteine-rich domain may have unmasked a nonspecific binding activity for Ras that is not a property of full-length Raf, our observation that this domain preferentially interacts with the active, GTP-complexed form of Ras argues that this interaction is specific. Instead, we propose that the Ras binding site in the cysteine-rich domain is protected in the intact, unstimulated protein, possibly due to negative regulatory contacts with the COOH-terminal domain. We propose that Ras may initially interact with Raf via contacts with residues between positions 51 and 131. The initial Ras-Raf interaction and/or the resultant membrane translocation of Raf may promote exposure of the cysteine-rich domain for interaction with Ras and possibly other activating molecules. Thus, Ras interaction with these two binding sequences may be necessary to induce the removal of the negative regulatory action of the Raf NH2terminus and consequently may facilitate Raf activation by additional events. These may include interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (29Morrison D.K. Science. 1994; 266: 56-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), tyrosine kinases (30Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol.

To address this issue, mutationally active PKC-α, -ε, or -ζ have been transfected into T cells and the consequences for T cell activation determined. p21 plays an essential role in T cell activation. Accordingly, the effects of the constitutively active PKCs were compared to the effects of mutationally activated p21. The data indicate that PKC-ε and, to a lesser extent PKC-α but not -ζ, can regulate the transcription factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT-1). The ability of PKC-ε to induce transactivation of NF-AT-1 and AP-1 was similar to the stimulatory effect of a constitutively activated p21. PKC-ε, but not PKC-α nor activated p21, was able to induce NF-KB activity. Phorbol esters induce expression of CD69 whereas none of the activated PKC isotypes tested were able to have this effect. Activated Src and p21 were able to induce CD69 expression. These results indicate selective functions for different PKC isotypes in T cells. Moreover, the data comparing the effects of activated Ras and PKC mutants suggest that PKC-α, p21, and PKC-ε are not positioned linearly on a single signal transduction pathway.

T cell activation via the T cell antigen receptor is associated with the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and the resultant production of inositol polyphosphates and diacylglycerols that regulate intracellular calcium and protein kinase C (PKC),1 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CDAGdiacylglycerolPDBuphorbol 12,13-dibutyrateNF-AT-1nuclear factor of activated T cellsNF-ATppre-existing factor of the NF-AT-1 complexAP-1activating protein-1NF-KBnuclear factor binding to KB sitesCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseERKextracellular signal-regulated protein kinasewtwild typePBSphosphate-buffered saline. respectively (1Weiss A.

The term PKC refers to a family of closely related serine/threonine protein kinases for which at least 11 isotypes have been described (3Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). These isotypes can be classified according to their structure and cofactor requirements for activation. They are all activated by phospholipids and, with notable exceptions, diacylglycerol (DAG) via an allosteric mechanism. However, they differ markedly in their sensitivity to Ca2+. PKC-α, -β1, -β2, and -γ are dependent on Ca2+for activity, whereas PKC-ε, -δ, -η, and -θ are not. PKC-ζ typifies a third group of PKC isotypes (ζ, λ, ι) which also structurally belong to the PKC family, but atypically are not activated by phorbol esters or DAGs (4Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). A fourth group of enzymes has been described recently that bind DAG/phorbol esters and have structural homologies with the PKC family, but have unusual catalytic domains (5Johannes F.J. Pretle J.

PKC can regulate T cell activation genes via control of transcription factors. For example, in the interleukin 2 gene enhancer, the PKC responsive elements include sites for NF-KB, AP-1, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, NF-AT-1 (2Berry N. Nishizuka Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The PKC controlled signaling pathways that regulate these transcription factors are not fully characterized but may involve the guanine nucleotide binding protein p21, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases such as ERK2 and JNK1 (8Rayter S. Woodrow M. Lucas S.C. Cantrell D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4549-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 227: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (918) Google Scholar). T cells express multiple isotypes of PKC including PKC-α, -β1 (not -β2), -δ, -ε, -η, -θ, and -ζ (3Hug H. Sarre T.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and understanding the role of these different isotypes of PKC in transcription factor regulation is a major challenge. In particular, one complication is that most conclusions regarding the role of PKC in T cell activation are based on experiments that examine the effects of phorbol esters or synthetic DAGs which simultaneously activate multiple isotypes of PKC. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that phorbol esters may activate directly non-PKC signaling pathways. For example, phorbol esters can bind to molecules other than PKCs such as n-chimaerin (11Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lee J. Monfries C. Harden N. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One approach to explore the role of a signaling molecule in T cells is to look at the functional consequences of transfecting cells with mutated constitutively active signal transduction molecules (12Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Wotton D. Ways D.K. Parker P.J. Owen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17975-17982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Muramatsu M.A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PKC consists of a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and an NH2-terminal regulatory domain. The activity of the catalytic domain is inhibited by a pseudosubstrate motif within the regulatory domain (15Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational activation of PKC by complete truncation of the regulatory domain generates a constitutively active PKC that can contribute to T cell activation (14Muramatsu M.A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) but has lost substrate specificity (4Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). A more refined mechanism for mutationally activating PKC is to make a single point mutation in the PKC pseudosubstrate sequence (16Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that disrupts the interaction between the catalytic site and the pseudosubstrate sequence, but retains the regulatory domain that helps determine substrate specificity. Such PKC mutants can be used to examine directly the functional effects of an individual PKC isotype, independent of the effects of phorbol esters or DAGs. Accordingly, to examine the role of PKC in T cell activation, we have determined the consequences of expressing pseudosubstrate mutated PKC-α, PKC-ε, and PKC-ζ. These three isotypes were selected because they are representative of the three major subdivisions in the PKC family. As well, analysis of PKC translocation has suggested that both PKC-α and PKC-ε are regulated during T cell activation by phorbol esters (17Tsutsumi A. Kubo M. Fujii H. Freire-Moar J. Turck C.W. Ransom J.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1754-1756Google Scholar). Of the many diverse PKC responses that could be explored in this type of analysis, we chose to look at the regulation of three transcription factors that appear PKC responsive on the basis of phorbol ester experiments: AP-1, NF-AT-1, and NF-KB. We also looked at the effects of the different PKC isotypes on expression of the cell surface antigen CD69. Finally, the effects of the PKC mutants in T cells was compared with the effects of v -src, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, and constitutively active p21, v-Ha -ras. Ionomycin (Ca2+salt) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were from Calbiochem Corp. (United Kingdom). UCHT-1 (reactive with CD3) was used at 10 μg/ml in culture. [14C]Acetyl coenzyme A (at 50-60 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, UK). Other reagents were from Sigma. Specific antisera against the different PKC isotypes were raised against the COOH-terminal peptide from the proteins. Monoclonal antibodies against rat CD2 (OX-34) or p85 were purified from hybridoma supernatants. Rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham International. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibodies anti-CD69 (Leu16-FITC, IgG1) are from Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA). Reporter constructs; NF-KB-CAT: contains 3 copies of the sequence for the NF site (AGCTTGGGACTTTCCATGGGACTTTCCTAGGGATTCCCC), and AP-1-CAT contains 3 copies of the sequence for the AP-1 site (AGCTATGAGTCTCAGTGATCAGTGAGTCA). These sequences have been inserted in pBLCAT2 to generate NF-KB-CAT and AP-1-CAT, respectively (18Williams D.M. Teffery L.T. Murray E.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NF-AT-CAT contains 3 copies of the sequence 5′ corresponding to the sequence from positions −284 to −258 relative to the start of transcription of the interleukin 2 gene, upstream of the interleukin 2 minimal promoter driving the reporter gene CAT. This sequence has been identified as the binding site for NF-AT-1, the ARRE-2 site of the human interleukin 2 enhancer (19Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). The pMT-2 vector was used to express PKC-α (20Parker P.J. Coussens L. Totty N. Rhee L. Young S. Chen E. Stabel S. Waterfield M.D. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and PKC-ε (21Schaap D. Parker P.J. Bristol A. Kriz R. Knopf J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 352-357Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the pCO2vector was used to express PKC-ζ (22Ono Y. Fuiji T. Ogika K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The constitutively active PKC clones are full-length α, ε, and ζ cDNAs with a single point mutation in their inhibitory pseudosubstrate sequences within the regulatory domain. Mutants in the pseudosubstrate sequence were generated by substitution of a glutamic acid for an alanine in position 25 (PKC-αE25), position 159 for PKC-ε (PKC-εE159), and position 119 for PKC-ζ (PKC-ζE119). The PKC-α and PKC-ζ mutants are known to be constitutively active in vivo and in vitro (16Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Goode N.T. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Decock J.B.J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Fuller S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The wild type (wt) counterparts of these mutants PKC-α wt, PKC-ε wt, and PKC-ζ wt, were included in the experiments as controls. Other plasmids directing expression of constitutively active p21v-Ha-(pEF Ras), v -raf (pEF Raf), and v -src (pEF Src) were used and are described elsewhere (13Wotton D. Ways D.K. Parker P.J. Owen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17975-17982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CMVrCD2 construct contains a cytoplasmic domain truncated version of the rat CD2 gene (25D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl/ethidium bromide gradients using standard procedures. JH6.2, a subline of the human T acute lymphocytic lymphoma cell line Jurkat (26Nunès J. Klasen S. Ragueneau M. Pavon C. Couez D. Mawas C. Olive D. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, at 37°C in 5% C02in humidified air. Cells were transfected via electroporation (gene pulser: Bio-Rad, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were pulsed (107cells/0.5 ml) in complete medium at 960 microfarads and 340 mV. Cells transfected with similar plasmid mixtures were pooled and re-aliquoted before stimulation. Transfected cultures were cultured and stimulated as indicated. Conditions and quantities of DNA for transfection were optimized for each plasmid and each plasmid preparation. Transfection efficiencies ranged from 20 to 35%. For the reporter constructs AP-1, NF-KB, and NF-AT-1, between 0.5 and 20 μg of DNA/107cells was used. For v -src and v-Ha- ras and PKC expression constructs, 5-25 μg of DNA/107cells was used. Total cell lysates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) by overnight Western blot. Membranes were immersed in PBS/Tween 20, 0.5%, (PBST) plus 5% milk for 2 h to block nonspecific binding. Anti-PKC isotype antisera or p85α antibodies were diluted 1/3,000 to 1/5,000 in PBST + 1% milk and were allowed to react with the membrane overnight at 4°C. After extensive washes, membranes were incubated with a 1/15,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (for PKC immunsera) or rabbit anti-mouse Ig (for p85 antibodies) in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. After the washes in PBST and PBS, membrane bound antibodies were visualized by use of ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham) and Kodak XS1 films. CAT assays were performed as described previously (12Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107cells were lysed in 50 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl for 10 min on ice. Cellular debris as pelleted and the lysates heated at 68°C for 10 min before use. Assay conditions were 150 mM Tris, pH 8, 0.05 μCi of [14C]acetyl coenzyme A, and 2 mM chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the amount of radioactivity in the acetylated products and nonacetylated substrate of each reaction was determined by liquid scintillation counting of organic and aqueous phases, respectively. The percentage of chloramphenicol acetylation is calculated and results are presented as such or as -fold increase of the control response. Cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated Leu23antibodies (human CD69) for 30 min at 4°C and then washed three times in PBS containing 4% fetal calf serum prior to analysis with a FACScan fluorocytometer (Becton Dickinson). For analysis of rat CD2 and human CD3 antigens, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml OX-34 (rat CD2) or UCHT-1 (human CD3) antibodies for 30 min at 4°C, washed, and thereafter incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 30 min at 4°C, prior to FACS analysis. Propidium iodide was used to exclude dead cells from analysis. In fibroblasts, expression of pseudosubstrate mutated PKC-α has been shown to induce AP-1 activity (16Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of the mutated constitutively active PKC-α, -ε, and -ζ to induce the transcription factor AP-1 in T cells, we employed transient transfection protocols and quantitation of the expression of a CAT reporter gene whose activity is regulated by a trimer of the AP-1 binding site. Jurkat cells were cotransfected with the AP-1-CAT construct plus one of the expression constructs encoding the different PKC isotypes. The samples were harvested 18 h after transfection and the induction of AP-1-CAT activity was determined (Fig. 1). Basal AP-1 activity measured in T cells, in the absence of stimulus, is low and PDBu induced a 6-8-fold increase in the AP-1 activity (Fig. 1 A). In parallel experiments and as a positive control, cotransfection of a constitutively active Ras mutant, p21v-Ha-, induced a level of AP-1 activity comparable to the level of PDBu induced AP-1 activity. Similarily cotransfection of v -src, a constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase resulted in transactivation of AP-1 (Fig. 1 A). When PKC mutants were cotransfected with AP-1 in an identical procedure, PKC-εE159 and PKC-αE25 were found to transactivate the AP-1-CAT reporter construct. PKC-εE159 induced a level of AP-1-CAT comparable to that seen in phorbol ester-stimulated cells, whereas PKC-αE25 was consistently less effective (Fig. 1 B). The data in Fig. 1 C compare the kinetics of AP-1 induction in response to PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159 mutants and show that the kinetics of AP-1 induction by the two isotypes are similar in Jurkat cells. AP-1-CAT activity was not regulated by the PKC-ζE119 mutant nor by cotransfection of expression plasmid encoding wild type PKC-α, -ε, or -ζ. Increasing the amount of the PKC-ζE119 expression vector used in the experiments had no effect on AP-1 activity at any time point tested (data not shown). To determine whether the failure of the PKC-ζE119 mutant to transactivate AP-1 was due to insufficient expression of the enzyme, Western blot analysis of PKC isotypes in transfected cells was performed. JH6.2 cells constitutively express PKC-α, -ε, and -ζ. The point mutated PKC isotypes will migrate at a similar molecular weight as the endogenous isotypes and have an identical immunoreactivity as the endogenous enzyme. However, an increase in the total cellular levels of the particular PKC isotype is an indication that the transfected gene is efficiently transcribed and translated into the final PKC product. The Western blots in Fig. 2 show that endogenous PKC-ζ, detected in control empty vector transfected cells, migrates as an 80-kDa band. PKC-ζE119 levels increased with the time after transfection to reach a maximum level 16 h post-transfection. This level was maintained for at least 24 h. The failure of the PKC-ζE119 mutant to transactivate AP-1 was thus not due to insufficient expression of the enzyme. Jurkat cells constitutively express PKC-α and -ε. The functional effects of the mutated PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159 were easy to demonstrate but no increases in the total level of PKC-α and -ε were detected in cells transfected with the PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159 mutants (data not shown). Endogenous PKC-α and -ε are expressed at high levels in Jurkat cells and these data suggest that the activated mutants are expressed at a low level relative to the endogenous wild type enzyme. The transcriptional factor NF-AT-1 is a complex of AP-1 and NF-ATp (7Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). There is a two-signal requirement for NF-AT-1 activation which reflects that calcium regulated signals induce NF-ATp translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, whereas PKC or p21 is proposed to induce AP-1. The data in Fig. 3 A show that the calcium ionophore ionomycin alone has a weak inductive effect on NF-AT-1 but ionomycin and PDBu synergize for maximal activation. Expression of v -src can substitute for both ionomycin and PDBu signals and transactivate NF-AT-CAT. The constitutively active Ras mutant, v-Ha -ras alone, has no inductive effect on NF-AT-1, but can synergize with ionomycin for NF-AT-1 induction (Fig. 3 A). To study the role of PKC in the induction of an active NF-AT-1 complex, cotransfection experiments were carried out using the PKC-εE159, PKC-αE25, and PKC-ζE119 mutants. The data in Fig. 3 B show that the PKC-εE159 and PKC-αE25 mutants alone had no effect on NF-AT-1 activity but were able to induce NF-AT-1 in the presence of ionomycin. Neither PKC-ζE119, nor the wild type PKC-α, -ε, and -ζ isotypes were able to induce significant NF-AT-CAT activity, either alone or in combination with ionomycin. PKC is proposed to regulate NF-AT-1 via effects on AP-1. The PKC-εE159 mutant was repeatedly more effective than PKC-αE25 for NF-AT-1 induction, which is consistent with the relative potency of these constructs on AP-1 activity shown in Fig. 1. In kinetic experiments, the synergy between ionomycin and PKC-εE159 and PKC-αE25 mutants for NF-AT-CAT induction were readily detected 2 h after stimulation (Fig. 3 C). NF-KB, a PKC-regulated transcription factor, is a heterodimer composed of 2 DNA binding subunits which are members of the rel family (27Grimm S. Bauerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of the different PKC isotypes to transactivate NF-KB, PKC-εE159, PKC-αE25, and PKC-ζE119 expression constructs were cotransfected with an NF-KB-CAT construct. The samples were harvested 18 h after transfection and CAT activity was determined. As controls, cotransfection experiments were performed with constitutively activated Ras, v-Ha -ras, and an activated protein tyrosine kinase, v -src. The data in Fig. 4 a show that NF-KB-CAT activity in unstimulated JH6.2 cells can be increased 3-4-fold with phorbol ester stimulation. Cotransfection of an activated tyrosine kinase v -src was also able to increase NF-KB activity 2-3-fold, but constitutively active v-Ha -ras had no significant effect. This was in marked contrast to the strong transactivating effect of the Ras mutant on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 (Figs. 1 A and 3 A). As shown in Fig. 4B, only PKC-εE159 was able to induce NF-KB activity, and cotransfections carried out with the PKC-αE25 or PKC-ζE119 mutants had no detectable effect on NF-KB-CAT activity. In kinetic experiments, NF-KB activity was detected between 2 and 4 h after transfection of PKC-εE159, whereas no significant effect of PKC-αE25 or PKC-ζE119 mutants was detected at any time point (Fig. 4 C). The CD69 antigen is rapidly expressed at the cell surface in response to triggering of the T cell receptor or activation of T cells with phorbol esters (28Hara T. Jung J.M. Bjorndahl S.M. Fu S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1988-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The effects of phorbol ester led to the conclusion that PKC controls the surface expression of CD69. It is now also recognized that p21 is involved in CD69 induction. Thus transfection of a constitutively active Ras mutant into Jurkat cells induces CD69 expression, whereas transfection of a dominant negative Ras mutant prevents phorbol ester regulation of this surface antigen (25D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify which isotype of PKC could be involved in the induction of the CD69 molecule in T cells, plasmids encoding the different PKC mutants were transfected in Jurkat cells and the expression of CD69 monitored by FACS analysis. Results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 5. Optimal conditions to follow the induction of CD69 by a transfected plasmid were established by using the constitutively active v -src construct. Fig. 5 a shows that the JH6.2 subclone of Jurkat does not express CD69 in the absence of stimulus but PDBu is able to induce CD69 expression. In cells transfected with v -src, a subpopulation of cells can be seen to express CD69 to levels comparable to that seen in the PDBu-stimulated cells. Phorbol esters will activate all of the Jurkat cells, whereas the efficiency in transient transfection protocols means that only a subpopulation of cells will express the activated Src mutants. Thus in each experiment, cells were transfected with an expression construct encoding a truncated rat CD2 antigen as a surface tag. The transfection efficiency can then be estimated by fluorescence analysis of rat CD2 expression. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, the transfection efficiency from the CD2 analysis was 35% (Fig. 5 b) and in the v- src transfected cells (Fig. 5 c), a comparable percentage of the cells became CD69 positive, with a mean fluorescence intensity similar to that seen with PDBu-stimulated cells (Fig. 5 a). Expression of activated p21 also induced CD69 expression (Fig. 5 d) so that approximately 15% of cells became CD69 positive. CD3 expression was not affected by transfection of v -src or v-Ha -ras (data not shown). The weaker effect of v-Ha -ras compared to v -src was consistently observed in seven experiments. There was no synergy between phorbol ester and ionomycin or activated Ras and ionomycin for CD69 expression. CD69 induction was never observed in response to PKC-αE25, PKC-εE159, or PKC-ζE119, either alone or in combination, or in cells transfected with PKC mutants in combination with v-Ha -ras. However, cells transfected with any PKC construct, either active PKC or wt PKC, were still able to induce CD69 upon PDBu treatment or T cell receptor-CD3 complex ligation (data not shown). In all these experiments, the expression of functional constitutively active PKC-αE25 or PKC-εE159 was monitored by transactivation of an AP-1-CAT reporter gene. It has been suggested that signals from PKC and p21 converge to control the activity of the protein serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 (29Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 227: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (488) Google Scholar); we therefore examined the functional effect of expressing a constitutively active Raf kinase, partly to determine whether there were any intrinsic difficulties in using activated protein serine/threonine kinases for the CD69 induction assay. Preliminary experiments confirmed that a truncated Raf protein, v -raf, could replace activated p21 or phorbol esters for induction of AP-1 and NF-AT-1 in CAT assays. Expression of v -raf could also mimic the effect of v-Ha -ras for CD69 induction (Fig. 5 e). The present series of experiments have explored the ability of constitutively active pseudosubstrate mutated variants of PKC-α, PKC-ε, or PKC-ζ to regulate the activity of the transcriptional factors AP-1, NF-AT-1, and NF-KB. Phorbol esters can stimulate AP-1 activity in T cells and synergize with calcium signals to regulate NF-AT-1. The data show that the constitutively active mutants of PKC-α and -ε, PKC-αE25, PKC-εE159, can mimic phorbol esters for both AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction. However, the phorbol ester effect on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 was not mimicked by mutated PKC-ζ. Moreover, expression of the constitutively active PKC-ζE119 alone was not sufficient to induce any of the T cell responses examined and this enzyme must therefore have a different role in T cells than the phorbol ester/DAG regulated PKC isotypes such as PKC-α or -ε. The failure of the activated PKC-ζ mutant to mimic phorbol ester in T cell activation is not unexpected since this enzyme is not regulated by phorbol esters, either in vitro or in vivo. However, the lack of response of PKC-ζ to phorbol esters does not preclude that this enzyme might have some functional effects on T cell activation which could reflect its involvement in the signal transduction pathways controlled by other lipid second messengers. For example, in vitro, PKC-ζ shares with other PKC isotypes the ability to be regulated by the D-3 phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (30Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). As well, experiments in fibroblasts using dominant negative mutants of PKC-ζ or overexpression of PKC-ζwt have suggested a role for this PKC isotype in NF-KB induction (31Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The expression of constitutively active PKC-ζ or the overexpression of PKC-ζwt is not sufficient for NF-KB transactivation in T cells which could reflect that the mechanisms of NF-KB regulation in T cell and fibroblasts differ. One aim of the present study was to see whether PKC-α and -ε have different functional effects in T cells. The data show that the constitutively active PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159 have similar effects on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction, but are different in that PKC-εE159 could transactivate an NF-KB reporter gene, whereas PKC-αE25 could not. PKC-αE25 was consistently less efficient than PKC-εE159 for transactivation of NF-AT-1 or AP-1. The explanation for this difference is not known and it is possible that it reflects that PKC-αE25 is less efficiently expressed than PKC-εE159, possibly due to intrinsic differences in the stability of these two mutated PKC isotypes. This point was difficult to assess since transfected PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159 could not be dissociated from their endogenous (wild type) counterparts in Western blot analysis. However, the differences between PKC-αE25 compared to PKC-εE159 for AP-1 and NF-AT-1 activation were at most 2-fold. The sensitivity of the NF-KB assay would have allowed the detection of a 2-fold difference in the effect of PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159. Accordingly, it would seem that there is a real difference in the relative ability of PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159 to regulate the AP-1 and NF-KB family of transcriptional factors. In T cells, phorbol esters and DAGs stimulate the accumulation of “active” p21-GTP complexes in a PKC-dependent response (32Izquierdo M. Downward J. Graves J.D. Cantrell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This observation, combined with a requirement for Ras function for phorbol ester regulation of interleukin 2 gene expression (8Rayter S. Woodrow M. Lucas S.C. Cantrell D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4549-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) led to the idea that PKC functioned upstream of p21 in T lymphocytes. The relationship between PKC and Ras in other cell lineages is more complicated, particularily in fibroblasts, where it has been suggested that PKC may function both upstream and downstream of Ras. In the present study, we have compared the effect of a constitutively active Ras protein and constitutively active PKC-α and -ε mutants on T cell responses. If either of these isotypes functioned directly upstream or downstream of p21, then it would be expected that the functional effects of the active PKC mutants, PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159, would be the same as the effects of an “activated” Ras protein, p21v-Ha-. For AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction, p21v-Ha-, PKC-αE25, or PKC-εE159 have comparable effects and can mimic the effect of phorbol esters. However, PKC-εE159 could stimulate NF-KB, whereas the activated Ras mutant could not, which indicates clearly that not all PKC functions in T cells are mediated by p21. p21 controlled signaling pathways are necessary for regulating surface levels of the CD69 antigen and thus transfection of p21v-Ha- alone into Jurkat cells results in the expression of CD69 (25D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). If PKC-α or -ε function upstream of p21 then it would be predicted that cells transfected with activated mutants of PKC would also express CD69. The data in the present report show that phorbol ester treatment of T cells induces CD69 as does transfection of v -src. Transfection of v-Ha -ras is also able to induce CD69 in JH6.2 cells, although consistently to a lesser extent than v -src. In contrast, expression of PKC-αE25 and PKC-εE159 failed to induce CD69 expression. The implication from these data are that phorbol ester induction of CD69 is not mediated by PKC-α or PKC-ε, and therefore is likely to be regulated by another PKC isotype or, alternatively by another phorbol ester-dependent effector. Moreover, the data suggest that neither PKC-α nor PKC-ε regulate the activity of p21. In this context, p21 functions upstream of the protein serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 in many cells, and thus cells expressing constitutively activated Ras and Raf proteins have a similar phenotype. In the present report, v-Ha -ras and v -raf have a comparable effect on CD69 expression which illustrates that there is no intrinsic problem associated with the induction of CD69 by a constitutively active protein serine/threonine kinase. Thus the simplest interpretation of differences between the functional effects of v-Ha -ras and PKC-αE25 or PKC-εE159 with regard to CD69 induction is that these molecules are not positioned linearily in the same signaling pathway. Nevertheless, their similar effects on AP-1 and NF-AT-1 induction indicated that there must be some point of convergence of Ras and PKC-α/ε signals. One such convergence point for Ras and PKC could be at the level of the extracellular signal-regulated or mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERKs/MAPKs) cascade (33Pulverer B.J. Hughes K. Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. Leevers S.J. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). T cells express more than one member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family including ERK-2 and JNK-1 (34Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 35Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that p21 and PKC-α and -ε activate AP-1 and NF-AT-1 via parallel pathways that use different members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. The point of convergence of the signaling pathways would thus be in the nucleus at the level of transcriptional factor phosphorylation. In conclusion, it has been known for several years that T cells express multiple isoforms of PKC. The present study has shown that phorbol ester regulation of the transcriptional factors AP-1 and NF-AT-1 can be mimicked by constitutively active PKC-α and -ε. PKC-ε can transactivate NF-KB whereas PKC-α could not. PKC-ζ had no effect on AP-1, NF-AT-1, or NF-KB transactivation and its role in T cells is not yet discovered. These experiments indicate that different PKC isotypes may have selective physiological functions in T cell responses."

INTRODUCTIONThe pharmacological and therapeutic effects of several imidazoline and guanidinium derivatives, such as clonidine, guanabenz, and idazoxan, have been related to their specific interaction with α2-adrenergic receptors (1Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Van Zwieten P.A. J. Med. Chem. 1982; 25: 1389-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Wendt R.L. Scribabine A. Pharmacology of Antihypertensive Drugs.

However, during the last 10 years, several studies showed that some of these effects, including the centrally mediated decrease in blood pressure (4Bousquet P. Feldman J. Schwartz J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 230: 232-236PubMed Google Scholar) and the proconvulsant (5Jackson H.C. Dickinson S.L. Nutt D.J. Psychopharmacology. 1991; 105: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the anxiogenic-like (6Venault P. Jacquot F. Save E. Sara S. Chapouthier G. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) activities, were partially independent of the stimulation of α2-adrenergic receptors. This suggested the involvement of putative imidazoline receptors in mediating the “nonadrenergic” activities of the imidazoline and guanidinium derivatives. The existence of imidazoline binding sites (IBS)1 1The abbreviations used are: IBSimidazoline binding sitesMAOmonoamine oxidaseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. has been further supported by numerous binding and autoradiography studies showing that three imidazoline α2-adrenergic tritiated ligands, clonidine, p-aminoclonidine, and idazoxan, label binding sites that display a high affinity for imidazoline derivatives and are not recognized by catecholamines (7Bricca G.

To date, two major subclasses of IBS have been identified based on their high (I1) or low (I2) affinity for clonidine (11Michel M.C. Ernsberger P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 369-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Convergent studies (4Bousquet P. Feldman J. Schwartz J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 230: 232-236PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ernsberger P. Giuliano R. Willette R.N. Reis D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 408-418PubMed Google Scholar) attribute a role in blood pressure regulation to the I1BS. In contrast, the function of I2BS remains largely unknown.The identification of the functional activity of I2BS has been hindered mostly by the lack of a purified endogenous ligand as well as by the difficulty to define the agonist or antagonist properties of their synthetic ligands. To address the functional role of I2BS we used an alternative approach consisting of the characterization of their subcellular localization and structural properties. By this strategy, we showed that I2BS is a 60-kDa protein (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) located in the outer membrane of mitochondria (14Tesson F. Prip-Buus C. Lemoine A. Pegorier J.P. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 155-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and selectively regulated by K+and H+in vitro (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, the major mitochondrial localization of I2BS has been confirmed in different tissues and species (15Tesson F. Limon I. Parini A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 219: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Regunathan S. Meeley M.P. Reis D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By comparing the structural and regulatory properties of I2BS with those of other outer membrane mitochondrial proteins, we observed that I2BS share with monoamine oxidases (MAO), enzymes metabolizing endogenous active substances (i.e. adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine) and exogenous amines, the same molecular weight, subcellular localization, and ion regulation. This prompted us to investigate the structural and functional relationships between I2BS and MAO. In the present study, we demonstrate that I2BS is located on both MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, the fact that I2BS ligands inhibited MAO activity independently of the interaction with the catalytic region suggests that I2BS might be involved in the regulation of the enzyme activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[3H]Idazoxan (40-60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham International. [14C]Tyramine (50-60 mCi/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. [14C]Phenylethylamine was purchased from Isotopchim (Ganagobie, France). (±)-Idazoxan was supplied by Dr. Malen from I.D.R. Servier (Suresnes, France). Cirazoline was a gift from Synthelabo (Paris, France). Clonidine was obtained from Boehringer-Ingelheim (Ridgefield, CT). Rauwolscine was purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Moxonidine was a gift from Laboratoire Therapeutique Moderne. Hydroxylapatite-agarose Ultrogel was obtained from I.B.F. (Paris, France). Superose-12 and phenyl-Sepharose 4B gels were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Europe (St. Quentin en Yvelynes, France). All remaining drugs were obtained from Sigma (Paris, France).MicrosequencingThe I2BS was purified from rabbit kidney mitochondrial membranes to apparent homogeneity by using sequential chromatofocusing and hydroxylapatite chromatographies (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified fraction was further analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluroride membrane. The 60-kDa band corresponding to I2BS was detected by staining with Amido Black, excised, and subjected to on-membrane digestion with trypsin. The generated peptides were separated by narrow-bore reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, as described previously (17Bauw G. De Loose M. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Vandekerckhove J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bauw G. Van Den Bulcke M. Van Damme J. Puype M. Van Montagu M. Vandekerckhove J. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 194-196Google Scholar). Eluting peptides were collected manually and stored at −20°C until further processing. Amino acid sequencing was carried out with an Applied Biosystems Sequencer (model 477A), on-line connected with a phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer (model 120A).Yeast TransformationThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 cells (MAT a, leu2, his3, ura3, ade2-1, canR, cyr+) were transformed by pYeDP60 plasmid (control yeast), or the expression plasmids pHMAOAV60 and pHMAOBV60 constituted, respectively, by human placental MAO-A and human liver MAO-B open reading frames cloned into pYeDP60 expression plasmid, as described previously (19Urban P. Cullin C. Pompon D. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts, obtained by enzymatic digestion of yeast cell walls, and crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared as previously described (20Renouard A. Widdowson P.S. Cordi A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Chromatographic ProceduresPreparations and solubilization of mitochondrial membranes from rabbit renal cortex were performed as described previously (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobic chromatography was carried out in a glass chromatography column (1 × 30 cm) filled with 25 ml of phenyl-Sepharose 4-B gel and equilibrated with 10 column volumes of the following buffer: 0.1% digitonin, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 20°C. Thirteen ml of solubilized extract were diluted in 10 volumes of a buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 20°C to adjust the digitonin concentration at 0.1%. Solubilized material was applied to the phenyl-Sepharose 4-B column at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, at 20°C. The column was then washed with 3 volumes of buffer containing 0.1% digitonin, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Elution was performed by applying a linear gradient (0-2 mM) of CHAPS, and 1-2-ml fractions were collected.Hydroxylapatite-agarose chromatography was performed in a 1 × 30-cm chromatography column filled with 25 ml of hydroxylapatite-agarose-Ultrogel. The gel was equilibrated with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.1% digitonin, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 20°C. Thirty ml of solubilized material (protein concentration, 1-2 mg/ml) were applied to the column at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, at 20°C. Washing and elution were performed as described previously (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.8 ml were collected and tested for sodium phosphate concentration. Prior to MAO and I2BS activities assays, eluted fractions from hydroxylapatite-agarose columns were desalted by centrifugation on UNISEP Ultracent-30 (Bio-Rad) to adjust the sodium phosphate concentration at 10 mM.Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography column. Fractions from hydroxylapatite-agarose column displaying [3H]idazoxan binding and MAO activities were pooled, desalted, concentrated to 200 μl, and applied to the Superose 12 column. The elution was performed using buffer A at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected.Binding StudiesMitochondrial membranes from rabbit renal cortex or transformed yeast cells (50 μg of protein) were incubated at 20°C for 45 min in a final volume of 250 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, unless otherwise mentioned, with the required concentrations of [3H]idazoxan in the presence of 10-5M rauwolscine to mask any α2-adrenergic receptor. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 μM cirazoline. At the end of the incubation, bound radioligand was separated from free by vacuum filtration as described previously (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were placed in 5 ml of Ready-Safe scintillation fluid (Beckman), and the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Packard, model Tri-Carb 300) at 48% efficiency. [3H]Idazoxan binding on solubilized extracts was performed in the same experimental conditions except that incubation was ended by precipitation with bovine γ-globulin/polyethylene glycol followed by vacuum filtration over glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B). Binding data were analyzed using a nonlinear least-square curve fitting procedure (PRISM™, GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA).Monoamine Oxidase Activity MeasurementMembranes (50 μg of protein) or solubilized extracts were incubated at 37°C for 20 min, unless otherwise mentioned, in a final volume of 250 μl of sodium phosphate buffer, 50 mM, pH 7.5, with the required concentrations of [14C]tyramine or [14C]phenylethylamine. Pargyline (10-5M) was used to define monoamine oxidase-specific activity. The reaction was ended by addition of 1 ml of HCl, 2 N, 4°C. The reaction product was extracted by addition of 2 ml of ethyl acetate/toluene (v/v), and the radioactivity contained in the organic phase was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer at 97% efficiency. Steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated using a nonlinear least-square curve fitting procedure (PRISM™).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe I2BS was purified from rabbit kidney mitochondrial membranes to apparent homogeneity by using sequential chromatofocusing and hydroxylapatite chromatographies (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsequencing of selected tryptic peptides allowed for the recovery of four peptide sequence stretches. Amino acid sequences of such peptides displayed 50-85.7% similarity with human, rat, and bovine MAO-A and MAO-B (Fig. 1). These data, along with other studies showing that I2BS and MAO are co-localized in different areas of rabbit and human brain (20Renouard A. Widdowson P.S. Cordi A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Sastre M. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), further supported the hypothesis of structural relationship between I2BS and MAOs.To address this issue, we combined biochemical and molecular biology approaches. First, we investigated whether I2BS and MAO could be discriminated through their biophysical properties. Treatment of mitochondria from rabbit kidney with increasing digitonin concentrations allowed a dose-dependent solubilization of both I2BS and MAO activities. The recoveries of [3H]idazoxan binding and [14C]tyramine degradation rate at the different digitonin concentrations were significantly correlated (r = 0.987, p < 0.01), suggesting a similar insertion of I2BS and MAO in the mitochondrial membrane matrix. Using hydrophobic, hydroxylapatite, and size exclusion chromatography, I2BS and MAO activities were systematically eluted in the same fractions (Fig. 2), and the recovery of [3H]idazoxan binding and [14C]tyramine degrading activity were almost identical after each chromatographic procedure (data not shown). These data indicate that I2BS and MAO share structural properties preventing their separation by purification procedures.Figure 2:Elution profiles of I2BS and MAO activities after separation of solubilized rabbit renal cortex mitochondrial membranes by phenyl-Sepharose 4-B (A), hydroxylapatite-agarose (B), and Superose 12 (C) chromatography. Chromatographic procedures were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each chromatography, the elution profile was recorded by a UV detector set at 280 nm. Fractions were tested for I2BS and MAO activities in a final volume of 125 μl. The I2BS density (•) was measured by binding studies with 20 nM [3H]idazoxan using 10-6M cirazoline to define nonspecific binding. MAO activity (▴) was defined by measuring the specific oxidation of 1 mM [14C]tyramine (isotopic dilution, 1:100) for 20 min, in presence or absence of 10-5M pargyline. Solid lines, optical density.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assess whether I2BS and MAO are a single entity or two co-purified, tightly associated proteins, we transformed yeast with recombinant cDNA encoding for human placenta MAO-A or human liver MAO-B (22Urban P. Andersen J.L. Hsu H.P.P. Pompon D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Then, we verified if I2BS could be co-expressed with the enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 3, I2BS and MAO were not expressed in wild-type and control plasmid transformed yeast. In contrast, expression of MAO-A or MAO-B gave rise simultaneously to [3H]idazoxan binding in yeast mitochondria. [3H]Idazoxan binding was saturable, of high affinity and reversible. Indeed, Scatchard analysis of saturation experiments showed that [3H]idazoxan interacted with a homogeneous population of high affinity binding sites in yeast cells expressing MAO-A (Bmax 1.81 ± 0.41 pmol/mg of protein, Kd94.4 ± 13.3 nM) or MAO-B (Bmax 1.39 ± 0.13 pmol/mg of protein, Kd25.7 ± 1.7 nM). In addition, [3H]idazoxan-specific binding was completely dissociated after the addition of a large excess of cold ligand to the mitochondrial preparations (t1/2= 2.32 min). The [3H]idazoxan binding sites co-expressed with MAO-A and MAO-B display ligand recognition properties consistent with those described for I2BS. Indeed, competition studies showed that, in yeast expressing MAO-A or MAO-B, [3H]idazoxan binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner and with similar affinities by the I2BS ligands cirazoline (KI5.08 ± 1.73 nM; 2.97 ± 1.09 nM for MAO-A and -B, respectively) and guanabenz (KI35.2 ± 9.5 nM; 41.8 ± 8.2 nM for MAO-A and -B) and poorly affected by clonidine or moxonidine, selective ligands for I1BS, and by the α2antagonist rauwolscine (KI> 10 μM). Taken together, these data clearly show that I2BS is located on both MAO-A and MAO-B.Figure 3:Expression of MAOs and I2BS in yeast cells. I2BS density and MAO activity in wild-type, control, and transformed yeast cells expressing MAO-A (upper panel) or MAO-B (lower panel). I2BS densities (white bars) and MAO activities (black bars) in mitochondrial membranes were evaluated on 50 μg of protein by saturation studies of [3H]idazoxan binding (using [3H]idazoxan concentration from 1 to 150 nM) and by applying the radiochemical assay with [14C]tyramine for MAO-A (upper panel) or [14C]phenylethylamine for MAO-B (lower panel), respectively. Results were the mean ± S.E. of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, to define the localization of I2BS with respect to the binding sites of classical MAO inhibitors, we tested the effect of clorgyline, deprenyl, pargyline, Ro 411049, and Ro 196327 on [3H]idazoxan binding. In yeast expressing MAO-A or MAO-B, MAO inhibitors failed to inhibit [3H]idazoxan binding at concentration up to 5 μM. These findings, in addition to previous results obtained from [3H]idazoxan binding studies in rabbit cerebral (20Renouard A. Widdowson P.S. Cordi A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and renal cortex2 2F. Tesson, I. Limon-Boulez, P. Urban, M. Puype, J. Vandekerckhove, I. Coupry, D. Pompon, and A. Parini, unpublished results. and rat cerebral cortex (23Olmos G. Gabilondo A.M. Miralles A. Escriba P.V. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicate that I2BS are not associated to MAO regions interacting with classical MAO inhibitors.To investigate the involvement of I2BS in the regulation of MAO activity, we studied the effect of imidazoline and related compounds on MAO-dependent [14C]tyramine oxidation in mitochondria from rabbit kidney and transformed yeast cells. As observed for [3H]idazoxan binding, MAO activity was inhibited dose-dependently by cirazoline and guanabenz but not by clonidine, moxonidine, or rauwolscine (Fig. 4 A). The mechanism of MAO inhibition by cirazoline and guanabenz was distinct from the “suicide inhibition” previously reported for various MAO inhibitors (24Singer T.P. Ramsay R.R. Yasuhara H. Parvez S.H. Oguchi K. Sandler M. Nagatsu T. Monoamine Oxidase: Basic and Clinical Aspects. VSP, Utrecht1993: 23-43Google Scholar). Indeed, MAO activity was fully recovered after removing of cirazoline or guanabenz by extensive membrane washing (98 ± 2% versus control). To determine the type of MAO inhibition by imidazoline derivatives, we studied the effect of cirazoline on [14C]tyramine oxidation in mitochondria from rabbit kidney. The double reciprocal plot of MAO velocity versus substrate concentration curve showed that cirazoline acts as a noncompetitive MAO inhibitor as it decreased Vmax and did not affect Km(Fig. 4 B). Thus, inhibition of MAO activity by imidazoline derivatives occurs by a mechanism distinct from the direct interaction with the MAO catalytic site. Comparison of results from radioligand and enzyme assays showed that inhibition constants of imidazoline derivatives were lower for [3H]idazoxan binding to I2BS than for MAO activities. Multiple factors may account for discrepancy. First, in competition studies, we found that [3H]idazoxan binding to mitochondrial I2BS was inhibited by the MAO substrates tyramine, serotonin, and phenylethylamine, at concentrations close to the lowest required for the measure of MAO activity (Fig. 5). Thus, competition of ligand binding to I2BS by the MAO substrates may be responsible, in part, for the decrease in the potency of imidazoline derivatives to inhibit the enzyme activity. Second, previous studies have shown that I2BS and MAO activities are regulated by different factors including K+(25Coupry I. Atlas D. Podevin R.A. Uzielli I. Parini A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar) and H+(13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 2, protein(s) and various endogenous ligands isolated in the central nervous system and in the periphery (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Singer T.P. Ramsay R.R. Yasuhara H. Parvez S.H. Oguchi K. Sandler M. Nagatsu T. Monoamine Oxidase: Basic and Clinical Aspects. VSP, Utrecht1993: 23-43Google Scholar, 26Li G. Regunathan S. Barrow C.J. Eshraghi J. Cooper R. Reis D.J.

It is conceivable that the presence or the absence of one of these regulatory factors could modulate the effects of I2BS on MAO activity. This is particularly true considering that I2BS ligands bind to a MAO regulatory domain and do not interact directly with the catalytic site. Finally, two observations indicate that the high affinity state of I2BS may be associated to a small population of MAOs: 1) in different human tissues and transformed yeast cells, the density of I2BS is much lower than the number of MAO molecules (14Tesson F. Prip-Buus C. Lemoine A. Pegorier J.P. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 155-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tesson F. Limon I. Parini A. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1953-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and 2) within the same tissue, various conformational states of MAOs can be expressed depending on their assembling in the mitochondrial membranes and their interaction with membrane or cytosolic factors (30Weyler W. Hsu Y.P.P. Breakefield X.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 47: 391-417Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of I2BS ligands on a subpopulation of MAOs may not be precisely quantified by the classical enzyme assay, which measures the total MAO activity. At present, further studies are necessary to define the role of I2BS in the inhibition of MAO activity. However, the involvement of I2BS in the regulation of MAO activity is supported by biochemical and functional studies: first, the order of potency for inhibition of [3H]idazoxan binding and MAO activities are identical; second, both ligand binding to I2BS and inhibition of MAO activity by imidazoline derivatives are fully reversible processes; finally, I2BS ligands, independently of their interaction with α2-adrenergic receptors, regulate centrally mediated activities where MAO are implied (5Jackson H.C.

Indirect evidence for a relationship between I2BS and MAOs has been previously suggested by other studies showing that their density increases simultaneously in human brain in the elderly (21Sastre M. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Alzheimer's disease (32Ruiz J. Martin I. Callado L.F. Meana J.J. Barturen F. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 160: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the I2BS density is down-regulated by rat chronic treatment with MAO inhibitors clorgyline and pargyline (23Olmos G. Gabilondo A.M. Miralles A. Escriba P.V. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The molecular relationship between I2BS and MAOs being clearly defined, our results should contribute to characterize definitively the functional activity of I2BS and to identify a novel mechanism of MAO regulation. INTRODUCTIONThe pharmacological and therapeutic effects of several imidazoline and guanidinium derivatives, such as clonidine, guanabenz, and idazoxan, have been related to their specific interaction with α2-adrenergic receptors (1Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Van Zwieten P.A. J. Med. Chem. 1982; 25: 1389-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Wendt R.L. Scribabine A. Pharmacology of Antihypertensive Drugs.

However, during the last 10 years, several studies showed that some of these effects, including the centrally mediated decrease in blood pressure (4Bousquet P. Feldman J. Schwartz J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 230: 232-236PubMed Google Scholar) and the proconvulsant (5Jackson H.C. Dickinson S.L. Nutt D.J. Psychopharmacology. 1991; 105: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the anxiogenic-like (6Venault P. Jacquot F. Save E. Sara S. Chapouthier G. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) activities, were partially independent of the stimulation of α2-adrenergic receptors. This suggested the involvement of putative imidazoline receptors in mediating the “nonadrenergic” activities of the imidazoline and guanidinium derivatives. The existence of imidazoline binding sites (IBS)1 1The abbreviations used are: IBSimidazoline binding sitesMAOmonoamine oxidaseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. has been further supported by numerous binding and autoradiography studies showing that three imidazoline α2-adrenergic tritiated ligands, clonidine, p-aminoclonidine, and idazoxan, label binding sites that display a high affinity for imidazoline derivatives and are not recognized by catecholamines (7Bricca G.

To date, two major subclasses of IBS have been identified based on their high (I1) or low (I2) affinity for clonidine (11Michel M.C. Ernsberger P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 369-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Convergent studies (4Bousquet P. Feldman J. Schwartz J. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Ther. 1990; 253: 408-418PubMed Google Scholar) attribute a role in blood pressure regulation to the I1BS. In contrast, the function of I2BS remains largely unknown.The identification of the functional activity of I2BS has been hindered mostly by the lack of a purified endogenous ligand as well as by the difficulty to define the agonist or antagonist properties of their synthetic ligands. To address the functional role of I2BS we used an alternative approach consisting of the characterization of their subcellular localization and structural properties. By this strategy, we showed that I2BS is a 60-kDa protein (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) located in the outer membrane of mitochondria (14Tesson F. Prip-Buus C. Lemoine A. Pegorier J.P. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 155-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and selectively regulated by K+and H+in vitro (13Limon I. Coupry I. Lanier S.M. Parini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21645-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, the major mitochondrial localization of I2BS has been confirmed in different tissues and species (15Tesson F. Limon I. Parini A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 219: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Regunathan S. Meeley M.P. Reis D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By comparing the structural and regulatory properties of I2BS with those of other outer membrane mitochondrial proteins, we observed that I2BS share with monoamine oxidases (MAO), enzymes metabolizing endogenous active substances (i.e. adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine) and exogenous amines, the same molecular weight, subcellular localization, and ion regulation. This prompted us to investigate the structural and functional relationships between I2BS and MAO. In the present study, we demonstrate that I2BS is located on both MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, the fact that I2BS ligands inhibited MAO activity independently of the interaction with the catalytic region suggests that I2BS might be involved in the regulation of the enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2047500417,"Activation of growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases frequently results in the binding of numerous proteins to their tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains. These interactions involve the SH2 domains of the binding proteins and phosphorylated tyrosines on the receptor molecules, with the specificity of interaction dictated by the amino acid composition surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine. In the case of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, the major binding site for Src family tyrosine kinases is in the juxtamembrane domain and includes tyrosine 579 (Mori, S., Ronnstrand, L., Yokote, K., Engstrom, A., Courtneidge, S. A., Claesson-Welsh, L., and Heldin, C-H. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 2257-2264). To analyze in more detail which amino acids surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine at position 579 were important for high affinity interaction with Src family kinases, we synthesized a series of phosphopeptides corresponding to this binding site in which single amino acids were individually changed and tested their ability to compete with the PDGF receptor for binding of Fyn. We found that not only the three residues carboxyl-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine were important but that also residues at positions −1 and +4 relative to the tyrosine were required. Phosphorylation of both tyrosines 579 and 581 significantly increased competition efficiency. The activated colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor, which is known to associate with Src family kinases, has a sequence in its juxtamembrane region similar to that surrounding Tyr-579 of the PDGF receptor, and a phosphopeptide modeled on this sequence competed the association of Fyn with the receptor in vitro. Furthermore, mutational analysis demonstrated that these sequences were required for the efficient association of Src family kinases with the activated CSF-1 receptor in vivo. Phosphopeptides corresponding to the Src family binding sites of both PDGF and CSF-1 receptors activated Src kinase activity in vitro. These observations support a model in which the enzymatic activity of Src family tyrosine kinases is controlled by intra- and intermolecular interactions of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides with the SH2 domain of the kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1966782345,"NGFI-A (also known as EGR-1, zif/268, and Krox-24) is a zinc finger transcription factor induced in many cell types by a variety of growth and differentiation stimuli. To determine if NGFI-A plays a requisite role in these processes, we used homologous recombination to mutate both alleles of NGFI-A in embryonic stem (ES) cells and examined its effect on growth and differentiation. We find that ES cells lacking NGFI-A exhibit similar growth rates and serum-induced gene expression profiles compared to wild-type parental cells. They are capable of differentiating into neurons, cardiac myocytes, chondrocytes, and squamous epithelium. Chimeric mice were generated from targeted ES cells, and their progeny were crossed to produce homozygous mutant mice. Growth and histological analyses of mice lacking NGFI-A confirm the finding in ES cells that NGFI-A is not required for many of the processes associated with its expression and suggest that the function of NGFI-A is either more subtle in vivo or masked by redundant expression provided by other gene family members such as NGFI-C, Krox-20, or EGR3.

The expression of NGFI-A has been detected in a variety of differentiation paradigms such as embryonal carcinoma cells into myocytes or neurons, pre-osteoblasts into osteoblasts, and myelomonocytic precursors into macrophages (16Edwards S.A. Darland T. Sosnowski R. Samuels M. Adamson E.D. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Lanoix J. Belhumeur P. Lussier M. Royal A. Bravo R. Skup D.

While most of the evidence for the involvement of NGFI-A in these processes has been correlative, antisense strategies directed against NGFI-A have shown that NGFI-A is necessary for macrophage differentiation as well as for T lymphocyte proliferation (20Nguyen H.Q. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21Perez-Castillo A. Pipaon C. Garcia I. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19445-19450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the importance of NGFI-A in the variety of cellular processes associated with its induction, we used homologous recombination followed by culture in elevated G418 to inactivate both copies of NGFI-A in embryonic stem (ES) cells. In this report, we demonstrate that NGFI-A is not required for the growth and differentiation of ES cells. We confirm and extend these findings by examining homozygous mutant mice derived from the targeted ES cells and find that mice lacking NGFI-A exhibit no overt defects in growth or differentiation. To construct the targeting vectors, a 4.5-kb EcoRI/ XbaI fragment encompassing −1.0 kb relative to the transcription start site to the 3′-UTR of the NGFI-A gene was isolated from a λDash II Balb/c mouse genomic library (Stratagene) and cloned into the corresponding sites in pGEM-7z(+) (Promega). The neomycin resistance gene cassette MC1neopAβAct (22McMahon A. Bradley A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1073-1085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), PGKneo, or PGKneopA (23Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar) was cloned into a unique NdeI site located upstream of the DNA binding domain using XhoI linkers. The thymidine kinase gene cassette MC1TK was cloned 3′ of the short arm of homology as an XhoI/ SalI fragment into a SalI site carried over from the phage polylinker to create either pA(MC1neopA)TK, pA(PGKneopA)TK, or pA(PGKneo)TK. AB1 and D3 ES cells were passaged every 2-3 days, maintained with daily changes of ES medium (DMEM containing 15% fetal calf serum (HyClone or Sigma), 10 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10-20 μg of LIF (Life Technologies, Inc.) antibiotics), and cultured on γ-irradiated neomycin-resistant primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). ES cells were shown in preliminary experiments to contribute extensively to chimeric mice (30-75% as determined by coat color) when injected into day 3.5 C57Bl/6 host blastocysts (24Robertson E. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Washington DC1987Google Scholar). NsiI-linearized targeting vector (25 μg) was electroporated into approximately 107trypsinized ES cells suspended in 0.9 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.2) using a BTX electroporator at 260 V, 500 μF. After plating onto 10-cm MEF feeder plates for 24 h, drug selection was applied using G418 (330 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) with or without 2 μM ganciclovir (Syntex). Approximately 103colonies survived selection in G418 alone with 2-5-fold reduction in numbers with ganciclovir, while no reduction was seen in cells transfected with a vector lacking the TK expression cassette. Colony halves were picked and pooled in groups of five for PCR analysis, while the corresponding half was plated onto individual 96 wells containing MEF feeders. DNA for PCR was prepared from cells by lysis in 50 μL of 1 × PCR buffer, digested for 3 h to overnight in 10 μg/ml proteinase K, which was then heat-inactivated at 95−100°C for 15 min (25Kim H.S. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8887-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Half of the lysate was used for PCR analysis using primers specific for the neomycin resistance gene and the 3′-untranslated region of NGFI-A external to the targeting vector, with conditions previously determined from cells transfected with a positive control template. Individual clones were identified from positive pools and expanded for Southern analysis. Blots were exposed to x-ray film (Amersham Corp.) or to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics). ES cells conditioned to grow in the absence of MEF feeders were plated in triplicate onto gelatinized six-well plates to yield approximately 1 × 103colonies. At various times, cells were trypsinized, and cell counts were determined in duplicate for each well. Error bars represent standard deviation from the mean. For serum response analysis, ES cells deprived of serum for 12-24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum were induced with fetal calf serum at a final concentration of 20% and harvested at various times after induction. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62682) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed in 2.2 M formaldehyde gels, transferred onto Sureblot nylon membranes (Oncor), and probed with either a 400-bp BglII/ XbaI fragment of the 3′-UTR of NGFI-A, full-length c- fos cDNA (ATCC), a 410-bp BglII fragment of the 3′-UTR of NGFI-B, or full-length cyclophilin cDNA, and exposed for 12-24 h to PhosphorImager screens. Immunoblots were prepared (27Day M.L. Fahrner T.J. Aykent S. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15253-15260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from 5 × 106uninduced or serum-stimulated ES cells or NGF-induced PC12 cells and probed by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) using the anti-NGFI-A mAb 6H10. For lymphocyte proliferation assays, single cell suspensions of spleens from adult mice were prepared by mincing between frosted slides. Cells were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution and plated into flat bottom 96-well plates at 5 × 105cells/well in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 mM HEPES, and 2 × 10-5M 2-mercaptoethanol. Following exposure to either concanavalin A (Sigma) or anti-CD3 antibody, cells were incubated at 37°C at 5% CO2for 72 h, followed by an additional incubation for 20 h in the presence of added [3H]thymidine (0.4 μCi/well). For stimulation by anti-CD3 antibody, cells were plated onto anti-CD3 antibody-coated plates which were prepared by incubating 2C11 hybridoma cell culture supernatant at various dilutions for 12 h at 37°C, after which the medium was aspirated and the plates were allowed to dry. For differentiation assays, ES cells were lightly trypsinized, aggregated to form simple embryoid bodies (24Robertson E. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Washington DC1987Google Scholar), and plated 4-5 days later onto gelatinized plates. Neurons, beating cardiac myocytes, and other cell types were distinguishable morphologically between 4 and 12 days after plating. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of cardiac myosin was performed on cells fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS by incubating mAb 3A6.8 made against cardiac myosin2 2S. C. Smith, unpublished results. followed with rhodamine-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Teratomas were produced by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection of 107ES cells into SCID mice. Tumors were evident by 3 weeks after injection, at which time the mice were sacrificed. Tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight, incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS, embedded in OCT (TissueTek), cut into 7-μm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Blastocyst injection (24Robertson E. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Washington DC1987Google Scholar) of two D3 ES cell-derived clones A4 and Z, singly targeted by the vectors pA(MC1neopA)TK and pA(PGKneo)TK, respectively, resulted in chimeras which transmitted the agouti allele as well as the targeted allele to their offspring. The resulting heterozygotes were mated to produce homozygous mutants lacking the wild type allele. All subsequent analyses were performed on mice derived from either of these clones. For histological analysis, mice were perfused transcardially, and their tissues fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Bones were decalcified following fixation by overnight incubation in 10% formic acid in PBS. Tissues were processed for paraffin embedding, sectioned into 6-7-μm sections, and stained as described in figure legends. To disrupt NGFI-A, we used a 4.5-kb genomic fragment of the NGFI-A gene to construct a replacement-type targeting vector (28Thomas K. Capecchi M. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar), which upon homologous recombination, introduces several in-frame stop codons that truncate the NGFI-A coding sequence upstream of the DNA binding domain. The negative selectable marker thymidine kinase (MC1TK) was attached at the end of the genomic fragment to select against nonhomologous recombination (Fig. 1 a) (29Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Linearized targeting vector was electroporated into AB1 or D3 ES cells and transfectants were selected by culture in G418 and ganciclovir. From 580 doubly resistant colonies, four had incorporated the targeting vector by homologous recombination as assessed by PCR and verified by Southern blot (Fig. 1 b). No other integration sites were detected when blots were probed specifically for the neomycin cassette (data not shown). From these heterozygous clones, homozygous mutant ES cells were generated by culturing in elevated concentrations of G418 (3-4 mg/ml) (30Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Surviving colonies were screened by Southern blot to identify clones homozygous for the targeted allele. (Fig. 1 c). Because NGFI-A is rapidly induced in quiescent fibroblasts upon treatment with serum (6Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C.P. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. Le Beau M. Adamson E.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 8Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 31Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that serum also induced NGFI-A in quiescent ES cells. After treatment of ES cells with serum for 1 h, NGFI-A mRNA and protein were detected in wild type cells, but were absent in the homozygous mutant cells, confirming that the targeting vector disrupted the NGFI-A gene (Fig. 2, a and b). We next examined the effect of this mutation on ES cells in 1) their growth rate and 2) their serum induction profiles of other immediate-early genes. To compare growth rates, equivalent numbers of wild type and mutant cells were plated and cell counts were taken at various times afterward. No significant differences were observed in cell number during the exponential growth phase (Fig. 2 c), with cell doubling times ranging from 13-15 h in both wild type and mutant cells. The expression profiles of c- fos and NGFI-B mRNAs demonstrated characteristic serum induction patterns, as evidenced by an increase in mRNA levels within 1 h, but no differences were observed between wild type (WT) and mutant (KO) cells (Fig. 2 b). We also examined whether the loss of NGFI-A affected the expression of the closely related genes Krox-20, EGR-3, and NGFI-C, but no differences were observed (data not shown). Thus, NGFI-A is not essential for ES cell proliferation or the response to serum. NGFI-A is induced during the differentiation of a variety of cell types (5Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 17Lanoix J. Belhumeur P. Lussier M. Royal A. Bravo R. Skup D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 391-399PubMed Google Scholar, 18Suva L.J. Ernst M. Rodan G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 1103: 2503-2510Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additionally, NGFI-A has been implicated in the regulation of α-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene expression (32Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12813-12816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the loss of NGFI-A affected these processes, we assessed the ability of ES cells to differentiate into neurons and cardiac myocytes (24Robertson E. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Washington DC1987Google Scholar). ES cells were aggregated to form embryoid bodies which were then allowed to attach and undergo differentiation. After several days, both wild type and NGFI-A-/-cells formed neurons with extensive neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3 a). Rhythmically contracting myocytes were also observed, and these stained positive with a monoclonal antibody which recognizes cardiac myosin (Fig. 3 b). To examine the role of NGFI-A in the formation of a greater variety of tissues, we examined the ability of NGFI-A deficient ES cells to form teratomas after injection into SCID mice (24Robertson E. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Washington DC1987Google Scholar). Three weeks after injection, tumors from these mice were analyzed histologically. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained tumor sections revealed the presence of a variety of tissue types including cartilage, with their chondrocytes arranged in characteristic groups or cell “nests” (Fig. 4 a, arrow); squamous epithelium, forming a stratified layer of flattened cells (Fig. 4 b, arrowheads); and striated muscle, arranged in longitudinal myofibrils containing cross-striations (Fig. 4 c, arrows). The presence of these tissues indicate that, although NGFI-A is expessed in these tissues in embryonic and adult animals, it is not required for their formation (33McMahon A.P. Champion J.E. McMahon J.A. Sukhatme V.P. Development. 1990; 108: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).3 3M. A. Watson and J. Milbrandt, unpublished observations. Taken together, the in vitro differentiation and histological analysis of teratomas demonstrate that the absence of NGFI-A does not abolish the ability of ES cells to differentiate into a variety of cell types. Injection of targeted ES cells into blastocysts resulted in chimeras which transmitted the agouti as well as the targeted allele to their offspring. Homozygous mutant mice were produced by intercross matings of the resulting heterozygotes. The NGFI-A mutant mice were born at expected Mendelian frequencies, appeared healthy, and were virtually indistinguishable from their littermates. The NGFI-A mutant mice were monitored for growth by weighing at various ages. In accord with the findings obtained from ES cells in vitro, NGFI-A does not appear to be required for growth in general as both mutant and wild type animals gained weight at the same rate (Fig. 5). NGFI-A is highly expressed in the thymus (34Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. Development. 1990; 110: 173-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in T-lymphocytes (6Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C.P. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. Le Beau M. Adamson E.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) which have been previously shown to require NGFI-A for proliferation (21Perez-Castillo A. Pipaon C. Garcia I. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19445-19450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the T cell compartment of NGFI-A-/-mice was further investigated. Histological analysis of the thymus indicated a normal architecture in NGFI-A-/-mice, as evidenced by a well demarcated cortex (C) and medulla (M) (see Fig. 7, c and d). To examine the proliferative response of peripheral lymphocytes, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured following activation by concanavalin A or anti-CD3 antibody. Surprisingly, both control and NGFI-A-/-lymphocytes demonstrated an equivalent response (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating that NGFI-A is not required for T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to these stimuli. To explore the possibility that NGFI-A is required for the formation of a variety of tissues and cell types, a histological survey was performed. Examination of coronal brain sections stained with cresyl violet revealed a normal neuronal organization and cellularity in the hippocampus (Fig. 7, a and b) and cortex (not shown), indicating that, despite the extensive expression of NGFI-A in the developing brain (34Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. Development. 1990; 110: 173-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NGFI-A does not appear to be required for its basic organization. In situ hybridization analysis has also demonstrated coordinate regulation of NGFI-A and c- fos in the developing long ends of bones where they may regulate bone or cartilage formation (33McMahon A.P. Champion J.E. McMahon J.A. Sukhatme V.P. Development. 1990; 108: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).3Longitudinal sections of the humerus taken from mice at 9 months of age showed a bone marrow cavity with normal cellularity, contained within a spongy bone shaft and epiphysis (Fig. 7, e and f). Higher magnification of the epiphyseal plate demonstrated zones of proliferation (p), hypertrophy (h), and calcification (c) of normal thickness compared to wild type samples (Fig. 7, g and h). Thus, NGFI-A does not appear to be required for bone or cartilage formation. These results confirm the findings in ES cells that differentiation into a variety of cell types remains intact despite the absence of NGFI-A. We have eliminated NGFI-A from ES cells by homologous recombination and have examined its effect on proliferative and differentiative processes associated with its expression. Our finding that ES cells proliferate normally without NGFI-A suggests either that NGFI-A has no role in ES cell proliferation, or that redundant mechanisms can compensate for NGFI-A function. We did not observe a compensatory increase, however, in the expression of other gene family members in the mutant cells. Similar observations have been reported for the targeted disruption of the immediate early genes c -fos and c -jun in which the lack of either gene did not significantly impair ES cell growth (35Field S.J. Johnson R.S. Mortensen R.M. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9306-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Hilberg F. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports have described the induction of NGFI-A during differentiation into a variety of cell types, including neurons, myocytes, and osteoblasts. We have shown by in vitro differentiation and analysis of teratomas that NGFI-A is not essential for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into multiple lineages. Additionally, NGFI-A is induced in cardiac tissue in response to hypertrophic signals and has been reported to regulate transcription of the α-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene (αCMHC) (32Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12813-12816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that NGFI-A-/-ES cells can differentiate into beating embryoid bodies, which occurs only when both α- and β-cardiac myosin heavy chain genes are expressed (38Robbins J. Gulick J. Sanchez A. Howles P. Doetschman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11905-11909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that NGFI-A is not essential for the expression of this gene. As indicated by the weight analysis, growth in general of mice lacking NGFI-A appears to be normal. It is also surprising to find an intact proliferative response to mitogenic signals in NGFI-A-/-lymphocytes, which is in direct contrast to previous studies using antisense oligonucleotides directed against NGFI-A (21Perez-Castillo A. Pipaon C. Garcia I. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19445-19450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, histological analysis of NGFI-A-/-mice indicate a variety of cell types including neurons, thymocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. These results reinforce our findings in ES cells that NGFI-A is not required for many of the processes associated with its expression and suggest either that the expression of NGFI-A is superfluous to these processes, or that other factors or gene products provide functional redundancy. It is notable that NGFI-A is a member of a gene family that includes NGFI-C, EGR3, and Krox-20. Because these genes are often coordinately regulated, a likely explanation may be that these genes provide adequate functional compensation for the absence of NGFI-A without exhibiting a compensatory increase in expression. Significant overlap in function and expression has been observed in other gene families involved in signal transduction, most notably the src family of tyrosine kinases. Targeted mutation of these genes results in minimal or undetectable phenotypes despite their widespread pattern of expression. It may therefore be necessary to target other members of the NGFI-A gene family before the full range of function of these genes can be fully recognized.

https://openalex.org/W2068132259,"Glutamate is believed to be the major excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Keeping the extracellular concentration of glutamate low, the glutamate transporters are required for normal brain function. Arachidonic acid (AA) inhibits glutamate uptake in relatively intact preparations (cells, tissue slices, and synaptosomes (Rhoads, D. E., Ockner, R. K., Peterson, N. A., and Raghupathy, E. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 1965-1970 and Volterra, A., Trotti, D., Cassutti, P., Tromba, C., Salvaggio, A., Melcangi, R. C., and Racagni, G. (1992b) J. Neurochem. 59, 600-606). The present study demonstrates that the effect of AA occurs also in a reconstituted system, consisting of a purified glutamate transporter protein incorporated into artificial cell membranes (liposomes). The characteristics of the AA effect in this system and in intact cells are similar with regard to specificity, sensitivity, time course, changes in Vmax, and affinity. AA-ethyl ester is inactive, suggesting that the free carboxylic group is required for inhibitory activity. When incubated with proteoliposomes, AA (300 μM, 15 min) mostly partitions to the lipid phase (lipid/water about 95:5). However, uptake inhibition is abolished by rapid dilution (6.5-fold) of the incubation medium (water phase), a procedure that does not modify the amount of AA associated with lipids. On the contrary, inhibition remains sustained if the same dilution volume contains as little as 5 μM AA, a concentration inactive before saturation of liposome lipids with 300 μM AA. The same degree of inhibition (60%) is obtained by 5 μM AA following preincubation with the inactive AA-ethyl ester (300 μM) instead of AA. The lipids apparently inactivate AA by extracting it from the water phase. The results suggest that AA acts on the transporter from the water phase rather than via the membrane. This could be true for other proteins as well since γ-aminobutyric acid uptake is similarly affected by AA. Glutamate is believed to be the major excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Keeping the extracellular concentration of glutamate low, the glutamate transporters are required for normal brain function. Arachidonic acid (AA) inhibits glutamate uptake in relatively intact preparations (cells, tissue slices, and synaptosomes (Rhoads, D. E., Ockner, R. K., Peterson, N. A., and Raghupathy, E. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 1965-1970 and Volterra, A., Trotti, D., Cassutti, P., Tromba, C., Salvaggio, A., Melcangi, R. C., and Racagni, G. (1992b) J. Neurochem. 59, 600-606). The present study demonstrates that the effect of AA occurs also in a reconstituted system, consisting of a purified glutamate transporter protein incorporated into artificial cell membranes (liposomes). The characteristics of the AA effect in this system and in intact cells are similar with regard to specificity, sensitivity, time course, changes in Vmax, and affinity. AA-ethyl ester is inactive, suggesting that the free carboxylic group is required for inhibitory activity. When incubated with proteoliposomes, AA (300 μM, 15 min) mostly partitions to the lipid phase (lipid/water about 95:5). However, uptake inhibition is abolished by rapid dilution (6.5-fold) of the incubation medium (water phase), a procedure that does not modify the amount of AA associated with lipids. On the contrary, inhibition remains sustained if the same dilution volume contains as little as 5 μM AA, a concentration inactive before saturation of liposome lipids with 300 μM AA. The same degree of inhibition (60%) is obtained by 5 μM AA following preincubation with the inactive AA-ethyl ester (300 μM) instead of AA. The lipids apparently inactivate AA by extracting it from the water phase. The results suggest that AA acts on the transporter from the water phase rather than via the membrane. This could be true for other proteins as well since γ-aminobutyric acid uptake is similarly affected by AA."

https://openalex.org/W2111688914,"Activated thrombin receptors on human umbilical vein endothelial cells rapidly undergo homologous desensitization, leaving the cells unable to respond to thrombin. The present studies examine the fate of activated thrombin receptors on endothelial cells and the mechanisms that restore intact receptors to the cell surface. The results show that: 1) at biologically relevant concentrations, thrombin rapidly cleaves all of its receptors on the cell surface. 2) The cleaved receptors are cleared from the cell surface in a two-phase process, with 60% being internalized within 10 min, the remainder requiring several hours. 3) The restoration of intact, thrombin-responsive receptors on the cell surface initially occurs from an intracellular pool of receptors in a process that is independent of protein synthesis. 4) Recycling of cleaved receptors either does not occur on endothelial cells or is masked by receptor clearance. 5) Subconfluent endothelial cells re-express intact receptors on the cell surface at a slower rate than confluent cells. 6) The agonist peptide, SFLLRN, also causes receptor internalization, although at concentrations greater than those required for receptor activation and desensitization. These results are distinctly different from those observed with megakaryoblastic cell lines, where >90% of the activated thrombin receptors are internalized rapidly, up to 40% of the cleaved receptors are recycled, and no intracellular pool of intact receptors has been detected. Since the primary structure of the thrombin receptor is the same in all the cell types studied, these results demonstrate that there can be substantial differences between cell types in the mechanisms involved in the clearance of activated receptors and the re-expression on the cell surface of intact receptors capable of responding to thrombin."

The vertebrate enzyme is an α2β2tetramer in which the α subunits contribute to most parts of the two catalytic sites. To study the roles of histidine and cysteine residues in this catalytic activity we converted all 5 histidines that are conserved between species, 4 nonconserved histidines, and 3 conserved cysteines of the human α subunit individually to serine and expressed the mutant α subunits together with the wild-type β subunit in insect cells by means of baculovirus vectors. Mutation of any of the 3 conserved histidines, residues 412, 483, and 501, inactivated the enzyme completely or essentially completely, with no effect on tetramer assembly or binding of the tetramer to poly(L-proline). These histidines are likely to provide the three ligands needed for the binding of Fe2+to a catalytic site. Mutation of either of the other 2 conserved histidines reduced the amount of enzyme tetramer by 20-25% and the activity of the tetramer by 30-60%. Mutation of the nonconserved histidine 324 totally prevented tetramer assembly, whereas mutation of the 3 other nonconserved histidines had no effects. Two of the 3 cysteine to serine mutations, those involving residues 486 and 511, totally prevented tetramer assembly under the present conditions, whereas the third, involving residue 150, had only a minor effect in reducing tetramer assembly and activity. The data do not support previous suggestions that cysteine residues are involved in Fe2+binding sites.

Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens and related proteins by the hydroxylation of proline residues in - X-Pro-Gly- sequences. This modification plays a central role in the synthesis of all collagens, as 4-hydroxyproline residues are essential for the folding of the newly synthesized collagen polypeptide chains into triple-helical molecules (for reviews, see Refs. 1-3). Prolyl 4-hydroxylase requires Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate. The active enzyme from vertebrates is an α2β2tetramer in which the α subunits contribute to most parts of the two catalytic sites (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T.

The 2-oxoglutarate binding site can be divided into distinct subsites; subsite I is probably a positively charged side chain of the enzyme that ionically binds the C-5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate, whereas subsite II consists of two cis-positioned coordination sites for the enzyme-bound Fe2+which is chelated by the C-2 oxo and C-1 carboxyl functions (1Kivirikko K.I.

Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A search for conserved amino acids within the sequences of several 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases demonstrated a weak homology within 2-histidine-containing motifs located about 50-70 amino acids apart, the histidines concerned being residues 412 and 483 in the human α subunit sequence (18Myllylä R.

Two cysteine residues of the α subunit have been reported to form an intrachain disulfide bond that is essential for tetramer assembly (21John D.C.A. Bulleid N.J.

The 2 asparagines, residues 96 (codon AAC) and 242 (codon AAT), which serve as the N-glycosylation sites, were converted to glutamines (codon CAG) in a double mutant α subunit. The site-directed mutagenesis steps were performed in a pBluescript (Stratagene) vector containing the full-length cDNA clone (PA-59) of the human α subunit at the SmaI site (9Helaakoski T. Vuori K.

The mutagenesis was carried out using an oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system based on the unique site elimination procedure (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), after which the plasmid was digested with PstI and BamHI, the cleavage sites for which closely flank the SmaI site. The resulting PstI- PstI and PstI and BamHI fragments containing 61 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence, the whole coding region, and 551 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence were then cloned into the PstI- BamHI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (22Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The sequences were verified by Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing (23Sanger K. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc.

The levels of expression of the wild-type and mutant prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramers were compared by densitometry of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands in nondenaturing PAGE using a bioimage (BioImage, Millipore). The α subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase has 12 histidine residues (Fig. 1). One of them is located in the alternatively spliced region in which the sequence coded by exon 9 contains a histidine in position 349, whereas the sequence coded by exon 10 contains it in position 360 (28Helaakoski T.

Thus histidine 349/360 can be regarded as a nonconserved residue. Of the remaining 11 histidines, only 5 (circled in Fig. 1) are conserved between the human and C. elegans α subunits (9Helaakoski T.

All these, together with 4 nonconserved histidines (these 9 histidines are underlined in Fig. 1) were converted individually to serine. All 5 cysteine residues (Fig. 1) are conserved in the α subunit from man to C. elegans (9Helaakoski T. Vuori K. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that cysteines 276 and 293 form an intrachain disulfide bond that is essential for tetramer assembly (21John D.C.A. Bulleid N.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14018-14025Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cysteines 486 and 511 may form another intrachain disulfide, but they are not essential for tetramer assembly. Cysteine 150 does not seem to be involved in any disulfide bonding (21John D.C.A. Bulleid N.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14018-14025Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The possible catalytic roles of cysteines as 150, 486, and 511 were studied here by converting these individually to serine. The human α subunit contains 2 asparagine residues that act as attachment sites for oligosaccharide units (asparagines 96 and 242, Fig. 1). These vary greatly in the extent of their glycosylation, the polypeptide being present in diglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and nonglycosylated forms (19Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Kedersha N.L. Tkacz J.C. Berg R.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Both these asparagines were converted to glutamines in a double mutant α subunit. In order to study whether any of the 9 histidine mutations inhibits assembly of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer, each of the mutant α subunits was expressed in insect cells together with the wild-type protein disulfide-isomerase/β subunit. The cells were harvested 72 h after baculovirus infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The Triton X-100-soluble proteins were then analyzed by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2). A distinct band corresponding to the enzyme tetramer (11Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was seen in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction from cells infected with a virus coding for either the wild-type α subunit or any of 8 out of the 9 histidine to serine mutant α subunits. The only mutant α subunit that did not form a tetramer was that containing the histidine to serine mutation in position 324. Surprisingly, this is one of the 4 nonconserved histidines studied here, this position being occupied by lysine in the C. elegans α subunit (11Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Repeated control experiments indicated that this result was not due to a methodological artifact. As the goal of this work was to identify residues critical for catalytic activity rather than tetramer assembly, this aspect was not pursued any further. Densitometric tracings of the Coomassie-stained bands corresponding to the enzyme tetramer from at least four experiments in the case of each mutant indicated that there are no major differences in the amounts of tetramer formed per unit extractable cell protein except in the case of the histidine 324 mutation described above. However, two of the mutant α subunit-coding viruses, those with histidine 165 or 221 mutation, consistently produced about 20-25% less tetramer than the other viruses (details not shown). To study the effect of the various histidine mutations on the prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity of the tetramer, Triton X-100 extracts from cell homogenates were assayed by a method based on measurement of the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (25Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). All values were expressed per 10 μg of extractable cell protein (Table I). Three histidine to serine mutations were found to have a marked effect on prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in the resulting tetramer (Table I). A mutation in position 412 or 483 totally eliminated the enzyme activity, whereas a mutation in position 501 reduced it to about 4% (Table I). None of the mutations involving the 3 nonconserved histidines that did not inhibit tetramer assembly, residues 63, 141, and 296, had any effect on enzyme activity of the tetramer. The two mutations of conserved histidines that appeared to have a minor inhibitory effect on the amount of enzyme tetramer, residue 165 and 221 (see above), produced a reduction of about 70 or 50%, respectively, in enzyme activity per unit extractable cell protein relative to that obtained with the wild-type α subunit (Table I). Since the amount of tetramer was reduced by about 20-25%, however (see above), the actual reduction in the activity of the tetramer was about 60 or 30%. The Kmvalues for Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate, and the peptide substrate with these two mutant tetramers were identical to those with the wild-type enzyme (details not shown). Further investigations into the properties of the histidine 501 to serine mutant enzyme showed no differences in the Kmvalues for Fe2+, ascorbate, or the peptide substrate relative to the wild-type enzyme, but the Kmfor 2-oxoglutarate was consistently about 3-fold (Table II). In agreement with this minor difference, the Kifor pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylate, which acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to 2-oxoglutarate, was about 2.5-fold (Table II). The main difference, however, was that the Vmax determined from the kinetic plots was consistently less than about 5% of that of the wild-type enzyme (details not shown). Because prolyl 4-hydroxylase becomes bound to poly(L-proline) even in the absence of Fe2+and other cosubstrates (3Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar, 25Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 32Tuderman L. Kuutti E.-R. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it seemed possible to determine whether the three histidine mutations that had a marked effect on enzyme activity had any effect on binding to poly(L-proline). Small aliquots of Triton X-100 extracts from cells expressing either the wild-type enzyme or an enzyme containing any of the three mutant α subunits with a histidine 412, 483, or 501 to serine substitution were mixed with poly(L-proline) linked to agarose. The recently discovered (α(II))2β2tetramer (see above), which differs from the α2β2tetramer studied here in that it does not bind to poly(L-proline) (29Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Vuori K. MacNeil I.A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), served as a control. All three mutant enzymes became bound to poly(L-proline) as efficiently as the wild-type enzyme, whereas no binding was detected with the (α(II))2β2tetramer (Fig. 3). These data indicate that none of the three histidine mutations with a marked effect on enzyme activity had any effect on the binding of the enzyme to poly(L-proline). As in the case of the histidine mutants, each of the cysteine mutant α subunits was expressed in insect cells together with the wild-type protein disulfide-isomerase/β subunit, and the Triton X-100-soluble proteins were used for the analyses. Two out of the three cysteine mutants, those involving residues 486 and 511, were found either to prevent tetramer assembly or to destabilize thetetramer to such an extent that no tetramer band was seen by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions and Coomassie staining (Fig. 4). The third cysteine mutant, that involving residue 150, had no major effect on tetramer assembly (Fig. 4), but densitometric tracings of the Coomassie-stained band indicated that the amount of tetramer formed was slightly reduced, being about 80% of that seen with most of the other viruses (details not shown). The amount of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity observed with the cysteine 150 mutant α subunit had decreased to a slightly larger extent than the amount of tetramer (I), suggesting that the specific activity of the mutant tetramer was about 80% of that of the wild-type enzyme. The two other cysteine mutants that appeared to prevent tetramer assembly generated no prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity (Table III). An α subunit containing both these mutations was found to form a tetramer, as shown by analysis of the Triton X-100-soluble proteins by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 4). Densitometric tracings of the Coomassie-stained band indicated no decrease in the amount of tetramer formed. The amount of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity observed with the double mutant α subunit was identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table III). When the tetramer was purified by an affinity column procedure and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, the size of the double mutant α subunit was distinctly smaller than that of either the diglycosylated or monoglycosylated α subunit present in the wild-type enzyme, the difference being consistent with loss of all the carbohydrate (Fig. 5). The present data demonstrate that there are 3 conserved histidine residues that play a major role in the catalytic activity of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Mutation of either histidine 412 or 483 to serine completely inactivated the enzyme, whereas mutation of histidine 501 to serine reduced its activity to about 5%. These results agree with previous data indicating that the enzyme is inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate, an effect which could be partially prevented by the presence of Fe2+and 2-oxoglutarate or Fe2+and ascorbate but not by the peptide substrate, even though the peptide becomes bound to the enzyme in the absence of Fe2+and other cosubstrates (18Myllylä R. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protection by Fe2+alone could not be studied, as Fe2+will not remain bound to the enzyme under nonturnover conditions (3Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar, 18Myllylä R. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Kaska D.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Fe2+is probably coordinated with a catalytic site of prolyl 4-hydroxylase by means of three side chains (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Kivirikko K.I. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Vuori K. Myllylä R. Parkkonen T. Pihlajaniemi T Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins.

Some early results suggested that one or more of these side chains may be cysteine residues (3Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the present data are not consistent with this suggestion, as mutation of the only cysteine that was not essential for tetramer assembly or stability, residue 150, had practically no effect on the catalytic activity of the tetramer. Analyses of another 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, isopenicillin N synthase by a variety techniques, suggest that all three Fe2+binding ligands are histidines (33Jiang F. Peisach J. Ming L.-J. Que Jr., L.J. Chen V.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11437-11445Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Ming L.-J. Que Jr., L.J. Kriauciunas A. Frolik C.A. Chen V.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6664-6673Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The most likely role for all three critical histidines identified here is that they provide the three ligands involved in the coordination of Fe2+with a catalytic site. As the main binding site for both 2-oxoglutarate (4Hanauske-Abel H.M. Günzler V. J. Theor. Biol. 1982; 94: 421-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Majamaa K. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and ascorbate (8Majamaa K. Günzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7819-7823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consists of the enzyme-bound iron atom, it is unlikely that mutation of a residue contributing to an additional subsite of either a 2-oxoglutarate or ascorbate binding site would lead to such a marked inactivation of the enzyme. Although mutation of histidine 501 increased the Kmfor 2-oxoglutarate and the Kifor pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylate about 3-fold, this increase is not consistent with the possibility that histidine 501 may provide the positively charged side chain that interacts with the negatively charged carboxyl group at C-5 of 2-oxoglutarate and is termed subsite I (5Majamaa K. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Kiof the wild-type enzyme for pyridine-2,4-dicarboyxylate, which is able to bind at subsites I and II (subsite II being Fe2+), is less than 1/10 of that of pyridine-2-carboxylate, which lacks a domain able to bind at subsite I (5Majamaa K. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Accordingly, mutation of the positively charged subsite I residue is likely to lead to a much more than a 3-fold increase in the Kmfor 2-oxoglutarate and the Kifor pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylate. The finding that the histidine 412, 483, and 501 mutant enzymes all became bound to poly(L-proline) clearly demonstrates that none of these histidines is critically involved in a poly(L-proline) binding site. This finding also suggests that none of these mutations caused any marked overall changes in the structure of the enzyme, as the sites involved in poly(L-proline) binding appear to have retained their native-type conformations. The data indicating that none of these three histidine mutations inhibited assembly of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer likewise suggest that these mutations have caused no major structural changes. A histidine-containing motif showing homology to that around histidine 483 in the α subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase has recently been identified in bovine aspartyl (asparaginyl) β-hydroxylase (36Jia S. McGinnis K. VanDusen W.J. Burke C.J. Kuo A. Griffin P.R. Sardana M.K. Elliston K.O. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7227-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the histidine present in this motif was converted to alanine, no enzyme activity was detected in the resulting mutant enzyme (36Jia S. McGinnis K. VanDusen W.J. Burke C.J. Kuo A. Griffin P.R. Sardana M.K. Elliston K.O. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7227-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, the mutant enzyme failed to bind Fe2+/2-oxoglutarate, suggesting that the histidine residue is involved in the binding of either Fe2+or 2-oxoglutarate. The data further suggested that no major structural changes had taken place as a result of the mutation (36Jia S. McGinnis K. VanDusen W.J. Burke C.J. Kuo A. Griffin P.R. Sardana M.K. Elliston K.O. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7227-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the results being in a complete agreement with those obtained here with prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Sequence analyses of flavone 3β hydroxylase from several sources also demonstrated the presence of three conserved histidines which may be involved in the binding of Fe2+to the catalytic site (37Britsch L. Dedio J. Saedler H. Forkmann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Three histidine to serine mutations appeared to influence the tetramer assembly. Surprisingly, mutation of one of the 4 nonconserved histidines, residue 324, completely prevented tetramer formation, indicating that although this position can be occupied by either histidine or lysine (11Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its occupation by serine will prevent tetramer assembly. Mutation of two conserved histidines, residue 165 or 221, had more minor effects on tetramer assembly or stability. The amount of enzyme activity obtained with these two mutants decreased to an even larger extent than the amount of tetramer, suggesting that the mutations caused some minor structural changes. The cysteine 150 to serine mutation may also have caused minor structural changes, as the amount of tetramer was consistently slightly lower, whereas the two other cysteine mutations studied, those involving residues 486 and 511, totally eliminated tetramer assembly. This result differs from those obtained in experiments on assembly of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer in a cell-free system, in that mutation of either cysteine 486 or 511 reduced the amount of tetramer formed but did not totally prevent tetramer assembly (21John D.C.A. Bulleid N.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14018-14025Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The data obtained both here and in a cell-free system (21John D.C.A. Bulleid N.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14018-14025Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggest that these 2 cysteines play a major role in maintaining the native-type structure of the α subunit, probably by intrachain disulfide bond formation, and thus these 2 cysteines are not likely to be directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. The functions of the asparagine-linked carbohydrate units present in the α subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase are unknown (3Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that enzymic removal of the carbohydrate from the tetramer has little if any effect on the enzyme activity (31Kedersha N.L. Tkacz J.C. Berg R.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present data demonstrate that mutation of both glycosylated asparagines to glutamines causes no changes in tetramer assembly or in the specific activity of the resulting tetramer. As the extent of glycosylation of these 2 asparagines in the wild-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase is highly heterogeneous, the carbohydrate-free tetramer produced here may be more suitable than the wild-type tetramer for attempts to crystallize the enzyme.

INTRODUCTIONThe induction of malignant tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system of the rat by pulse exposure to the alkylating N-nitroso carcinogen ethylnitrosourea (EtNU1; 1The abbreviations used are: EtNUN-ethyl- N-nitrosoureamAbmonoclonal antibody/antibodiesgpglycoproteinbpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCR.

Nature. 1966; 210: 1378-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) provides a model for the molecular analysis of cell type-specific carcinogenesis (Rajewsky et al., 1977Rajewsky M.F. Augenlicht L.H. Biessmann H. Goth R. Hülser D.F. Laerum O.D. Lomakina L.Ya. Hiatt H.H. Watson J.D. Winsten J.A. Origins of Human Cancer.

Academic Press, New York1985: 155-171Google Scholar). Specific DNA-alkylation products formed by this carcinogen in proliferation-competent target cells may lead to mutations in genes critically associated with cell differentiation and malignant transformation. Thus, a specific mutation of the neu/erbB-2 gene, whose expression is diagnostic for EtNU-induced malignant schwannomas in the peripheral nervous system, may be traced back to a small number of mutant Schwann precursor cells with uncontrolled proliferation which first become detectable shortly after carcinogen exposure (Nikitin et al., 1991Nikitin A.Yu. Ballering L.A.P. Lyons J. Rajewsky M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9939-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, target genes of similar relevance to malignant conversion by chemical carcinogens have not yet been identified.The neuro-oncogenic effect of EtNU in the rat is strongly dependent on the developmental stage at the time of carcinogen exposure, with maximum susceptibility during the late prenatal to early postnatal period. To characterize cell subpopulations in the developing central nervous system in terms of cell lineage relationships, phenotypic differentiation, and relative risk of malignant conversion by EtNU, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been produced after immunization with intact fetal brain cells isolated at different stages of development (Kindler-Röhrborn et al., 1985Kindler-Röhrborn A. Ahrens O. Liepelt U. Rajewsky M.F. Differentiation. 1985; 30: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One of these antibodies (mAb RB13-6) recognizes a cell surface antigen expressed by a small subpopulation of neural precursor cells, but not by cells of the mature brain. In contrast, sustained expression of the RB13-6 antigen is observed in the cells of most EtNU-induced brain tumors analyzed thus far and in all tumorigenic neuroectodermal cell lines derived from such tumors or from fetal brain cells that underwent malignant transformation in culture after exposure to EtNU in vivo (e.g. cell line BT4Ca; Kindler-Röhrborn et al.

Expression of the RB13-6 antigen, as observed in brain tumors, could thus specify differentiating neural precursor cells particularly sensitive to malignant conversion by EtNU.Prior to biochemical characterization and molecular cloning of the RB13-6 antigen, the rate and equilibrium constants for binding of mAb RB13-6 to the surface of intact cells were determined and the number of antigenic determinants/cell was calculated to be ∼6,000/fetal brain cell and ∼30,000/BT4Ca cell (Dux et al., 1991aDux R. Kindler-Röhrborn A. Lennartz K. Rajewsky M.F. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Initial biochemical analyses suggested that the RB13-6 antigen was a membrane glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa (Cleeves, 1991Cleeves, V., 1991, Biochemische Charakterisierung Antikörper-definierter Zelloberflächenmoleküle Normaler und Maligner Neuraler Zellen der Ratte.

Here we describe the characterization of the membrane glycoprotein recognized by mAb RB13-6 and its large scale purification by immunoaffinity chromatography, followed by sequencing of endoproteinase-generated peptides, and isolation of the cDNA encoding gp130RB13-6from a fetal rat brain cDNA library. Potential structural and functional features of gp130RB13-6are discussed on the basis of its significant sequence homology to the human and murine plasma cell membrane glycoprotein PC-1 (van Driel and Goding, 1987van Driel I.R.

After centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was incubated with purified antibody (20 μg/ml solubilisate) for 10 min. The immunocomplex was precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 5 min at room temperature, and the matrix was washed with SBT and SBT containing 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS. Bound protein was released at 50°C by incubation with sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol) for SDS-PAGE analysis which was supplemented with 0.5%β-mercaptoethanol for reduction of samples.Preparation of Plasma MembranesAdherent BT4Ca cells were grown to confluence (∼3 × 105cells/cm2) on Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Frank et al., 1972Frank W. Ristow H.J. Schwalb S. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 70: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) containing 2% fetal calf serum. For expansion of cultures, 1/20 of confluent cell layers were cultivated on new dishes. After washing with PBS, cells were collected in PBS and resuspended in homogenization buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, and protease inhibitors: 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) at a concentration of 3 × 107cells/ml. The suspension was homogenized with a Polytron PT35 (Kinematica) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Crude membranes were collected from the resulting turbid supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, resuspended in PBS, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. After washing with PBS, the pellet was resuspended in PBS, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2and stored at −80°C. Membrane protein contents were determined according to Lowry et al., 1951Lowry O.H.

The matrix was blocked with 100 mM ethanolamine, pH 8.5, and washed several times with PBS. Plasma membranes from BT4Ca cells were solubilized for 90 min at a protein concentration of 4.2 mg/ml in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucoside (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 0.14% deoxycholate plus protease inhibitors as mentioned above. The insoluble membrane fraction was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated for 3 h with affinity matrix (20-100 μg of coupled antibody/mg of membrane protein). After washing with the buffer used for solubilization, this buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, and with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucoside, the antigen was eluted from the matrix with 100 mM diethylamine, 1 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucoside. Individual fractions were immediately neutralized by adding 1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After large scale preparation, the eluted protein was concentrated in a vacuum concentrator without neutralization and mixed with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE.Deglycosylation of Purified RB13-6 AntigenPurified protein was incubated at 95°C for 5 min at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in an aqueous solution of 30 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6% n-octyl-β-D-glucoside, 3 mM EDTA. After cooling to room temperature, 0.4 unit of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 18 h.Assay for 5′-Nucleotidase ActivityThe standard reaction mixture contained 100 μl of aqueous substrate solution (7 mM thymidine 5′-monophosphate nitrophenyl ester, Sigma), 870 μl of buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2), and 30 μl of purified gp130RB13-6diluted in 2 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucoside.Endoproteinase Cleavage, Peptide Analysis, and MicrosequencingAfter SDS-PAGE on a 7% gel, the band representing the purified antigen was excised and cleaved directly in the gel with endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim; enzyme/protein ratio 1:10) essentially according to Eckerskorn and Lottspeich, 1989Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Chromatographia. 1989; 28: 92-94Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar. Resulting peptide fragments were eluted with 60% acetonitrile, 40% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC on a Smart System (Pharmacia; detection wavelength 206 nm). Using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O as solvent A and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as solvent B, a gradient of 0 to 60% B was applied. Peptide-containing fractions were sequenced on a 473A gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.RT-PCR with Degenerate Inosine-containing PrimersThe sequences of protease-generated peptides K15, K45, and K37 (see Fig. 5) were used to design the following oligonucleotides: 5′-(AATCTGCAG)ACICACGGITACAA(T/C)AA(T/C)GA(G/A)TT-3′, 5′-(AATGAGCTC)ATGGAIGCIATITTC(C/T)TIGCICA(C/T)GG-3′, and 5′-(AATGGATCC)TTCTGIATIACIC(T/G)IGGIC(T/G)ICC(G/A)AA-3′ (opposite strand). These primers are degenerate in the 3′-region and contain inosine or the most likely nucleotide according to rat codon usage in other ambiguous positions. At the 5′-end, primers contain cleavage sites for restriction enzymes and three additional nucleotides.Poly(A)+RNA from BT4Ca cells was prepared using Oligotex-dT latex beads (Qiagen) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. After (dT)12-18-primed reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), the cDNA synthesized from 30 ng of RNA was used in a standard PCR reaction (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 35 pmol of each primer and a cycle profile of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 40°C, and 1 min at 72°C. For sequence analysis, PCR products purified by gel electrophoresis were cloned into the SrfI site of the plasmid pCRScript SK(+) (Stratagene).Isolation of cDNA Clones Encoding the RB13-6 AntigenTwenty sublibraries were generated from a λgt11 fetal rat brain library (Clontech) by plating 105phages/dish and preparation of plate lysate stocks (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sublibraries were then screened for the presence of clones encoding the RB13-6 antigen by standard PCR with 35 pmol of primers F1 (5′-TTCTGCACATCCAACCGGCAC-3′) and R1 (5′-AGTCTGCAGTGCGAGGCAGGAG-3′), using 1 μl of phage suspension containing 1-5 × 107phages. Sublibraries giving a PCR product of the expected size were plated at a density of 300 phages/cm2and screened by hybridization with the RB13-6 antigen cDNA fragment obtained by RT-PCR and labeled with α-[32P]dCTP using a multiprime labeling kit (Amersham). Standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for plating of phages, screening, and isolation of pure cDNA clones. Insert DNA of positive clones was excised with restriction endonuclease EcoRI and cloned in pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) for sequence analysis. Starting with 108phages, the 5′-end of the cDNA encoding the RB13-6 antigen was amplified from the complete phage library by sequential standard PCR with primer pairs LF (5′-GACTCCTGGAGCCCGT-3′)/R3 (5′-CCTGGGATGAGGCACAGGCTT-3′) and LF/R2 (5′-ATCCGCACAGGAACAGAGGGC-3′). For the second PCR (25 cycles: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C), 1/100 of the primary PCR mixture (5 min at 95°C; 34 cycles as described above) was used.DNA Sequencing and Sequence AnalysisDNA fragments cloned in plasmid vectors were sequenced with the AutoRead Sequencing Kit using an A.L.F. DNA sequencer (both from Pharmacia) and standard sequencing primers. For sequencing of long DNA fragments cloned in pBluescript SK(+), sequential nested deletions were generated with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease (Stratagene) according to the supplier's protocol after SacI and BamHI cleavage of the plasmid. Sequences of cloned PCR products were confirmed by sequencing several independent clones. Sequence analysis and data base searching were performed with the program package HUSAR (Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resources) used within the GENIUSnet (a service of the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg).RESULTSBiochemical Characterization and Purification of the RB13-6 Antigen for MicrosequencingmAb RB13-6 binds to a plasma membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass (SDS-PAGE) of 130 kDa, as shown by immunoprecipitation from Triton X-100 solubilisates of metabolically labeled BT4Ca cells (Fig. 1). Without reduction of the protein prior to electrophoresis, a decreased mobility between 140 kDa and 180 kDa was observed, depending on the pore size of the gel. Improved solubilization of plasma membranes isolated from antigen-positive BT4Ca cells with 50 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucoside and 0.2% deoxycholate instead of Triton X-100 permitted us to detect the specifically immunoprecipitated 130-kDa protein by conventional silver staining of the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Deglycosylation of the purified protein by cleavage with N-glycosidase F resulted in a protein core with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa (Fig. 2 B).Figure 1:Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody RB13-6 (lanes Ab) from Triton X-100 solubilisates of metabolically [35S]methionine-labeled BT4Ca cells.

SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie R-250.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The RB13-6 antigen was purified from BT4Ca cells by immunoaffinity chromatography with immobilized mAb RB13-6. Several parameters had to be optimized for successful purification (see “Experimental Procedures”): coupling of the antibody to the matrix resulting in intermediate surface density, solubilization of plama membranes with both n-octyl-β-D-glucoside and deoxycholate, the presence of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+), and high excess of coupled mAb over solubilized antigen. The antibody-antigen complex formed at the affinity matrix could be dissociated with alkaline solutions (pH > 11) or 6 M urea, but not with an acidic (pH 2) buffer. Based on the approximate number of antigenic determinants on BT4Ca cells (30,000; Dux et al. (1991a)), the yield of antigen purified according to the optimized protocol was calculated to be ∼25%.Since the N terminus of purified antigen was not accessible to Edman degradation, large scale purification was necessary to obtain an amount of protein sufficient for protease cleavage. Plasma membranes from 4.2 × 1010BT4Ca cells containing 800 mg of protein yielded ∼50 μg of homogeneous gp130RB13-6(Fig. 2 A) which was treated with endoproteinase Lys-C to generate peptides for microsequencing. After purification by HPLC, the sequences of 5 peptides (K15: KGSSNXEGGTHGYNNEF; K17: KSGPVSAGV; K29: KAPFYQPSHAEELSK; K37: KT/GNLPFGRPRVIQK; and K45: KSMEAIFLAHGPSFK) were determined by automated Edman degradation.cDNA Cloning Based on gp130RB13-6Peptide SequencesThe significant degree of homology of all gp130RB13-6peptides to the sequences of human and murine PC-1 proteins (29-64% identical amino acids) suggested a certain arrangement of the sequenced peptides in the protein (see Fig. 5). Based on their assumed positions, degenerate, inosine-containing oligonucleotides were designed from the peptide sequences K15, K45 (forward primers), and K37 (reverse primer) (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used for RT-PCR with mRNA from BT4Ca cells (Fig. 3). The amplified 400-bp cDNA fragment was then used as a probe for screening of a fetal rat brain cDNA library, resulting in a λgt11 clone with a 2.5-kilobase insert containing an open reading frame of 2420 bp. The 1.5-kilobase insert of a second isolated λ clone was found to be identical with the 3′ part of this λ insert. Completion of the 5′ region was achieved by sequential PCR amplification of a predominant 420-bp fragment from the whole phage library, using one λ-specific primer (LF) and two primers (R3, R2) from the terminal part of the known sequence (Fig. 4). The complete sequence (Fig. 5) contains an open reading frame of 2664 bp coding for 888 amino acids with a single potential initiation codon near the 5′ end. The sequence context of this ATG coding for the first Met (ACAATGG) is in accordance with the Kozak rules for functional initiation codons of vertebrate mRNAs (Kozak, 1987Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). Two consecutive stop codons at positions 2666 and 2678 terminate the open reading frame which is followed by a 97-bp noncoding sequence with a polyadenylation signal 30 bp from eight terminal adenosines. All sequenced gp130RB13-6peptides were found to be part of the derived amino acid sequence; this was considered as evidence for the authenticity of the isolated sequence.Figure 3:RT-PCR with degenerate, inosine-containing primers based on gp130RB13-6 peptide sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The degree of homology between human and murine PC-1 sequences is 81%. The entire gp130RB13-6sequence can be divided into parts of high and low homology, suggesting functional domains (Fig. 6). Sequence-based calculations of the hydrophobicity profiles (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16989) Google Scholar) of gp130RB13-6and of the PC-1 proteins confirmed their relationship and are indicative of a similarly located transmembrane domain (amino acids 23-45) followed by a short intracellular domain. Further analysis revealed several putative structural features of gp130RB13-6which are summarized in Table I. The putative catalytic domain is highly conserved between gp130RB13-6, human and murine PC-1, and a bovine intestinal nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Fig. 7).Figure 6:Amino acid sequence homology between murine PC-1 and gp130RB13-6: comparison with the homology between murine and human PC-1.

The absence of Mg2+in the assay did not affect this reaction, whereas addition of 1 mM EDTA inhibited the enzymatic cleavage.DISCUSSIONThe surface antigen recognized by mAb RB13-6 on cells of the malignant neuroectodermal rat cell line BT4Ca was identified by affinity purification and cDNA cloning as a glycoprotein (gp130) related to the human and murine PC-1 proteins. PC-1 was originally described as a cell surface antigen of differentiated, antibody-secreting B cells (Takahashi et al., 1970Takahashi T. Old L.J. Boyse E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 1325-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but later found to be expressed in other tissues also (Harahap and Goding, 1988Harahap A.R. Goding J.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2317-2320PubMed Google Scholar). The class II transmembrane protein PC-1 is a homodimer consisting of two disulfide-linked 115-kDa polypeptides. cDNA cloning of murine and human PC-1 had neither revealed homology to other proteins nor possible biological functions (van Driel and Goding, 1987van Driel I.R. Goding J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4882-4887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Buckley et al., 1990Buckley M.F. Loveland K.A. McKinstry W.J. Garson O.M. Goding J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17506-17511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rebbe et al. (1991) reported that nucleotide pyrophosphatase/alkaline phosphodiesterase I activity is associated with murine PC-1 which was confirmed by expression of enzymatically active PC-1 in CHO cells (Rebbe et al., 1993Rebbe N.F. Tong B.D. Hickman S. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PC-1 isolated from bovine liver can be phosphorylated at a threonine residue, and it has been suggested that it may act as a threonine-specific ectoprotein kinase (Oda et al., 1991Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16791-16795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Oda et al., 1993Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27318-27326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence for the existence of a soluble form of PC-1 generated by proteolytic cleavage has been published (Belli et al., 1993Belli S.I. van Driel I.R. Goding J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The protein purified from BT4Ca cells most probably corresponds to the antigenic determinant detected by the same antibody on a subpopulation of neural precursor cells of rat brain and in EtNU-induced brain tumors of the rat (Kindler-Röhrborn et al., 1985Kindler-Röhrborn A. Ahrens O. Liepelt U. Rajewsky M.F. Differentiation. 1985; 30: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 1994). Direct proof of this assumption by biochemical analysis of different cell types of the immature rat brain has thus far not been possible due to the relatively weak antigen expression and the small number of antigen-positive fetal brain cells (Dux et al., 1991aDux R. Kindler-Röhrborn A. Lennartz K. Rajewsky M.F. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Kindler-Röhrborn et al., 1994Kindler-Röhrborn A. Blass-Kampmann S. Lennartz K. Liepelt U. Minwegen R. Rajewsky M.F. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 215-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The EtNU-induced, malignant cell line BT4Ca was chosen for biochemical analysis and purification of gp130RB13-6because it combines a high rate of cell proliferation with high antigen expression. Several parameters of the purification procedure had to be defined and optimized before sufficient amounts of gp130RB13-6could be isolated, probably due to an unstable epitope recognized by the antibody, retaining its native structure only under certain conditions. The unusually high excess of affinity matrix required may be a consequence of the moderate binding affinity of the antibody (K = 1.87 × 108liters/mol; Dux et al., 1991bDux R. Kindler-Röhrborn A.

Expression of FACCγ1 in FACC-deficient Fanconi anemia (FA) lymphoblasts corrected the hypersensitivity of these cells to mitomycin C. Binding of FACCγ1 to protein A-agarose and incubation with radiolabeled cell lysates identified three polypeptides with molecular masses of 65, 50, and 35 kDa that were also detected on immunoblots probed with the purified FACCγ1 polypeptide. FACC, as well as the three FACC-binding polypeptides, co-fractionated with cytosolic and membrane extracts. Binding was specific for the FACC moiety of FACCγ1 and was detected in cytosolic extracts of a number of FA and non-FA mammalian cells. These results demonstrate that FACC binds directly to a family of ubiquitous cytosolic proteins and is conserved in a wide range of mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W1627408694,"Neu differentiation factor (NDF, or heregulin) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are structurally related proteins that bind to distinct members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Here we show that NDF inhibits EGF binding in a cell type-specific manner. The inhibitory effect is distinct from previously characterized mechanisms that involve protein kinase C and receptor internalization because it occurred at 4°C and displayed reversibility. The extent of inhibition correlated with both receptor saturation and affinity of different NDF isoforms, and it was abolished upon overexpression of either EGF receptor or ErbB-2. Binding kinetics and equilibrium analyses indicated that NDF reduced the affinity, rather than the number, of EGF receptors, through an acceleration of the rate of ligand dissociation and deceleration of the association rate. On the basis of co-immunoprecipitation of EGF and NDF receptors, we attribute the inhibitory effect to the formation of receptor heterodimers. According to this model, EGF binding to NDF-occupied heterodimers is partially blocked. This model of negative trans-regulation within the ErbB family is relevant to other subgroups of receptor tyrosine kinases and may have physiological implications.

https://openalex.org/W1479683825,"Glucokinase is distinguished from yeast hexokinase and low Kmmammalian hexokinases by its low affinity for glucose and its cooperative behavior, even though glucose binding residues and catalytic residues are highly conserved in all of these forms of hexokinase. The roles of Ser-151 and Asn-166 as determinants of hexose affinity and cooperative behavior of human glucokinase have been evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis, expression and purification of the wild-type and mutant enzymes, and steady-state kinetic analysis. Mutation of Asn-166 to arginine increased apparent affinity for both glucose and ATP by a factor of 3. Mutation of Ser-151 to cysteine, alanine, or glycine lowered the Kmfor glucose by factors of 2-, 26-, and 40-fold, respectively, decreased Vmax, abolished cooperativity for glucose, and also decreased Kmfor mannose and fructose. The Ser-151 mutants had hexose Kmvalues similar to those of yeast hexokinase, hexokinase I, and the recombinantly expressed COOH-terminal half of hexokinase I. However, the Kivalues for the competitive inhibitors, N-acetylglucosamine and glucose-6-P, were unchanged, suggesting that Ser-151 is not important for inhibitor binding. Mutation of Ser-151 also increased the Kmfor ATP about 5-fold and abolished the enzyme's low ATPase activity, which indicates it is essential for ATP hydrolysis. The substrate-induced change in intrinsic fluorescence of S151A occurred at a much lower glucose concentration than that for wild-type enzyme. The results implicate a dual role for Ser-151 as a determinant of hexose affinity and catalysis, exclusive of the glucose-induced conformational change, and suggest that the low hexose affinity of glucokinase is dependent on interaction of Ser-151 with other regions of the protein.

INTRODUCTIONGlucokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and liver and is the first rate-limiting reaction in glycolysis in these tissues (1Weinhouse S. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1976; 11: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Meglasson M.D. Matchinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab.

Glucokinase (hexokinase IV) is a member of the hexokinase family of enzymes but is distinguished from the other members of the family by its lower affinity for glucose (Km= 6.0 mM compared with 20-170 μM for the low Kmhexokinases), its molecular size (50 versus 100 kDa for hexokinase), and its cooperative behavior with respect to glucose (1Weinhouse S. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1976; 11: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Meglasson M.D. Matchinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab.

Physiol. 1982; 71: 549-555Google Scholar). Recently, the sugar specificity of human β-cell glucokinase has been studied by kinetic analysis, fluorescence techniques, and molecular modeling (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The enzyme exhibits sigmoid behavior with glucose and 2-deoxyglucose as substrates but not with mannose and fructose. A molecular model of human β-cell glucokinase predicts that the carbonyl group of Ser-151 interacts with the 2-OH of mannose and fructose while Glu-256 interacts with the 2-OH of the glucose, which suggests that Ser-151 may be involved in the enzyme's cooperative behavior (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar).The determinants of sugar specificity and cooperative behavior of human β-cell glucokinase have also been studied by mutating several putative active site residues (6Xu L.Z. Zhang W. Weber I.T. Harrison R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27458-27465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are conserved in the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of mammalian hexokinase (N-HK1 1The abbreviations used are: N-HKthe NH2-terminal half of human kidney hexokinase IC-HKthe COOH-terminal half of human kidney hexokinase IHK-HKhuman kidney hexokinase IPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGKglucokinase. and C-HK, respectively), glucokinase, and yeast hexokinase (7Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21925-21928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved putative glucose binding residues in human β-cell glucokinase are Ser-151, Asn-204, Asp-205, Asn-231, Glu-256, and Glu-290 (8Gidh-Jain M. Takeda J. Xu L.Z. Lange A.J. Vionnet N. Stoffel M. Froguel P. Velho G. Sun F. Cohen D. Patel P. Lo Y.-M.D. Hattersley A.T. Luthman H. Wedell A. Charles St., R. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Asp-205 was predicted, by analogy with yeast hexokinase, to be a base catalyst, and consistent with that hypothesis, mutation of Asp-205 to Ala decreased the kcatof the enzyme by a factor of at least 1000 (9Lange A.J. Xu L.Z. Van Poelwijk F. Granner D.K. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Asn-204, Gly-256, and Glu-290 were predicted from molecular modeling to interact with the 3-OH, 4-OH, 2-OH, and 1-OH groups of glucose (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 10Charles R.S. Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues resulted in enzymes with decreased values of kcatand increased Kmvalues for glucose, mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose (6Xu L.Z. Zhang W. Weber I.T. Harrison R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27458-27465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results support the prediction of the model that these residues interact with hexoses (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). One conserved putative hexose binding residue of glucokinase that has not yet been studied by site-directed mutagenesis is Ser-151. In addition, based on the molecular model of glucokinase (10Charles R.S. Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Asn-166 has been postulated to constitute one of the nonconserved residues whose corresponding residue in yeast hexokinase may be important for ATP binding and the glucose-induced conformational change (11Harrison, R. W., 1985, Refinement of Yeast Hexokinase A and B Crystal Structure, Ph.D. thesis, Yale University, New Haven, CT.Google Scholar). It was the object of this study to examine whether Ser-151 and Asn-166 are involved in hexose binding and/or catalysis. It is demonstrated here that point site mutations of Ser-151 but not Asn-166 convert the high Kmglucokinase to a lower Kmenzyme similar, in some of its properties, to yeast hexokinase and the low Kmmammalian hexokinases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsQ-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Glu-6-P dehydrogenase, Lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase were from Boehringer Mannheim. Glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, fructose, and all other sugars were from Sigma. The full-length cDNA for human kidney hexokinase I was a kind gift from Dr. Graeme Bell (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago). Antibody to mouse brain hexokinase I was a kind gift from Dr. John Wilson (Dept. of Biochemistry, Michigan State University).Construction of pET Expression Plasmids for Human β-Cell GlucokinaseA 2.6-kilobase human pancreatic β-cell glucokinase cDNA clone, ph-GK-20, was used to generate the construct pEhgk-WT (8Gidh-Jain M. Takeda J. Xu L.Z. Lange A.J. Vionnet N. Stoffel M. Froguel P. Velho G. Sun F. Cohen D. Patel P. Lo Y.-M.D. Hattersley A.T. Luthman H. Wedell A. Charles St., R. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1932-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). An NdeI site was generated at the 5′-end using the polymerase chain reaction with an oligonucleotide that has a one-base pair mismatch (GGCTGGTGTGCATATGCTGGACGACAG). The insert in the pET3a expression construct included the protein coding region of the cDNA as well as the 3′-untranslated region.Construction of pET3a HK-HK, N-HK, and C-HK Expression PlasmidsThe expression plasmid pET3a HK-HK was constructed from an AlwNI- XbaI fragment of the human kidney hexokinase cDNA and two pairs of complementary oligonucleotide linkers. The linkers (NdeI/ AlwNI, encoding the NH2-terminal amino acids and translation initiation site) were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated to the NdeI site of the pET3a vector and the AlwNI site of the cDNA. The 3′-linkers (XbaI/ EcoRI), encoding the COOH-terminal phenylalanine and the termination site, were similarly treated and ligated to the XbaI site of the cDNA and to the EcoRI site of pET3a.The pET3a C-HK (residues 456-920) expression plasmid was prepared by digestion of pET3a HK-HK with NdeI and NcoI, and the ends were filled in with Klenow and ligated together. The pET3a N-HK (residues 1-455) expression plasmid was prepared as follows. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a fragment of pET3a HK-HK using the T7 forward primer and a synthetic primer, which contains a termination site right after the codon for Ala-455 and a XbaI site. Both the polymerase chain reaction fragment and pET3a vector were digested with XbaI. The pET3a vector was further treated with phosphatase and ligated to the XbaI-digested polymerase chain reaction fragment to construct the pET3a N-HK. The authenticity of all plasmid constructs and fidelity of the entire coding sequence of the cDNAs was determined by dideoxy chain termination sequencing with modified T7 DNA polymerase.Construction of pET19b HK-HK, pET19b C-HK, and pET19b N-HKpET19b HK-HK was prepared by digesting the construct pET3a HK and pET19b vector with NdeI and XbaI, followed by ligation. Both pET19b C-HK and pET19b N-HK were prepared in a similar manner.Expression and Purification of HK-HK, C-HK, and N-HKThe expression of HK-HK (intact HK), C-HK, and N-HK were accomplished using the T7 RNA polymerase based system of Studier and Moffat (12Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4788) Google Scholar). Cells containing pET3a HK-HK and pET3a C-HK were induced at 22°C for 24 h and harvested, and cell pellets were then lysed by freeze-thawing × 3. The crude extracts containing HK-HK and C-HK were partially purified by 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and dialyzed against hexokinase buffer (5 mM potassium Pi, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and 10 mM glucose). The enzyme fractions were loaded on to a 100-ml DEAE-A50 ion exchange column and washed with hexokinase buffer containing 100 mM KCl. Hexokinase was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (100-500 mM). The pooled fractions were concentrated by precipitation with 65% (NH4)2SO4, dissolved in hexokinase buffer containing 100 mM KCl, and purified to homogeneity by elution from a Sephadex G-100 superfine column (1.5 × 90 cm). This purified preparation was free of bacterial hexokinase.Purifications of pET19b HK-HK and pET19b N-HK were performed as follows. Cells harboring the expression plasmids were induced and harvested as described for pET3a HK-HK. Cell pellets were then lysed by freeze-thawing × 3 except that a buffer containing 100 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, pH 8.0, was used. The crude extracts were passed through a DEAE-Sephadex column equilibrated in the same buffer. The flow through was loaded onto a 10-ml Ni-Sepharose column, and the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer containing 10 mM imidazole, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and then eluted with buffer containing 25 mM imidazole and 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The hexokinase fractions were precipitated with 65% ammonium sulfate, dissolved in 1 ml of hexokinase buffer, and purified to homogeneity on a Sephadex G-100 superfine column (1.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated with hexokinase buffer. The N-HK containing the His-tag sequence was induced and purified to near homogeneity in a similar manner. Western blots of both HK-HK and N-HK were performed using a polyclonal antibody against rat brain hexokinase.Site-directed Mutagenesis of Human β-Cell GlucokinaseMutagenesis of human β-cell glucokinase was carried out by using the method of Kunkel (13Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). A NdeI- BamHI fragment of human pancreatic glucokinase was subcloned into pBluescript. A single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was prepared, annealed to a phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide, and transformed into XL-blue cells. Mutant clones were identified by DNA sequencing. A NdeI- ClaI mutagenic fragment was subcloned into the pET3a GK vector. The entire NdeI- ClaI fragment was sequenced to confirm the authentic sequence of the pET3a GK expression vector. The double mutant (S151A and N166R) was prepared by subcloning the mutant fragment (ClaI- SstI) of N166R into the S151A mutant expression vector digested by ClaI and SstI. Oligonucleotide primers were used to make mutations as follows with the mutated codon in the lower case: GK (wild type), 5′-CCCCTGGGCTTCACCTTCTCCTTTCCTGTGAGG-3′; S151C, 5′-CCCCTGGGCTTCACCTTCtgcTTTCCTGTGAGG-3′; S151A, 5′-CCCCTGGGCTTCACCTTCgccTTTCCTGTGAGG-3′; S151G, 5′-CCCCTGGGCTTCACCTTCggcTTTCC-TGTGAGG-3′; and N166R, 5′-GAAGACATCGATAAGGGCATCCTTCTCagaTGGACCAAGGGC-3′.Bacterial Expression and Purification of Native and Mutant Forms of Human β-Cell GlucokinaseWild-type glucokinase and mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-plys S using the phage T7 RNA polymerase-based system described by Studier and Moffat (12Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4788) Google Scholar), except that a lower induction temperature was used (9Lange A.J. Xu L.Z. Van Poelwijk F. Granner D.K. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similar yields of about 20 mg/liter were obtained for all of the mutants and for the wild-type enzyme. Cell extracts containing glucokinase were freeze-thawed three times to break the cells, and 100 μg/ml DNase A and 1 mg/ml lysozyme were added to the cell extract at 4°C for 1 h. Glucokinase was first partially purified by precipitation with 40-65% (NH4)2SO4. The pellet was dissolved in glucokinase buffer (50 mM potassium Pi, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), dialyzed against the same buffer, and then loaded on to a 100-ml Q-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 2 liters of glucokinase buffer containing 150 mM KCl, and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 150-450 mM KCl. The fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled, precipitated with 70% (NH4)2SO4, and dissolved in 1 ml of glucokinase buffer. Glucokinase was loaded on to a 100-ml G-100 Sephadex superfine column equilibrated in glucokinase buffer. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were eluted from the column with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa. Native human β-cell glucokinase has a specific activity of about 80-120 units/mg, which is similar to that reported for the purified rat liver enzyme (14Andreone T. Printz R.L. Pilkis S.J. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 363-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various Ser-151 mutants were also purified to homogeneity by the above procedure.Enzyme Assay and Kinetic AnalysisModeling of Human β-Cell Glucokinase StructureA model of human β-cell glucokinase was generated by analogy to the known crystal structure of the related yeast hexokinase β (10Charles R.S.

(5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The model and crystal structures were examined using the program FRODO (35Jones A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) run on an Evans and Sutherland ESV 10 computer graphics workstation (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Determination of Circular Dichroism SpectraAll far UV spectra were collected on a Jasco 500 A in a 0.01-cm cell at 20°C. Scans were collected at 1 nm/min with a time constant of 64 s, and all data are the average of three blank corrected samples. Samples were dialyzed against 50 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove any precipitated protein, and the A280was measured to scale the CD data to the same concentration. The CD data presented corresponds to samples with an A280of 1.0 in a 1-cm cell.Determination of Intrinsic Fluorescence of β-Cell GlucokinaseExperiments were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol with a multi-frequency phase fluorometer (ISS Inc.). The excitation wavelengths were 280 nm in a 10 × 10-mm2size cuvette (6Xu L.Z. Zhang W. Weber I.T. Harrison R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27458-27465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lin S.X. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9670-9675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose was removed from glucokinase prior to the experiment by a dialysis overnight against a buffer containing 50 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol. The experiment was initiated by the addition of a final concentration of 1 or 100 mM hexose. The fluorescence spectra were recorded after addition of sugar and then analyzed with an IBM-PC microcomputer interfaced with the fluorometer to extract maximum fluorescence intensity of spectra at 312 nm. The relative fluorescence enhancement was obtained by dividing fluorescence enhancement by the initial intrinsic fluorescence.Assay of ATPase Activity of GlucokinaseReaction mixtures for following the ATPase activity of glucokinase contained 0-20 mM Mg-[γ-32P]ATP (3 × 105cpm/umol), 5 mM excess MgCl2, 50 mM Pipes, pH 7.0, and 20 μg of glucokinase in 200 μl. Inorganic phosphate release was performed by the method of Viola et al. (16Viola R.E. Raushel F.M. Rendina A.R. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as previously described (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J.

Glucokinase was purified 20-fold from extracts of E. coli by (NH4)2SO4precipitation (45-65%), Q-Sepharose chromatography, and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 superfine column as described under “Experimental Procedures” (20Menezes L.C. Pudles J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Q-Sepharose column is the most important step for removing contaminating bacterial hexokinase, which was eluted with the 150 mM KCl, potassium Pi, pH 8.0, wash. Wild-type glucokinase and all five Ser-151 and Arg-166 mutants were purified to homogeneity by the criteria of SDS-PAGE (data not shown).Circular Dichroism of the Mutants and Wild-type EnzymeTo ascertain whether the point site mutations caused large changes in secondary structure, the circular dichroism spectra of the mutants were compared with wild-type enzyme. There were no significant changes in the circular dichroism spectra of the Ser-151 mutants (Fig. 1), which indicates that there was no gross change in their secondary structure. There was also no change in the circular dichroism of the Asn-166 mutants (data not shown).Effect of Mutation of Ser-151 and Asn-166 on Glucokinase Phosphorylation of GlucoseTwo distinctive features of mammalian glucokinase are its high Kmfor glucose and cooperative behavior with respect to glucose (1Weinhouse S. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1976; 11: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Meglasson M.D. Matchinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab.

Physiol. 1982; 71: 549-555Google Scholar). The effect of various Ser-151 mutations is shown in Table I. Mutation of Ser-151 to cysteine decreased the Kmfor glucose to one-third, while kcatdecreased to about one-tenth the wild-type value. Mutation of Ser-151 to Ala decreased the Kmfor glucose by a factor of nearly 20, while kcatdecreased to one-tenth the wild-type value. The S151G mutant had a Kmabout 1/40th the wild-type value, while kcatdecreased by 2 orders of magnitude. The Kmvalues for ATP were increased about 5-fold for all Ser-151 mutants. The sigmoid behavior of glucokinase with regard to glucose was abolished for the S151A and S151G mutants.Table I:Effect of mutation of Ser-151 on β -cell glucokinase catalysis and affinity for glucose Open table in a new tab Mutation of Asn-166 to Arg lowered the Kmvalues for glucose and for ATP to one-third the wild-type enzyme value, while Vmax and the Hill coefficient were not affected. Therefore, the effect of mutating both Ser-151 and Asn-166 was tested. The double mutant, N166R/S151A, exhibited a Kmfor glucose about 60% lower than that for the S151A mutant, but the Vmax was also decreased by a factor of 3. Like the S151A mutant, the double mutant had a Hill coefficient of 1.0 and a higher Kmfor ATP.Effect of Mutation of Ser-151 and Asn-166 on Sugar Specificity of GlucokinaseThe sugar specificity of human β-cell glucokinase has been studied (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and fructose are substrates of the enzyme, and it was of interest to determine whether the Ser-151 mutants also had enhanced affinities for these substrates. As shown in Table II, for the S151C mutant, the Kmvalues for mannose and fructose were similar to that for the wild-type enzyme, but the kcatvalues relative to glucose were decreased. The S151A mutant exhibited decreased Kmvalues for mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and fructose by factors of about 20, 10, and 4, respectively, compared to the wild-type enzyme. The Vmax values decreased by factors of 20 for mannose and 2-deoxyglucose and by about 5-fold for fructose compared to wild-type enzyme. The Ser-151 mutants had similar catalytic efficiencies for glucose and mannose, except for S151C, which phosphorylated mannose less efficiently than glucose. S151A was similar to the wild-type enzyme in catalytic efficiency for fructose, but the Cys and Ala mutants were at least 1 order of magnitude less efficient at phosphorylating fructose compared to the wild-type enzyme.Table II:Effect of mutation of Ser-151 and Asn-166 on the sugar specificity of β -cell glucokinase Open table in a new tab N166R exhibited a 2-fold decrease in Kmfor mannose compared to the wild-type enzyme, resulting in nearly 2-fold greater catalytic efficiency. For fructose, this mutant showed an increase in Vmax and decreased Km, resulting in nearly 10-fold greater catalytic efficiency compared to the wild-type enzyme. The double mutant had greatly enhanced affinities for mannose and fructose.Effect of Ser-151 Mutations on Glucose-induced Changes in Intrinsic FluorescenceRat liver glucokinase exhibits a glucose-induced change in intrinsic fluorescence that has been postulated to reflect the presence of two different conformations of the enzyme (15Lin S.X.

Human β-cell glucokinase has been predicted to undergo a similar conformational change on the binding of glucose (5Xu L.Z. Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Gidh-Jain M. Pilkis S.J.

Science. 1979; 204: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For the wild-type enzyme, 100 mM glucose caused a 31.1% increase in intrinsic fluorescence, while 1 mM glucose had no significant effect. The S151C mutant exhibited a small but significant increase (4.2%) in intrinsic fluorescence at 1 mM glucose and the same change at 100 mM glucose as seen with the wild-type enzyme. However, the S151A mutant exhibited a 41.5% change in intrinsic fluorescence at 1 mM and a 54.8% increase at 100 mM glucose. The results show that in the case of the S151A mutant, the glucose dependence of changes in intrinsic fluorescence parallels the changes in hexose affinity. The N166R mutant exhibited a reduced glucose-induced change in intrinsic fluorescence (4% at 1 mM glucose and 10% at 100 mM glucose).Effect of Mutations on Inhibition of Glucokinase by N-Acetylglucosamine and Glu-6-PTable III shows that the Kivalues for the competitive inhibitor N-acetylglucosamine (5Xu L.Z.

The Kivalues for Glu-6-P of all Ser-151 mutants were also similar to that for the wild-type enzyme, with small decreases for S151C and S151A (Table III). The results demonstrate that mutation of Ser-151 has little effect on the enzyme's inhibition by Glu-6-P and N-acetylglucosamine. The N166R mutant and the double"

Proteins altered by mutation in site A (CelDD246A), B (CelDD261A), or C (CelDD523A) were compared with wild type CelD. The Ca2+-binding isotherm of wild type CelD was compatible with two high affinity sites (Ka= 2 × 106M−1) and one low affinity site (Ka< 105M−1). The Ca2+-binding isotherms of the mutated proteins showed that sites A and B were the two high affinity sites and that site C was the low affinity site.

This notion is supported by the unique example of the adenovirus E2 promoter, which contains two oppositely oriented E2F sites spaced 16 base pairs apart (1Kovesdi I. Reichel R. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1986; 45: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Kovesdi I. Reichel R. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both the spacing and orientation of these sites were found to be critical for proper control of this promoter by the product of the adenovirus E1A immediate early gene (28Hardy S. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4495-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). E1A dissociates E2F from other cellular proteins and allows it to bind the 19-kDa E4 gene product, which appears to stabilize cooperative binding of E2F molecules to the two sites in the E2 promoter (29Babiss L.E.

E2F binding to the E2 promoter was shown to be very unstable in the absence of E4 protein, and E4 did not stabilize E2F binding to a single E2F site (28Hardy S. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

We have investigated the role of a conserved overlapping inverted repeat E2F sequence motif found in the promoters of the mammalian DHFR genes (40Chen M.J. Shimada T. Moulton A.D. Cline A.

Azizkhan, unpublished data. of DHFR, and for adenovirus- and human cytomegalovirus-mediated activation of the gene (10Hiebert S.W. Blake M. Azizkhan J. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Wade M. Kowalik T.F.M.M. Huang E.-S. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In one of these previous reports, we suggested that the E2F sequence found near the major transcription start site of the three characterized mammalian DHFR genes, 5′-TTTCGCGCCAAA-3′, was a “full site” for optimal E2F binding and function, and that the sites found in the E2 promoter, 5′-TTTCGCGC-3′, represented a less stable site for binding of a dimeric transcription factor (10Hiebert S.W. Blake M. Azizkhan J. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A functional role for inverted repeat E2F elements is further supported by the presence of identical or similar sequence elements in a number of other genes (Fig. 1 C) and by two studies which show that inverted repeat E2F elements are selected from among populations of random oligonucleotides by Rb-binding proteins (46Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1073-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 47Ouellette M.M. Chen J. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1075-1081PubMed Google Scholar). This paper reports the effect of mutations in the DHFR inverted repeat E2F sequence element on the binding stability of cellular form(s) of E2F and defined homo- and heterodimers of cloned E2F proteins. Because this element consists of two overlapping, oppositely oriented high affinity E2F binding sequences, we were able to use site-specific mutagenesis to destroy the inverted repeat while leaving intact one or the other of the two E2F sites within the element. We demonstrate that all the forms of E2F dimers tested bind significantly more stably in vitro to the inverted repeat sequence than to “single” E2F sites that do not possess inverted symmetry. We also show that the rates of association are the same among the three sites. Finally, altering the inverted repeat results in a 2-5-fold decrease in transcription from the DHFR promoter, equivalent to the functional consequence of mutationally abolishing E2F binding (8Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that the inverted repeat overlapping E2F-binding sites in the DHFR and other promoters represents a novel means by which E2F binding and gene transcription are modulated. The wild-type and E2F double site mutant DHFR-CAT reporter plasmids have been described previously (44Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Construction of the E2F Site 1 and Site 2 mutants also has been described (10Hiebert S.W. Blake M. Azizkhan J. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Wade M. Kowalik T.F.M.M. Huang E.-S. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing wild type and single site mutant DHFR E2F site promoter fragments (restricted to remove the upstream Sp1 sites) and the synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the DHFR wild type E2F site also have been described previously (45Wade M. Kowalik T.F.M.M. Huang E.-S. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding E2F-1 amino acids 88-437 was cloned into the pBSK vector (Stratagene) by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the p121 primer previously described to produce the pBSK-E2F1-121 construct (16Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Cell. 1992; 70: 337-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding DP-1, pGC, was a kind gift of R. Girling and N. B. LaThangue (22Girling R. Partridge J.F. Bandara L.R. Burden N. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. La Thangue N.B. Nature. 1993; 362: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HeLa S-3 cells were grown in Joklik's modified minimal essential media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum in suspension at a concentration of 4-8 × 105cells/ml with daily 1:2 expansion of cells. Transcriptionally competent nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (8Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 48Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary and Balb/c3T3 cells were transfected with the appropriate DHFR-CAT reporter plasmids by the calcium phosphate method (49Graham F.L. Eb van der, A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and assayed for CAT activity as described previously (8Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 50Gorman C. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). CAT activity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of spots cut from thin layer chromatography plates. In Vitro Transcription and Translation-Run-off transcription of DHFR-CAT constructs and analysis of start sites by primer extension assay was performed as described previously (51Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Transcription products were quantitated by laser densitometry of autoradiographs. For production of mRNA encoding E2F-1 protein fragments, pBSK-E2F1-121 (described above) was digested to completion with either BamHI (for amino acids 88-437) or PvuI (amino acids 88-292), phenol-chloroform extracted twice, ethanol precipitated, resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and incubated with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) in standard transcription reactions essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA was phenol-chloroform extracted twice, precipitated, resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, and added directly to in vitro translation reaction mixtures. RNA was added to 40 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (40 units of RNasin, Promega) and amino acids (1 mM each), in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. Where indicated, the pBSK-E2F-121, pGC or a control luciferase-encoding plasmid were added directly to a coupled transcription/translation system (TNT, Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. To prepare 35S-labeled proteins for denaturing (sodium dodecyl sulfate) polyacrylamide gel analysis, translation or transcription-translation reactions were performed in the presence of methionine-minus amino acid mixtures, and[35S]methionine was added. For the analysis of E2F+DNA complexes formed in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract, gel mobility shift reaction were performed essentially as described previously (8Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For off-rate experiments, 40 μl of reaction mixtures were equilibrated on ice in the presence of 12 μg of nuclear extract. DHFR wild type or mutant promoter fragment probes were fill-in labeled by incubation with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [32P]dATP; 40,000 cpm (0.2-0.4 ng) was added to each reaction mixture, and binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. (Longer incubation times of up to 1 h had no effect on the intensity or mobility of E2F complexes.) The reaction mixtures were then mixed with 3 μl of loading dye (50% glycerol, 0.5 × Tris borate (TBE) buffer, 0.0001% xylene cyanol, 0.0001% bromphenol blue) and transferred to a 4°C cold room. A 6-μl aliquot was immediately removed and applied to a 4% native polyacrylamide gel that was already running at 100 V in a 4°C cold room (zero time point). Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (40 ng) was added to the remaining reaction mixture with thorough mixing by repeated pipetting, and aliquots were removed and loaded onto the running gel at the indicated time points. Addition of probe to each reaction mixture was timed so that each probe was incubated with nuclear extract for 20 min before competitor oligonucleotide was added. Gels were run at 250 V for 1.5-2 h after the loading dyes had migrated into the gel. For the E2F-1 and DP-1 gel shift experiments, programmed rabbit reticulocyte lysates were added to reactions instead of nuclear extract, and the reactions were done in the presence of 1.5% Nonidet P-40 and 3 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. A labeled E2F site oligonucleotide probe (see above) was used as the probe in the cotranslation experiments depicted in Fig. 3. For the off-rate experiments, the amount of labeled wild type or single site mutant promoter fragment probe DNA was increased to 80,000 cpm (0.2-0.4 ng), and the amount of competitor oligonucleotide to 80 ng. For the E2F-1 experiments, five μl of programmed lysate (TNT, Promega) was added to the reaction mixture; for the E2F-1/DP-1 experiments, 1 μl of lysate was added and the amount of cold competitor oligonucleotide increased to 400 ng. Native polyacrylamide gels (6% for E2F-1 and 4% for E2F-1/DP-1) were run at 250-400 V for 4 h for E2F-1 and 2 h for E2F-1/DP-1. Otherwise, the off-rate experiments were performed exactly as described above. The association rate for E2F-1/DP-1 heterodimers was measured in three separate experiments. Probes consisted of end-labeled DNA fragments (1.5 nmol DNA, 108cpm/μg) containing the inverted repeat E2F site or each of the single E2F sites as used in the off-rate experiments; all probes had the same specific activity. Reactions (80 μl) were initiated with each of the three probes by the addition of 2 μl of reticulocyte lysate programmed with E2F-1 and DP-1 in vitro transcribed mRNA, and aliquots were removed and applied to running gels at 30-s intervals for 3 min. Computer densitometry analysis of video-captured autoradiographs was performed using the Image program (NIMH Research Services Branch). The half-life of E2F-1-DP-1 complex and the rates of association were determined by direct quantitation of radioactivity in bands on dried gels using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. The 12-nucleotide inverted repeat E2F sequence near the major transcription start site is 100% conserved among the DHFR promoters in mouse, hamster (shaded boxes, Fig. 1 A), and human (40Chen M.J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Additionally, inspection of E2F sequences in a number of other gene promoters, including the E1A promoters of at least eight serotypes of adenovirus and seven different cellular promoters, including both the human and mouse E2F-1 promoters (12, for review; 52, 53), reveals inverted repeat-like sequences (Fig. 1 C). Finally, in two studies several E2F sites selected from among random oligonucleotide populations by proteins associated with Rb have inverted repeat character (Fig. 1 C; 46, 47). Therefore, we set out to determine whether the DHFR inverted repeat sequence conferred any changes in E2F binding relative to binding to sequences that contained only a single site. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created mutations in the DHFR E2F site that allowed us to abolish either the 5′ site or the 3′ site separately; each of the these mutations preserved only a single site. The sites that remain (5′-GCGCCAAA-3′ in the Site 1 mutant and 5′-TTTCGCGC-3′ in the Site 2 mutant) each represent single consensus E2F sites. An additional mutation at the center of the inverted repeat (the double site mutant) abolished both E2F sequences (Fig. 1 B); this double site mutation completely eliminates E2F binding activity (8Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). E2F binding to the single site mutant probes produced gel mobility shift complexes indistinguishable in mobility from those produced by binding to the wild type inverted repeat element (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 6, and 10). Extensive investigation of the adenovirus E2 promoter, which consists of two oppositely oriented E2F sites, had established that extracts from adenovirus-infected cells gave a slower mobility gel shift complex characteristic of simultaneous binding of E2F molecules to two separate sites (29Babiss L.E.

However, titration experiments showed that E2F complexes with identical gel mobility formed with the wild type and single site mutant DHFR E2F sites even at high protein concentration (data not shown). Having demonstrated that the inverted repeat sequence apparently did not serve as two independent sites, we undertook a series of experiments to determine whether it enhanced the stability of E2F binding relative to binding to a single E2F site. E2F in HeLa cell extracts was allowed to bind to radiolabeled promoter fragment probes containing the wild type, Site 1 mutant or Site 2 mutant E2F sites (Fig. 1 B). The binding reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium (15-30 min at room temperature), and an excess of a competitor oligonucleotide consisting of the wild type DHFR E2F site was added to the reaction mixture. Aliquots of the mixture were then applied to a gel that was already running at time points after addition of the competitor oligonucleotide. Initial results confirmed earlier studies of the E2 promoter (28Hardy S. Shenk"

We report the isolation of super-repressor mutants of PutA that decrease expression from the putA promoter in the presence or absence of proline.

The observation that these mutations simultaneously affect induction by proline and proline dehydrogenase activity suggests that a single proline-binding site is involved in both proline dehydrogenase activity and induction of the expression of the put operon.

Furthermore, the results indicate that the proline dehydrogenase activity of PutA is essential for induction of the put operon by proline. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium can use proline as a sole carbon and nitrogen source. In these bacteria, proline utilization requires the presence of two gene products. The putP gene encodes a membrane protein that is the major proline permease. The putA gene encodes a bifunctional dehydrogenase with both proline dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.8) and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C)11 dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12) activities that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to glutamate (1, 2). The proline dehydrogenase reaction couples proline oxidation with the reduction of an FAD cofactor tightly associated with the PutA protein (2, 3). The electrons are transferred to the electron transport chain in the cytoplasmic membrane in vivo (4) or can be transferred to an artificial electron acceptor (p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT)) in vitro. The reduction of INT can be used to monitor proline dehydrogenase activity. P5C dehydrogenase activity couples P5C oxidation with the reduction of NAD. Most previously isolated putA mutants lack both enzymatic activities (5). In addition to its catalytic functions, PutA is a transcriptional regulator that represses the expression of both put genes in the absence of proline. PutA has been shown to bind specifically to operator sites in the put regulatory region (2, 6). Although proline induces the expression of the put operon in vivo, incubation of PutA with proline does not prevent the formation of a PutA-DNA complex in vitro (2, 7) unless an electron acceptor is also available (7), suggesting that prevention of the formation of a PutA-DNA complex depends on redox events that follow the binding of proline by PutA. The following model has been proposed to explain how PutA autoregulates its own expression. In the absence of proline, PutA remains in the cytoplasm, where it binds to the put operators, preventing put gene expression. When a sufficient concentration of proline is available, PutA binds proline and functionally associates with the electron transport chain in the cytoplasmic membrane, where it is enzymatically active (8). The resulting decrease in cytoplasmic PutA levels releases the repression of the operators, allowing expression of the put genes (5, 9). We report the isolation of mutants of PutA with a super-repressor phenotype. The purified mutant PutA proteins were defective in proline dehydrogenase activity, but were not altered in P5C dehydrogenase activity or DNA binding affinity. Analysis of the mutants indicated that prevention of the formation of a PutA-DNA complex requires proline dehydrogenase activity. The strains used are listed in. P22 phage lysates and transductional crosses were performed as described (15). Strains with partial duplications of the chromosome were constructed following a modification of a previously described method (16). To construct strain MST3324, a P22 lysate from strain TT1788 was used to transduce strain MST179, selecting KmRTcRcolonies. The resulting strain, MST3028 (see Fig. 1A), was then transduced with a P22 lysate from strain TT1794, selecting PSN+KmRcolonies. One of the resulting TcRcolonies was chosen for further studies. Chromosomal duplications are unstable in the absence of selection, so the structure of the duplication in strain MST3324 was confirmed by segregation of the two copies of the putA gene after growth in the absence of tetracycline (the selection for the Tn 10 element at the duplication join point). Cells were grown on rich medium in the absence of selection and plated onto the same medium. The colonies were then replica-plated onto rich medium supplemented with the corresponding antibiotics plus the indicator X-Gal and to PSN (proline as sole nitrogen source) medium. Homologous recombination resulted in two types of TcSsegregants retaining either copy I (PSN-KmRX-Gal-blue) or copy II (PSN+KmSX-Gal-white). Difco nutrient broth (0.8%) containing NaCl at a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) was used as rich medium. The minimal medium used was E medium (17) supplemented with 0.6% succinate. When specified, 0.2% proline was added to E minimal medium. The nitrogen-free medium used to score growth on proline as sole nitrogen source was NCN medium (18) supplemented with 0.6% succinate, 0.2% proline, and 1 mM MgCl2. PSN plates also contained the indicator tetrazolium red (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) at a concentration of 0.0025% (w/v). Solid medium contained 1.5% Difco Bacto-agar (rich or E minimal medium) or Difco Noble agar (PSN medium). Except where indicated, the final concentrations of antibiotics in rich medium were as follows: tetracycline, 20 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 20 μg/ml; and ampicillin, 30 μg/ml. Concentrations in minimal medium were as follows: tetracycline, 10 μg/ml; kanamycin, 125 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 5 μg/ml; and ampicillin, 15 μg/ml. Other supplements used were X-Gal (20 μg/ml) and sucrose (50 mg/ml). Cells were grown at 37°C. A concentrated P22 lysate (2 × 1012plaque-forming units/ml) grown on strain MST1697 was mutagenized in vitro with hydroxylamine (15) to 0.1% survival. Mutagenized phage were centrifuged and resuspended, and then ∼109plaque-forming units were used to transduce 100 ml of an overnight culture of strain MST3324. Cells were concentrated and plated onto rich medium supplemented with tetracycline (15 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol, and the colonies obtained were replica-plated onto different media after 3 days of growth at 37°C. The plasmids used are listed in. Plasmid pPC34 is an ApRexpression vector in which the putA gene is fused to the Ptacpromoter (19). pPC34 also contains the lacI gene; thus, the expression of putA can be induced by IPTG. To construct pPC101, plasmid pPC34 was partially digested with SalI to remove the 1932-base pair SalI fragment internal to the putA gene. This fragment was replaced with a SalI fragment of ∼4 kilobase pairs from pRL250 containing the sacB gene from Bacillus subtilis and a KmRgene (npt) (14). In plasmid pPC101a, the transcription of the sacB gene is in the opposite orientation to that of the bla gene in the vector. The strategy followed to select for in vivo recombination of mutant putASalleles into pPC101 is described in Fig. 2. This strategy was based on two observations: (i) plasmids derived from pBR322 do not replicate in polA mutants (21), and (ii) cells containing the sacB gene from B. subtilis do not grow in the presence of sucrose (22). Sequencing of both strands in double-stranded plasmids was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method (31) using a Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA isolation, restriction, and ligation followed standard procedures (23). Plasmid construction was done in E. coli DH5α. Plasmids that were to be introduced into S. typhimurium r+m+strains were first propagated in MS1882 (r-m+). The purification of the wild-type and mutant PutA proteins was carried out by a modification of the method previously described (7). A 1-liter culture of strain MST2614 carrying the expression plasmid (pPC34, pPC102, pPC103, or pPC104) was grown to early exponential phase in plasmid broth (15) containing ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. The expression of the putA gene in the plasmid was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1 mM and incubation of the culture for 1 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 1 volume of 0.85% NaCl, resuspended in 35 ml of G buffer (70 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 20% (v/v) glycerol), and ruptured in a French pressure cell. The membranes were removed by centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting crude extract was subjected to precipitation with (NH4)2SO4at a final concentration of 40%. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of G buffer and dialyzed against the same buffer. The samples were brought to 100 mM KCl, and several 0.5-ml aliquots were subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After a 16.5-ml wash with G buffer containing 100 mM KCl, elution of the proteins was carried out in G buffer using a linear gradient of KCl (100-185 mM) followed by isocratic elution at 185 mM KCl in G buffer. The PutA protein eluted from the column during the isocratic step. Elution of the peak corresponding to PutA was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm and confirmed by proline dehydrogenase assays. For the mutants (PutA1223 and PutA1224) deficient in proline dehydrogenase activity, the identity of the peak was also confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This modified purification scheme renders pure PutA protein (as judged by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels) without the gel filtration step previously used (7). Fractions containing PutA were pooled, precipitated with (NH4)2SO4at a final concentration of 50%, resuspended in G buffer, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The final purified samples (∼2 ml) contained between 1.6 and 4 mg of PutA protein/ml. Purified samples were stored frozen at −80°C until use. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (24). Electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was carried out as described (15) using discontinuous gels with a 4% stacking gel and a 7% separating gel. Proteins on SDS or native gels were stained with FastStain (Zoion Research Inc., Allston, MA). Assays contained 2-20 pmol of PutA protein in G buffer. (The final concentrations of G buffer were 0.5× in the experiment described for Fig. 5, 0.13× in the experiments described for Fig. 6 and 7, and 0.11× in the experiment described for Fig. 8.) 50 ng of the DNA fragment corresponding to the 420-base pair put control region (∼0.2 pmol) were present in the assays. This fragment was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using plasmid pPC6 (12) as a template as described (23). The fragment was used in gel retardation assays without further purification. The 1 × binding buffer contained 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 60 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The nonspecific competitor DNA used in the assays was an HaeIII digest of phage φX174 (500 ng/assay). Where indicated, PutA was preincubated for 2 min in the presence of proline and INT (see concentrations and volumes in the legends of Fig. 6−8) before mixing with the DNA and binding buffer. The protein and DNA mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 15 min before adding loading solution (1 × loading solution = 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and loading in a gel constantly running at 300 V (the gel was previously prerun at 200 V for 2 h). The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 7% polyacrylamide gel with a 30:0.8 acrylamide/ N, N-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4°C in 1 × TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, 89 mM borate, 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 9.5) at 200 V. The bands on the gel were then visualized with ethidium bromide (10 μg/ml in 1 × TBE buffer), a proline dehydrogenase activity stain (see below), and/or a protein stain in that order. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described (15) using CHCl3/SDS to permeabilize whole cells. Proline dehydrogenase activity was assayed by following the proline-dependent reduction of the electron acceptor INT as described previously (1) using crude extracts or purified protein. Crude extracts used for proline dehydrogenase assays were prepared from cells grown in E minimal medium supplemented with succinate and proline. After washing with 1 volume of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.8, cells were ruptured in a French pressure cell, and the extract was centrifuged at 5000 rpm to remove intact cells. The supernatant was used as crude extract. To calculate the Km(Pro)and Vmaxvalues of the proline dehydrogenase reaction, the proline concentration in the assays was varied from 22 to 454 mM (wild-type PutA), from 45 to 909 mM (PutA1222), or from 2.3 to 181 mM (PutA1223). Initial rates were measured in all the assays performed to determine the kinetic parameters of the proline dehydrogenase reaction, with substrate depletion kept to <5% of the initial concentration. The proline dehydrogenase bands on native gels were identified by an activity stain. The gel was immersed in the same reaction buffer used for purified samples and gently agitated for 5-10 min (7). DL-P5C was prepared by hydrolysis of DL-P5C dinitrophenylhydrazone (Sigma) as described (25). The concentration of P5C was determined using o-aminobenzaldehyde as described (26). Due to its instability at neutral pH, P5C was stored at a concentration of ∼100 mM in 1 M HCl and vacuum-dried just before use in enzymatic assays. P5C dehydrogenase activity was assayed by following the P5C-dependent, NAD-dependent reduction of INT as described (1) using purified protein. All proline dehydrogenase and P5C dehydrogenase assays were corrected for a no-enzyme blank. When using crude extracts, proline dehydrogenase assays were also corrected for a no-proline blank. To isolate super-repressor mutants of the PutA protein, a strain was constructed with a partial chromosomal duplication containing two reporter genes for the regulation of the transcription from the putA promoter: (i) the putA gene itself and (ii) a putA::MudJ fusion that places the expression of lacZ under the control of the putA promoter (Fig. 1 A). Both copies contain wild-type putP genes. The duplication strain used, MST3324, is able to grow on PSN medium because it contains a wild-type putA allele and exhibits a blue phenotype in rich medium supplemented with the indicator X-Gal because the putA::MudJ fusion allows expression of the lacZ gene from the putA promoter. A hydroxylamine-treated P22 lysate grown on strain MST1697 was used to locally mutagenize copy II of the put operon in strain MST3324 (Fig. 1 B). The resulting TcRCmRrecombinants were replica-plated onto PSN medium (to test for ability to grow on proline as sole nitrogen source as an indicator of the expression of the putA gene in copy II) and rich medium supplemented with X-Gal (to monitor the expression of β-galactosidase as an indicator of the expression of the putA:: lacZ fusion in copy I). Colonies were also replica-plated onto two control plates: E minimal medium supplemented with succinate + proline (to detect mutants in which the PSN-phenotype was due to auxotrophic mutations) and rich medium with kanamycin (to detect colonies in which the X-Gal-white phenotype was due to excision of the MudJ element by recombination between the mutagenized phage and copy II). In the most common class of putA mutants, which inactivate the PutA protein, the expression of β-galactosidase is increased because the mutant PutA protein is unable to repress the expression of the putA::MudJ fusion. These putA mutants exhibit a PSN-X-Gal-dark blue phenotype. In contrast, super-repressor mutants were expected to show reduced expression from both putA promoters (i.e. low levels of β-galactosidase and proline dehydrogenase activities), resulting in a PSN-X-Gal-white phenotype. About 8000 TcRCmRcolonies were screened, yielding several colonies with the expected phenotype for super-repressor mutants (PSN-X-Gal-white). Three of these putASmutants were characterized in detail: putA1222, putA1223, and putA1224. putA1225, a null putA-allele used as a control in further studies, was also isolated in the same screening as a PSN-X-Gal-dark blue colony. shows the β-galactosidase and proline dehydrogenase activities of the corresponding strains. In duplication strains with a null putA allele, the putA:: lacZ fusion was fully derepressed regardless of the presence or absence of proline. In duplication strains with a wild-type or putASallele, the putA:: lacZ fusion was repressed to different extents. Proline derepressed the putA:: lacZ fusion in duplications with the wild-type putA gene or, to a lesser extent, in duplications with the putA1222 allele. In contrast, the putA:: lacZ fusion was fully repressed in duplications with the putA1223 or putA1224 allele regardless of the presence or absence of proline. Proline dehydrogenase activity in crude extracts was reduced in all three putASmutants, although it was more dramatically reduced in mutants putA1223 and putA1224. Thus, based on the level of repression and induction of the putA promoter by proline, these results indicate that at least two different classes of super-repressor mutants were isolated. The super-repressor phenotype of mutant putA1222 seems to be weaker than that of putA1223 or putA1224. To test whether the putASmutations were dominant over the wild-type putA allele, duplication strains containing each of the three putASalleles on one copy and wild-type putA+on the other copy were constructed. In all cases, the resulting diploids were unable to grow on proline as sole nitrogen source, indicating that the super-repressor mutations are dominant over putA+in trans, resulting in a very low level of expression of the wild-type protein. The presence of both the wild-type and mutant putASgenes in these duplications was confirmed by transduction with a lysate from strain MST179 (putA::MudJ) followed by selection of KmRcolonies. Recombination of the donor DNA fragment resulted in PSN-X-Gal-white colonies (yielding a putA::MudJ/ putASduplication) or PSN+X-Gal-blue colonies (yielding a putA/ putA::MudJ duplication) depending on whether the recombination event removed the wild-type or mutant putASallele, respectively. The results of the dominance tests also confirmed that, in all three cases, the putASmutations were responsible for the reduced expression of the putA:: lacZ fusion, excluding the possibility that this phenotype was due to a second, spontaneous mutation affecting the expression of the fusion. Because the putA gene is autoregulated, the expression of the PutA protein is severely reduced in strains with a putASmutation (), making it difficult to accurately measure the enzymatic activities. In addition, the putASmutations also severely reduce the expression of the proline transporter encoded by the putP gene. The decreased level of proline transported into these cells would prevent induction of the putA gene by intracellular proline. Therefore, to overexpress and to purify the mutant proteins, we cloned the mutant putASalleles in an expression vector by an in vivo recombination strategy (Fig. 2). In the resulting plasmids, pPC102, pPC103, and pPC104, the expression of the mutant proteins is no longer autoregulated, but is instead driven by the Ptacpromoter. To confirm that the putASmutations had been recombined into the expression vector, plasmids pPC102, pPC103, and pPC104 were tested for their ability to regulate the expression of a putA:: lacZ fusion (I). In all three cases, the presence of a putASallele in the plasmid resulted in the reduced expression of the putA:: lacZ fusion compared with the level of expression in the presence of the putA+allele. Cells containing the putASplasmids and a putA::Tn 10 mutation on the chromosome were also tested for their ability to grow on proline as sole nitrogen source. None of the plasmids containing putASalleles were able to confer a PSN+phenotype, confirming that the super-repressor mutations had recombined into these plasmids. DNA sequencing of the mutant putASalleles indicated that each of the three mutants contains a single base substitution that changes the amino acid sequence. Gly-288 is changed to Asn in PutA1222, Asp-285 is changed to Asn in PutA1223, and Arg-556 is changed to His in PutA1224. PutA1223 also contains a second mutation at codon 761 (TTC to TTT) that does not affect the amino acid sequence of the corresponding PutA protein. The wild-type and mutant PutA proteins were purified after overexpression from plasmids pPC34, pPC102, pPC103, and pPC104, respectively. The purification protocol was identical in all four cases since none of the mutations affected the relevant physical properties of the mutant proteins with respect to the wild-type protein. After induction of cells containing pPC34 or any of the plasmids bearing putASalleles with IPTG, a band corresponding to PutA (predicted molecular mass of 144 kDa) was evident. Fig. 3 shows the induction and purification steps for the wild-type protein and the final purified samples of wild-type and mutant PutA proteins. The PutA protein can either associate with the cytoplasmic membrane, where it is enzymatically active, or bind to the put regulatory region, where it represses the expression of both put genes (5). Thus, super-repressor mutants could result from mutations that either increase the affinity of PutA for DNA or decrease its enzymatic activity. Therefore, we analyzed the DNA binding and enzymatic properties of the purified mutant PutA proteins compared with the wild-type protein. shows the proline dehydrogenase and P5C dehydrogenase activities of the purified proteins. Proline dehydrogenase activity (the first of the two enzymatic steps carried out by PutA) was decreased to a different extent in all three PutASproteins. In the case of PutA1222 (a weak super-repressor), the activity observed was ∼40% of the wild-type level, whereas in mutants PutA1223 and PutA1224 (the two strong super-repressors), the activity was reduced to 6 and 0.25% of the wild-type level, respectively. Thus, there is a direct correlation between the strength of super-repression (Tables II and III) and the level of proline dehydrogenase activity (). In contrast to proline dehydrogenase activity, P5C dehydrogenase activity (the second enzymatic step carried out by PutA) was not decreased in any of the PutASmutants (). The calculated Km(P5O)was ∼8 mM for the wild-type and the three mutant proteins. To determine if the decreased proline dehydrogenase activity in the mutant PutASproteins was due to decreased affinity for proline or a decreased rate of catalysis, the kinetic parameters of proline dehydrogenase activity were determined (Fig. 4). The Km(Pro)and Vmaxvalues of the proline dehydrogenase reaction were calculated using Lineweaver-Burk inverse plots for wild-type PutA (Km(Pro)= 43 mM; Vmax= 6900 nmol of INT reduced min-1mg of protein-1), PutA1222 (Km(Pro)= 285 mM; Vmax= 6670 nmol of INT reduced min-1mg of protein-1), and PutA1223 (Km(Pro)= 7 mM; Vmax= 434 nmol of INT reduced min-1mg of protein-1). Finally, the activity observed in PutA1224 was extremely low at all the substrate concentrations tested, preventing the accurate calculation of Km(Pro)and Vmaxfor this mutant. The values calculated for the wild-type protein are in good agreement with those previously reported for purified PutA from S. typhimurium (Km(Pro)= 83 mM; Vmax= 5000 nmol of INT reduced min-1mg of protein-1) (3), although in Ref. 3, PutA was purified by a different protocol. Kinetic analysis of the mutant proteins indicates that PutA1222 is defective in the recognition of proline (Km(Pro)), but not in the rate of conversion of proline to P5C, whereas PutA1223 is defective in the conversion of proline to P5C, but not in the recognition of proline. Furthermore, like wild-type PutA (3), PutA1223 was inhibited by high concentrations of substrate (Fig. 4 B), also indicating that this mutant protein is not altered in the recognition of proline. To determine whether any of the super-repressor proteins exhibited enhanced DNA binding affinity, a series of gel retardation assays were carried out using a DNA fragment corresponding to the put control region (6) and variable amounts of the purified wild-type or mutant protein. As a control for nonspecific binding, all the assays contained an excess of DNA fragments that were not bound by PutA. None of the mutant proteins was significantly enhanced in its affinity for DNA in vitro (Fig. 5). Thus, the super-repressor phenotype observed in vivo was not the result of increased DNA affinity. Although the super-repressor mutations did not directly increase DNA binding, they could indirectly affect DNA binding by preventing induction by proline. The formation of a PutA-DNA complex can be prevented in vitro by preincubating PutA with proline and INT prior to the DNA addition (7). Although neither proline nor INT alone affects DNA binding, when added together, proline and INT alter the conformation of the PutA protein so that it assumes a low mobility form that no longer enters native polyacrylamide gels (7). These observations suggest that the conformational change caused by proline and INT prevents DNA binding. Therefore, gel retardation assays in the presence of proline and INT were carried out to determine whether the PutASproteins, which showed reduced induction by proline in vivo, responded to the presence of proline in vitro. The results indicate that proline alone has no effect on DNA binding by the wild-type and mutant PutA proteins (Fig. 6). In contrast, when the proteins were preincubated with proline and INT, several differences between the wild-type and mutant PutA proteins were evident. At the concentrations of proline used, there was no difference in the observed DNA binding by wild-type PutA (Fig. 6, lanes 1-4) and the weak super-repressor, PutA1222 (lanes 5-8). In both cases, the formation of a PutA-DNA complex was prevented by preincubation of PutA with proline and INT, and in both cases, PutA assumed a low mobility form that did not enter the gel. In contrast, preincubation of PutA1223 and PutA1224 with proline and INT did not prevent the formation of a PutA-DNA complex. However, PutA1223 and PutA1224 were different with respect to the conformational changes induced by proline: whereas PutA1223 assumed a low mobility form (Fig. 6 C, lanes 10 and 12), PutA1224 did not (lanes 14 and 16). Since these results indicate that proline dehydrogenase activity is required to prevent DNA binding, we tested the possibility that a diffusible product of the reaction might be responsible for this effect. Combinations of the wild-type and mutant PutA proteins were preincubated with proline and INT before DNA binding assays were performed (Fig. 7). As expected, DNA binding by PutA1223 and PutA1224 was not prevented by the addition of proline and INT (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 4). However, in samples that contained wild-type PutA in addition to PutA1223 or PutA1224, the binding of DNA was prevented, and both the wild-type and mutant proteins assumed a low mobility form (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 5) that did not enter the gel (Fig. 7 B). Thus, when the proteins were mixed before binding to DNA, the mixture of wild-type and mutant proteins behaved as the wild-type protein, i.e. the presence of the wild-type protein abolished the mutant phenotype of PutA1223 and PutA1224 in vitro. However, if the proteins were mixed after they were bound to DNA, wild-type PutA did not release PutA1223 or PutA1224 from the DNA (data not shown). There are two potential explanations for the dominance of the wild-type protein in vitro: (i) the product of the wild-type reaction (P5C in equilibrium with γ-glutamyl semialdehyde) could be the actual effector that prevents DNA binding (not proline or INT), or (ii) the wild-type and mutant proteins could form heterodimers that no longer bind DNA in the presence of proline and INT. Considering the observation that there is no effect on DNA binding by the mutant proteins when the wild-type and mutant proteins are mixed after binding to DNA, the second possibility seems more likely. To directly test whether a diffusible intermediate such as P5C was the actual effector that prevented DNA binding, proline and INT were preincubated with wild-type PutA, and the protein was then removed by filtration. A control sample without PutA was also prepared in parallel. In the sample preincubated with wild-type PutA, the amount of enzyme used would exhaust all the oxidized INT present. Both the treated and untreated filtrates were added to gel retardation assays with wild-type PutA (Fig. 8). The control filtrate not preincubated with wild-type PutA (containing proline and INT) prevented DNA binding as efficiently as when PutA was directly preincubated with proline and INT (Fig. 8, − lane). However, the filtrate preincubated with wild-type PutA (containing P5C, the product of the proline dehydrogenase reaction, and an excess of proline, but no oxidized INT) did not prevent DNA binding by PutA (Fig. 8, + lane). These data suggest that the redox changes induced in PutA upon the binding of proline in the presence of INT (not a diffusible intermediate such as P5C) prevent DNA binding. The PutA protein is unusual because it functions both as a membrane-associated enzyme and as a DNA-binding protein that represses its own synthesis. Previous genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the choice between its enzymatic or regulatory role is determined by its cellular distribution: when bound to the membrane, the PutA protein functions as an enzyme, but when it accumulates in the cytoplasm, the PutA protein functions as a DNA-binding protein (5). Ultimately, this distribution is determined by the availability of proline, which is both the inducer of the put operon and the substrate for the enzymatic activity of the PutA protein. But how does proline mediate these two opposing roles of the PutA protein? One approach to answer this question is to isolate mutants that affect the regulation of the put operon. A large number of loss-of-function mutants have been previously isolated in the putA gene. Most of the characterized mutants are due to null mutations that eliminate all three activities of PutA: proline dehydrogenase, P5C dehydrogenase, and DNA binding (5). Such mutants indicate that the PutA protein is required for transcriptional regulation, but do not indicate the mechanism of regulation. To identify the functions of PutA involved in the regulation of the put operon, we isolated mutants with a super-repressor phenotype. The scheme we used to isolate such rare mutations had four important features. (i) The mutants were required to retain the ability to bind DNA, precluding the isolation of null mutants, which are much more frequent. (ii) A chromosomal duplication was used, so the ratio of the gene for the regulator (one copy of putA) to the reporter gene (one copy of putA::MudJ) was equivalent (in contrast to plasmid-based schemes, in which one of the genes is present in excess), eliminating the isolation of mutants that affect the copy number of one gene or titrate a gene product. (iii) Two copies of the putP gene were included to reduce the probability of isolating mutants defective in the transport of the inducer proline. (iv) Localized mutagenesis with P22 transducing particles treated with hydroxylamine in vitro allowed the isolation of rare mutants while avoiding the isolation of nonspecific mutants that map outside of the put region. This approach allowed us to identify several super-repressor mutants with decreased expression from the putA promoter relative to the wild type. One of the super-repressor mutants (PutA1224) has a single amino acid substitution in the predicted proline dehydrogenase domain (27). The amino acid substitutions in the other two super-repressor mutants are located in another region of PutA. In each of these mutants, the strength of repression correlates with defects in the proline dehydrogenase activity of the PutA protein, but the P5C dehydrogenase activity and DNA binding affinity are not altered. The observation that induction by proline and proline dehydrogenase activity are simultaneously altered in all three mutants suggests that proline binds to a single site on the protein and that proline binding at the active site is responsible for both enzymatic activity and induction. It has been previously shown that reduction by proline induces a conformational change in PutA (28). However, reduction by proline does not prevent binding to the put control region (7, 28). Analysis of the mutants isolated here indicates that proline dehydrogenase activity itself mediates regulation by proline. PutA1222, which is defective in the recognition of proline, is a slightly better repressor than the wild-type protein. Although this mutant requires higher concentrations of proline to achieve wild-type proline dehydrogenase activity, the rate of enzymatic conversion of proline to glutamate is not altered. PutA1223 and PutA1224 are much stronger repressors than the wild-type protein. These two mutants are severely defective in the proline dehydrogenase reaction. The super-repressor phenotype observed in vivo for the mutants isolated correlates with their DNA binding properties in vitro. The addition of proline plus INT to the wild-type PutA protein prevented the formation of a PutA-DNA complex and caused the wild-type PutA protein to assume a low mobility form that did not enter the gel (Fig. 6) (7). Under identical conditions, PutA1223 and PutA1224 showed an altered response to proline in DNA binding assays. In the case of PutA1224, which is defective in both proline recognition and proline dehydrogenase activity, the addition of proline plus INT neither induced the formation of a low mobility form nor prevented DNA binding (Fig. 6, lanes 14 and 16). In contrast, with PutA1223, which recognizes proline but is defective in proline dehydrogenase activity, the addition of proline plus INT induced the formation of a low mobility form, but did not prevent DNA binding. This result indicates that the two effects of proline plus INT on the PutA protein (producing a low mobility form of PutA and preventing DNA binding) are separate events: binding of proline in the presence of INT induces a conformational change in PutA that results in a low mobility form, but prevention of DNA binding requires the proline dehydrogenase activity of PutA. Previous studies have shown that a stable association of PutA with bacterial membranes in vitro requires proline dehydrogenase activity, i.e. simply reducing PutA by proline is not sufficient to promote stable PutA-membrane association (29). Furthermore, full induction of the put genes in vivo requires both proline and a terminal electron acceptor (30), suggesting that a functional coupling of the proline dehydrogenase activity of PutA with the electron transport chain in the membrane is required for induction of the put operon. The results presented here provide direct genetic evidence that proline dehydrogenase activity is required for induction of the put operon in vivo and prevention of DNA binding in vitro. A trivial reason why proline dehydrogenase activity is required for induction by proline might be because a product of the reaction, not proline itself, is the actual inducer. However, three lines of evidence indicate that this is not the case. (i) The super-repressor mutations are dominant to the wild-type gene in vivo. (ii) The product of proline dehydrogenase activity did not prevent DNA binding by wild-type PutA in vitro (Fig. 8). (iii) The addition of P5C to DNA binding assays did not prevent the formation of a PutA-DNA complex in vitro (data not shown). In summary, these results indicate that the redox events associated with the proline dehydrogenase activity of PutA are required for induction of the put operon by proline. Full induction of putA expression requires that the PutA protein synthesized is enzymatically active, thus avoiding wasteful synthesis of PutA if either membrane sites or proline (which are both required for enzymatic activity) is not available. Autoregulation of the putA gene may play an important physiological role because, like many membrane-associated proteins, overproduction of the PutA protein is lethal. Hence, by turning off its own synthesis when membrane sites are saturated, the PutA protein may avoid lethal overexpression. Some preliminary evidence suggests that certain other membrane-associated enzymes may also be regulated by a similar mechanism.

The functional effects of each mutation in reconstitution assays are largely confined to the domain in which it occurs, where the unmutated site is unable to compensate for the defect.

When all four sites are intact, free Mg2+ causes a 50-60-fold increase in TnC's affinity for the other components of the regulatory complex, allowing it to attach firmly to thin filaments. Calcium can replace Mg2+ at a concentration ratio of 1:5000, and at this ratio the Ca2·TnC complex is more tightly bound to the filaments than the Mg2·TnC form.

CF1is composed of five different subunits designated α to ε in order of decreasing molecular weight and with a subunit stoichiometry of 3α, 3β, 1γ, 1δ, and 1ε (1McCarty R.E. Moroney J.V. Martonosi A. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 383-413Crossref Google Scholar). CF1is a latent ATPase, requiring activation either by removing the ε subunit and/or reducing the only disulfide bond of the enzyme located on the γ subunit (2Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E.

Freshly isolated CF1has up to two molecules of ADP bound with sufficient strength to resist removal during successive passage through several gel filtration columns (10Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J.

The remaining two sites do not retain nucleotides during gel filtration and are thus assumed to be of lower affinity. Tightly bound ADP can be released from the enzyme upon binding of MgATP at another site, probably one of the lower affinity sites (10Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) catalytic sites switch properties with each other with respect to their affinity for nucleotides. The apparent asymmetry among the nucleotide binding sites on CF1is considered to result from asymmetric interactions between the three α and three β subunits and the smaller single copy subunits, γ, δ, andε. Since the asymmetry remains intact following removal of the two smallest subunits, δ and ε, the γ subunit is sufficient to provide the necessary asymmetric interaction(s). However, some recent studies of the reconstituted α and β subunits of the F1of the thermophylic bacterium PS3 (14Miwa K. Yoshida M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The F1complexes of several bacteria have been successfully disassembled in vitro and reassembled from their individual subunits (17Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In vitro assembly of an F1enzyme from a eukaryotic source, however, has not yet been reported in spite of intensive efforts in many laboratories. This goal remains a very important one for effectively studying subunit interactions for these enzymes, especially since the eukaryotic enzymes exhibit several properties, including subunit composition and regulatory mechanisms, that are different from their bacterial counterparts (for reviews, see Refs. 1, 21Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 64: 173-214Google Scholar, and 22Nalin C.M. Nelson N. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1988; 15: 273-294Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Development of an in vitro assembly system is also essential for our studies of CF1that involve assembling genetically engineered subunits into an active enzyme complex for probe-labeling studies aimed at examining protein dynamics (23Chen Z.

Chem. 1986; 261: 12109-12113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for isolating the CF1β subunit and reconstituting it with β-deficient membranes of Rhodospirrillum rubrum to form an active hybrid F1complex. In this paper, we report the isolation of the γ subunit and an αβ complex from CF1. The two protein preparations were readily reconstituted with each other to form a fully functional core enzyme complex. Using this reconstitution system, we have been able to demonstrate that an α3β3γ complex is likely to be the minimum structure required for asymmetric nucleotide binding and, therefore, for cooperative catalysis by CF1. Formation of the core complex is also prerequisite for proper binding of the inhibitory ε subunit and for binding of the allosteric CF1-specific inhibitor tentoxin. CF1and CF1lacking the δ and ε subunits, CF1(−δε), were prepared from fresh market spinach as described previously (2Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G.

Prior to use, the proteins were desalted on Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns (27Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated ε subunit was stored in the isolation buffer at 4°C (2Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 3Richter M.L. Patrie W.J. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7371-7373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotides and tentoxin were purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions of tentoxin were prepared by dissolving the inhibitor in ethanol to a final concentration of 5 mM, and stored at −70°C. Urea and guanidine hydrochloride were purchased from Fluka. Hydroxylapatite was purchased from Bio-Rad. 1-10 mg of CF1(−δε) were desalted on Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns equilibrated with 30 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). ATP and MgCl2were added to final concentrations of 5.5 mM and 5 mM, respectively. LiCl was added slowly from a 10 M stock solution to a final concentration of 2 M. The final protein concentration was kept below 1 mg/ml. The solution was incubated on ice for 1.5 h and then applied to a 1.5 × 10-cm hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with a solution containing 30 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgATP, and 0.3 M LiCl at 4°C. The column was washed with the same buffer solution. A mixture of α and β subunits, and usually a trace amount of contaminating γ subunit, was washed straight through the column. This fraction was collected and dialyzed at 4°C against at least 5 volumes of a solution containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgATP, and 2 mM dithiothreitol. The αβ complex was further purified by application to a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose column equilibrated with a solution containing 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM EDTA. A small amount of free β subunit was washed from the column with the equilibration buffer containing 0.12 M NaCl. The αβ mixture eluted when the column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.17 M NaCl. Any residual undissociated αβγ remained tightly bound to the column until the NaCl concentration was raised to 0.4 M. The αβ mixture was dialyzed at 4°C against at least 5 volumes of a solution containing 20% glycerol, 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), and 1 mM MgATP and stored at −70°C for further use. More than 50% of the α and β subunits of the CF1(−δε) were routinely recovered in the αβ complex. Isolation of the γ Subunit from CF1 (−δε)-CF1(−δε) was desalted on a centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with a solution containing 15 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). ATP, MgCl2, and urea were added to final concentrations of 5.5 mM, 5 mM, and 4 M, respectively. The protein concentration was kept at or slightly below 1 mg/ml. The solution was stirred gently on ice for 1 h and then applied to a 1.5 × 7-cm hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with a solution containing 15 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM MgCl2at 4°C. The protein (αβ) was washed through the column with 50 ml of buffer containing 4 M urea, 15 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM MgCl2. The column was washed with 20 ml of 15 mM NaH2PO4(pH 7.0) followed by 30 ml of 200 mM NaH2PO4(pH 7.0). The γ subunit was eluted as a sharp peak by washing the column with a solution containing 4 M urea and 300 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The γ subunit tended to aggregate when the protein concentration at this step was too high, requiring dilution with the elution buffer. The γ fraction was dialyzed at 4°C against a buffer containing 20% glycerol, 50 mM NaHCO3(pH 9.5), 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.3 M LiCl. The protein (∼1 mg/ml) was stored indefinitely at −70°C without loss of reconstitutive activity. The purified αβ mixture was diluted to about 100 μg/ml with a solution containing 20% glycerol, 50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, and 2 mM dithiothreitol and kept on ice. The γ subunit was added slowly to the αβ and gently mixed. The mixture was left to sit at room temperature (∼22°C) for at least 1 h before assaying ATPase activity. In some experiments, any unreconstituted subunits were separated from the reconstituted αβγ by DEAE chromatography as described in the preceding section. Release of bound nucleotides upon denaturation and precipitation of the αβ and CF1(−δε) complexes was achieved essentially as described elsewhere (10Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50 μl of 1.2 M HClO4were added to each 100 μl of protein sample containing between 100 and 200 μg of protein. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation in a Beckman Microfuge at full speed for 5 min. 25 μl of 1.3 M K2CO3were added immediately to the supernatant to neutralize it. The centrifugation was repeated, and the supernatant was subjected to HPLC analysis on a Beckman System Gold gradient system equipped with a Shimadzu CR601 integrator. Nucleotides were separated isocratically on a Beckman 5-μm ODS column with an eluting solvent containing 50 mM potassium phosphate and 5 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (pH 6.5) in 92.2% (v/v) distilled water, 7.8% (v/v) acetonitrile (10Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide absorbance was monitored at 254 nm. Concentrations of nucleotides in extracts were determined by comparing peak areas with those of standard nucleotides of known concentration. ATPase activities were determined by measuring phosphate release (28Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 668-675Google Scholar) for 5-10 min at 37°C. The assay mixture for calcium-dependent ATPase activity contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM CaCl2. That for magnesium-dependent ATPase activity contained 40 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8), 4 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Na2SO3(29Larson E.M. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 67-77Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed on a Beckman model E664 analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with schlieren optics. Electron microscopy was performed as described elsewhere (32Boekema E.J. Bottcher B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Treatment of CF1(−δε) with 2 M LiCl2followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” led to isolation of two protein fractions, one containing the γ subunit with an almost equal concentration of contaminating α subunit, and another containing a freely soluble and highly purified mixture of α and β subunits. Between 50 and 70% of the α and β subunits were recovered from the starting material. A highly purified γ subunit was obtained using a similar procedure in which the LiCl was replaced by 4 M urea. The αβ fraction obtained using this alternative procedure was inactive in reconstitution. Therefore, the LiCl αβ fraction and the urea γ fraction were used for reconstitution studies. Gel electrophoresis of these fractions is shown in Fig. 1. Preliminary studies (not shown) indicated that when the αβ fraction shown in Fig. 1 was subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation, it sedimented as a single species with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 350,000 (the calculated molecular weight of the α3β3complex is 328,000). The αβ fraction was also shown to co-chromatograph with CF1(−δε) on a 1 × 40-cm column of Sephadex G-200, a considerable distance in front of standard bovine serum albumin that was shown earlier (33Mills D.A. Richter M.L. Baltscheffsky M. Current Progress in Photosynthesis Research. Vol. III. Kluwer, The Netherlands1990: 6-10Google Scholar) to co-elute with free β subunit under the same conditions. The high molecular weight of the αβ fraction suggested that it may exist as a hexameric α3β3complex similar to that isolated from the thermophilic bacterial F1(34Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Otawara-Hammamoto Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and to that isolated from CF1following treatment of thylakoid membranes with LiCl (35Avital S. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7067-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the protein was examined by electron microscopy, we did not observe the usual hexameric structure, which is routinely observed in preparations of CF1and CF1(−δε) (32Boekema E.J. Bottcher B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This was true despite a number of trials in which the protein concentration, the ionic strength, and the nucleotide concentration of the suspension medium were varied. A likely explanation for the lack of structure is that the αβ complex is less stable than the αβγ complex and fell apart upon dehydration and/or binding to the carbon grid when preparing the protein for electron microscopy. That the αβ mixture is less stable than CF1or CF1(−δε) was evident when the protein was analyzed by HPLC as shown in Fig. 2. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2B, the αβ mixture was chromatographed in the presence of Mg2+and ATP, both of which are required for reconstitution with the γ subunit (see the following section). Under these conditions most of the protein migrated with an apparent molecular weight expected for a hexameric α3β3complex. A small fraction of the protein migrated as a species with a molecular weight of approximately 50,000, which was presumed to be monomeric α and β subunits. When the αβ mixture was frozen and thawed in the absence of nucleotides and in the presence of EDTA, only the lower molecular weight monomeric form was present (Fig. 2 C). We did not observe significant amounts of material migrating between these two forms, which would have suggested the presence of stable αβ heterodimers. The αβ complex exhibited a low rate of magnesium- or calcium-dependent ATP hydrolysis (Table I). The activity persisted even after the αβ was recycled through the isolation procedure to remove any residual traces of the γ subunit and after further purification by anion-exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In addition, the activity was totally insensitive to the inhibitor tentoxin and to added ε subunit (results not shown) under conditions where both strongly inhibit the catalytic activity of CF1(−δε). These observations precluded the possibility that the residual activity of the αβ complex resulted from the presence of a small amount of contaminating CF1(−δε). We found that the γ subunit aggregated upon removal of the urea, which was used to elute it from the hydroxylapatite column during isolation. In order to keep γ soluble, it was necessary to slowly exchange the urea for a buffer containing a relatively low concentration of chaotropic ions (0.3 M LiCl) at high pH (9.5). Under these conditions, γ could be concentrated to as much as 5 mg/ml without apparent aggregation or loss of reconstitutive activity. The cleanest preparations of the γ subunit were completely devoid of any catalytic activity yet were fully functional in reconstitution. By mixing the αβ and γ fractions, we were able to recover more than 80% of the catalytic activity of the starting material (Table I). The reconstitution occurred equally well regardless of whether the αβ subunits were in the hexameric or monomeric form. Purification of the reconstituted αβγ complex by anion-exchange chromatography resulted in an enzyme with essentially identical properties to CF1(−δε) (Table I). The reconstitution was complete within 2-3 h of mixing (Fig. 3) and was not sensitive to variations in pH between 6 and 8 (Table II). However, if the pH of the reconstitution mixture was kept at pH 9 or above, such as the conditions used to store the γ subunit, almost no activity was recovered (Table II).Table I:Reconstitution of an active core enzyme complex from isolated αβ and γ subunits of CF1 Open table in a new tab Table II:Conditions for reconstitution of the αβ complex with the γ subunit Open table in a new tab The reconstituted core enzyme complex was fully sensitive to inhibition by tentoxin and was strongly inhibited by the ε subunit (Fig. 4 and Table I). It was observed that exposure of the γ subunit to urea-containing solutions for several hours or overnight resulted in a significant loss of sensitivity to inhibition by the ε subunit, without a significant loss of γ-dependent reconstitution of ATPase activity. This suggested that part of the binding site for ε is present on the γ subunit and that this site may have been chemically modified (e.g. carbamylation of one or more amino groups) during prolonged incubation of γ in the presence of urea. This explained the higher residual activity observed for the reconstituted αβγ complex than for CF1(−δε) following addition of normally saturating concentrations of the ε subunit (Table I). To avoid such modification, the γ subunit isolation procedure was performed as quickly as possible, and more recently (results not shown) it was found that 2 M guanidine hydrochloride can effectively substitute for urea in the isolation procedure, eliminating the time-dependent loss of ε binding. MgATP was present throughout the preparation and storage of the αβ complex, so in order to test the effects of magnesium and ATP on reconstitution, the αβ complex was first desalted by column centrifugation. Reconstitution was found to be almost completely dependent on the presence of both magnesium and ATP (). The small residual activity observed in the absence of added nucleotide probably resulted from a small amount of ATP or ADP remaining bound to the αβ complex during the desalting procedure (see Table III). ADP could substitute quite well for ATP, whereas GTP was a poor substitute. AMP and CTP were ineffective.Table III:Analysis of tightly bound nucleotides Open table in a new tab The αβ protein complex was routinely isolated and stored in the presence of both magnesium and ATP. To examine the complex for the presence of tightly bound nucleotides, free and loosely bound nucleotides were first removed by passing the protein sequentially through two centrifuge columns. The columns were warmed to room temperature prior to addition of the protein to avoid dissociation of the αβ into monomers. Nucleotides that remained bound to the protein following chromatography on two consecutive Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns were identified using a HPLC procedure similar to that described by Shapiro et al. (10Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results are shown in Table III. The αβ complex retained approximately 1 mol of MgATP/mol of α3β3under these conditions. When EDTA was included in the buffer used to equilibrate the centrifuge columns, the residual MgATP was completely removed. This is in contrast to CF1(−δε), which contains nearly four tightly bound nucleotides/α3β3, two of which remain tightly bound even after continuous exposure to EDTA during isolation (I). The nucleotide binding properties of CF1(−δε) were essentially identical to those described previously for CF1(10Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated β subunit alone was shown (26Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) not to bind tentoxin with sufficient strength to compete with CF1(−δε) for binding of the toxin. This result suggested that CF1subunits other than, or in addition to, the β subunit are required for tentoxin binding. We undertook similar competition experiments to test for a binding interaction between tentoxin and the γ subunit or the αβ subunit complex. As shown in Fig. 5, neither the αβ complex nor the γ subunit, when preincubated with tentoxin, could reduce the effective concentration of the toxin, even at molar concentrations more than 10-fold higher than the concentration of latent CF1, which was needed to completely block tentoxin inhibition. As an additional control, some of the CF1(−δε) was pretreated with DCCD (see the legend to Fig. 6) before it was reconstituted with the γ subunit. The resulting αβγ complex was devoid of catalytic activity, but it was still capable of binding tentoxin and thus effectively blocking tentoxin inhibition of the active CF1(−δε) (results not shown).Figure 6:Competition between CF1(−δε), the αβ complex, and the free γ subunit for ε binding. The effectiveness of the αβ complex (●), the free γ subunit (▴), or DCCD-inhibited CF1(−δε) (▪) to compete with CF1(−δε) for ε subunit binding, was determined by preincubating a fixed concentration of the ε subunit with varying amounts of the competing protein. Each incubation mixture contained, in a total volume of 0.5 ml, 50 mM Tricine-NaOH, 1 mM ATP, 10 μg of CF1(−δε), varying amounts of the competing protein, and 1.9 μg of purified ε subunit (added last to all but the control sample), which was sufficient to inhibit the activity of the CF1(−δε) by 51%. After 5 min of incubation at 22°C, 0.5 ml of double strength CaATPase assay mixture, preincubated at 37°C, was added to begin the ATPase reaction. The DCCD-inhibited CF1(−δε) sample was prepared by treating CF1(−δε) with 200 μM DCCD for 1 h in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH. 7.0) (47Shoshan V. Selman R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 384-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CaATPase activity of the DCCD-treated protein was <0.1 μmol/min/mg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Competition experiments were also used to examine the structural requirement for ε binding. This was done by preincubating the ε subunit with the γ subunit, or with the αβ complex, prior to addition of CF1(−δε). If the ε subunit binds to either of these fractions, then their presence should reduce the effective concentration of the ε subunit, thus reducing the extent of inhibition of the ATPase activity of CF1(−δε). The results (Fig. 6) indicate that at high concentrations the γ subunit did somewhat reduce the effectiveness of the ε subunit, suggesting a weak binding interaction between these two subunits. The αβ complex, however, even at a very high"

This view is not universally accepted, and other reports suggest that in the presence of tropomyosin and under conditions where S1 concentrations are high relative to caldesmon, inhibition of ATPase activity occurs with little reduction of S1+ATP binding (Marston and Redwood, 1993Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12317-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter model requires that the mode of action of caldesmon be quite different in the presence of tropomyosin. myosin subfragment 1 12-(N-methyl- N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)) N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole IANBD-labeled caldesmon 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonapthalene acrylodan-labeled actin. Testing the different models of caldesmon both by mathematical modeling and by experimentation requires information regarding the rates of binding of caldesmon to actin in the presence and absence of tropomyosin. We have used two combinations of fluorescent probes to measure the concentration dependence of this association reaction. The concentration dependence of the observed association rates was analyzed by a simple Monte Carlo model assuming that the binding is a single-step mechanism.

Other proteins were prepared as described earlier (Chalovich et al., 1992Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol.

For modification with IANBD, caldesmon was treated with 10 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37°C and then loaded onto a 1.5 × 15-cm column of ACA 202 (Spectrum) gel filtration resin equilibrated with 100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA. To the mixture was added a stock of 25 mM IANBD in dimethyl formamide to give a concentration 5 times that of the caldesmon concentration. The reaction was stopped by the addition of dithiothreitol to 1 mM after an incubation of 4 h at 18°C. Unreacted probe was removed by gel filtration chromatography on ACA 202 resin. The extent of labeling was determined to be between 1.5 and 2 mol of probe/mol of caldesmon using an extinction coefficient of 2.6 × 104M-1cm-1at 495 nm (Trayer and Trayer, 1988Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5718-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled with acrylodan at Cys374by incubating at 4°C for 12 h in a solution containing 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM NaN3with a 5-fold molar excess of acrylodan. The extent of labeling was 70-100% as determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.29 × 104M-1cm-1at 360 nm (Prendergast et al., 1983Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the location of the fluorescent probe, NBD-labeled caldesmon was digested with chymotrypsin (1:1000, w/w) for 5 min, and the products of reaction were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on an SP-R cation exchange column (Waters) or by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polypeptides that had been previously determined to originate from the NH2-terminal myosin binding region (Velaz et al., 1990Velaz L. Ingraham R.H. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the COOH-terminal actin binding region (Chalovich et al., 1992Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were fluorescently labeled. In preparations that were not completely labeled, the myosin binding fragment was more fluorescent than the actin binding fragments, suggesting a more rapid reaction of the probe with the former site. In another approach, the digested IANBD-labeled caldesmon was applied to a 1.5 × 9-cm calmodulin affinity column equilibrated with 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2. The fluorescently labeled myosin binding fragment was in the breakthrough volume and was purified further as described earlier (Velaz et al., 1990Velaz L. Ingraham R.H. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intact caldesmon and the 35-kDa, 20-kDa, and smaller actin and calmodulin binding fragments were eluted by replacing the buffer with one containing 1 mM EGTA in place of the CaCl2. The 35- and 20-kDa actin binding fragments were purified as described previously (Chalovich et al., 1992Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm except for caldesmon, which was determined by the Lowry assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We have shown earlier that the Lowry assay gives an excellent estimate of the true caldesmon concentration (Velaz et al., 1989Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9602-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weights used for calculation of protein concentrations were 120,000 (S1), 42,000 (actin), 68,000 (tropomyosin), 16,500 (calmodulin), 87,000 (caldesmon), and 20,000 (the actin binding fragments of caldesmon). The ATPase activity of skeletal S1 was measured by the liberation of 32Pifrom [32Pi]ATP as described earlier (Chalovich and Eisenberg, 1982Chalovich J.M. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2432-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified polypeptides were run on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to Bio-Rad sequential grade polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The fluorescent band was cut out of the membrane and sequenced at the UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility. Samples were prepared by the drop method (Hayat, 1972Hayat M.A. Principles and Techniques of Electron Microscopy. Vol. 2. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1972Google Scholar) and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were examined with a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope at 65 kV. Fluorescence was measured on a SPEX Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer in 0.4 × 1.0-mm cells at 15°C. The excitation and emission slit widths were 1.25 mm (4.5-nm band-pass). Binding isotherms were constructed by maintaining the actin concentration at 1 or 2 μM and varying the caldesmon concentration. Results were most easily interpreted when the fluorescence of the actin probe was monitored so that the signal was proportional to the number of actin sites occupied. Curves of the fraction of caldesmon bound/total actin, or θ, versus free caldesmon were constructed by assuming that when the fluorescence no longer changed the actin was saturated. The free caldesmon concentration was calculated using the analysis of McGhee and von Hippel, 1974McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

These parameters were varied until there was a satisfactory fit to the experimental data. There is not a unique solution to such fluorescence titration data when the stoichiometry is unknown. The stoichiometry of binding is known to be 1 caldesmon per 7 (Velaz et al., 1989Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9602-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or more (Smith et al., 1987Smith C.W.J. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) actin monomers; a value of 7 was used in the calculations. The MLAB program was used in this mathematical modeling. Measurements were made in 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 34 mM potassium propionate, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol buffer, using an Applied Photophysics DX17.MV/2 sequential stopped flow spectrofluorometer. The binding of caldesmon to actin was monitored as an increase in light scattering, an increase in fluorescence intensity of the NBD probe on caldesmon, or a decrease in fluorescence of acrylodan-labeled actin upon binding to IANBD-modified caldesmon. IANBD fluorescence was monitored using a filter with 0% transmission at 510 nm and 80% transmission at 540 nm with excitation at 492 nm. Acrylodan fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 391 nm with a filter having 0% transmission at 430 nm and 80% transmission at 500 nm or with a 485-494-nm band-pass filter; both filters produced the same rate constant, but the 500-nm cut-on filter produced the larger signal. The concentration of caldesmon used was at least 10 times the concentration of binding sites, assuming one caldesmon binds to at least seven actin monomers. Two precautions were used to avoid actin depolymerization in cases where very low actin concentrations were used. Actin was diluted from a 20 μM stock and used for kinetic measurements within 5 min so that appreciable depolymerization would not occur. The same results were obtained using a final actin concentration of 0.5 μM or 2 μM. Alternatively, the actin was treated with a 1.2-fold molar excess of phalloidin added from a 10 mM stock in methanol. Identical results were obtained in the presence and absence of phalloidin. Cytochalasin D (1 mol/100 mol of actin monomer) was sometimes added to the actin when high actin concentrations were used to facilitate mixing. We detected no difference in the traces obtained in the presence and absence of cytochalasin D. Association rates were measured by mixing IANBD-labeled caldesmon with actin or acrylodan-labeled actin in either the presence or absence of tropomyosin. Averages of up to 15 kinetic measurements were analyzed by fitting equations for a monoexponential or biexponential process to the data with the software provided in the Applied Photophysics package. Caldesmon binds to an actin lattice where a single binding site consists of several actin monomers. In such situations there is a parking problem, that is units consisting of seven free actin monomers are not always available, so binding of caldesmon may require reorganization of existing bound caldesmon molecules. The result is that second order rate constants of the association reaction cannot simply be obtained from the slope of kobsagainst free ligand concentration. We therefore analyzed the kinetic data by a Monte Carlo simulation. The binding and dissociation between a caldesmon molecule and a 7-mer actin are assumed to be simple one-step reactions with rate constants k and k′, respectively. The equilibrium constant for the reaction is defined as K = k/ k′. Because the value of K can be obtained from equilibrium binding measurements, only one of the rate constants is an adjustable parameter. We assumed that the actins in solution are uniform in length, with M monomers per actin filament. M and k (or k′) are the only adjustable parameters in our simulation. The simulation of the kinetics of binding of caldesmon to actin was carried out by following the transitions of a single actin filament among its various “states” as a function of time, starting from a bare actin filament at time 0. An actin state is specified not only by the number of bound caldesmon molecules but also by the distribution of the gaps between two neighboring caldesmons. The transition between any two actin states always involves either a binding or a dissociation reaction. Analyses of the equilibrium binding of caldesmon to actin by the equation of McGhee and von Hippel, 1974McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2717) Google Scholar show that there is a small amount of positive cooperativity, which compensates for the parking problem (Velaz et al., 1989Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9602-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We neglect this cooperativity between bound caldesmon molecules in this initial kinetic analysis. Because the cooperativity is small, this is a good first approximation (we are working on a more complete model that accounts for the cooperativity). Thus, if the transition between two states involves the binding of a caldesmon to a gap of m empty units between two bound caldesmon molecules on actin, the transition probability can be evaluated as follows: α = (m − 6) kCc, where Ccis the concentration of caldesmon in solution. Note that m must be larger than 7 for binding to occur. If the transition involves the desorption of a caldesmon from the actin, the transition probability is simply equal to k′. The number of caldesmon molecules in solution changes when caldesmon binds to (or dissociates from) actin; this causes the caldesmon concentration in solution to change as a function of time during the simulation. The concentration of caldesmon in solution at any given time can be evaluated using the following equation: Cc= Cc0− (n/ M)Ca0, where n is the number of total bound caldesmon molecules on the single actin filament and Ca0and Cc0are the initial concentrations of actin monomers and caldesmon molecules, respectively, as prepared in the experiment at time 0. At any given state, all of the “out-going” transition probabilities can be evaluated and used to calculate the average “occupation time” that the actin will stay in that state as well as to determine which state the system will go to when the next transition occurs. Thus, by following a path of state transitions, a histogram of the total bound caldesmon on actin can be obtained as a function of time (see Fig. 1). A large number of similar histograms were obtained by repeating the simulation with the same set of parameters. The kinetic curve of caldesmon binding was then obtained by averaging over these histograms. Light-scattering measurements were not useful for the measurement of unmodified caldesmon binding to actin because the initial binding reaction had a very small signal, while the subsequent slow bundling of actin filaments (caused by the large excess of caldesmon over actin) produced a very large signal. The slow reaction, which was completed in about 20 min, was confirmed as actin filament bundling by electron microscopy (not shown). Large signals were obtained with the binding of NBD-labeled caldesmon to either acrylodan-labeled actin or to native actin. In the former case, the actin probe was observed, while in the latter case caldesmon fluorescence was monitored. Fig. 2A (curves 1 and 3) shows that the binding of NBD-labeled caldesmon quenched the fluorescence of acrylodan-labeled actin by 37%. The binding of smooth muscle tropomyosin to acrylodan-labeled actin resulted in an 18% increase in fluorescence (curves 3 and 4). The fluorescence of the acrylodan-labeled actin-tropomyosin complex was also greatly quenched by caldesmon-NBD (curves 4 and 2). Fig. 2 B shows that S1 also quenched the fluorescence of acrylodan-labeled actin. Thus while the acrylodan-modified actin gave a large signal upon binding to caldesmon, its fluorescence was sensitive to other actin binding proteins. The fluorescence change that occurred when caldesmon-NBD bound to acrylodan-labeled actin was related to the fraction of actin monomers interacting with caldesmon-NBD. Fig. 3 shows the binding curve derived from the decrease in fluorescence of the actin-acrylodan as a function of the added caldesmon-NBD. Analysis of the fluorescence data required the assumption of a stoichiometry of binding. A reasonable fit to the data could be obtained for any value of stoichiometry greater than 1:5; the solid curve shown is for a stoichiometry of 1:7. Two additional parameters describe binding of a large ligand to a lattice. The binding constant for caldesmon binding to an isolated site of seven actin monomers, K, was determined to be 3.2 × 105M-1. The parameter for cooperativity between adjacent caldesmon molecules, ω, was 17.9. The product Kω is the affinity of caldesmon to a site adjacent to an existing bound caldesmon molecule; this was found to be 5.7 × 106M-1. In our detailed earlier study, in which the binding was measured by a more direct method, values of K and ω were typically near 6 × 105and 5-6, respectively, with Kω equal to 3.6 × 106M-1(Velaz et al., 1989Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9602-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This agreement is reasonable and suggests that the fluorescence change is monitoring the binding reaction. Fluorescence changes accompanying the binding of IANBD-labeled caldesmon to pure actin are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4 A, curves 1 and 4 show that the binding of actin to caldesmon-NBD resulted in a 71% increase in fluorescence intensity and a small blue shift from 546 to 536 nm. The addition of a substoichiometric amount of S1 to the actin-caldesmon complex resulted in a partial reversal of the fluorescence enhancement (curve 2); higher concentrations of S1 totally reversed the fluorescence enhancement. This is consistent with our earlier observation that caldesmon and S1 are competitive with each other for binding to actin. The addition of ATP (curve 3) weakened the binding of S1 to actin and resulted in an increase in fluorescence. This change was time-dependent, and the fluorescence returned to a low value as the ATP was hydrolyzed and the S1 reattached to actin (not shown). Caldesmon binds weakly to S1 (Hemric and Chalovich, 1988Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1878-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows that a small decrease in fluorescence occurred upon the addition of S1 to caldesmon-NBD in the absence of actin. Caldesmon also binds to pure tropomyosin (Graceffa, 1987Graceffa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 218: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Fujii et al., 1988Fujii T. Ozawa J. Ogoma Y. Kondo Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Watson et al., 1990Watson M.H. Kuhn A.E. Mak A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fig. 4C shows that tropomyosin caused a small (8-9%) increase in fluorescence intensity in both the absence (curves 1 and 2) and presence (curves 3 and 4) of actin (Fig. 4 C). All of these changes were much smaller than those that occurred when caldesmon-NBD bound to actin. Since both the NH2and COOH ends of caldesmon-NBD contained a fluorescent label it was necessary to determine if the observed fluorescence change was due solely to the interaction of the COOH-terminal actin binding region with actin. The COOH- and NH2-terminal polypeptides of IANBD-labeled caldesmon were isolated from chymotryptic digests of the caldesmon. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the presumptive myosin binding fragment indicated the presence of two polypeptides, Ser26-Tyr-Gln-Arg-Asn-Asp-Asp and Gln28-Arg-Asn-Asp-Asp-Asp, that confirmed that this fragment is from the NH2-terminal region containing Cys153. The addition of actin did not result in a change in the fluorescence of the labeled NH2-terminal fragment. The 35- and 20-kDa actin binding fragments of caldesmon, which contain only one Cys residue, Cys580, were also purified and found to be fluorescent. Fig. 4 D shows that addition of actin to the pure IANBD-labeled 35-kDa caldesmon fragment resulted in a 92% increase in fluorescence (curves 1 and 3). The increase in fluorescence was largely eliminated by the addition of substoichiometric concentrations of S1 (curve 2). Therefore, the change in fluorescence of caldesmon was due to the interaction of the COOH-terminal region of caldesmon with actin. We had shown earlier that modification of caldesmon with iodoacetamide does not alter its binding to actin or actin tropomyosin (Velaz et al., 1989Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9602-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, modification of the two Cys groups of caldesmon with IANBD did not have a measurable effect on the inhibitory activity of caldesmon (data not shown). Similarly, modification of actin with acrylodan had little effect on the ATPase activity (data not shown). For example, at 50 mM ionic strength, smooth muscle tropomyosin enhanced the rate of ATPase activity in the presence of acrylodan actin and absence of caldesmon by a factor of 1.7; this is typical for unmodified actin (Williams et al., 1984Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, more than twice as much caldesmon was required to give 50% inhibition of the acrylodan actin-activated ATPase activity in the absence of tropomyosin. The rate of binding of NBD-labeled caldesmon to either actin or acrylodan-labeled actin could be readily observed in a stopped flow apparatus. Fig. 5 shows an example of a reaction using each probe. In the cases shown, the fit was to a monoexponential function. The total fluorescence change was completed within about 50 ms, and no further change occurred at longer time intervals when actin bundles began to form. At higher concentrations of caldesmon, a slightly better fit was obtained with a biexponential fit; this complexity was ignored for this first analysis. The analysis of the rate data to obtain the rate constants k and k′ was done by a Monte Carlo simulation using a simple one-step binding model. For this analysis, we assumed binding constants of caldesmon to actin in the absence and presence of tropomyosin of 0.55 × 106M-1and 1.9 × 106M-1, respectively (Chen and Chalovich, 1992Chen Y. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These binding constants are those to an isolated caldesmon binding site composed of seven actin monomers. The actin lengths assumed in the simulations were M = 700, 1400, 2800, and 5600. The half-times of the individual reactions were found, in simulations, to be rather insensitive to the actin length. Thus, most of our simulations were based on M = 700 to save computing time. Although fluorescence changes observed with caldesmon-NBD binding to pure actin reflected changes in the caldesmon probe while binding to acrylodan actin reflected changes in the actin probe, both measurements produced similar kinetic profiles. Fig. 6 A shows the dependence on the total caldesmon concentration of the observed half-time values for a single exponential fit to the binding of caldesmon to pure actin. Data obtained by observing the fluorescence of acrylodan actin (squares) were indistinguishable from those obtained by monitoring the caldesmon-NBD fluorescence (circles). The solid curve is the result of the simulation of these data with a single-step model having an association rate constant, k, of 1 × 107M-1s-1and a dissociation rate constant, k′, of 18.2 s-1. While this was the best fit of the data, most of the data fell within an envelope bracketed by theoretical curves with association rate constants ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 × 107M-1s-1. The simple model used was a good first approximation of the binding. Fig. 6B shows that the addition of tropomyosin did not greatly alter the observed kinetics of caldesmon binding. The results of experiments done by monitoring acrylodan actin (circles) and caldesmon-NBD (squares) were in close agreement with each other, indicating that the same process was being monitored in each case. The profile of τ versus caldesmon concentration was quite similar to that obtained in the absence of smooth muscle tropomyosin. The best fit of the simulated data was with an association rate constant of 1.2 × 107M-1s-1and dissociation rate constant of 6.3 s-1, and the data were bracketed by curves generated with association rate constants of 1 and 1.4 × 107M-1s-1. Interestingly, the enhanced binding of caldesmon to actin in the presence of tropomyosin appeared to be due primarily to a decrease in the rate constant for caldesmon detachment; the association rate constant was relatively unchanged. The values of k and k′ that generate the best fit of half-times with experimental points are tabulated in Table I.Table I:Rate constants for the binding of caldesmon to actin in the presence and absence of tropomyosin Open table in a new tab Caldesmon-NBD is a useful model for studying the binding of caldesmon to actin. This probe gave a large change in fluorescence upon binding to actin but only small changes upon binding to myosin or tropomyosin, thus indicating a high degree of selectivity. However, observation of this probe on caldesmon had the disadvantage of high background fluorescence when the caldesmon-NBD concentration was high relative to actin. To overcome this difficulty, we have also monitored acrylodan-labeled actin, which is quenched by the NBD probe on caldesmon. Both probes left the steady state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis unaltered, and similar transient kinetic results were obtained regardless of whether the caldesmon probe or actin probe was monitored. We have shown earlier that the binding of caldesmon to actin is competitive with the binding of S1 in both the presence and absence of tropomyosin (Chalovich et al., 1987Chalovich J.M. Cornelius P. Benson C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5711-5716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hemric and Chalovich, 1988Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 63: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In agreement with that result, we now report that the fluorescence change due to caldesmon-NBD binding to actin was reversed by the binding of substoichiometric amounts of S1 to actin both in the presence and absence of tropomyosin. The region of caldesmon that binds to actin and has inhibitory activity is at the COOH-terminal domain of caldesmon (Szpacenko and Dabrowska, 1986Szpacenko A. Dabrowska R. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; Fujii et al., 1987Fujii T. Imai M. Rosenfeld G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2757-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region was also sufficient and necessary for the fluorescence changes reported here. The binding of caldesmon to actin is probably mechanistically complex because of the parking problem that occurs for binding of a large ligand to a lattice and because of the cooperativity that may exist among adjacent ligands. The data in the present case were analyzed by a Monte Carlo simulation that did not include cooperative effects. The binding constants k and k′ are intrinsic rate constants for the binding to an isolated binding site. Presumably, the true situation consists of a series of rate constants depending on nearest neighbors and on the slower rearrangement of sites to provide total saturation of the actin filament. However, our simple analysis provided a reasonable approximation to the actual event as judged by the close fit of the theoretical curve to the data of Fig. 6. Such a simple analysis would not be expected to be suitable for a more cooperative system such as in the binding of tropomyosin to actin where ω = 1600 (Wegner, 1979Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 839-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Even in the present case, the inclusion of cooperativity would have given a better fit of the individual reactions run at high caldesmon concentrations where there was a slight deviation from a single exponential. We will include the effect of cooperativity in the future. Tropomyosin is known to enhance the binding of caldesmon to actin; this enhanced binding appeared, from the present work, to be due to a decrease in the rate constant of dissociation of caldesmon from actin. We did not observe any indication that tropomyosin altered the mechanism of binding, that is the individual time courses of the binding reaction were similar in the presence and absence of tropomyosin; the concentration dependence of the half-times also had a similar appearance. If there were two classes of binding sites for caldesmon, in either the presence or absence of tropomyosin, one might expect to see biexponential binding kinetics even at the lowest caldesmon concentrations used since the caldesmon concentration far exceeded the number of binding sites. In actuality, we observed a good fit to the data with a single exponential curve except at high caldesmon concentrations. While we cannot rule out multiple sites there is no evidence from these data that they exist. A more telling experiment would be to measure the binding with excess actin over caldesmon. However, this becomes experimentally difficult and computationally nontrivial because several actin monomers constitute a single binding site. Another approach is to measure the dissociation of caldesmon from actin using the same probes described here. However, analysis of this behavior requires Monte Carlo simulations that are different from those presented here. This is a topic of current investigation.
