This ability of the erythrocytes to sickle, as the phenomenon is commonly described, appears to be attended by no pathological consequences in the majority of these individuals, and they are spoken of as having sicklemia, or the sickle cell trait. However, a certain proportion of the individuals who sickle are the vic4ims of a severe, chronic, hemolytic type of anemia known as sickle cell anemia. This proportion has been variously estimated at between 1: 1.4 (8) and 1: 40 (4). The essential difference between sicklemia and sickle cell anemia appears at present to depend at least in part upon the relative ease with which sickling takes place. In sickle cell anemia the erythrocytes may frequently sickle under the conditions encountered in the circulating blood, whereas in sicklemia sickling does not usually occur under these conditions (12). This difference has been attributed to a greater tendency of the erythrocytes of sickle cell anemia to sickle when the 02-tension is reduced, although recently this viewpoint has been challenged (13). Perhaps because of this differencealthough there may be other factors involved, such as the anisoand poikilocytosis to be observed in some individuals with the disease, and a greater resistance to hemolysis of trait cells when sickled than sickle cell anemia cells when sickled-the erythrocytes of a patient with sickle cell anemia have a greatly shortened life span, both in the individuals with the disease and in normal persons who have been transfused with the cells of sickle cell anemia patients, whereas sicklemia erythrocytes have an normal life span (3, 14). The ability of the red cells to sickle was observed to have a genetic basis not long after sickle cell anemia 1 This investigation was supported in part by a grant from the U. S. Public Health Service. The study has been possible only through the generous cooperation of the Anemia Clinic of the Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, The University Hospital of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary, Eloise, Michigan; all three institutions have made their case records of sickle cell anemia freely available. It is a pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mrs. Marion Weyrauch for technical assistance, and to Mrs. Laura Williams for case work. was recognized as a clinical entity (5). On the basis of a study of one large family, Taliaferro and Huck (15) postulated that the ability to sickle was due to a single dominant gene. At that time the clinical distinction between sicklemia and sickle cell anemia had not been clearly drawn, and the inference was that this gene was more strongly expressed in some individuals (sickle cell anemia) than in others (sicklemia). This has remained the accepted hypothesis up to the present time. Several years ago the author, in a review on the clinical detection of the genetic carriers of inherited disease (9), was led to suggest an alternative hypothesis-namely, that there existed in Negro populations a gene which in heterozygous condition results in sicklemlia, and in homozygous condition in sickle cell anemia. This hypothesis has a counterpart in the relationship which has been demonstrated to exist between thalassemia major and minor (10, 16). Recently the opportunity has arisen to give this hypothesis a thorough test. There exist a number of arguments permitting a critical decision between the two hypotheses. The present preliminary note will consider only one of these arguments. If the homozygous-heterozygotus hypothesis is correct, then both the parents of any patient with sickle cell anemia should always sickle (barring the occasional role of mutation; see below). If, on the other hand, the disease is due to a dominant gene with variable expression, only one parent need although occasionally, due to the chance marriage of two sicklers, both parents may sickle. In calculating the exact proportion of sicklemia to be expected among the parents of individuals with sickle cell anemia according to the dominant hypothesis, certain assumptions must be made. To the best of the author's knowledge, the question of the phenotype of the homozygote has never been raised by those who have accepted the variable dominant hypothesis of sickle cell anemia. For purposes of calculation we shall assume that under the variable dominant hypothesis all homozygotes have sickle cell anemiaalternative assumptions, such as intra-uterine lethality, are possible. We shall further assume that one in fifty heterozygotes also develops sickle cell anemia. Finally, we shall assume on the basis of the clinical data that the fertility of those with sickle cell anemnia approximates 20 percent of normal, with the result that only a few individuals with this disease-so few SCIENCE July 15, 1949, Vol. 1 10 64"

https://openalex.org/W1986848786,"The temporal spacing and the magnitude of major extinctions over the past 250 and 570 million years, based on the use of different metrics of extinction probability, are analyzed by comparing deterministic and stochastic explanations. The best-fitting time series model is a stochastic autoregressive model that displays a pseudoperiodic behavior with a cycle length of 31 million years for the past 250 million years, regardless of the metric of extinction probability. The periodicity lengthens and weakens when the analysis is extended to the entire Phanerozoic. The history of the probability of extinction for the entire Phanerozoic, based on time series analysis, does not support the reported bipartite distribution of Van Valen. Rather, the probability of extinction has decreased uniformly over Phanerozoic time whereas the inertia or stability of the biotic system after the Late Permian crisis has increased."

This lack of covariance indicates that the event at 3.2 million years did not result in a permanent increase in the ice budget of either the Northern or the Southern Hemisphere."

The pavoninins exert repellent activity against sharks and are considered to be the factors responsible for the predator-repelling property of the sole."

This effect is greatest for modes with large horizontal wave numbers and frequencies. It is large enough to affect estimates of the depth of the convection zone and may carry useful information about the structure of solar convective turbulence.

https://openalex.org/W1983945913,"ONNE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS confronting the clinical physiologist today is how the stomach makes its hydrochloric acid. Nowhere else in the body does a physiological fluid regularly attain a pH less than 3.0, let alone a value between 0.8 and 0.9 of a pH unit. Formation of such a solution requires the liberation of a strong acid, at concentration of about 0.17 N. This process has always fascinated me because of the simplicity of the chemical entity involved, but my interest in the problem derives from utilitarian clinical considerations as well. Some fifteen years ago, Dr. Alvarez of the Mayo Clinic said that the unequivocal cure of gastrointestinal ulceration awaits a medical procedure based on the complete elimination of acid formation in the stomach, and in order to attain this it is necessary that"
