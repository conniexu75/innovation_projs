https://openalex.org/W2005131012,"Heat shock promoters contain one or more binding sites for a specific heat shock factor (HSF). We report the cloning and sequence of the gene encoding yeast HSF, and demonstrate that HSF is required for growth at normal temperatures (15 degrees C-30 degrees C). The activity of a promoter containing a synthetic HSF binding site varies over a 200-fold range between 15 degrees C and 39 degrees C (heat shock). This change in activity is accompanied by multiple changes in the phosphorylation state of HSF, but all forms of HSF are able to bind DNA. We propose that the expression of heat shock genes in yeast is modulated by phosphorylation of DNA-bound HSF, and that this leads to a more efficient interaction of the factor with other components of the transcriptional machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2067598960,"The question of how the primary amino acid sequence of a protein determines its three-dimensional structure is still unanswered. One approach to this problem involves the de novo design of model peptides and proteins that should adopt desired three-dimensional structures. A systematic approach was aimed at the design of a four-helix bundle protein. The gene encoding the designed protein was synthesized and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The protein was shown to be monomeric, highly helical, and very stable to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl). Thus a globular protein has been designed that is capable of adopting a stable, folded structure in aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W2022987966,"The Drosophila developmental gene, engrailed, encodes a sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Using deletion constructs expressed as fusion proteins in E. coli, we localized this activity to the conserved homeodomain (HD). The binding site consensus, TCAATTAAAT, is found in clusters in the engrailed regulatory region. Weak binding of the En HD to one copy of a synthetic consensus is enhanced by adjacent copies. The distantly related HD encoded by fushi tarazu binds to the same sites as the En HD, but differs in its preference for related sites. Both HDs bind a second type of sequence, a repeat of TAA. The similarity in sequence specificity of En and Ftz HDs suggests that, within families of DNA binding proteins, close relatives will exhibit similar specificities. Competition among related regulatory proteins might govern which protein occupies a given binding site and consequently determine the ultimate effect of cis-acting regulatory sites."

https://openalex.org/W2023482892,"The yeast heat shock transcription factor gene, HSF1, has been isolated from an S. cerevisiae genomic expression library (in lambda gt11). The sequenced gene encodes an 833 amino acid protein having a mass of 93,218 daltons. Expression of specific DNA-binding activity in E. coli and of transcriptional activity in yeast confirmed the identity of the cloned gene. Southern analysis and gene-disruption experiments indicate that the heat shock transcription factor is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene. The DNA-binding domain was localized to a 118 amino acid region in the amino-terminal third of the protein. Inspection of the DNA-binding domain reveals no resemblance to any currently known secondary structural motifs implicated in DNA recognition and binding."
https://openalex.org/W2029131064,"The ""P"" gene of the paramyxovirus SV5 encodes two known proteins, P (Mr approximately equal to 44,000) and V (Mr approximately equal to 24,000). The complete nucleotide sequence of the ""P"" gene has been obtained and is found to contain two open reading frames, neither of which is large enough to encode the P protein. We have shown that the P and V proteins are translated from two mRNAs that differ by the presence of two nontemplated G residues in the P mRNA. These two additional nucleotides convert the two open reading frames to one of 392 amino acids. The P and V proteins are amino coterminal and have 164 amino acids in common. The unique C terminus of V consists of a cysteine-rich region that resembles a cysteine-rich metal binding domain. An open reading frame that contains this cysteine-rich region exists in all other paramyxovirus ""P"" gene sequences examined, which suggests that it may have important biological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2052203027,"In mammalian cells, the glucocorticoid receptor binds specifically to glucocorticoid response element (GRE) DNA sequences and enhances transcription from linked promoters. It is shown here that derivatives of the glucocorticoid receptor also enhance transcription when expressed in yeast. Receptor-mediated enhancement in yeast was observed in fusions of GRE sequences to the yeast cytochrome c1 (CYC1) promoter; the CYC1 upstream activator sequences were not essential, since enhancement was observed in fusions of GREs to mutant CYC1 promoters retaining only the TATA region and transcription startpoints. It is concluded that the receptor operates by a common, highly conserved mechanism in yeast and mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2018796983,We have analyzed interactions between the mammalian TATA factor (TFIID) and derivatives of the yeast activator GAL4. The interaction of the TATA factor on the adenovirus E4 promoter with GAL4 binding sites adjacent to the TATA site was qualitatively altered in response to GAL4 binding. Alterations in the TFIID interactions were observed with two GAL4 derivatives that stimulated hybrid E4 promoter activity in vitro but not with a third derivative that bound to DNA but showed no activation. These results indicate that TFIID is a direct target for a GAL4 activation domain and suggest a simple general model for the activation mechanism.
https://openalex.org/W2084229225,"We show that derivatives of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4, synthesized in and purified from E. coli, stimulate transcription of a mammalian gene (the adenovirus E4 gene) in a HeLa cell nuclear extract. Stimulation depended upon GAL4 binding sites inserted in the template. When the GAL4 sites were placed immediately upstream of the E4 TATA box, GAL4 stimulated efficiently. When the GAL4 sites were further upstream from TATA, however, efficient stimulation by GAL4 required, in addition, a site for a mammalian transcriptional activator immediately upstream of TATA. Under these conditions, the GAL4 derivatives functioned synergistically with the proximally bound activator. Previous experiments have defined two ""activating regions"" in GAL4, and our current experiments define a third, whose function is observed in vitro but not in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2010234214,"The glucocorticoid receptor regulates transcriptional initiation upon binding to its cognate hormone. A series of fusion genes was constructed to examine the mechanism of hormone-regulated transcriptional enhancement. The DNA binding domain of the bacterial LexA repressor was fused to receptor derivatives lacking the region that is necessary and sufficient for specific DNA binding and transcriptional enhancement at glucocorticoid response elements (GRE's). The resultant hybrid proteins activated transcription from promoters linked to the lex operator. Enhancement still required hormone binding by the hybrid receptor regardless of the exact positioning of the LexA binding domain within the protein. Thus, the unliganded hormone binding domain of the receptor acts as a strong but reversible inhibitor of receptor activity in a manner that is independent of the means by which the receptor recognizes DNA. The results also show directly that the receptor contains at least one ""enhancement domain"" other than that overlapping the GRE binding region; the second domain, enh2, occupies a region near the receptor amino terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2114262759,"The gene mab-3 appears to regulate a subset of sex-specific events in C. elegans male development. Mutations in mab-3 have no apparent effect on hermaphrodites, but cause synthesis of yolk proteins and a limited lineage alteration in males. We infer that mab-3 has at least two distinct male-specific functions. First, mab-3 activity prevents yolk protein production by males, without affecting stage or tissue specificity of expression. Second, mab-3 activity is required for expression of the male V ray cell lineage. Epistasis analysis is most consistent with a model in which mab-3 is controlled by tra-1, the last switch gene known to act in the somatic sex determination pathway. We discuss how genes such as mab-3 might generate sexual dimorphism."

https://openalex.org/W1486014609,"In the present study, we evaluated whether mononuclear leukocytes could synthesize and secrete growth hormone (GH) in vitro. By using RNA slot blot analysis, we detected maximum spontaneous levels of specific GH mRNA in the cytoplasm of rat leukocytes after a 4-h incubation. Northern gel analysis demonstrated that the specific leukocyte GH RNA was polyadenylated and had a molecular mass of 1.0 kb. Further studies using immunofluorescence, antibody affinity chromatography, and Sephacryl gel filtration indicate that leukocytes secrete a high molecular weight ( > 300,000) and a low molecular weight (~ 22,000) immunoreactive GH (irGH). A substantial amount of the high molecular weight irGH can be converted to the lower molecular weight form after reduction with mercaptoethanol. The irGH appeared to be de novo synthesized because it could be radiolabeled with tritiated amino acids and its production could be blocked by previous incubation of leukocytes with cycloheximide. The replication of Nb2 rat node lymphoma cells was stimulated by affinity-purified human lymphocyte-derived irGH. The growth stimulation was blocked by specific antibodies to hGH. We conclude that lymphocytes produce an irGH that is similar to if not identical to pituitary GH in terms of bioactivity, antigenicity, and molecular weight. The findings demonstrate a potential regulatory loop between the immune and neuroendocrine tissues.—Weigent, D. A.; Baxter, J. B.; Wear, W. E.; Smith, L. R.; Bost, K. L.; Blalock, J. E.

https://openalex.org/W1561680312,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and is important for storage of adipocyte lipid. To study the regulation of LPL synthetic rate in adipose tissue, primary cultures of isolated rat adipocytes were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and LPL was immunoprecipitated with an LPL-specific antibody. A pulse-chase experiment identified the cellular and secreted forms of LPL as a 55-57-kDa protein. In the presence of heparin, there was a large increase in secretion of newly synthesized LPL from the cells, although heparin did not stimulate cellular LPL synthetic rate. When cells were exposed to insulin for 2 h, pulse-labeling revealed that insulin stimulated a maximal dose-related increase in LPL synthetic rate of 300% of control. This increase in LPL synthetic rate was observed after an exposure to insulin for as little as 60 min and was accompanied by only a 10-25% increase in total protein synthesis. In addition, insulin had no effect on the turnover of intracellular LPL. Using a cDNA probe for LPL, insulin induced a 2-fold increase in the LPL mRNA. Thus, insulin stimulated an increase in specific LPL mRNA in isolated rat adipocytes. This increase in LPL mRNA then leads to an increase in the synthetic rate of the LPL protein."
https://openalex.org/W1494515794,"Enhanced c-myc oncogene expression associated with peptide mitogen-stimulated cell growth is primarily a result of a post-transcriptional event involving increased mRNA stability. We have recently shown that estradiol stimulates c-myc expression in estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells. In this report, we show that in estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cells, estradiol stimulated the c-myc gene exclusively at the transcriptional level, increasing c-myc mRNA transcription more than 10-fold within 20 min, while having no effect on the c-myc mRNA half-life of 18 min. In addition, pretreatment of the cells with cycloheximide did not prevent induction of the c-myc oncogene, indicating a primary effect of estrogen. Furthermore, the elevated level of c-myc mRNA in estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 cells was due primarily to a more stable c-myc mRNA with a half-life of 49 min, in the absence of enhanced transcription. These results indicate that different mechanisms of regulation of c-myc oncogene expression exist in hormone-dependent and -independent human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2154544847,"Trigger factor is a soluble, 63,000 dalton protein of E. coli that stabilizes proOmpA, the precursor form of a major outer-membrane protein, in a conformation competent for in vitro membrane assembly. There is approximately one trigger factor molecule bound to each 70S ribosome isolated from cell extracts in physiological buffers. Trigger factor dissociates from ribosomes in 1.5 M LiCl and reassociates with salt-washed ribosomes in low-salt buffer. Binding is exclusively to the 50S (large) subunit, known to contain the exit domain for nascent polypeptide chains. In addition to its associations with proOmpA and ribosomes, excess trigger factor can compete with the proOmpA-trigger factor complex for a limited number of membrane sites that are essential for translocation of proOmpA. These data suggest a model of trigger factor cycling between the cytoplasm, the ribosome, presecretory proteins, and membrane receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1978164779,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene CDC28 encodes a protein kinase required for progression from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle. We present evidence that the active form of the Cdc28 protein kinase is a complex of approximately 160 kd containing an endogenous substrate, p40, and possibly other polypeptides. This complex phosphorylates p40 and exogenous histone H1 in vitro. Cell cycle arrest during G1 results in inactivation of the protein kinase accompanied by the disassembly of the complex. Furthermore, assembly of the complex is regulated during the cell cycle, reaching a maximum during G1. Partial complexes thought to be intermediates in the assembly process phosphorylate histone H1 but not p40. Addition of soluble factors to these partial complexes in vitro restores p40 phosphorylation and causes the complex to increase to the mature size. A model is presented in which p40 phosphorylation is required during G1 for cells to initiate a new cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1966856085,"The abundant E. coli ""histone-like"" protein HU is shown to be a differential effector of DNA recognition by three diverse control proteins. DNA recognition by lac repressor and catabolite activator protein is greatly stimulated, while specific aroH DNA recognition by trp repressor is inhibited. BaCl2, an agent previously shown to promote DNA bending, mimics the HU effect to give the same qualitative differential stimulation spectrum. The HU activation involves cooperativity, further suggesting that the various DNA bends and distortions induced during assembly of higher order HU:DNA structures are important for the HU stimulation. Thus, E. coli chromosomal DNA regulation is likely strongly influenced by HU protein that may promote a variety of alternative DNA structures that either facilitate or inhibit specific recognition by diverse control proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1612480077,"In a previous paper (Ikemura, H., Takagi, H., and Inouye, M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7859-7864), we demonstrated that the pro-sequence consisting of 77 amino acid residues at the amino terminus of subtilisin is essential for the production of active subtilisin. When the aggregates of pro-subtilisin produced in Escherichia coli were solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and dialyzed against 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1 or 6.2), pro-subtilisin was efficiently processed to active subtilisin. When more than 14 residues were removed from the amino terminus of the pro-sequence, active subtilisin was no longer produced as in the in vivo experiments. Similarly, active subtilisin would not renature under the same conditions once solubilized in guanidine hydrochloride. When the aspartic acid residue at the active site (Asp32) was altered to asparagine, processing of mutant pro-subtilisin was not observed even in the presence of wild-type pro-subtilisin. Inhibitors such as phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor did not block the processing of wild-type pro-subtilisin. These facts indicate that processing or pro-subtilisin is carried out by an intramolecular, self-processing mechanism. When the sample was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.2), no active subtilisin was found, suggesting that the highly charged nature of the pro-sequence plays an important role in the process of refolding of denatured pro-subtilisin."

https://openalex.org/W2081165976,"A new instrument has been developed for the electrophoretic separation of large DNA molecules that can independently regulate the voltage of each of 24 electrodes and allow the magnitude, orientation, homogeneity, and duration of the electric field to be precisely controlled. Each parameter can be varied at any time during the electrophoretic process. Thus distinct sets of conditions can be combined to optimize the separation of various fragment sizes in a single run. Independent control of electrode voltage allows all of the fields to be generated with electrodes arranged in a closed contour, independent of a particular geometry. This device increases both the resolution in any size range and the speed of separation, especially for DNA molecules larger than 3 megabases."
https://openalex.org/W2027022289,"The order of genes in the chromosome of enteric bacteria has been evolutionarily conserved despite the existence of mechanisms for rearrangement. Homologous chromosomal sequences in the same orientation recombine to form deletions or duplications. When homologous sequences in inverse orientation recombine, one expects to form an inversion of the intervening chromosomal segment. This expectation was tested by placing pairs of homologous sequences in inverse order at various points in the chromosome. Sequences at many pairs of sites (permissive) do recombine to generate the expected inversion, while the same sequences placed at other pairs of sites (nonpermissive) do not form an inversion. For the one nonpermissive interval tested, the missing inversion type can be constructed by an alternative transductional method; strains with this inversion are viable. Thus mechanistic limitations must prevent sequences at particular sites from undergoing the recombination event required to form an inversion."
https://openalex.org/W1515099708,"Cytochrome b is an integral membrane protein, which forms the core of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome bc1) complex. A computer-aided three-dimensional modeling procedure was carried out in four steps. First, the candidate hydrophobic helices were searched for throughout the protein primary sequence by a computer procedure based upon the method of Eisenberg; second, a secondary helical structure was imposed to the transmembrane peptides; third, the helical segments at a lipid-water interface were oriented, and finally the possible interactions between helices with similar properties were investigated. This procedure enabled the identification of nine hydrophobic segments, of which eight are membrane-spanning helices while one has amphipathic properties. Three hydrophilic receptor-binding domains were also identified. Based upon their hydrophobicity profiles, the transmembrane helices could be associated in pairs inside the lipid bilayer. In our folding model proposed for cytochrome b, all mutation sites are not only located on the same side of the membrane but are also in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure. Inhibitor resistance mutational sites which were recently characterized (di Rago, J.-P., and Colson, A.-M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12564-12570) have been located on this model. Moreover, the receptor-binding domains and the mutation sites are close neighbors in the three-dimensional spatial representation."
https://openalex.org/W1604881631,"The isolation and deduced amino acid sequence of 70 melibiose carrier mutants with impaired methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (TMG) and cation recognition properties is described. The Km for TMG transport ranged from 1 to greater than 100 mM. Amino acid substitutions occurred at 23 unique sites within the protein. These sites were clustered into four distinct regions: Asp-15 through Ile-18 (cluster I), Tyr-116 through Pro-122 (cluster II), Val-342 through Ile-348 (cluster III), and Ala-364 through Gly-374. Only two sites fell outside of these clusters: Ile-61 and Ala-236. In the native conformation, some or all of these clusters may interact to form the substrate recognition site. Impairment of TMG recognition was accompanied by decreased Li+ inhibition of melibiose transport in all but one mutant. That changes in sugar recognition properties should so frequently accompany changes in cation recognition properties suggests an interaction between the two substrates. A model for such interaction is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2166561860,A protein that binds specifically to A/G mismatches has been detected in E. coli by a gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay. A specific endonuclease is associated with the A/G mismatch-binding protein through two chromatographic steps. The endonuclease is specific for A/G-containing DNA fragments and has no cleavage activity on DNA containing the other seven possible mispairs or homoduplex DNA. The endonuclease simultaneously makes incisions at the first phosphodiester bond 3' to and the second phosphodiester bond 5' to the dA of the A/G mismatch. No incision site was detected on the other strand. These results are consistent with the unidirectional A to C conversion and short repair tract of a novel dam- and mutHLS-independent A/G repair pathway we have recently described. A nucleotide excision repair model is proposed for the conversion of an A/G mismatch to a C/G base pair.
https://openalex.org/W1576579253,"Abstract Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutants of recombinant mouse dihydrofolate reductase to test the role of some amino acids in the binding of two inhibitors, methotrexate and trimethoprim. Eleven mutations changing eight amino acids at positions all involved in hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions with dihydrofolate or one of the two inhibitors were tested. Nine mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and two were spontaneous mutants previously obtained by in vivo selection (Grange, T., Kunst, F., Thillet, J., Ribadeau-Dumas, B., Mousseron, S., Hung, A., Jami, J., and Pictet, R. (1984) Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 3585-3601). The choice of the mutated positions was based on the knowledge of the active site of chicken dihydrofolate reductase established by x-ray crystallographic studies since the sequences of all known eucaryotic dihydrofolate reductases are greatly conserved. Enzymes were produced in great amounts and purified using a plasmid expressing the mouse cDNA into a dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Escherichia coli strain. The functional properties of recombinant mouse dihydrofolate reductase purified from bacterial extracts were identical to those of dihydrofolate reductase isolated from eucaryotic cells. The Km(NADPH) values for all the mutants except one (Leu-22----Arg) were only slightly modified, suggesting that the mutations had only minor effects on the ternary conformation of the enzyme. In contrast, all Km(H2folate) values were increased, since the mutations were located in the dihydrofolate binding site. The catalytic activity was also modified for five mutants with, respectively, a 6-, 10-, 36-, and 60-fold decrease of Vmax for Phe-31----Arg, Ile-7----Ser, Trp 24----Arg and Leu-22----Arg mutants and a 2-fold increase for Val-115----Pro. All the mutations affected the binding of methotrexate and six, the binding of trimethoprim: Ile-7----Ser, Leu-22----Arg, Trp-24----Arg, Phe-31----Arg, Gln-35----Pro and Phe-34----Leu. The relative variation of Ki for methotrexate and trimethoprim were not comparable from one mutant to the next, reflecting the different binding modes of the two inhibitors. The mutations which yielded the greatest increases in Ki are those which involved amino acids making hydrophobic contacts with the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1629531138,"Abstract The mode of phospholipase C activation initiated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been studied in comparison with that initiated with vasopressin and bombesin in a rat fibroblast line, WFB. Stimulation of WFB cells by PDGF, vasopressin, and bombesin elicites rapid hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides and an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). On stimulation by PDGF, there was a lag period of about 10 s before an increase in [Ca2+]i. No measurable lag period was observed in the [Ca2+]i response induced by vasopressin or bombesin. Pretreatment of WFB cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate profoundly inhibited inositol phosphate formation evoked by vasopressin and bombesin, but enhanced to some extent inositol phosphate formation stimulated by PDGF. In membranes prepared from WFB cells, GTP markedly augmented inositol polyphosphate formation induced by vasopressin and bombesin. It was not successful in showing the PDGF-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates in the membrane preparation. The effects of GTP, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) on polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by growth factors were studied in WFB cells made permeable to nucleotides by treatment with either saponin or Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin. PDGF, vasopressin, and bombesin elicited inositol phosphate production in the permeabilized WFB cells in the absence of added GTP. GDP beta S, a competitive inhibitor of GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), markedly reduced the bombesin- and vasopressin-stimulated production of inositol phosphates. However, the PDGF-stimulated production of inositol phosphates was not affected by the addition of GDP beta S. GTP gamma S, an agonist of G-proteins, largely enhanced the vasopressin- and bombesin-stimulated hydrolysis of inositol lipids when added at 10-100 microM. In the presence of GTP gamma S, the PDGF-stimulated hydrolysis of inositol lipids was not enhanced, but was reduced: 100 microM GTP gamma S reduced the stimulated hydrolysis to about a half of the control level. Only GTP gamma S, and no other nucleoside triphosphates, was found to have these effects. Activation of G-proteins in WFB cells by fluoroaluminate resulted in the inhibition of inositol phosphate production elicited with not only PDGF, but also with vasopressin and bombesin. These results indicate that a G-protein couples vasopressin and bombesin receptors to the activation of phospholipase C. Moreover, these results suggest that coupling of the PDGF receptor to phospholipase C is not mediated through a G-protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1555021615,"Abstract A series of overlapping deletions has been constructed in the ompA gene which encodes the 325-residue Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the OmpA fragments were either located in the periplasmic space or were associated with the outer membrane. Apparently an area between residues 154 and 180 is required for this association; all proteins missing this area were found to be periplasmic. The nature of this association remained unknown; no membrane-protected tryptic fragments could be identified for any of these polypeptides. Hybrid genes were constructed encoding parts of the periplasmic maltose binding protein and an area of the ompA gene coding for residues 154-274. The corresponding proteins were not localized to the outer membrane but remained attached to the outer face of the plasma membrane, possibly because the normal mechanism of release from this membrane was impaired. In the OmpA protein the conspicuous sequence Ala180-Pro-Ala-Pro-Ala-Pro-Ala-Pro187 exists. Frameshift mutants were constructed to eliminate this sequence. There was no effect on the incorporation of the mutant proteins into the outer membrane. Thus, this hinge region is not involved in sorting. A proposal suggesting the existence of a sorting signal common to several outer membrane proteins (Benson, S. A., Bremer, E., and Silhavy, T. J. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 3830-3834) was subsequently rejected (Bosch, D., Leunissen, J., Verbakel, J., de Jong, M., van Erp, H., and Tommassen, J. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 189, 449-455; Freudl, R., Schwarz, H., Klose, M., Movva, N. R., and Henning, U. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 3593-3598). Although it is not known whether or not the outer membrane association observed represents a step in the normal sorting mechanism, it is concluded that it remains an open question whether or not a sorting signal, as proposed originally, exists in outer membrane proteins."

W., and Eisen, H.J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11805-11810). In this paper, glucocorticoid receptor of mouse L cells that were grown in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate was digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin (either before or after immune purification with BuGR antibody) and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, autoradiography, and Western blotting. The receptor is endogenously phosphorylated only on serine residues. Chymotrypsin digestion results in a 32P-labeled 42-kDa receptor fragment which contains steroid-binding, DNA-binding, and BuGR-reactive sites. Trypsin digestion generates a 27-kDa steroid-bound fragment (meroreceptor) which is not labeled with 32P and a 32P-labeled 15-kDa fragment which contains both the DNA-binding domain and the BuGR epitope. We have calculated that there are 4 times as many phosphate residues in the intact receptor than in the 42-kDa chymotrypsin fragment. From examination of 32P-labeled receptor fragments, we have deduced that one phosphate is located between amino acids 398 and 447, a region containing the BuGR epitope and about one-third of the DNA-binding domain, and the remaining three phosphates appear to be clustered just to the amino-terminal side of the BuGR epitope in a region defined by amino acids 313 to 369. Treatment of intact 32P-labeled receptor in cytosol with alkaline phosphatase removes these three phosphates, but it does not remove the phosphate from the DNA-binding-BuGR-reactive fragment and it does not affect the ability of the transformed receptor to bind to DNA-cellulose."
https://openalex.org/W1542814728,"The process by which DNA-interactive proteins locate specific sequences or target sites on cellular DNA within Escherichia coli is a poorly understood phenomenon. In this study, we present the first direct in vivo analysis of the interaction of a DNA repair enzyme, T4 endonuclease V, and its substrate, pyrimidine dimer-containing plasmid DNA, within UV-irradiated E. coli. A pyrimidine dimer represents a small target site within large domains of DNA. There are two possible paradigms by which endonuclease V could locate these small target sites: a processive mechanism in which the enzyme scans DNA for dimer sites or a distributive process in which dimers are located by random three-dimensional diffusion. In order to discriminate between these two possibilities in E. coli, an in vivo DNA repair assay was developed to study the kinetics of plasmid DNA repair and the dimer frequency (i.e. the number of dimer sites on a given plasmid molecule) in plasmid DNA as a function of time during repair. Our results demonstrate that the overall process of plasmid DNA repair initiated by T4 endonuclease V (expressed from a recombinant plasmid within repair-deficient E. coli) occurs by a processive mechanism. Furthermore, by reducing the temperature of the repair incubation,more » the endonuclease V-catalyzed incision step has been effectively decoupled from the subsequent steps including repair patch synthesis, ligation, and supercoiling. By this manipulation, it was determined that the overall processive mechanism is composed of two phases: a rapid processive endonuclease V-catalyzed incision reaction, followed by a slower processive mechanism, the ultimate product of which is the dimer-free supercoiled plasmid molecule.« less"

Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the fragments disclosed for the various proteinases eight independent cleavage sites distinct from the typical kallikrein cleavage sites flanking the kinin region. All the identified cleavage sites cluster in two stretches of 11-12 residues of the kininogen heavy chain. These short segments represent the primary attack sites for proteinases (proteinase-sensitive regions) in the heavy chain portion of human low molecular weight kininogen. The amino acid sequences of the two proteinase-sensitive regions are mutually homologous; they are further characterized by the presence of a single copy each of the consensus tetrapeptide Cys-X-Gly-Cys known to form a narrow disulfide loop (Kellermann, J., Thelen, C., Lottspeich, F., Henschen, A., Vogel, R., and Muller-Esterl, W. (1987) Biochem. J. 247, 15-21). The proteinase-sensitive regions are located at the junctions of the three cystatin-like domains constituting the kininogen heavy chain. Proteolytic cleavage at the sensitive regions dissects the kininogen heavy chain and releases single domains of 20,000 Da and combined domains of 40,000 Da which can function as cysteine proteinase inhibitors. The presence of kininogen heavy chain domains in plasma samples under pathologic conditions suggests that cleavage of the proteinase-sensitive regions might also occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1542005894,"Incubation of cultured human (IM-9) lymphocytes with glucocorticoids increases the number of insulin receptors on the cell surface. Recently it has been shown that this results from a 3-fold increase in the rate of proreceptor synthesis. In the case of homologous insulin receptor down-regulation, a moderate rise in proreceptor biosynthesis has also been demonstrated. To further delineate the mechanisms of insulin receptor regulation, we have measured insulin receptor mRNA levels in hydrocortisone-treated and insulin-treated IM-9 lymphocytes. An increase in insulin receptor mRNA could be detected after 2 h of incubation with hydrocortisone and a plateau was reached by 4-6 h. The response was dose-dependent, being detectable with 50 nM hydrocortisone and reaching a maximal 3.7-fold increase at 200 nM. Actinomycin D completely suppressed the effect, whereas cycloheximide inhibited the effect by no more than 50%. These findings were extended by performing in vitro nuclear transcription assays which revealed that the 3-4-fold increase in insulin receptor mRNA could be attributed to increases in transcription. In contrast, homologous down-regulation was not associated with any change in total insulin receptor mRNA levels. The present study demonstrates that hydrocortisone, but not insulin, stimulates insulin receptor biosynthesis by increasing the rate of transcription and that de novo protein synthesis is probably required for a maximal effect."
https://openalex.org/W1588224088,"A trypsin-like enzyme (tryptase) has been purified to homogeneity from the granules of a human cytolytic lymphocyte (CTL) line, Q31, by a three-step procedure. By including 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml heparin in purification buffers, near total yields of tryptase activity were obtained during the purification. The enzyme, referred to as Q31 tryptase, migrated in polyacrylamide gels with sodium dodecyl sulfate at a position corresponding to 28 kDa with and to 45 kDa without 2-mercaptoethanol. It had an amino-terminal sequence identical to a previously reported human CTL tryptase at 20 of 22 positions identified. It hydrolyzed N alpha-carbobenzyloxy-L-lysyl-thiobenzyl ester (BLT), and this BLT esterase activity was most efficient at slightly alkaline pH and was relatively more active near neutral pH than mouse CTL tryptase. Human alpha 1-protease inhibitor, human antithrombin III, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and p-aminobenzamidine inhibited the Q31 tryptase. The inhibition by human antithrombin III was rapid enough to be of physiological significance. A survey of oligopeptide p-nitroanilides found that the best substrate for human Q31 tryptase is H-D-(epsilon-carbobenzyloxy)Lys-L-Pro-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide. The Q31 tryptase appears to have broad specificity for amino acid residues at P2 and P3, i.e. at 2 and 3 residues amino-terminal to the scissile bond."
https://openalex.org/W1875798317,"Recombinant human transferrin receptor has been produced in a baculovirus expression system. Magnetic particles coated with an anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody were used to immunoselect virus-infected Sf9 insect cells expressing the human transferrin receptor on their cell surface. Recombinant virus containing the human transferrin receptor cDNA was then plaque-purified from these cells. Biosynthetic labeling studies of infected cells showed that the human transferrin receptor is one of the major proteins made 2-3 days postinfection. The recombinant receptor made in insect cells is glycosylated and is also posttranslationally modified by the addition of a fatty acid moiety. However, studies with tunicamycin and endoglycosidases H and F showed that the oligosaccharides displayed on the recombinant receptor differ from those found on the naturally occurring receptor in human cells. As a consequence, the human receptor produced in the baculovirus system has an Mr of 82,000 and is smaller in size than the authentic receptor. About 30% of human transferrin receptors made in insect cells do not form intermolecular disulfide bonds, but are recognized by the anti-transferrin receptor antibody, B3/25, and bind specifically to a human transferrin-Sepharose column. Binding studies using 125I-labeled human transferrin showed that insect cells infected with the recombinant virus expressed an average of 5.8 +/- 0.9 X 10(5) transferrin receptors (Kd = 63 +/- 9 nM) on their cell surface. Thus, the human transferrin receptor produced in insect cells is biologically active and appears suitable for structural and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1490542383,"ATP-citrate lyase in vivo contains three phosphorylation sites on two tryptic peptides (peptides A and B). These phosphorylation sites are under hormonal control. Multifunctional protein kinase (MFPK) from rat liver phosphorylates peptide B on serine and threonine residues whereas cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates peptide A on a serine residue (Ramakrishna, S., and Benjamin, W. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12280-12286). We now report that rat adipose tissue MFPK also phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of peptide B of ATP-citrate lyase. When the activity of MFPK was assayed using partially purified (by chromatography on phosphocellulose) cytosol fractions from insulin-treated adipose tissue, it was found that MFPK activity was decreased by over 55%. This decrease in MFPK activity occurs at physiological concentrations of insulin (EC50 = 1 x 10(-10) M). Its onset is rapid and almost maximal at 5 min after the addition of insulin. Even when new protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide, extracts from insulin-treated fat pads have less MFPK activity compared to the control. The insulin effect is maintained after further chromatography on a gel filtration column suggesting that the decrease in MFPK activity is not due to a low molecular weight inhibitor. The insulin-induced decrease in MFPK activity is due to a decrease in Vmax whereas the affinity of this enzyme toward ATP-citrate lyase or ATP is unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1570621654,"The membrane subunit (IIGlc) of the glucose permease has been purified from overproducing Escherichia coli. About 2 mg of pure protein was obtained from 10 g (wet weight) of cells. IIGlc of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium are functionally indistinguishable. A small difference was revealed, however, by a monoclonal antibody which neutralizes glucose phosphorylation activity of IIGlc from S. typhimurium, but does not cross-react with IIGlc of E. coli. A dimeric form of purified IIGlc can be detected by chemical cross-linking and by zonal sedimentation at 4 degrees C. Upon mild oxidation a disulfide bond is formed between the subunits of the dimer. Oxidized IIGlc is more stable than the reduced form but is inactive because it cannot be phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic subunit (IIIGlc) of the glucose permease. Cys-421 could be identified as the oxidation-sensitive residue, using a novel assay to detect IIIGlc-dependent phosphorylation of nitrocellulose-bound IIGlc that has been purified by gel electrophoresis. No dimeric form of phosphorylated IIGlc could be detected. Because phosphorylated IIGlc is a catalytic intermediate it is concluded that catalytically active IIGlc is a monomer and that the dimeric form is an artefact observed only with purified resting IIGlc. That IIGlc is active as a monomer is further supported by the observation that monomeric IIGlc catalyzes phosphoryl exchange between glucose and glucose 6-phosphate at equilibrium and that an excess of inactive IIGlc with a serine replacing Cys-421 does not interfere with the activity of wild-type IIGlc as would be expected if interaction between the subunits in a dimer were essential for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1510123531,"Abstract The membrane part of the 325-residue outer membrane protein OmpA of Escherichia coli encompasses residues 1-177. This part is thought to cross the membrane eight times in antiparallel beta-strands, forming four loops of an amphipathic beta-barrel. With the aim of gaining some insight into the mechanism of sorting, i.e. the way the protein recognizes and assembles into its membrane, a set of point mutants in the ompA gene has been generated. Selection for toxicity of ompA expression following mutagenesis with sodium bisulfite yielded genes with multiple base pair substitutions, the majority of which resulted in amino acid substitutions in the membrane moiety of the protein. None of the altered proteins was blocked in membrane incorporation. A proline residue exists at or near each of the presumed turns at the inner side of the outer membrane. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, each of them was replaced by a leucine residue which is thought to be a turn blocking residue. None of these proteins had lost the ability to be incorporated into the membrane. Apparently, leucine residues are tolerated at turns in this protein. To interfere with the formation of antiparallel beta-strands, four double mutants were prepared: ompA-ON3 (Ala11----Pro, Leu13----Pro), -ON4 (Ala11----Asp, Leu13----Pro), -ON5 (Gly160----Val, Leu162----Arg), and -ON6 (Leu164----Pro, Val166----Asp). The former three proteins and even quadruple mutants consisting of a combination of ompA-ON2 or -ON4 with -ON5 were not defective in membrane assembly. In contrast, the OmpA-ON6 protein was translocated across the plasma membrane but could not be incorporated into the outer membrane. It is concluded that at least one rather small area of the polypeptide is of crucial importance for the assembly of OmpA into the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1498169126,"Inbred mice can be phenotypically divided into two groups: those that contain high levels of a kidney metallo-endopeptidase activity (meprin-a) and those with low meprin-a activity. In studies to investigate the molecular basis for the heterogeneity in the expression of this proteinase activity, we found a latent metallo-proteinase activity associated with kidney membranes of C3H/HeJ mice, a low activity strain. The latent proteinase was activated by treatment of kidney brush border membranes with trypsin and was purified from solubilized C3H kidney membranes. Purified preparations of the C3H latent proteinase (referred to as meprin-b) contained three major proteins of subunit molecular weights 90,000, 140,000, and 160,000. In the absence of reducing agents, four 90,000-Da subunits are covalently linked by S-S bridges. The two higher molecular mass proteins are not covalently linked to each other or to the 90,000-Da subunits. However, cross-linking and affinity chromatography studies indicated that the proteins in the meprin-b preparation were tightly associated. By contrast, purified meprin-a contains only 85,000-Da subunit proteins linked by S-S bridges to form a tetramer. Endoglycosidase F treatment decreased the mass of the 90,000-Da meprin-b subunit and the 85,000-Da meprin-a subunit to polypeptides of 65,000-70,000 Da. The 90,000- and 85,000-Da subunits are immunologically similar, in that polyclonal antibodies prepared against one of the subunits cross-react with the other. The substrate specificities and inhibitor profiles of purified preparations of meprin-a and meprin-b are also similar. These data are consistent with the proposition that meprin-b is a polymorphic form of meprin-a that is incompletely processed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1512427104,"The F1- and F2-polypeptide components of the fusion proteins and the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase proteins of the avirulent Queensland (V4) and virulent Australia-Victoria (AuV) strains of Newcastle disease virus have been isolated and subjected to extensive primary structural analysis including amino-terminal sequence analysis and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry mapping. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed on the gene which encodes the V4 hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein. Signal peptidase cleavage was found to have occurred at the Ser31-Leu32 peptide bond of the primary translation products of the fusion protein genes. Activation cleavage of the V4 fusion protein precursor generated a sequence of -Gly-Lys-Gln-Gly84 at the carboxyl terminus of the F2-polypeptide and an amino-terminal sequence of the F1-polypeptide commencing with 86Leu-Ile-Gly-. The V4 hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein gene was found to encode a primary translation product 45 amino acids longer at the carboxyl terminus than obtainable from the corresponding gene of the AuV strain (McGinnes, L. W., and Morrison, T. G. (1986) Virus Res. 5, 343-356). However, post-translational proteolytic processing, exclusive to the primary translation product of the V4 hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein gene, was found to have removed the last 42 residues of this carboxyl-terminal appendage."
https://openalex.org/W1482651185,"The effect of insulin and factors which have insulin-like activity on the kinetic parameters of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (MeGlc) transport in rat adipocytes were assessed. Carrier-mediated uptake of MeGlc was estimated by the difference in the amounts of [14C]MeGlc and L-[3H]glucose taken up in cells under equilibrium exchange conditions at 37 degrees C. The Km and Vmax values in basal cells were 17.4 mM and 0.24 nmol/10(6) cells/s, respectively. Removal of endogenous adenosine by adenosine deaminase resulted in a 26% decrease in the basal rate due to a slight increase in the Km (19.6 mM) and a decrease in the Vmax value (0.20 nmol/10(6) cells/s). The maximum concentration (10 nM) of insulin decreased the Km to approximately one-half of the basal (7.1 mM) concomitant with an 8.5-fold increase in the Vmax value (2.04 nmol/10(6) cells/s). Submaximal concentrations (50 and 150 pM) of insulin, N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (1 microM), mechanical agitation of cells by centrifugal force (160 x g), low temperature (15 degrees C), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (1 microM), and hydrogen peroxide (10 mM) all decreased the basal Km value to a range of 13.5-7.3 mM, concomitant with a 1.7-7.4-fold increase in the Vmax. A possible explanation for the alterations in the kinetic parameters may be that insulin and other factors cause the translocation of the mobile low-Km glucose transporters from an intracellular site to the cell surface, where the stationary high-Km transporters are located. Thus, when the Km and Vmax values of the hypothetical high-Km transporters were assumed to be 20 mM and 0.20 nmol/10(6) cells/s, respectively, and the Km of the low-Km transporters was assumed to be 7 mM, the theoretical Km decreased from 20 to 7.5 mM as the Vmax of the low-Km transporters increased from near 0 to 2.0 nmol/10(6) cells/s. The relation between empirical Km and Vmax values as affected by several agents and conditions followed closely the relation predicted by the above two-transporter model."
https://openalex.org/W1540867329,"Although the allosteric enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli has been the focus of numerous physical and enzymological studies for over 2 decades, the catalytic mechanism is still poorly understood. There has been much speculation regarding the role of a conserved histidine residue at position 134 which recent crystallographic studies have implicated in the catalytic mechanism as a general acid or as a general base. We have used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, 13C-isotope incorporation, and high field NMR to probe the role of His134 in the catalytic mechanism of aspartate transcarbamoylase. By comparing the wild-type catalytic trimer with that from a partially active mutant in which His134 is replaced by alanine, we have assigned the 13C resonance for His134 in the wild-type enzyme. This residue is shown to have a pK less than 6, indicating that the imidazole ring is unprotonated at pH values optimal for enzymatic activity (pH 8.0). This result eliminates the possibility of His134 participating as a general acid in the carbamoyl transfer mechanism. Since the crystallographic studies indicate that His134 is close enough to hydrogen-bond to the carbonyl of the liganded bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, the imidazole ring would be oriented as to make it unlikely that the N1 lone pair of electrons could participate in general base catalysis. Moreover, if His134 is implicated in base catalysis, we would have expected a much greater loss of activity upon its replacement by alanine. Perhaps the role of His134 is merely to help position the carbonyl group of carbamoyl phosphate for nucleophilic attack by the alpha-amino group of aspartate."
https://openalex.org/W1551078384,"We have identified two chromatographically separable forms of mitochondrial RNA polymerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which utilize different DNA templates. One form is only active in a nonselective assay utilizing a poly[d(A-T)] template. The other form selectively initiates from a mitochondrial promoter consensus sequence. Both enzymes can be extracted from yeast mitochondria and all components are encoded by nuclear genes. The possibility that these two activities represent core and holoenzyme forms of the multicomponent mitochondrial RNA polymerase is supported by our observation that both enzymes are absent from a strain bearing a disrupted copy of the RPO41 gene (Greenleaf, A. L., Kelly, J. L., and Lehman, I. R. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 3391-3399). The two enzyme activities are differentially regulated by carbon source; the nonselective enzyme is repressed during growth on glucose relative to the selective enzyme. The 5-fold increase in RNA polymerase activity on a nonrepressing carbon source correlates with the increased level of transcript production from mitochondrial DNA. These results suggest that the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and, in consequence, mitochondrial transcription are regulated by carbon catabolite control."
https://openalex.org/W2066647186,"A karyotypic analysis was performed on seven independently derived clones of primary rat embryo cells transformed by the ras oncogene plus the cooperating oncogene myc. The transfected oncogenes were sometimes present in amplified copy number, with heterogeneity in the levels of amplification. Some chromosomal features, such as aberrantly banding regions and double-minute chromosomes, typical of cells carrying amplified genes, were also seen in three of the seven cell lines. Underlying this heterogeneity there was an unexpected finding. All seven lines showed a common integration site for ras on the q arm of rat chromosome 3 (3q12), though some lines also had other sites of integration. In four of the lines integration of ras was accompanied by deletion of the p arm of chromosome 3 or its possible translocation to chromosome 12."
https://openalex.org/W1587008301,"Overproduction of human terminal transferase protein has now been accomplished by cloning the coding sequence of human terminal transferase into a baculovirus, where the expression of terminal transferase is under the control of the polyhedrin protein promoter. Two constructs were made, one producing a protein containing the entire terminal transferase fused to 12 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the polyhedrin protein, and the other producing 58-kDa human terminal transferase. The terminal transferase levels expressed in cells infected with either recombinant baculovirus are around 10,000 units/10(7) cells at 48 h postinfection, about 200-fold greater than levels expressed in thymus and cultured lymphoblastoid cells. The chimeric polyhedrin/human terminal transferase protein produced in the infected insect cells has a molecular weight of about 60,000 while the nonfused recombinant human terminal transferase is identical in molecular weight to that present in human lymphoblastoid cells. Both forms of recombinant terminal transferase show immunological and enzymatic activity. When infected cells are pulse-labeled with [35S] methionine at 42-45 h postinfection, about 10% of newly synthesized protein is terminal transferase. Both forms of terminal transferase are phosphorylated in recombinant virus-infected cells as demonstrated by pulse-labeling infected cells with 32P-inorganic phosphate and isolation of labeled terminal transferase peptides by immunoprecipitation."
