https://openalex.org/W2070396914,"Acanthaster planci, a coral predator, is undergoing a population explosion in many areas of the Pacific Ocean. Data on feeding rates, population movements, and stages of infestation were collected along coral reefs of Guam and Palau. Direct observations on destruction of Guam's coral reefs indicate that narrow, fringing reefs may be killed as rapidly as 1 kilometer per month. In a 2(1/2)-year period, 90 percent of the coral was killed along 38 kilometers of Guam's shoreline."
https://openalex.org/W2059518997,"A bacterium, a spirillum, has been isolated from a deep-sea sample and has been found to grow optimally at about 500 bars and 2 degrees to 4 degrees C. These conditions are similar to those prevailing at the 5700-meter depth from which the sample was collected. The organism grows at these pressures and temperatures with a generation time of between 4 and 13 hours; at atmospheric pressure and 2 degrees to 4 degrees C, the generation time is about 3 to 4 days."
https://openalex.org/W2004026722,"Stalagmites have been recovered from 45 meters below sea level in an underwater karstic cave (""blue hole"") near Andros Island in the Bahamas. Uranium series ages, corrected for contamination of the sample by young marine carbonate replacements, show that the speleothem was deposited between 160,000 and 139,000 years before the present. This period corresponds to the Illinoian glacial event and demonstrates that sea level must have been lowered by at least 42 meters (allowing for subsidence) from its present position during this time."
https://openalex.org/W2029484013,Radiolarian skeletons were placed at several depths on the taut mooring wire of a buoy in the central Pacific for 4 months. Recent radiolarian sediment dissolved at appreciable rates at depths shallower than 2000 meters; solution was greatest near the surface and decreased with depth. This pattern correlates with bathymetric distributions of dissolved silicon and of temperature. Siliceous Radiolaria from planktonic samples appeared to dissolve about eight times faster than those from sediment. Tripyleans seemed to be less resistant than polycystins. Acantharia dissolved completely at all depths.
https://openalex.org/W2042757281,"Females of the neotropical mantis Acanthops falcata adopt a special posture at dawn which is maintained for about 20 minutes. During the same period, males fly strongly, even in the absence of females. Our studies show that in this posture females are secreting a pheromone that acts as a sex attractant. All sexual activity in this species normally occurs between dawn and sunrise. It can be triggered by any dark-to-light transition, irrespective of real time. This sexual periodicity is probably an antipredator adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2087658969,Communities of Paleozoic shelf invertebrates underwent varied rates of change in faunal composition. Notable changes took place during Late Devonian-Early Mississippian time and were most noticeable in ofishore brachiopod-dominated communities. Near-shore molluscan communities remained relatively stable throughout the Paleozoic.
https://openalex.org/W2013698343,"Nesting biology of the Antarctic plunder fish, Harpagifer bispinis (Schneider), was examined at Arthur Harbor, Antarctic Peninsula, during the austral winter, 1975. Females prepare nest sites, spawn, and guard the eggs for 4 to 5 months, the longest guarded incubation period reported for any fish species. If this guard is removed, it is soon replaced by a conspecific, usually male. If the second guard is removed, a third replaces it. Guards are essential to ensure nest survival. Selfish or parental acts or acts of kinship or reciprocity do not adequately explain guard replacement. The act may be altruistic."
https://openalex.org/W1992488502,"Biting in Anopheles freeborni is inhibited during ovarian development. Biting inhibition is triggered by ecdysone, a hormone produced by the ovary during oogenesis. Biting inhibition does not occur in females after the removal of ovaries, but is restored by replacing ovaries or injecting ecdysone. Ecdysone also inhibits biting behavior when it is fed to females. This is the first example of ecdysone controlling a nonmolt-related behavior in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2002070059,"Exaimnination of ultrathin sections of ""undisturbed"" marin1e sediments from the Gulf of Mexico indicates that they are chlaracterized by a loose, open, random arrangement of particles. The microstructures do not appear to conform entirely to either cardhouse or honeycomb structures."

https://openalex.org/W1984179593,"Order-disorder transitions between ferrous iron and magnesium in orthopyroxenes [minerals close to the composition (Fe, Mg) SiO(3)] occur rapidly between approximately 480 degrees and 1000 degrees C. Disordering and ordering have been studied experimentally. The determination of the metastable ferrous iron site occupancy in orthopyroxenes from rapidly cooled volcanic rocks provides information on the cooling rates, especially from 600 degrees to 480 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2005377760,"Chemical process design requires quantitative information on the equilibrium properties of a variety of fluid mixtures. Since the experimental effort needed to provide this information is often prohibitive in cost and time, chemical engineers must utilize rational estimation techniques based on limited experimental data. The basis for such techniques is molecular thermodynamics, a synthesis of classical and statistical thermodynamics, molecular physics, and physical chemistry."

https://openalex.org/W1989473020,"Diverse photoperiodic responses were shown by three populations of Xanthium strumarium L. originating between 22° and 25°N on the western coast near Culiacán, Sinaloa; in the Chihuahuan Desert near Matehuala, San Luis Potośi; and on the Gulf Coast near Ciudad Mante, Tamaulipas, respectively. A combination of differences in critical night length and in ripeness-to-flower response (maturity) appears to be the basis for reproductive adaptation of these populations to different climatic regimes that prevail at the same latitude (and photoperiodic regime)."
