https://openalex.org/W2073197322,"Background Epidemiologic evidence suggests that cognitive and physical activities are associated with better cognition in late life. The present study was conducted to examine the possible benefits of four structured lifestyle activity interventions and compare their effectiveness in optimizing cognition for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method and Findings This was a 12-month cluster randomized controlled trial. 555 community-dwelling Chinese older adults with MCI (295 with multiple-domain deficits (mdMCI), 260 with single-domain deficit (sdMCI)) were recruited. Participants were randomized into physical exercise (P), cognitive activity (C), integrated cognitive and physical exercise (CP), and social activity (S, active control) groups. Interventions comprised of one-hour structured activities three times per week. Primary outcome was Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SOB) scores. Secondary outcomes included Chinese versions of Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), delayed recall, Mini-Mental State Examination, Category Verbal Fluency Test (CVFT) and Disability Assessment for Dementia – Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (DAD-IADL). Percentage adherence to programs and factors affecting adherence were also examined. At 12th month, 423 (76.2%) completed final assessment. There was no change in CDR-SOB and DAD-IADL scores across time and intervention groups. Multilevel normal model and linear link function showed improvement in ADAS-Cog, delayed recall and CVFT with time (p<0.05). Post-hoc subgroup analyses showed that the CP group, compared with other intervention groups, had more significant improvements of ADAS-Cog, delayed recall and CVFT performance with sdMCI participants (p<0.05). Overall adherence rate was 73.3%. Improvements in ADAS-Cog and delayed recall scores were associated with adherence after controlling for age, education, and intervention groups (univariate analyses). Conclusions Structured lifestyle activity interventions were not associated with changes in everyday functioning, albeit with some improvements in cognitive scores across time. Higher adherence was associated with greater improvement in cognitive scores. Factors to enhance adherence should be specially considered in the design of psychosocial interventions for older adults with cognitive decline.

We studied the effect of a nurse home visiting program on child maltreatment among young disadvantaged families in the Netherlands. This study is the first to investigate the effects of this program outside of the United States. Methods We conducted a single blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial that compared usual care with the nurse home visitation program, which began during pregnancy and continued until the children’s second birthdays, in 460 disadvantaged women who were pregnant for the first time and <26 years of age. The primary outcome was the existence of a report about the child from a child protecting services agency (CPS reports). Secondary outcome measures included home environment and child behavior. Results Two hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to the control group, and 237 were assigned to the intervention group. Three years after birth, 19% of the children in the control group had a CPS report. The 11 percent of children in the intervention group with CPS files was significantly lower (relative risk 0.91, p-value 0.04). At 24 months, the intervention group scored significantly better on the IT-HOME. At 24 months after birth, the children in the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in internalizing behavior (relative risk 0.56, p-value 0.04) but no evidence of a difference from the control group in externalizing behavior (relative risk 0.71, p-value 0.12). Conclusion The number of CPS reports for the intervention group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Additionally, the long-term home environments were improved and internalizing behaviors of the children were lower in the intervention group. Trial Registration Dutch Trial Register NTR854"
https://openalex.org/W1977226499,"South Africa bears the world’s largest burden of HIV with over 6.4 million people living with the virus. The South African government’s response to HIV has yielded remarkable results in recent years; over 13 million South Africans tested in a 2012 campaign and over 2 million people are on antiretroviral treatment. However, with an HIV & AIDS and STI National Strategic Plan aiming to get 80 percent of the population to know their HIV status by 2016, activists and public health policy makers argue that non-invasive HIV self-testing should be incorporated into the country HIV Counseling and Testing [HCT] portfolios. In-depth qualitative interviews (N = 12) with key stakeholders were conducted from June to July 2013 in South Africa. These included two government officials, four non-governmental stakeholders, two donors, three academic researchers, and one international stakeholder. All stakeholders were involved in HIV prevention and treatment and influenced HCT policy and research in South Africa and beyond. The interviews explored: interest in HIV self-testing; potential distribution channels for HIV self-tests to target groups; perception of requirements for diagnostic technologies that would be most amenable to HIV self-testing and opinions on barriers and opportunities for HIV-linkage to care after receiving positive test results. While there is currently no HIV self-testing policy in South Africa, and several barriers exist, participants in the study expressed enthusiasm and willingness for scale-up and urgent need for further research, planning, establishment of HIV Self-testing policy and programming to complement existing facility-based and community-based HIV testing systems. Introduction of HIV self-testing could have far-reaching positive effects on holistic HIV testing uptake, giving people autonomy to decide which approach they want to use for HIV testing, early diagnosis, treatment and care for HIV particularly among hard-to reach groups, including men."
https://openalex.org/W2026219049,"Myxovirus resistance (Mx) GTPases are induced by interferon and inhibit multiple viruses, including influenza and human immunodeficiency viruses. They have the characteristic domain architecture of dynamin-related proteins with an N-terminal GTPase (G) domain, a bundle signaling element, and a C-terminal stalk responsible for self-assembly and effector functions. Human MxA (also called MX1) is expressed in the cytoplasm and is partly associated with membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. It shows a protein concentration-dependent increase in GTPase activity, indicating regulation of GTP hydrolysis via G domain dimerization. Here, we characterized a panel of G domain mutants in MxA to clarify the role of GTP binding and the importance of the G domain interface for the catalytic and antiviral function of MxA. Residues in the catalytic center of MxA and the nucleotide itself were essential for G domain dimerization and catalytic activation. In pulldown experiments, MxA recognized Thogoto virus nucleocapsid proteins independently of nucleotide binding. However, both nucleotide binding and hydrolysis were required for the antiviral activity against Thogoto, influenza, and La Crosse viruses. We further demonstrate that GTP binding facilitates formation of stable MxA assemblies associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, whereas nucleotide hydrolysis promotes dynamic redistribution of MxA from cellular membranes to viral targets. Our study highlights the role of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis for the intracellular dynamics of MxA during its antiviral action."
https://openalex.org/W2007443023,"Anthropogenic changes in land use threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functioning by the conversion of natural habitat into agricultural mosaic landscapes, often with drastic consequences for the associated fauna. The first step in the development of efficient conservation plans is to understand movement of animals through complex habitat mosaics. Therefore, we studied ranging behavior and habitat use in Dermanura watsoni (Phyllostomidae), a frugivorous bat species that is a valuable seed disperser in degraded ecosystems. Radio-tracking of sixteen bats showed that the animals strongly rely on natural forest. Day roosts were exclusively located within mature forest fragments. Selection ratios showed that the bats foraged selectively within the available habitat and positively selected natural forest. However, larger daily ranges were associated with higher use of degraded habitats. Home range geometry and composition of focal foraging areas indicated that wider ranging bats performed directional foraging bouts from natural to degraded forest sites traversing the matrix over distances of up to three hundred meters. This behavior demonstrates the potential of frugivorous bats to functionally connect fragmented areas by providing ecosystem services between natural and degraded sites, and highlights the need for conservation of natural habitat patches within agricultural landscapes that meet the roosting requirements of bats."
https://openalex.org/W2026597643,"It is widely known that ion channels are expressed in the plasma membrane. However, a few studies have suggested that several ion channels including voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels also exist in intracellular organelles where they are involved in the biochemical events associated with cell signaling. In the present study, Western blot analysis using fractionated protein clearly indicates that Kv1.3 channels are expressed in the nuclei of MCF7, A549, and SNU-484 cancer cells and human brain tissues. In addition, Kv1.3 is located in the plasma membrane and the nucleus of Jurkat T cells. Nuclear membrane hyperpolarization after treatment with margatoxin (MgTX), a specific blocker of Kv1.3 channels, provides evidence for functional channels at the nuclear membrane of A549 cells.

Selective Kv1.3 blockers induce the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and c-Fos activation. Moreover, Kv1.3 is shown to form a complex with the upstream binding factor 1 in the nucleus.

Although Kv1.3 channels in excitable cells have been extensively characterized using electrophysiological, pharmacological, and molecular biological techniques, their presence in the nucleus has not been previously reported. In the present study, we investigated the localization and the functional roles of Kv1.3 channels in the nuclei of human cancer cells. The results show that functional Kv1.3 channels are expressed in the nucleus and are involved in the activation of specific transcription factors following the inhibition of their transport activity. A549 (lung adenocarcinoma cell), SNU-484 (gastric adenocarcinoma cell), and Jurkat (T-cell lymphoblast-like cell) cells were maintained with RPMI 1640 medium (Welgene) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Welgene) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich). MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell) cells were cultured in DMEM. Cells were fractionated, using a Qproteome cell compartment kit (Qiagen), into cytosol, membrane, and nuclear protein. The cells suspended in extraction buffer CE1 were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was then transferred into a new microcentrifuge tube (cytosolic fraction). Extraction buffer CE2 was added to the pellets and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred into a new microcentrifuge tube (membrane fraction). To protect the nuclear fraction, 700 units of nuclease were added to the pellet and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Extraction buffer CE3 was added to the pellets and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 6800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred into a new microcentrifuge tube (nuclear fraction). Finally, all protein fractions were incubated in ice-cold acetone for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The equal protein concentrations of subcellular extracts were resolved in 1× sample buffer to load samples into gels for Western blot analysis. The nuclear membrane of A549 cells was isolated by previously reported methods (22Franco-Obregón A. Wang H.W. Clapham D.E.

A549 cells were suspended in 4 ml of hypotonic solution containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-free acid, and 0.5 mm d,l-dithiothreitol (pH 7.9) for 10 min on ice. The swollen cells were spun at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 4 ml of hypotonic solution. The cells were homogenized with 10 strokes of a round glass pestle in a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). After centrifugation, the deposited nuclei were washed until the supernatant was clear. The nuclei were incubated in nuclear suspension medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), followed by homogenization with three strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. After adding DNase I and RNase (250 μg/ml), the nuclei were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. They were spun at 1000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min and resuspended in incubation buffer containing 0.2 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by adding high NaCl buffer containing 2000 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), and 2-mercaptoethanol (1%). The nuclear membrane was harvested by centrifugation at 1600 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. The isolation of the nucleus was performed using the Nuclei Pure Prep nuclei isolation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Intracellular solution containing 125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2PO4, 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm MgCl2, (pH 7.2), 100 nm Ca2+ with 10.2 mm EGTA, and 1.65 mm CaCl2 was added to the isolated nuclei. The nuclei were treated with 1 nm of MgTX (Alomon Labs) or 1 μm of ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min and then stained with 200 nm of 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 10 min to measure changes of nuclear membrane potential (12Quesada I.

The intensity of DiOC6(3) fluorescence signal was measured using BD FACSCaliburTM (BD Bioscience) and analyzed by BD CellQuestTM Pro software. To deplete the potassium concentration in the isolated nucleus, the nuclei were incubated in 0 mm [K+] solution containing 125 mm NMDG-Cl, 2 mm K2PO4, 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2), 100 nm Ca2+ with 10.2 mm EGTA, and 1.65 mm CaCl2 for 30 min. The nuclei were changed to extranuclear [K+] solutions (0, 30, 60, or 125 mm) adding 1 nm of MgTX for 5 min and then treated with DiOC6(3) at room temperature for 10 min. For the experiments to examine the effects of blockade of Sp1 expression, A549 cells were treated with 200 nm of mithramycin A to decrease Sp1 proteins for 24 h. The purified nuclei from A549 cells were suspended in intracellular solution and treated with 1 nm of MgTX for 10 min. After the nuclei were stained with DiOC6(3), fluorescence signal was measured using BD ACCURITM C6 (BD Bioscience). The isolated nuclei of A549 cells were incubated in intracellular solution supplemented with 1 nm MgTX at room temperature for 10 min to detect the phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB) and CREB. In addition to nuclei, pCREB and c-Fos were measured using A549 cells treated with 10 nm 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy) psoralen (PAP-1) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 and 30 min, respectively. Adult normal brain tissue extracts were purchased from Abcam (ab29456, ab29461), GeneTex (GTX29466), and NOVUS Biologicals (NB820–89333, NB820–605700). Tissue extracts were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with Na,K-ATPase (1:1000), ATP5a (1:500), GRP78 BiP (1:1000), lamin A (1:500), Sp1 (1:500), PARP (1:400), Emerin (1:1000) (Abcam), Kv1.1 (1:200, 1:400), Kv1.2 (1:500), Kv1.3 (1:500), Kv2.2 (1:400) (Alomone Labs), CREB (1:200), phospho-CREB (Ser133) (1:200) (Millipore), c-Fos (K-25) (1:200), and β-actin (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:6000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were transfected with sure-silencing Kv1.3 shRNA plasmid DNA (SABioscience) using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). To select transfected cells, cells were grown in medium containing the effective concentration of neomycin (G418; BIOSESANG Inc.). Detection of the Kv1.3 protein complex in the nucleus of A549 and MCF-7 cells was performed using the Nuclear Complex Co-IP Kit (Active Motif). Nuclear extracts (400–500 μg) of A549 and MCF-7 cells were incubated with 2 μg of Kv1.3 antibody (Alomone Labs) or guinea pig IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were conjugated with antibody by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C. The bounded proteins were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Bands detected by silver staining were identified using the Hybrid LC-MS/MS System (Applied Biosystems). MS/MS data were analyzed using a SEQUEST search. Furthermore, a loaded gel was transferred, blocked, and incubated with anti-Kv1.3 (1:500) (Alomone Labs) or anti-UBF1 (1:1000) (Abcam) for Western blot analysis. A ChIP-IT® Express Enzymatic kit (Active Motif) was used to perform ChIP using A549 cells. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 μg of anti-Sp1 or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 4 h. The collected DNA was analyzed using RT-PCR with Kv1.3 promoter specific-primers. The sequences of primers were: Kv1.3 promoter (−910/−728) forward, 5′-AAC AAC TAG AGC GCT GCA AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCG GGG AAA TAA GAG GAA AA-3′; Kv1.3 promoter (−542/−325) forward, 5′-CCA TCA GCA CCC ATT ACT CC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCC ACA CCC CTA GGT ACA GC-3′; and Kv1.3 promoter (−121/+61) forward, 5′-ACA ACA TGA GGG CTC TTT CG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCT CCT CCC TCC TTC TCG-3′. A549 cells were transfected with Sp1 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) or treated with mithramycin A (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. MgTX, ionomycin, mithramycin A, and PAP-1 were dissolved in distilled water or DMSO. The concentration of the stock solution was 10 μm and diluted to the appropriate concentration using PBS or RPMI medium before the experiment. Statistical significance for the membrane potential experiments was determined using a Wilcoxon signed rank test and unpaired t test. For analysis of Western blot band density, a Mann-Whitney U test was used, and all tests were performed using the SAS program (version 9.1). The subcellular localization of Kv1.3 was determined by Western blot analysis using fractionated protein. To confirm the efficiency of the subcellular fractionation of each cell pellet, ATP5a (a mitochondria membrane marker), GRP78 BiP (an endoplasmic reticulum marker), Na,K-ATPase (a plasma membrane marker), and lamin A (a nuclear marker) antibodies were selected. As shown in Fig. 1, localization markers were predominantly expressed in their respective fractions; GRP78 BiP, ATP5a, and Na,K-ATPase were strongly detected in the membrane fraction, and lamin A was only associated with the nuclear fraction. Remarkably, Kv1.3 protein expression was detected in the nuclear fraction of MCF-7, A549, and SNU-484 cells and also in the cytosolic fraction of MCF-7 and A549 cells (Fig. 1A). The specificity of the Kv1.3 antibody was confirmed by using shRNA against Kv1.3 (19Jang S.H. Choi S.Y. Ryu P.D. Lee S.Y. Anti-proliferative effect of Kv1.3 blockers in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2011; 651: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To confirm whether this nuclear localization of Kv1.3 is specific for cancer cell lines, we also tested human brain tissues, which are known to express functional Kv1.3 channels. Kv1.3 protein was observed in the nuclear fraction of human brain tissue. The purity of human brain tissue extracts was validated using lamin A and Na,K-ATPase antibodies (Fig. 1B). It has been previously reported that Kv1.3 channels are expressed in the plasma and mitochondria membrane of human Jurkat cells (10Szabò I. Bock J. Jekle A. Soddemann M. Adams C. Lang F. Zoratti M.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2592-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although Kv1.3 protein was found in the nuclear region in cancer cells such as MCF7, A549, and SNU-484 cells and human brain tissues, Kv1.3 in Jurkat cells was detected in both the plasma membrane and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2). According to our fractionation method, proteins from mitochondria and plasma membrane are also found in the membrane fraction. Therefore, the membrane fraction presumably contains Kv1.3 channels that were localized to the mitochondrial and plasma membranes of Jurkat cells (10Szabò I. Bock J. Jekle A. Soddemann M. Adams C.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2592-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These results suggested the possibility that differential trafficking of Kv1.3 channels to the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and nucleus may be due to the existence of splice variants or chaperone proteins (27Napp J. Monje F. Stühmer W. Pardo L.A. Glycosylation of Eag1 (Kv10.1) potassium channels: intracellular trafficking and functional consequences.J. Biol.

KCNE4 suppresses Kv1.3 currents by modulating trafficking, surface expression and channel gating.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To address the possibility of alternative splicing, we compared the coding sequence of Kv1.3 (GenBankTM accession number L23499.1) between A549 cells and Jurkat cells. We sequenced the coding region of Kv1.3 isolated from both cells but could not detect any splice variants in either cell lines (data not shown). These results indicate that the Kv1.3 coding sequence does not exclusively determine subcellular localization of the channel in A549 and Jurkat cells. A Western blot assay indicated that Kv1.3 is found in the nuclear membrane of A549 cells purified with the method by Kaufmann et al. (23Kaufmann S.H. Gibson W. Shaper J.H. Characterization of the major polypeptides of the rat liver nuclear envelope.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2710-2719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). To test the hypothesis that Kv1.3 affects the nuclear membrane potential, we treated Kv1.3-selective blocker MgTX in the isolated nuclei from A549 cells and measured changes in nuclear membrane potential using DiOC6(3) fluorescence by flow cytometry. DiOC6(3) is a cationic lipophilic dye that partitions into the nuclear membrane as previously reported by Quesada et al. (12Quesada I. Rovira J.M. Martin F. Roche E. Nadal A. Soria B. Nuclear KATP channels trigger nuclear Ca2+ transients that modulate nuclear function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9544-9549Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When the perinuclear space is relatively more negative, DiOC6(3) accumulates in the nuclear envelope, and therefore fluorescence increases. As shown in Fig. 3B (panels a and b), MgTX (1 nm) increased DiOC6(3) fluorescence in isolated nuclei as indicated by a dextral shift of the fluorescence signal, indicating that nuclear membrane was hyperpolarized by a decrease in K+ permeability. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 μm) was used as a control, which provoked a decrease in DiOC6(3) fluorescence (left shift), indicating that the nuclear membrane is depolarized. In addition, we confirmed that the MgTX-induced hyperpolarization was due to Kv1.3 channel expression by testing the effects of the toxin in Kv1.3 silenced cells (Fig. 3C, panels a and b). As shown in Fig. 3C (panel c), hyperpolarization induced by MgTX was dramatically diminished following Kv1.3 shRNA transfection into A549 cells. To determine how the K+ gradient affects nuclear membrane hyperpolarization induced by MgTX, we measured changes in membrane potential while varying the K+ concentration gradient across the nuclear membrane. MgTX (1 nm) had little effect on the nuclear membrane potential in 0 mm K+ solution. However, when the K+ concentration outside the nucleus was increased (to 30, 60, and 125 mm), the effect of MgTX was significantly greater (Fig. 3C, panel d). This result demonstrates that the effects of MgTX are dependent on the magnitude of the K+ gradient across the nuclear membrane. To investigate the roles of Kv1.3 in the nucleus, we examined phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB in isolated nuclei from A549 cells (Fig. 4A). The level of phosphorylated CREB was increased by 2.1-fold following treatment with 1 nm MgTX. In contrast, CREB total protein levels were similar between control and MgTX treatment conditions. In intact A549 cells, the membrane-permeant Kv1.3 blocker, PAP-1 (10 nm) phosphorylated CREB by 2.2-fold (Fig. 4B) and increased c-Fos, an immediate early response transcription factor (Fig. 4C), but there was no significant difference of CREB total protein level between control and PAP-1 treatment conditions. To investigate whether nuclear Kv1.3 interacts with other proteins in the nucleus of A549, we purified Kv1.3 channel complexes using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and co-immunoprecipitation in the isolated nuclei. As shown in the MS/MS spectrum from A549 cells (Fig. 5A) and Western blot image using A549 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5B), the upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1) was co-purified with Kv1.3 using an antibody that selectively binds Kv1.3 protein. The Kv1.3 promoter sequence contains TATA-less and GC-rich regions that are required for specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor binding (29Simon M. Conley E.C. Shelton P.A. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Transcription of the T-cell potassium channel Kv1.3 is regulated by a GC-rich TATA-less promoter.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 7: 243-250Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that Sp1 could bind to the Kv1.3 promoter and regulate the expression of Kv1.3 in the nucleus. Through computational analysis using the JASPAR database and TFSEARCH, several potential Sp1 binding sites were found in the human Kv1.3 promoter (accession number 3180). To determine whether Sp1 is bound to the Kv1.3 promoter, we performed a ChIP assay using A549 cells. PCR analysis using primers divided into the three primers in the Kv1.3 promoter showed that one region (−910/−728) of the Kv1.3 promoter interacts with Sp1 protein (Fig. 6A). To determine whether Sp1 was involved in regulating Kv1.3 expression, mithramycin A, a selective inhibitor of transcription factor binding to the GC-rich promoter, and RNA interference were used to inhibit interaction of Sp1 with the Kv1.3 promoter. As shown in Fig. 6B (panel a), reducing Sp1 protein-promotor interactions using mithramycin A decreased Kv1.3 channel expression compared with control in nuclear extracts. Furthermore, silencing Sp1 mRNA expression"

Current prognostic models for HCC are developed on datasets of primarily patients with advanced cancer, and may be less relevant to resectable HCC. We developed a postoperative nomogram, the Singapore Liver Cancer Recurrence (SLICER) Score, to predict outcomes of HCC patients who have undergone surgical resection. Methods Records for 544 consecutive patients undergoing first-line curative surgery for HCC in one institution from 1992–2007 were reviewed, with 405 local patients selected for analysis. Freedom from relapse (FFR) was the primary outcome measure. An outcome-blinded modeling strategy including clustering, data reduction and transformation was used. We compared the performance of SLICER in estimating FFR with other HCC prognostic models using concordance-indices and likelihood analysis. Results A nomogram predicting FFR was developed, incorporating non-neoplastic liver cirrhosis, multifocality, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level, Child-Pugh score, vascular invasion, tumor size, surgical margin and symptoms at presentation. Our nomogram outperformed other HCC prognostic models in predicting FFR by means of log-likelihood ratio statistics with good calibration demonstrated at 3 and 5 years post-resection and a concordance index of 0.69. Using decision curve analysis, SLICER also demonstrated superior net benefit at higher threshold probabilities. Conclusion The SLICER score enables well-calibrated individualized predictions of relapse following curative HCC resection, and may represent a novel tool for biomarker research and individual counseling."
https://openalex.org/W2105441714,"Recent disease outbreaks caused by alien invasive pathogens into European forests posed a serious threat to forest sustainability with relevant environmental and economic effects. Many of the alien tree pathogens recently introduced into Europe were not previously included on any quarantine lists, thus they were not subject to phytosanitary inspections. The identification and description of alien fungi potentially pathogenic to native European flora before their introduction in Europe, is a paramount need in order to limit the risk of invasion and the impact to forest ecosystems. To determine the potential invasive fungi, a sentinel trees plot was established in Fuyang, China, using healthy seedlings of European tree species including Quercus petreae, Q. suber, and Q. ilex. The fungal assemblage associated with symptomatic specimens was studied using the tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS 1). Taxa with probable Asiatic origin were identified and included plant pathogenic genera. These results indicate that sentinel plants may be a strategic tool to improve the prevention of bioinvasions."

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDAChistone deacetylaseROSreactive oxygen speciesDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideTMRMtetramethylrhodamine methyl esterPEphycoerythrin. are classified in four classes depending on sequence identity and domain organization (1.Marks P.A. Xu W.-S. Histone deacetylase inhibitors: potential in cancer therapy.J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 107: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved NAD+-dependent acetyl-lysine deacetylases that belong to the class III type of HDACs. Sirtuins are involved in the regulation of metabolism and life span (2.Mouchiroud L. Houtkooper R.H. Moullan N. Katsyuba E. Ryu D. Cantó C. Mottis A. Jo Y.-S. Viswanathan M. Schoonjans K. Guarente L.

A number of studies have demonstrated that Sirt1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell fate and stress response in mammalian cells. Sirt1 promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis or cellular senescence induced by stresses such as DNA damage and oxidative stress. Like Sirt1, Sirt2 is a ubiquitous, nuclear, and cytoplasmic protein deacetylase (4.Borradaile N.M. Pickering J.G. NAD+, Sirtuins, and cardiovascular disease.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; 15: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Sirt2 is implicated in tumorigenesis and cell cycle regulation. An increasing number of proteins have been identified as substrates of Sirt1 and Sirt2, including p53, FoxO, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (5.Jung-Hynes B. Nihal M. Zhong W.

Here we asked whether sirtuins have a regulatory role in apoptosis-like events in platelets. In this study, we evaluated the effect of three different pharmacological inhibitors of Sirt1/Sirt2 on human and mouse platelets both under in vitro and in vivo conditions. We demonstrated that Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 are all expressed in enucleate platelets. We found that inhibitors of sirtuin deacetylases, sirtinol, EX-527, and AGK2, markedly stimulated apoptosis-like changes in platelets in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by enhanced annexin V binding to the platelet surface, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and disruption in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). Apoptosis-like changes in platelets were associated with enhanced phagocytic clearance of cells by macrophages. The apoptosis-like phenotype in platelets induced by sirtuin inhibitors was attributable to p53-mediated transcription-independent induction of proapoptotic Bax and was calpain-dependent. Administration of either sirtinol or EX-527 in mice resulted in a decrease in both platelet count as well as in the number of reticulated platelets. ABT-737 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals.

The final cell count was adjusted to 0.5–0.8 × 109/ml with a cell counter (Beckman Coulter Multisizer 4). All steps were carried out under sterile conditions, and precautions were taken to maintain the cells in a resting condition. Approval for the animal experiment was given by the university ethics review board, and all human participants gave written informed consent. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. ΔΨm was evaluated using the potential-sensitive fluorochrome JC-1, which selectively moves across a polarized mitochondrial membrane and forms aggregates (red). As the membrane potential collapses, the color changes from red to green because of the release of monomeric dye (17.Lopez J.J. Salido G.M. Gómez-Arteta E. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Thrombin induces apoptotic events through the generation of reactive oxygen species in human platelets.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To study ΔΨm, platelets were pretreated with either sirtinol (50 or 100 μm), carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone (100 μm), or DMSO (vehicle) for 30 min; AGK2 (100 μm); or EX-527 (10 or 50 μm); followed by incubation with 2 μm JC-1 for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed in PBS, and JC-1 fluorescence was analyzed in the FL1 and FL2 channels of a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) for detection of the dye monomer and aggregates, respectively. Forward and side scatter voltages were set at E00 and 273, respectively, with a threshold of 52 V. An amorphous region (gate) was drawn to encompass the platelets to differentiate from noise and multiplatelet particles. The ratio of red to green (FL2/FL1) fluorescence reflected the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. TMRM, another potential-specific dye that is sequestered by active mitochondria, was also employed to study the effect of sirtuin inhibitors. For evaluating the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, platelets were incubated with 1 μg/ml TMRM for 15 min prior to treatment with reagents (carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone, 100 μm; sirtinol, 100 μm). TMRM-stained platelets were analyzed in the FL2 channel of the flow cytometer. Platelets pretreated with either sirtinol (50 and 100 μm), AGK2 (100 μm), EX-527 (10 or 50 μm), or vehicle (DMSO) were washed with PBS and incubated with 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in dark. For a positive control, platelets were treated with H2O2 (1%) for 10 min. Cells were again washed, and fluorescence was analyzed in the FL1 channel of the flow cytometer. Sirtinol itself is fluorescent, and values for sirtinol were deducted from the observed values in the experiments. Platelets (1 × 108 cells in 100 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of sirtinol (50 and 100 μm), AGK2 (100 μm), EX-527 (10 or 50 μm), or vehicle (DMSO). For a positive control, platelets were treated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 10 min without stirring and resuspended in annexin V-binding buffer. Samples were incubated with 5 μl of FITC-labeled annexin V at room temperature for 30 min in the dark and analyzed on the flow cytometer. Data from 10,000 CD61-positive events were collected for each sample. Human monocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (18.Kodama T. Takehara T. Hikita H. Shimizu S. Shigekawa M.

Briefly, blood from healthy donors was collected in citrate, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Hysep according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Monocytes were further isolated by plating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells on polystyrene-coated tissue culture flasks for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by three washes with PBS to remove non-adherent lymphocytes. Monocytes (250,000 in a 500-μl volume) were then plated on 6-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 7 days to obtain monocyte-derived macrophages. Control and sirtinol (100 μm)-treated platelets labeled with calcein-AM were incubated with a monolayer of autologous monocyte-derived adherent macrophages for 45 min. Following the incubation period, the phagocyte monolayer was washed to remove non-interacting platelets, and adherent macrophages were removed by treatment with trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by 5 mm EDTA at 4 °C. monocyte-derived macrophages were recovered by trypsin/EDTA treatment for 15 min at 37 °C and subjected to flow cytometric and epifluorescense microscopic analysis. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto a PVDV membrane for 2 h at 0.8 mA/cm2 in a semidry blotter (TE 77 PWR, GE Healthcare). To block residual protein binding sites, blots were incubated for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) supplemented either with 5% (w/v) BSA (for Bax and Sirt2) or with 5% skimmed milk (for acetyl-p53, p53, Sirt1, and Sirt3). Membranes were incubated overnight with antibodies against Bax (conformationally changed, clone 6A7, 1:500), acetyl-p53 (1:1000), p53 (1:1000), Sirt1 (1:1000), Sirt2 (2 μg/ml), and Sirt3 (1:1000). To detect binding of the primary antibody, blots were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, diluted 1:10,000 in TBST for Bax and 1:2500 in skimmed milk for acetyl-p53, p53, Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3, and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 5 min. Blots were exposed to photographic films, and the optical density was estimated using scanning densitometry. For the protein loading control, membranes containing whole cell lysates were reprobed with the anti-β-actin antibody. To determine cytosolic caspase-3 activity, samples were pretreated with either sirtinol (50 and 100 μm), EX-527 (10 and 50 μm), or vehicle (DMSO) and lysed with equal amounts of 2× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. After a 10-min incubation in ice, an equal volume of 2× substrate buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, and 10 μm caspase substrate acetyl-DEVD-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin) was added to each lysate and further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (17.Lopez J.J. Salido G.M. Gómez-Arteta E. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Thrombin induces apoptotic events through the generation of reactive oxygen species in human platelets.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity was determined from the extent of cleavage of fluorogenic substrate measured at 460 nm emission (excitation, 360 nm). Intracellular calpain activity was measured as described previously (20.Li C. Chen S. Yue P. Deng X. Lonial S. Khuri F.R. Sun S.Y.

Washed human platelets in 96-well plates were exposed to either DMSO or sirtinol (50 and 100 μm) or EX-527 (10 and 50 μm) for 30 min and then loaded with t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-chloromethylcoumarin (10 μm). After 30 min of incubation, cellular fluorescence was quantified with a fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek FLx800) at 37 °C (excitation, 351 nm; emission, 430 nm). Platelets were isolated from human blood as described above. Precaution was taken to prevent leukocyte contamination. Cells were counted in a Beckman Coulter Multisizer 4. Total RNA was extracted from platelets (2.5–2.8 × 108 cells/ml) using TRIzol reagent according to the protocol of the manufacturer and suspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Platelet RNA (1 μg) was transcribed to cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Samples were amplified in a PTC-150 thermal cycler (MJ Research) by using the following program: 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 120 min, and 85 °C for 5 min. Primers were designed using the latest version of Primer3 Input software. The primers for target gene (p53) were AGAGGAAGAG-AATCTCCGCA (forward) and GTTTCTTCTT-TGGCTGGGGA (reverse). GAPDH was used as the reference gene, and the primer sequences for GAPDH were GAAGGTG-AAGGTCGGAGTC (forward) and GAAGAT-GGTGATGGGATTTC (reverse). We performed real-time PCR employing SYBR Green SuperMix in a CFX-96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 10 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 10 s of annealing (at 56 °C in the case of GAPDH and 59 °C in the case of p53 genes), and extension at 72 °C. A melt peak analysis of amplicons was carried to rule out nonspecific amplifications. N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (600 mg) was injected into tail vein of mice, followed by either DMSO (control) or sirtinol (15 mg/kg) (21.Ostrowska J.K. Wojtukiewicz M.Z. Chabielska E. Buczko W. Ostrowska H. Proteasome inhibitor prevents experimental arterial thrombosis in renovascular hypertensive rats.Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 171-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At various time points (0, 12, 36, 60, and 84 h), 25 μl of retro-orbital blood was drawn from each mouse in the control as well as treated groups, mixed with 200 μl of buffered saline glucose-citrate buffer (116 mm NaCl, 13.6 mm trisodium citrate, 8.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.6 mm KH2PO4, 0.9 mm EDTA, and 11.1 mm glucose (pH 7.3)), followed by 1 ml of balanced salt solution (149 mm NaCl, 3.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 7.4 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm K2HPO4, and 3% bovine calf serum). Cells were pelleted at 1400 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 300 μl of sheath fluid. They were stained with FITC-conjugated rat anti-CD41, which labels only platelets, followed by PE-streptavidin for 1 h on ice. They were then washed in balanced salt solution and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the fraction of the platelet population labeled with PE (14.Mason K.D. Carpinelli M.R. Fletcher J.I.

Mice were injected intravenously with either DMSO or sirtinol (15 mg/kg), AGK2 (15 mg/kg), or EX-527 (20 mg/kg). Blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus of mice at different time points (0, 12, 36, 60, and 84 h). Staining for reticulated platelets was carried out by incubation of 5 μl of blood with 50 μl of thiazole orange (0.1 mg/ml in PBS) and 1 μl of PE-conjugated CD41 antibody for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by fixation with 1 ml of paraformaldehyde (1%) in PBS (14.Mason K.D.

Cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 300 μl of sheath fluid, and analyzed by flow cytometry. After appropriate compensation, fluorescence data were collected using four-quadrant logarithmic amplification. The number of thiazole orange-positive platelets provided an estimate of new platelet production. A platelet count was carried out using a cell counter (Beckman Coulter Multisizer 4) at different time points (0, 12, 36, 60, and 84 h). After the experiment, the mice were sacrificed with an intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (500 mg/kg). Standard statistical methods were used. Parametric methods (Student's t test) were used for evaluation, and tests were considered significant at p < 0.05 (two-tailed tests). All statistical tests were carried out using Sigma Plot version 11 statistics software. Data are presented as means ± S.D. of at least three individual experiments from different blood donors. Because sirtinol is known to inhibit multiple sirtuin isoforms, we checked for the presence of Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 in human platelets by Western blot analysis. An earlier study has already reported the expression of Sirt1 in human platelets (22.Aquilano K. Vigilanza P. Baldelli S. Pagliei B. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) reside in mitochondria: possible direct function in mitochondrial biogenesis.J. Biol.

As presented in Fig. 1, all three sirtuin isoforms were found to be expressed in human platelets, which underscored the functional relevance of these sirtuins in platelets. Sirtinol is known to possess antitumor activity and to induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines (7.Ota H. Tokunaga E. Chang K. Hikasa M. Iijima K. Eto M. Kozaki K. Akishita M. Ouchi Y. Kaneki M.

To examine the effect of sirtuin inhibitors on platelets, we studied Δψm, an indicator of intrinsic cell death, in both sirtinol- as well as EX-527-treated platelets. The lipophilic cation JC-1 was used to detect the drop in ΔΨm by flow cytometry. Either of the inhibitors evoked progressive dissipation of platelet ΔΨm with increasing concentrations (sirtinol, 50 and 100 μm; EX-527, 10 and 50 μm; Fig. 2A). Carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone-treated platelets were employed as a positive control. Similar results were observed when we substituted JC-1 with TMRM, a pharmacologically distinct mitochondrial membrane potential probe (data not shown). Phosphatidylserine redistribution from the inner to the outer leaflet of the surface membrane is an early and widespread event during apoptosis (23.Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. A receptor for phosphatidylserine-specific clearance of apoptotic cells.Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Annexin V-FITC has a strong Ca2+-dependent affinity for phosphatidylserine and, therefore, is used as a probe for the detection of apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1994330799,"The spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria worldwide presents a major health threat to human health care that results in therapy failure and increasing costs. The transfer of resistance conferring plasmids by conjugation is a major route by which resistance genes disseminate at the intra- and interspecies level. High similarities between resistance genes identified in foodborne and hospital-acquired pathogens suggest transmission of resistance conferring and transferrable mobile elements through the food chain, either as part of intact strains, or through transfer of plasmids from foodborne to human strains. To study the factors that affect the rate of plasmid transfer, the transmission of an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) plasmid from a foodborne Escherichia coli strain to the β-lactam sensitive E. coli MG1655 strain was documented as a function of simulated environmental factors. The foodborne E. coli isolate used as donor carried a CTX-M-1 harboring IncI1 plasmid that confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Cell density, energy availability and growth rate were identified as factors that affect plasmid transfer efficiency. Transfer rates were highest in the absence of the antibiotic, with almost every acceptor cell picking up the plasmid. Raising the antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) resulted in reduced transfer rates, but also selected for the plasmid carrying donor and recombinant strains. Based on the mutational pattern of transconjugant cells, a common mechanism is proposed which compensates for fitness costs due to plasmid carriage by reducing other cell functions. Reducing potential fitness costs due to maintenance and expression of the plasmid could contribute to persistence of resistance genes in the environment even without antibiotic pressure. Taken together, the results identify factors that drive the spread and persistence of resistance conferring plasmids in natural isolates and shows how these can contribute to transmission of resistance genes through the food chain."

https://openalex.org/W2170267341,"Few noninvasive methods can accurately identify esophageal varices (EVs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. We developed and validated a novel, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography-based prediction model for high-risk EVs (HEVs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis.A total of 143 patients with compensated cirrhosis between February, 2010 and February, 2013 (training set) and 148 between June, 2010 and May, 2013 (validation set) who underwent ARFI elastography and endoscopy were prospectively recruited. Independent predictors of HEVs were used to construct a prediction model.Based on multivariate analysis, we developed two new statistical models, a varices risk score and ARFI-spleen diameter-to-platelet ratio score (ASPS), the latter of which was calculated as ARFI velocity × spleen diameter/platelet count. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the varices risk score and ASPS to predict HEVs were 0.935 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.882-0.970) and 0.946 (95% CI 0.895-0.977), respectively. When ASPS, a simpler model with a higher AUROC, was applied in the validation set, acceptable diagnostic accuracy for HEVs was observed (AUROC = 0.814 [95% CI 0.743-0.885]). To detect HEVs, a negative predictive value of 98.3% was achieved at ASPS <2.83, whereas a positive predictive value of 100% was achieved at ASPS >5.28.ASPS, a novel noninvasive ARFI-based prediction model, can accurately identify HEVs in patients with compensated cirrhosis. ASPS <2.83 may safely rule out the presence of HEVs, whereas patients with ASPS >5.28 should be considered for endoscopic examinations or appropriate prophylactic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1975272578,"Peer review represents the primary mechanism used by funding agencies to allocate financial support and by journals to select manuscripts for publication, yet recent Cochrane reviews determined literature on peer review best practice is sparse. Key to improving the process are reduction of inherent vulnerability to high degree of randomness and, from an economic perspective, limiting both the substantial indirect costs related to reviewer time invested and direct administrative costs to funding agencies, publishers and research institutions. Use of additional reviewers per application may increase reliability and decision consistency, but adds to overall cost and burden. The optimal number of reviewers per application, while not known, is thought to vary with accuracy of judges or evaluation methods. Here I use bootstrapping of replicated peer review data from a Post-doctoral Fellowships competition to show that five reviewers per application represents a practical optimum which avoids large random effects evident when fewer reviewers are used, a point where additional reviewers at increasing cost provides only diminishing incremental gains in chance-corrected consistency of decision outcomes. Random effects were most evident in the relative mid-range of competitiveness. Results support aggressive high- and low-end stratification or triaging of applications for subsequent stages of review, with the proportion and set of mid-range submissions to be retained for further consideration being dependent on overall success rate."

By using luminescence resonance energy transfer with functional receptors expressed in CHO cells, we show that the cleft of the amino-terminal domain of the GluN2B subunit, which has a lower channel open probability, is on average more closed than the GluN2A subunit, which has a higher open probability. Furthermore, the GluN1 amino-terminal domain adopts a more open conformation when coassembled with GluN2A than with GluN2B. Binding of spermine, an allosteric potentiator, opens the amino-terminal domain cleft of both the GluN2B subunit and the adjacent GluN1 subunit.

These studies provide direct structural evidence that the inherent conformations of the amino-terminal domains vary based on the subunit and match the reported open probabilities for the receptor. Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, activates the three subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors: AMPA receptors, kainate receptors, and NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors mediate the slower component of excitatory synaptic signaling that underlies learning and memory formation. NMDA receptors are obligate heterotetramers typically composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, and they require both glutamate and glycine binding to activate the cation-selective pore. The GluN1 subunit can be one of eight splice variants, and the GluN2 subunit can be one of four subtypes, A to D. The splice variant and subtype composition of the receptor dictate gating kinetics and lend specificity to modulator binding. Each subunit of the receptor is organized into domains with an extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD) 2The abbreviations used are:ATDamino-terminal domainLBDligand-binding domainTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and ligand-binding domain (LBD), the transmembrane, pore-forming region, and the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain.

Spermine binding to the extracellular portion of the NMDA receptor also results in an increase in apparent glycine affinity (19Williams K. Zappia A.M. Pritchett D.B. Shen Y.M. Molinoff P.B. Sensitivity of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor to polyamines is controlled by NR2 subunits.Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar). Based on mutational studies, spermine is thought to bind to acidic residues on the lower lobes of both GluN1 and GluN2B ATDs (blue residues in Fig. 1A) (9Mony L. Zhu S. Carvalho S. Paoletti P.

Interestingly, GluN1 subunits that include exon 5, a 21-residue stretch in the ATD lower lobe containing six basic residues, are no longer sensitive to spermine modulation. This suggests the positive charges introduced by exon 5 function similarly to spermine and obviate the spermine-binding site (18Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The structural mechanism of allosteric modulation of NMDA receptors has been thought to proceed by influencing the cleft of the bi-lobed ATD. Propping open the ATD of either the GluN1 or the GluN2 subunit increases the channel open probability (2Gielen M. Siegler Retchless B. Mony L. Johnson J.W. Paoletti P. Mechanism of differential control of NMDA receptor activity by NR2 subunits.Nature. 2009; 459: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Zhu S. Stroebel D. Yao C.A. Taly A. Paoletti P. Allosteric signaling and dynamics of the clamshell-like NMDA receptor GluN1 N-terminal domain.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because spermine acts as potentiator, this mechanism suggests that spermine stabilizes an open conformation of the GluN2B ATD (9Mony L. Zhu S. Carvalho S. Paoletti P. Molecular basis of positive allosteric modulation of GluN2B NMDA receptors by polyamines.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3134-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the extent of spermine potentiation is much less when the GluN2B ATD is already braced open by a thiol-reactive MTS (methanethiosulfonate) reagent (9Mony L. Zhu S. Carvalho S. Paoletti P. Molecular basis of positive allosteric modulation of GluN2B NMDA receptors by polyamines.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3134-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These studies provide indirect evidence that spermine potentiates the receptor by opening the GluN2B cleft; however, at present there is no direct study showing and quantifying the conformational changes in the ATDs upon spermine binding. To directly investigate the role of the ATD cleft in dictating open probabilities, we have used luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) to characterize the cleft distance in GluN2B and compare it to the distance between the same sites in GluN2A (23Sirrieh R.E. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Amino-terminal domain tetramer organization and structural effects of zinc binding in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 22555-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, we measured the openness of the GluN1 ATD when assembled with GluN2A or GluN2B. Finally, LRET directly revealed and quantified spermine-induced conformational changes in both the GluN1 and GluN2B ATDs. It is important to note that these measurements are made in a near physiological state, i.e. with receptors that have minimal changes relative to the wild-type proteins and studied in CHO cells without being purified or isolated using lipids and/or detergents. The GluN1-1a splice variant, GluN2A, and GluN2B of the rat NMDA receptors in the pcDNA 3.1 plasmid were generously provided by Shigetada Nakanishi. Mutations were introduced using traditional PCR methods, and the mutation and integrity of the plasmid were verified using DNA sequencing. The numbering system used includes the signal peptide. All LRET experiments were done in Cys-free backgrounds, where non-disulfide-bonded cysteines were mutated to serine. In GluN1, Cys-22 and Cys-459 were mutated to serine, and in GluN2B, Cys-232, Cys-399, and Cys-495 were mutated to serine. The Cys-free GluN2A subunit was made by introducing the mutations C231S, C395S, and C461S as described previously (23Sirrieh R.E. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Amino-terminal domain tetramer organization and structural effects of zinc binding in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 22555-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To measure between the upper and lower lobes of the GluN2 ATD, the Cys-free GluN1 was coexpressed with GluN2B with a hexa-His tag followed by the thrombin recognition sequence (amino acids LVPRGS), and Cys-232 in GluN2B or Cys-231 in GluN2A were not mutated to serines. The acceptor fluorophore used was Ni(NTA)2Cy3. To measure between the upper and lower lobes of the GluN1 ATD, the S224C mutation was introduced, and Cys-22 was maintained as a cysteine; the acceptor fluorophore used was Alexa555. To measure between the upper lobe of GluN1 and the lower lobe of GluN2B, a GluN1 construct that was Cys-free except for Cys-22, which was maintained as a cysteine, was coexpressed with GluN2B that was Cys-free except for Cys-232, which was also maintained as a cysteine. The acceptor fluorophore used was Alexa555. Analogous measurements in GluN2A involved coexpressing the Cys-free GluN1 with Cys-22 with GluN2A that was Cys-free except for the inherent Cys-231. The acceptor fluorophores for those measurements was Alexa555. To measure between the upper lobes of the GluN1 and GluN2B ATDs, the GluN1 construct that was Cys-free except for Cys-22 was coexpressed with the Cys-free GluN2B with a His tag and the thrombin sequence inserted at residue 30 (H30 in Fig. 1B). The acceptor fluorophore used was Ni(NTA)2Cy3. The donor fluorophore for all LRET measurements was a thiol-reactive terbium chelate (Invitrogen). Measurement of the sensitized acceptor lifetime before and after thrombin cleavage allows for the direct quantification of background fluorescence (23Sirrieh R.E. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V.

CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Ham's F-12 media (Invitrogen) and passaged every 2 days. Cells were transfected when 50–80% confluent with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Four 10-cm dishes were transfected per LRET experiment. Each dish was transfected with 12 μg of DNA, at a 1:3 ratio of GluN1 to GluN2 and a 1:2 ratio of DNA to Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were maintained in DMEM without l-glutamine prior to transfection through their harvest for use in experiments to help improve expression (38Chazot P.L. Cik M. Stepenson F.A. Li M. NMDA Receptor Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 33-42Google Scholar). For donor-only measurements, two 10-cm dishes were transfected. Cells for spectroscopic experiments were scraped up and isolated via centrifugation. Cells were washed in extracellular buffer containing (in mm) the following: 150 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.3 (HCl) and labeled in extracellular buffer for 1 h at room temperature. When GluN2A was coexpressed with GluN1, 10 mm Tricine was included in the buffer for apo measurements to chelate contaminating zinc (39Paoletti P. Ascher P. Neyton J. High-affinity zinc inhibition of NMDA NR1–NR2A receptors.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5711-5725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Donor-only samples were labeled with 200 nm terbium chelate. LRET samples were labeled with 200 nm each of the donor and acceptor fluorophores. After labeling, cells were washed twice with extracellular buffer, before being suspended in extracellular buffer and used for spectroscopic experiments. Cells were probed in a cuvette-based spectroscope using a QuantaMaster model QM3-SS with Fluorescan software (Photon Technology International). Data were analyzed with Origin 8.6 software (OriginLab Corp.). All samples were excited at 337 nm. Emission was detected at 545 nm for donor-only samples. The emission was detected at 565 nm for Alexa555 or 572 nm for Ni(NTA)2Cy3. The distance between the two fluorophores was calculated using Förster Equation 1, R=R0[τDAτD−τDA]1/6 (Eq. 1)Eq. 1 where R is the distance between the fluorophores; R0 is the distance at which energy transfer is half-maximal; τD is the lifetime of the donor fluorophore in the absence of the acceptor fluorophore; and τDA is the lifetime of the sensitized acceptor emission. LRET was measured before and after protease cleavage to allow for a direct quantification of the specific signal from the NMDA receptor and subtraction of the background fluorescence as described previously (23Sirrieh R.E.

Cleavage with thrombin eliminates the LRET from the NMDA receptor by releasing a peptide fragment containing one of the fluorophores, so any resulting fluorescence after cleavage is due to labeling of cysteines on the surface of the CHO cells. Five units of high activity bovine thrombin (Calbiochem) were added to cleave the receptors at the introduced thrombin recognition sequence as described above. n values given in Table 1 represent the number of biological repeats. Each sample (n) was scanned a minimum of three times, and each scan was an average of 99 sweeps. The LRET lifetimes have been normalized so that an easy comparison can be made between them. The error in the LRET lifetime (Table 1) is the S.E., and the error in the distances was calculated by propagating the errors in the lifetimes using the Error Propagation Calculator developed by Thomas Huber in the Physics Department of Gustavus Adolphus College.TABLE 1Lifetimes and distances from LRET measurements Open table in a new tab CHO cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with wild-type or mutant GluN1, GluN2B, and enhanced GFP at a microgram ratio of 1.5:4.5:1, respectively, with 7 μg of total DNA per 10 ml of medium. After 10–12 h of incubation with the transfection reagents, cells were re-plated at low density onto Petri dishes coated with poly-d-lysine. 300 μm d,l-APV and 30 μm DCKA were present in the medium during and after transfection. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed 24–48 h after transfection using borosilicate glass pipettes with resistance of 3–5 megohms, coated with dental wax, fire-polished, and filled with the following solution (in mm): 135 CsF, 33 CsOH, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 11 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The external solution was as follows (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. pH 7.4 was used to match the conditions of LRET measurements. Solutions were locally applied to isolated cells using a solenoid valve system (VC-6; Warner Instruments) and modified triple barrel tubing as described previously (30Tang C.M. Rapid solution application methods.Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2001: 6.9.1-6.9.17Google Scholar). Glycine (100 μm) was present continuously; glutamate (100 μm) was applied for 12 s every 30 s, and saturating spermine (5 mm) was applied for 3 s during the glutamate pulse. Cells were held at −60 mV prior to ligand application, ramped up to +50 mV several seconds before glutamate application, maintained at this voltage during the application, and then ramped down to −60 mV and held between sweeps. All recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), acquired at 10 kHz using pCLAMP10 software (Molecular Devices) and filtered on line at 3 kHz (8-pole Bessel; Frequency Devices). All experiments were performed at room temperature. To measure the conformations of GluN2A and GluN2B ATDs in intact functional receptors, we combined specific labeling sites and enzymatic cleavage positions to isolate specific signals from within an ATD (Fig. 1B) (23Sirrieh R.E.

First, the apo or resting conformation of the GluN2B ATD was probed by measuring between His-30 and Cys-232 in GluN2B (Figs. 1B and 2A). The LRET lifetime was determined by measuring the lifetime of sensitized acceptor emission upon donor excitation. The LRET lifetime in the apo-state after background fluorescence subtraction could be well represented by a single exponential with a lifetime of 252 ± 12 μs (Fig. 2A), which corresponds to a distance of 48.8 ± 0.4 Å between the two fluorophores (Table 1). The single lifetime suggests that the measurements correspond to distances within the subunit, as expected based on the crystal structures (27Karakas E. Furukawa H. Crystal structure of a heterotetrameric NMDA receptor ion channel.Science. 2014; 344: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 28Lee C.H. Lü W. Michel J.C. Goehring A. Du J. Song X. Gouaux E. NMDA receptor structures reveal subunit arrangement and pore architecture.Nature. 2014; 511: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), where there is no cross-talk across the subunits for these sites. Importantly, the same positions and fluorophores were also used to measure across the GluN2A ATD cleft (23Sirrieh R.E. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Amino-terminal domain tetramer organization and structural effects of zinc binding in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 22555-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The LRET lifetime measured between these sites in GluN2A was 312 ± 5 μs (Fig. 2A), corresponding to a distance of 51.2 ± 0.1 Å (23Sirrieh R.E. MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Amino-terminal domain tetramer organization and structural effects of zinc binding in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 22555-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These measurements show that the GluN2B cleft is inherently in a more closed conformation than the GluN2A cleft in the apo-receptor. Having identified intrinsic differences in GluN2A compared with GluN2B, we performed the same experiment with GluN1. LRET measurements were made between Cys-22 and S224C in GluN1 either when coexpressed with GluN2A or GluN2B. The sensitized emission of the acceptor again yielded a single exponential decay regardless of the coexpressed GluN2 subunit. The measurement of the GluN1 ATD cleft in the presence of GluN2A yielded an LRET lifetime of 324 ± 13 μs (Fig. 2B), a distance of 51.2 ± 0.3 Å. Repeating this experiment revealed, surprisingly, that the distance across the GluN1 cleft is decreased when placed in a GluN1/GluN2B heteromer. Specifically, the LRET lifetime of the apo-GluN1 ATD is 275 ± 4 μs, a distance of 49.2 ± 0.1 Å (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Importantly, these measurements were made on the same instrument using identical GluN1 plasmids, fluorophores, and solutions. There is clearly a difference in the conformation adopted by the GluN1 subunit that is dependent on the GluN2 subunit completing the receptor. To determine the effect of spermine, the LRET lifetimes were measured across the GluN2B cleft (again between His-30 and Cys-232, Fig. 1B) before and after the addition of the GluN2B-specific potentiator spermine. The LRET lifetime of the equilibrium state increases from 252 ± 12 to 369 ± 34 μs (Fig. 3A), corresponding to a distance of 52.8 ± 0.8 Å, an increase of 4 Å (Table 1). The increase in the d"

We successfully demonstrated the established ΦC31-RMCE method in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which is the first report of RMCE in mosquitoes. A new variant of this RMCE system, called iRMCE, combines the ΦC31-att integration system and Cre or FLP-mediated excision to remove extraneous sequences introduced as part of the site-specific integration process. Complete iRMCE was achieved in two important insect pests, Aedes aegypti and the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, demonstrating the transferability of the system across a wide phylogenetic range of insect pests."
https://openalex.org/W2081688199,"Background The UP4FUN intervention is a family-involved school-based intervention aiming at reducing and breaking up sitting time at home (with special emphasis on screen time), and breaking up sitting time in school among 10–12 year olds in Europe. The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate its short term effects. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 3147 pupils from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Norway participated in a school-randomized controlled trial. The intervention included 1–2 school lessons per week for a period of six weeks, along with assignments for the children and their parents. Screen time and breaking up sitting time were registered by self-report and total sedentary time and breaking up sitting time by accelerometry. The effect of the intervention on these behaviors was evaluated by multilevel regression analyses. All analyses were adjusted for baseline values and gender. Significance level was p≤0.01. No significant intervention effects were observed, neither for self-reported TV/DVD or computer/game console time, nor for accelerometer-assessed total sedentary time and number of breaks in sitting time. The intervention group, however, reported more positive attitudes towards (β = 0.25 (95% CI 0.11, 0.38)) and preferences/liking for (β = 0.20 (95% CI 0.08, 0.32)) breaking up sitting time than the control group. Conclusions/Significance No significant intervention effect on self-reported screen time or accelerometer-assessed sedentary time or breaks in sitting time was observed, but positive effects on beliefs regarding breaking up sitting time were found in favor of the intervention group. Overall, these results do not warrant wider dissemination of the present UP4FUN intervention. Trial Registration International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry ISRCTN34562078"
https://openalex.org/W2029520613,"We have previously shown a functional interaction between human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 and E7 oncoproteins and cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) in lung cells suggesting cooperation during carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms of such interaction, however, remain to be elucidated. Here we first present evidence showing that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) has the ability to activate the HPV-16 p97 promoter by acting on the long control region (LCR) in lung epithelial cells. Interestingly, we observed that CSC-induced p97 promoter activation occurs in a dose-dependent manner in both tumor A-549 (lung adenocarcinoma), H-2170 (bronchial carcinoma), SiHa or Hela (cervical carcinoma) cells but not in non-tumor BEAS-2B (bronchial) or NL-20 (alveolar) lung cells unless they ectopically expressed the HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes. In addition, we also observed a significant increase of primary DNA damage in tumor and non-tumor CSC-treated lung cells expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes suggesting a cooperative effect in this process, even though the contribution of E7 was significantly higher. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that tobacco smoke is able to induce the activation of the HPV-16 p97 promoter in cooperation with HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncogenes that, in turn, sensitize lung cells to tobacco smoke-induced DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2092944299,"Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a major cellular phospholipid that can be made by four separate pathways, one of which resides in the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial enzyme that generates PE is phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p). The pool of PE produced by Psd1p, which cannot be compensated for by the other cellular PE metabolic pathways, is important for numerous mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics and morphology, and is essential for murine development. To become catalytically active, Psd1p undergoes an autocatalytic processing step involving a conserved LGST motif that separates the enzyme into α and β subunits that remain non-covalently attached and are anchored to the inner membrane by virtue of the membrane-embedded β subunit. It was speculated that Psd1p autocatalysis requires a mitochondrial-specific factor and that for Psd1p to function in vivo, it had to be embedded with the correct topology in the mitochondrial inner membrane. However, the identity of the mitochondrial factor required for Psd1p autocatalysis has not been identified. With the goal of defining molecular requirements for Psd1p autocatalysis, we demonstrate that: 1) despite the conservation of the LGST motif from bacteria to humans, only the serine residue is absolutely required for Psd1p autocatalysis and function; 2) yeast Psd1p does not require its substrate phosphatidylserine for autocatalysis; and 3) contrary to a prior report, yeast Psd1p autocatalysis does not require mitochondrial-specific phospholipids, proteins, or co-factors, because Psd1p re-directed to the secretory pathway undergoes autocatalysis normally and is fully functional in vivo. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a major cellular phospholipid that can be made by four separate pathways, one of which resides in the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial enzyme that generates PE is phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p).

To become catalytically active, Psd1p undergoes an autocatalytic processing step involving a conserved LGST motif that separates the enzyme into α and β subunits that remain non-covalently attached and are anchored to the inner membrane by virtue of the membrane-embedded β subunit. It was speculated that Psd1p autocatalysis requires a mitochondrial-specific factor and that for Psd1p to function in vivo, it had to be embedded with the correct topology in the mitochondrial inner membrane. However, the identity of the mitochondrial factor required for Psd1p autocatalysis has not been identified. With the goal of defining molecular requirements for Psd1p autocatalysis, we demonstrate that: 1) despite the conservation of the LGST motif from bacteria to humans, only the serine residue is absolutely required for Psd1p autocatalysis and function; 2) yeast Psd1p does not require its substrate phosphatidylserine for autocatalysis; and 3) contrary to a prior report, yeast Psd1p autocatalysis does not require mitochondrial-specific phospholipids, proteins, or co-factors, because Psd1p re-directed to the secretory pathway undergoes autocatalysis normally and is fully functional in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2044659807,"Despite increasing knowledge about the effects of habitat loss on pollinators in natural landscapes, information is very limited regarding the underlying mechanisms of forest fragmentation affecting plant-pollinator interactions in such landscapes. Here, we used a network approach to describe the effects of forest fragmentation on the patterns of interactions involving the understory dominant palm Astrocaryum mexicanum (Arecaceae) and its floral visitors (including both effective and non-effective pollinators) at the individual level in a Mexican tropical rainforest landscape. Specifically, we asked: (i) Does fragment size affect the structure of individual-based plant-pollinator networks? (ii) Does the core of highly interacting visitor species change along the fragmentation size gradient? (iii) Does forest fragment size influence the abundance of effective pollinators of A. mexicanum? We found that fragment size did not affect the topological structure of the individual-based palm-pollinator network. Furthermore, while the composition of peripheral non-effective pollinators changed depending on fragment size, effective core generalist species of pollinators remained stable. We also observed that both abundance and variance of effective pollinators of male and female flowers of A. mexicanum increased with forest fragment size. These findings indicate that the presence of effective pollinators in the core of all forest fragments could keep the network structure stable along the gradient of forest fragmentation. In addition, pollination of A. mexicanum could be more effective in larger fragments, since the greater abundance of pollinators in these fragments may increase the amount of pollen and diversity of pollen donors between flowers of individual plants. Given the prevalence of fragmentation in tropical ecosystems, our results indicate that the current patterns of land use will have consequences on the underlying mechanisms of pollination in remnant forests."
https://openalex.org/W2082318502,"The high morbidity and mortality of patients with esophageal (E) and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancers, warrants new pre-clinical models for drug testing. The utility of primary tumor xenografts (PTXGs) as pre-clinical models was assessed. Clinicopathological, immunohistochemical markers (p53, p16, Ki-67, Her-2/neu and EGFR), and global mRNA abundance profiles were evaluated to determine selection biases of samples implanted or engrafted, compared with the underlying population. Nine primary E/GEJ adenocarcinoma xenograft lines were further characterized for the spectrum and stability of gene/protein expression over passages. Seven primary esophageal adenocarcinoma xenograft lines were treated with individual or combination chemotherapy. Tumors that were implanted (n=55) in NOD/SCID mice had features suggestive of more aggressive biology than tumors that were never implanted (n=32). Of those implanted, 21/55 engrafted; engraftment was associated with poorly differentiated tumors (p=0.04) and older patients (p=0.01). Expression of immunohistochemical markers were similar between patient sample and corresponding xenograft. mRNA differences observed between patient tumors and first passage xenografts were largely due to loss of human stroma in xenografts. mRNA patterns of early vs late passage xenografts and of small vs large tumors of the same passage were similar. Complete resistance was present in 2/7 xenografts while the remaining tumors showed varying degrees of sensitivity, that remained constant across passages. Because of their ability to recapitulate primary tumor characteristics during engraftment and across serial passaging, PTXGs can be useful clinical systems for assessment of drug sensitivity of human E/GEJ cancers."

This study was conducted to examine the relationships between problem-solving skills appraisal, hardiness, and suicidal ideation among university students. In addition, this study was conducted to examine problem-solving skills appraisal (including the three components of problem-solving confidence, approach-avoidance style, and personal control of emotion) as a potential mediator between hardiness and suicidal ideation. Methods The participants consisted of 500 undergraduate students from Malaysian public universities. Results Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) estimated that undergraduate students with lower hardiness, poor problem-solving confidence, external personal control of emotion, and avoiding style was associated with higher suicidal ideation. Problem-solving skills appraisal (including the three components of problem-solving confidence, approach-avoidance style, and personal control of emotion) partially mediated the relationship between hardiness and suicidal ideation. Conclusion These findings underline the importance of studying mediating processes that explain how hardiness affects suicidal ideation."
https://openalex.org/W1972191527,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of the severe tropical disease melioidosis, which commonly presents as sepsis. The B. pseudomallei K96243 genome encodes eleven predicted autotransporters, a diverse family of secreted and outer membrane proteins often associated with virulence. In a systematic study of these autotransporters, we constructed insertion mutants in each gene predicted to encode an autotransporter and assessed them for three pathogenesis-associated phenotypes: virulence in the BALB/c intra-peritoneal mouse melioidosis model, net intracellular replication in J774.2 murine macrophage-like cells and survival in 45% (v/v) normal human serum. From the complete repertoire of eleven autotransporter mutants, we identified eight mutants which exhibited an increase in median lethal dose of 1 to 2-log10 compared to the isogenic parent strain (bcaA, boaA, boaB, bpaA, bpaC, bpaE, bpaF and bimA). Four mutants, all demonstrating attenuation for virulence, exhibited reduced net intracellular replication in J774.2 macrophage-like cells (bimA, boaB, bpaC and bpaE). A single mutant (bpaC) was identified that exhibited significantly reduced serum survival compared to wild-type. The bpaC mutant, which demonstrated attenuation for virulence and net intracellular replication, was sensitive to complement-mediated killing via the classical and/or lectin pathway. Serum resistance was rescued by in trans complementation. Subsequently, we expressed recombinant proteins of the passenger domain of four predicted autotransporters representing each of the phenotypic groups identified: those attenuated for virulence (BcaA), those attenuated for virulence and net intracellular replication (BpaE), the BpaC mutant with defects in virulence, net intracellular replication and serum resistance and those displaying wild-type phenotypes (BatA). Only BcaA and BpaE elicited a strong IFN-γ response in a restimulation assay using whole blood from seropositive donors and were recognised by seropositive human sera from the endemic area. To conclude, several predicted autotransporters contribute to B. pseudomallei virulence and BpaC may do so by conferring resistance against complement-mediated killing."
https://openalex.org/W2033150935,"So far six susceptibility loci for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To identify additional RCC common risk loci, we performed a meta-analysis of published GWAS (totalling 2,215 cases and 8,566 controls of Western-European background) with imputation using 1000 Genomes Project and UK10K Project data as reference panels and followed up the most significant association signals [22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3 indels in eight genomic regions] in 383 cases and 2,189 controls from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A combined analysis identified a promising susceptibility locus mapping to 1q24.1 marked by the imputed SNP rs3845536 (Pcombined =2.30x10-8). Specifically, the signal maps to intron 4 of the ALDH9A1 gene (aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family, member A1). We further evaluated this potential signal in 2,461 cases and 5,081 controls from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GWAS of RCC cases and controls from multiple European regions. In contrast to earlier findings no association was shown in the IARC series (P=0.94; Pcombined =2.73x10-5). While variation at 1q24.1 represents a potential risk locus for RCC, future replication analyses are required to substantiate our observation."
https://openalex.org/W2057012899,"Objective Diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at higher risk of poor outcome than are non-diabetic patients with ACS. Few studies have focused on sex-related ACS incidence, ACS-related mortality or risk factors to affects sex specific ACS in Chinese with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Based on a hospital-based cohort of Chinese patients with T2DM, we aimed to investigate whether there was sex difference in ACS or ACS-related mortality or risk factors of ACS. Methods Totally 2,135 Hong Kong Chinese with T2DM were recruited during 1994-1996 and followed up until August 2012. We systematically analyzed sex-related ACS incidence and ACS-related mortality and risk factors with χ2-squared test, descriptive statistics and survival analysis. Results Regular follow-up was completed in 2,105 subjects (98.6%), with a median period of 14.53 years. The occurrence of ACS was recorded among 414 patients (19.7%) and ACS-related death among 104 patients (4.9%). ACS incidences increased with age in both men and women, and men had a higher prevalence of ACS than women across different age categories and different follow-up periods (log rank χ2=20.32, P<0.001). The transition of ACS incidences from slow to rapid increase were about 5 years earlier in men (at 51-55 years) than in women (55-60 years). Among ACS patients, cumulative ACS-related mortalities was similar between men and women (log rank χ2=0.063, P=0.802). Besides age and albuminuria, different profiles of risk factors accounted for the occurrence of ACS between men and women. Conclusions Our findings demonstrated sex differences in ACS incidence and risk factors, but not in ACS-related mortality in Chinese patients withT2DM. These findings suggest that screening and prevention campaigns should be optimized for men and women, which may help to identify diabetic patients at higher risk of coronary heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W1963706069,"Therapeutic angiogenesis may be applied in medical conditions to promote stimulation of angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a multistep process, which includes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which is mediated by various angiogenic polypeptides. Thus, studies that elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved in these processes are necessary to develop novel therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the in vitro effects of the pro-angiogenic factors, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and/or chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), on endothelial cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that IGF-1 and CCL2 treatment did not interfere with IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression, but CCL2 treatment increased CCL2 receptor (CCR2) expression. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the IGF-1/CCL2 combination induced a greater increase in fibronectin deposition, but the treatments did not alter the expression of the fibronectin receptors, CD49e and CD44. The interaction of fibronectin with cytokines demonstrated that IGF-1/CCL2 promoted changes in intermediate F-actin remodeling that may result in increased endothelial cell adhesion and cell migration mediated by fibronectin. Furthermore, IGF-1/CCL2 stimulated endothelial cells, grown on fibronectin, to form capillary-like structures and intercellular lumina with greater luminal area. These data suggest that IGF-1/CCL2 combination and a fibronectin matrix may contribute to the angiogenesis process to stimulate adhesion, migration, and tube formation by endothelial cells as a result of F-actin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2086061994,"Sepsid flies (Diptera: Sepsidae) are important model insects for sexual selection research. In order to develop mitochondrial (mt) genome data for this significant group, we sequenced the first complete mt genome of the sepsid fly Nemopoda mamaevi Ozerov, 1997. The circular 15,878 bp mt genome is typical of Diptera, containing all 37 genes usually present in bilaterian animals. We discovered inaccurate annotations of fly mt genomes previously deposited on GenBank and thus re-annotated all published mt genomes of Cyclorrhapha. These re-annotations were based on comparative analysis of homologous genes, and provide a statistical analysis of start and stop codon positions. We further detected two 18 bp of conserved intergenic sequences from tRNAGlu-tRNAPhe and ND1-tRNASer(UCN) across Cyclorrhapha, which are the mtTERM binding site motifs. Additionally, we compared automated annotation software MITOS with hand annotation method. Phylogenetic trees based on the mt genome data from Cyclorrhapha were inferred by Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, strongly supported a close relationship between Sepsidae and the Tephritoidea."
https://openalex.org/W2030457723,"Plant density was varied with P, Ca, Mg, and KNO3 in a multifactor experiment to improve Curcuma longa L. micropropagation, biomass and microrhizome development in fed-batch liquid culture. The experiment had two paired D-optimal designs, testing sucrose fed-batch and nutrient sucrose fed-batch techniques. When sucrose became depleted, volume was restored to 5% m/v sucrose in 200 ml of modified liquid MS medium by adding sucrose solutions. Similarly, nutrient sucrose fed-batch was restored to set points with double concentration of treatments’ macronutrient and MS micronutrient solutions, along with sucrose solutions. Changes in the amounts of water and sucrose supplementations were driven by the interaction of P and KNO3 concentrations. Increasing P from 1.25 to 6.25 mM increased both multiplication and biomass. The multiplication ratio was greatest in the nutrient sucrose fed-batch technique with the highest level of P, 6 buds/vessel, and the lowest level of Ca and KNO3. The highest density (18 buds/vessel) produced the highest fresh biomass at the highest concentrations of KNO3 and P with nutrient sucrose fed-batch, and moderate Ca and Mg concentrations. However, maximal rhizome dry biomass required highest P, sucrose fed-batch, and a moderate plant density. Different media formulations and fed-batch techniques were identified to maximize the propagation and storage organ responses. A single experimental design was used to optimize these dual purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2059691388,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are ubiquitously located on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrices. The negatively charged heparan sulfate chains interact with a multitude of different proteins, thereby influencing a variety of cellular and developmental processes, for example cell adhesion, migration, tissue morphogenesis, and differentiation. The human exostosin (EXT) family of genes contains five members: the heparan sulfate polymerizing enzymes, EXT1 and EXT2, and three EXT-like genes, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3. EXTL2 has been ascribed activities related to the initiation and termination of heparan sulfate chains. Here we further investigated the role of EXTL2 in heparan sulfate chain elongation by gene silencing and overexpression strategies. We found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of EXTL2 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells resulted in increased chain length, whereas overexpression of EXTL2 in the same cell line had little or no effect on heparan sulfate chain length. To study in more detail the role of EXTL2 in heparan sulfate chain elongation, we tested the ability of the overexpressed protein to catalyze the in vitro incorporation of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine to oligosaccharide acceptors resembling unmodified heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate precursor molecules. Analysis of the generated products revealed that recombinant EXTL2 showed weak ability to transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to heparan sulfate precursor molecules but also, that EXTL2 exhibited much stronger in vitro N-acetylglucosamine-transferase activity related to elongation of heparan sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1972321668,"Redox imbalance is believed to contribute to the development and progression of several neurodegenerative disorders. Our aim was to develop an animal model that exhibits neuron-specific oxidative stress in the CNS to study the consequences and eventually find clues regarding the pathomechanisms of oxidative insults in neuronal homeostasis. We therefore generated a novel neuron-specific superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-deficient mouse by deleting exon 3 of the SOD2 gene using CamKIIα promoter-driven Cre expression. These neuron-specific SOD2 knockout (SOD2(nko)) mice, although born at normal frequencies, died at the age of 4 weeks with critical growth retardation, severe energy failure, and several neurologic phenotypes. In addition, SOD2(nko) mice exhibited severe neuronal alterations such as reactive astrogliosis, neuronal cell cycle inhibition, and induction of apoptosis. JNK activation and stabilization of p53, as a result of reactive oxygen species accumulation, are most likely the inducers of neuronal apoptosis in SOD2(nko) mice. It is remarkable that hypothalamic regulation of glucose metabolism was affected, which in turn induced necrotic brain lesions in SOD2(nko) mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that exclusive deficiency of SOD2 in neurons results in an impaired central regulation of energy homeostasis that leads to persistent hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia-related neuropathology, and an early lethality of the mutant mice."
https://openalex.org/W1976034252,"Advances in molecular biology, microfluidics, and laboratory automation continue to expand the accessibility and applicability of these methods beyond the confines of conventional, centralized laboratory facilities and into point of use roles in clinical, military, forensic, and field-deployed applications. As a result, there is a growing need to adapt the unit operations of molecular biology (e.g., aliquoting, centrifuging, mixing, and thermal cycling) to compact, portable, low-power, and automation-ready formats. Here we present one such adaptation, the rotary zone thermal cycler (RZTC), a novel wheel-based device capable of cycling up to four different fixed-temperature blocks into contact with a stationary 4-microliter capillary-bound sample to realize 1-3 second transitions with steady state heater power of less than 10 W. We demonstrate the utility of the RZTC for DNA amplification as part of a highly integrated rotary zone PCR (rzPCR) system that uses low-volume valves and syringe-based fluid handling to automate sample loading and unloading, thermal cycling, and between-run cleaning functionalities in a compact, modular form factor. In addition to characterizing the performance of the RZTC and the efficacy of different online cleaning protocols, we present preliminary results for rapid single-plex PCR, multiplex short tandem repeat (STR) amplification, and second strand cDNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048501577,"Multivalent interactions occur frequently in nature, where they mediate high-affinity interactions between cells, proteins, or molecules. Here, we report on a method to generate multivalent aptamers (Multi-Aptamers) that target L-selectin function using rolling circle amplification (RCA). We find that the L-selectin Multi-Aptamers have increased affinity compared to the monovalent aptamer, are specific to L-selectin, and are capable of inhibiting interactions with endogenous ligands. In addition, the Multi-Aptamers efficiently inhibit L-selectin mediated dynamic adhesion in vitro and homing to secondary lymphoid tissues in vivo. Importantly, our method of generating multivalent materials using RCA avoids many of the challenges associated with current multivalent materials in that the Multi-Aptamers are high affinity, easily produced and modified, and biocompatible. We anticipate that the Multi-Aptamers can serve as a platform technology to modulate diverse cellular processes."

The individual behavior and decision-making of consumer agents is determined by complex psychological dynamics that include their own assessment of present and future economic conditions as well as those of others, potentially leading to feedback loops that affect the macroscopic state of the economic system. We propose that the large-scale interactions of a nation's citizens with its online resources can reveal the complex dynamics of their collective psychology, including their assessment of future system states. Here we introduce a behavioral index of Chinese Consumer Confidence (C3I) that computationally relates large-scale online search behavior recorded by Google Trends data to the macroscopic variable of consumer confidence. Our results indicate that such computational indices may reveal the components and complex dynamics of consumer psychology as a collective socio-economic phenomenon, potentially leading to improved and more refined economic forecasting."
https://openalex.org/W2086551122,"In birds, different types of predators may target adults or offspring differentially and at different times of the reproductive cycle. Hence they may also differentially influence incubation behaviour and thus embryonic development and offspring phenotype. This is poorly understood, and we therefore performed a study to assess the effects of the presence of either a nest predator or a predator targeting adults and offspring after fledging on female incubation behaviour in great tits (Parus major), and the subsequent effects on offspring morphological traits. We manipulated perceived predation risk during incubation using taxidermic models of two predators: the short-tailed weasel posing a risk to incubating females and nestlings, and the sparrowhawk posing a risk to adults and offspring after fledging. To disentangle treatment effects induced during incubation from potential carry-over effects of parental behaviour after hatching, we cross-fostered whole broods from manipulated nests with broods from unmanipulated nests. Both predator treatments lead to a reduced on- and off-bout frequency, to a slower decline in on-bout temperature as incubation advanced and showed a negative effect on nestling body mass gain. At the current state of knowledge on predator-induced variation in incubation patterns alternative hypotheses are feasible, and the findings of this study will be useful for guiding future research."

The software reports multiple hits per alignment. The added value of the new SW implementation is demonstrated with two test cases: (1) tag recovery in next generation sequence data and (2) isotype assignment within an immunoglobulin 454 sequence data set. Both cases show the usability and versatility of the new parallel Smith-Waterman implementation."

https://openalex.org/W2071713924,"Green and white sturgeon are species of high conservational and economic interest, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD) for which significant climate change-derived alterations in salinity and nutritional patterns are forecasted. Although there is paucity of information, it is critical to test the network of biological responses underlying the capacity of animals to tolerate current environmental changes. Through nutrition and salinity challenges, climate change will likely have more physiological effect on young sturgeon stages, which in turn may affect growth performance. In this study, the two species were challenged in a multiple-factor experimental setting, first to levels of feeding rate, and then to salinity levels for different time periods. Data analysis included generalized additive models to select predictors of growth performance (measured by condition factor) among the environmental stressors considered and a suite of physiological variables. Using structural equation modeling, a path diagram is proposed to quantify the main linkages among nutrition status, salinity, osmoregulation variables, and growth performances. Three major trends were anticipated for the growth performance of green and white sturgeon in the juvenile stage in the SFBD: (i) a decrease in prey abundance will be highly detrimental for the growth of both species; (ii) an acute increase in salinity within the limits studied can be tolerated by both species but possibly the energy spent in osmoregulation may affect green sturgeon growth within the time window assessed; (iii) the mechanism of synergistic effects of nutrition and salinity changes will be more complex in green sturgeon, with condition factor responding nonlinearly to interactions of salinity and nutrition status or time of salinity exposure. Green sturgeon merits special scientific attention and conservation effort to offset the effects of feed restriction and salinity as key environmental stressors in the SFBD."

Using Item Response Theory (IRT) methodology, we assess the performance of a test of receptive vocabulary, the U.S.-validated Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition (PPVT-III), when translated, adapted, and administered to children 3 to 10 years of age in Madagascar (N = 1372), in the local language (Malagasy). Though Malagasy is considered a single language, there are numerous dialects spoken in Madagascar. Our findings were that test scores were positively correlated with age and indicators of socio-economic status. However, over half (57/96) of items evidenced unexpected response variation and/or bias by local dialect spoken. We also encountered measurement error and reduced differentiation among person abilities when we used the publishers' recommended stopping rules, largely because we lost the original item ordering by difficulty when we translated test items into Malagasy. Our results suggest that bias and testing inefficiency introduced from the translation of the PPVT can be significantly reduced with the use of methods based on IRT at both the pre-testing and analysis stages. We explore and discuss implications for cross-cultural comparisons of internationally recognized tests, such as the PPVT."
https://openalex.org/W1990007117,"Background Smoking among youths is a worldwide problem, particularly in China. Many endogenous and environmental factors influence smokers’ intentions to smoke; therefore, a comprehensive model is needed to understand the significance and relationship of predictors. This study aimed to develop a prediction model based on problem-behavior theory (PBT) to interpret intentions to smoke among Chinese youths. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 26,675 adolescents from junior, senior, and vocational high schools in Shanghai, China. Data on smoking status, smoking knowledge, attitude toward smoking, parents’ and peers’ smoking, and media exposure to smoking were collected from students. A structural equation model was used to assess the developed prediction model. Results The experimental smoking rate and current smoking rate among the students were 11.0% and 3%, respectively. Our constructed model showed an acceptable fit to the data (comparative fit index = 0.987, root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.034). Intention to smoke was predicted by perceived environment (β = 0.455, P < 0.001) system consisting of peer smoking (β = 0.599, P < 0.001), parent smoking (β = 0.152, P < 0.001), and media exposure to smoking (β = 0.226, P < 0.001), and behavior system (β = 0.487, P < 0.001) consisting of tobacco experimentation (β = 0.663, P < 0.001) and current smoking (β = 0.755, P < 0.001). Smoking intention was irrelevant for personality system in students (β = -0.113, P>0.05) which consisted of acceptance of tobacco use (β = 0.668, P < 0.001) and academic performance (β = 0.171, P < 0.001). Conclusion The PBT-based model we developed provides a good understanding of the predictors of intentions to smoke and it suggests future interventions among youths should focus on components in perceived environment and behavior systems, and take into account the moderating effects of personality system."

The channel has been implicated in environmental thermosensation, hyperalgesia in inflamed tissues, skin sensitization, and hair growth. Although transient receptor potential (TRP) channel research has vastly increased our understanding of the physiological mechanisms of nociception and thermosensation, the molecular mechanics of these ion channels are still largely elusive. In order to better comprehend the functional properties and the mechanism of action in TRP channels, high-resolution three-dimensional structures are indispensable, because they will yield the necessary insights into architectural intimacies at the atomic level. However, structural studies of membrane proteins are currently hampered by difficulties in protein purification and in establishing suitable crystallization conditions. In this report, we present a novel protocol for the purification of membrane proteins, which takes advantage of a C-terminal GFP fusion. Using this protocol, we purified human TRPV3. We show that the purified protein is a fully functional ion channel with properties akin to the native channel using planar patch clamp on reconstituted channels and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. Using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, we reveal clear distinctions in the molecular interaction of different ligands with the channel. Altogether, this study provides powerful tools to broaden our understanding of ligand interaction with TRPV channels, and the availability of purified human TRPV3 opens up perspectives for further structural and functional studies."

Therefore, we used hereditary hypertriaclyglycerolemic (HHTg) rats as a unique model for studying the effect of spontaneous physical activity [voluntary running (VR)] on metabolic syndrome-related disorders, such as dyslipidemia, in non-obese subjects. Adult HHTg males were fed standard (CD) or high-sucrose (HSD) diets ad libitum for four weeks. Within both dietary groups, some of the rats had free access to a running wheel (CD+VR, HSD+VR), whereas the controls (CD, HSD) had no possibility of extra physical activity. At the end of the four weeks, we measured the effects of VR on various metabolic syndrome-associated parameters: (i) biochemical parameters, (ii) the content and composition of triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerols (DAG), ceramides and membrane phospholipids, and (iii) substrate utilization in brown adipose tissue. In both dietary groups, VR led to various positive effects: reduced epididymal and perirenal fat depots; increased epididymal adipose tissue lipolysis; decreased amounts of serum TAG, non-esterified fatty acids and insulin; a higher insulin sensitivity index. While tissue ceramide content was not affected, decreased TAG accumulation resulted in reduced and modified liver, heart and skeletal muscle DAG. VR also had a beneficial effect on muscle membrane phospholipid composition. In addition, compared with the CD group, the CD+VR rats exhibited increased fatty acid oxidation and protein content in brown adipose tissue. Our results confirm that physical activity in a non-obese model of severe dyslipidemia has many beneficial effects and can even counteract the negative effects of sucrose consumption. Furthermore, they suggest that the mechanism by which these effects are modulated involves a combination of several positive changes in lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1996449038,"Studies using pharmacological and genetic approaches have shown that increased activity/expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Despite the importance of NHE1 in cardiac hypertrophy, severe cerebrovascular side effects were associated with the use of NHE1 inhibitors when administered to patients with myocardial infarctions. p90 ribosomal S6 Kinase (RSK), a downstream regulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, has also been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that RSK plays a role in the NHE1 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophic response. Infection of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts with the active form of the NHE1 adenovirus induced hypertrophy and was associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of RSK (P<0.05). Parameters of hypertrophy such as cell area, protein content and atrial natriuretic mRNA expression were significantly reduced in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts infected with active NHE1 in the presence of dominant negative RSK (DN-RSK) (P<0.05). These results confirm that NHE1 lies upstream of RSK. Increased phosphorylation and activation of GATA4 at Ser261 was correlated with increased RSK phosphorylation. This increase was reversed upon inhibition of RSK or NHE1. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the NHE1 mediated hypertrophy is accounted for by increased activation and phosphorylation of RSK, which subsequently increased the phosphorylation of GATA4; eventually activating fetal gene transcriptional machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2006303685,"For consumers today, the perceived ethicality of a food’s production method can be as important a purchasing consideration as its price. Still, few studies have examined how, neurofunctionally, consumers are making ethical, food-related decisions. We examined how consumers’ ethical concern about a food’s production method may relate to how, neurofunctionally, they make decisions whether to purchase that food. Forty-six participants completed a measure of the extent to which they took ethical concern into consideration when making food-related decisions. They then underwent a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing a food-related decision-making (FRDM) task. During this task, they made 56 decisions whether to purchase a food based on either its price (i.e., high or low, the “price condition”) or production method (i.e., with or without the use of cages, the “production method condition”), but not both. For 23 randomly selected participants, we performed an exploratory, whole-brain correlation between ethical concern and differential neurofunctional activity in the price and production method conditions. Ethical concern correlated negatively and significantly with differential neurofunctional activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). For the remaining 23 participants, we performed a confirmatory, region-of-interest (ROI) correlation between the same variables, using an 8-mm3 volume situated in the left dlPFC. Again, the variables correlated negatively and significantly. This suggests, when making ethical, food-related decisions, the more consumers take ethical concern into consideration, the less they may rely on neurofunctional activity in the left dlPFC, possibly because making these decisions is more routine for them, and therefore a more perfunctory process requiring fewer cognitive resources."
https://openalex.org/W2021571333,"The phytocystatins regulate various physiological processes in plants, including responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, mainly because they act as inhibitors of cysteine proteases. In this study, we have analyzed four cystatins from Theobroma cacao L. previously identified in ESTs libraries of the interaction with the fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa and named TcCYS1, TcCYS2, TcCYS3 and TcCYS4. The recombinant cystatins were purified and subjected to the heat treatment, at different temperatures, and their thermostabilities were monitored using their ability to inhibit papain protease. TcCYS1 was sensitive to temperatures above 50°C, while TcCYS2, TcCYS3, and TcCYS4 were thermostable. TcCYS4 presented a decrease of inhibitory activity when it was treated at temperatures between 60 and 70°C, with the greater decrease occurring at 65°C. Analyses by native gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography showed that TcCYS4 forms oligomers at temperatures between 60 and 70°C, condition where reduction of inhibitory activity was observed. TcCYS4 oligomers remain stable for up to 20 days after heat treatment and are undone after treatment at 80°C. TcCYS4 presented approximately 90% of inhibitory activity at pH values between 5 and 9. This protein treated at temperatures above 45°C and pH 5 presented reduced inhibitory activity against papain, suggesting that the pH 5 enhances the formation of TcCYS4 oligomers. A variation in the titratable acidity was observed in tissues of T. cacao during the symptoms of witches' broom disease. Our findings suggest that the oligomerization of TcCYS4, favored by variations in pH, is an endergonic process. We speculate that this process can be involved in the development of the symptoms of witches' broom disease in cocoa."
https://openalex.org/W1996650165,"Background Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is being widely adopted in high TB burden countries. Analysis is needed to guide the placement of devices within health systems to optimize the tuberculosis (TB) case detection rate (CDR). Methods We used epidemiological and operational data from Uganda (139 sites serving 87,600 individuals tested for TB) to perform a model-based comparison of the following placement strategies for Xpert devices: 1) Health center level (sites ranked by size from national referral hospitals to health care level III centers), 2) Smear volume (sites ranked from highest to lowest volume of smear microscopy testing), 3) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) volume (sites ranked from greatest to least patients on ART), 4) External equality assessment (EQA) performance (sites ranked from worst to best smear microscopy performance) and 5) TB prevalence (sites ranked from highest to lowest). We compared two clinical algorithms, one where Xpert was used only for smear microscopy negative samples versus another replacing smear microscopy. The primary outcome was TB CDR; secondary outcomes were detection of multi-drug resistant TB, number of sites requiring device placement to achieve specified rollout coverage, and cost. Results Placement strategies that prioritized sites with higher TB prevalence maximized CDR, with an incremental rate of 6.2–12.6% compared to status quo (microscopy alone). Diagnosis of MDR-TB was greatest in the TB Prevalence strategy when Xpert was used in place of smear microscopy. While initial implementation costs were lowest in the Smear Volume strategy, cost per additional TB case detected was lowest in the TB prevalence strategy. Conclusion In Uganda, placement of Xpert devices in sites with high TB prevalence yielded the highest TB CDR at the lowest cost per additional case diagnosed. These results represent novel use of program level data to inform the optimal placement of new technology in resource-constrained settings."
https://openalex.org/W1996029339,"Atherosclerosis is increasingly recognized as a complex chronic inflammatory disease. Many more studies have extended vaccination against atherosclerosis by using epitopes from self-antigens or beyond and demonstrated that vaccination with antigens or derivatives could reduce the extent of the lesions in atherosclerosis-prone mice. Our previous study has demonstrated that construct AHHC [ApoB100688-707 + hHSP60303-312 + hHSP60153-163 + Cpn derived peptide (C)] significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesion. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AHHC can be modulated towards increased lesion reduction in mice by creating two other derivatives with a sequential epitope-substitution named RHHC in which A was replaced by an “R” (C5aR1-31) and RPHC with a further “H” (hHSP60303-312) conversion into “P” (protease-activated receptor-142-55) in mice. Antigenic epitopes were incorporated into a dendroaspin scaffold. Immunization of B6;129S-Ldlrtm1HerApobtm2Sgy/J mice with three constructs elicited production of high levels of antibodies against each epitope (apart from hHSP60153-163 and P which induced a low antibody response). Histological analyses demonstrated that the mice immunized with either RPHC or RHHC showed significant reductions in the size of atherosclerostic lesions compared to those with AHHC (69.5±1.1% versus 55.7±3.4%, P<0.01 or 65.6±1.3% versus 55.7±3.4%, P<0.01). Reduction of plaque size in the aortic sinus and descending aorta correlated with alterations in cellular immune responses when compared with controls. We conclude that a recombinant construct RPHC may provide new antigenic and structural features which are favorable for significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion formation. This approach offers a novel strategy for developing anti-atherosclerotic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2005408445,"The TM1088 locus of T. maritima codes for two proteins designated TM1088A and TM1088B, which combine to form the cytosolic portion of a putative Trk K+ transporter. We report the crystal structure of this assembly to a resolution of 3.45 Å. The high resolution crystal structures of the components of the assembly, TM1088A and TM1088B, were also determined independently to 1.50 Å and 1.55 Å, respectively. The TM1088 proteins are structurally homologous to each other and to other K+ transporter proteins, such as TrkA. These proteins form a cytosolic gating ring assembly that controls the flow of K+ ions across the membrane. TM1088 represents the first structure of a two-subunit Trk assembly. Despite the atypical genetics and chain organization of the TM1088 assembly, it shares significant structural homology and an overall quaternary organization with other single-subunit K+ gating ring assemblies. This structure provides the first structural insights into what may be an evolutionary ancestor of more modern single-subunit K+ gating ring assemblies."
