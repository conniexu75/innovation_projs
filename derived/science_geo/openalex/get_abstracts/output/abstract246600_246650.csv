https://openalex.org/W2113297575,"Today's surface ocean is saturated with respect to calcium carbonate, but increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are reducing ocean pH and carbonate ion concentrations, and thus the level of calcium carbonate saturation. Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms—such as corals and some plankton—will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean–carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously. The surface waters of the oceans are saturated with calcium carbonate, which is good news for marine organisms with external skeletons such as corals and some phytoplankton. Yet the level of calcium carbonate saturation is reduced as the ocean undergoes acidification due to the uptake of carbon dioxide produced from fossil fuels. New research indicates that, if carbon dioxide concentrations continue to increase at the present rate, the Southern Ocean as well as parts of the subarctic Pacific Ocean will be undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by 2100. The findings suggest that at high latitudes some marine organisms will not be able to grow their calcium carbonate exoskeletons within decades, not centuries as suggested previously."

The inorganic cores possess useful properties that are controlled by their composition, size and shape, and the surfactant coating ensures that these structures are easy to fabricate and process further into more complex structures. This combination of features makes colloidal nanocrystals attractive and promising building blocks for advanced materials and devices. Chemists are achieving ever more exquisite control over the composition, size, shape, crystal structure and surface properties of nanocrystals, thus setting the stage for fully exploiting the potential of these remarkable materials."

The ubiquitin-proteasome system protects cells against proteotoxicity by degrading soluble monomeric misfolded aggregation-prone proteins but is ineffective against, and impaired by, non-native protein oligomers. Here we show that autophagy is induced in response to impaired ubiquitin proteasome system activity. We show that ATG proteins, molecular determinants of autophagic vacuole formation, and lysosomes are recruited to pericentriolar cytoplasmic inclusion bodies by a process requiring an intact microtubule cytoskeleton and the cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6. These data suggest that HDAC6-dependent retrograde transport on microtubules is used by cells to increase the efficiency and selectivity of autophagic degradation.

In Huntington disease (HD) and related dominantly inherited, late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, pathology is the direct consequence of expansion of CAG triplet repeats that encode homopolymeric tracts of glutamine (polyQ) within the mutant gene product (1Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). In HD, these polyQ tracts typically consist of greater than 39 glutamines in the huntingtin protein (Htt), while Htt with fewer than ∼30 glutamines is not associated with disease (2Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7080) Google Scholar). This CAG length dependence of disease onset and severity in HD and in related CAG expansion disorders (1Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) correlates strongly with the propensity of expanded polyQ proteins to aggregate in vitro, in cell culture (3Scherzinger E.

There is compelling data in support of the hypothesis that CAG expansion and other neurodegenerative diseases are disorders of protein conformation, in which normally well behaved proteins adopt non-native toxic oligomeric conformations (6Taylor J.P.

Recent studies have suggested that cellular toxicity (15Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar, 16Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat.

Because polyglutamine aggregates are largely insoluble, refractory to chemical denaturation (19Hazeki N. Tukamoto T. Goto J. Kanazawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and because they accumulate in inclusion bodies (IB) (20Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar), it is widely assumed that cells have little or no capacity to eliminate them. However, several recent studies have established that neurons in conditional transgenic mouse models of polyQ disease have the capacity to recover from the toxicity of transient expression of aggregation prone proteins containing expanded polyglutamine tracts (21Yamamoto A. Lucas J.J. Hen R. Cell. 2000; 101: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 22Zu T. Duvick L.A. Kaytor M.D. Berlinger M.S. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8853-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, cellular mechanisms must exist to suppress the toxicity associated with intracellular accumulation of conformationally defective mutant proteins like Htt and ataxin-1. Elucidating the molecular processes underlying these cytoprotective mechanisms is clearly important to the development of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of Huntington and other neurodegenerative diseases. A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that autophagy is a primary mechanism through which mammalian cells can capture and degrade protein aggregates. In classic autophagy, cytoplasmic contents, including ribosomes, soluble proteins and organelles, are captured into bilamellar autophagosomes, which, upon fusion with lysosomes, mature into degradative autolysosomes (23Mortimore G.E. Miotto G. Venerando R. Kadowaki M. Subcell Biochem. 1996; 27: 93-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In yeast these events require the function of ATG genes, which encode proteins called Atgs (24Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M.

Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A functional role for autophagy in clearance of aggregated Htt is suggested by the observation that 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of type III phosphoinositide 3-kinases required for many vesicular trafficking events, including autophagosome formation (26Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), increases levels of polyQ-expanded Htt inclusions and decreases the clearance of aggregates from mammalian cells expressing these constructs (27Ravikumar B.

Pharmacological activation of mTOR, a protein kinase that regulates a myriad of cellular responses to changes in nutrient and hormonal status, including autophagy (29Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar), delays the neurotoxicity associated with mutant Htt in cellular (30Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol.

Ultrastructural evidence suggesting a proliferation of lysosomes and autophagic bodies in striatal neurons expressing mutant Htt (32Kegel K.B. Kim M. Sapp E. McIntyre C. Castano J.G. Aronin N.

Neurol. 1997; 42: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and Alzheimer disease brains (34Nixon R.A. Cataldo A.M. Mathews P.M. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), further supports a linkage between degeneration and autophagy (35Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 897-908PubMed Google Scholar), although these morphological studies cannot distinguish between a role for autophagy in cytoprotection or cell death. Recently, we reported that RNAi-mediated Atg knockdown leads to increased steady-state levels of Htt and completely prevents clearance of cytoplasmic polyglutamine aggregates from cell models of HD (36Iwata A. Christianson J. Bucci M. Ellerby L. Nukina N. Forno L. Kopito R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13135-13140Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We also observed that cytoplasmic IB are consistently labeled with antibodies to endogenous Atgs, irrespective of the particular aggregating species, suggesting that recruitment of autophagocytic machinery to sites of IB formation may be a general feature of the cellular defense against protein aggregation (36Iwata A. Christianson J. Bucci M. Ellerby L. Nukina N. Forno L. Kopito R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13135-13140Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Aggregated proteins in the mammalian cytoplasm are sequestered into pericentriolar IB called “aggresomes” (37Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Aggresomes form when the ubiquitin proteasome system is overwhelmed with aggregationprone protein by a process in which small protein aggregates are actively transported on microtubules by a process requiring dynein/dynactin motors (38Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) and the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 (39Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that neurons expressing polyglutamine-expanded Htt survive better if they can form aggresomes (18Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), together with the finding that polyglutamine toxicity is enhanced by microtubule disrupting agents that prevent aggresome formation (40Muchowski P.J. Ning K. D'Souza-Schorey C. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), strongly supports the hypothesis that aggresome formation is a cytoprotective mechanism. One way that aggresome formation could be cytoprotective would be to facilitate the delivery of dispersed protein aggregates to the autophagy pathway (38Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Indeed evidence for such a mechanism is suggested by the demonstration that pharmacological inhibition of autophagy slows the clearance of aggresomes composed of mutant peripheral myelin protein PMP22, a Schwann cell protein associated with a host of demyelinating neuropathies (42Fortun J. Dunn Jr., W.A. Joy S. Li J. Notterpek L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10672-10680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophagy has been primarily considered to be a bulk, non-selective pathway by which cells scavenge cytoplasmic proteins and organelles in response to nutrient deprivation (43Kamada Y. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 73-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, efficient degradation of protein aggregates by autophagy requires that they be concentrated in nascent autophagic structures. Previous investigators have reported that microtubule disruption interferes with autophagy by impairing autolysosome formation (44Aplin A. Jasionowski T. Tuttle D.L. Lenk S.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 45Webb J.L. Ravikumar B. Rubinsztein D.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we show that autophagosome formation is strongly activated by acute proteasome impairment. Because proteasome impairment inevitably accompanies the production and/or accumulation of aggregated proteins (46Liu C.W. Giasson B.I. Lewis K.A. Lee V.M. Demartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22670-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 47Park Y. Hong S. Kim S.J. Kang S. Mol. Cells. 2005; 19: 23-30PubMed Google Scholar), this finding suggests a mechanism by which protein aggregation could induce an autophagic response. We find that recruitment of Atgs, aggregates, and lysosomes to aggresomes requires both an intact microtubule cytoskeleton and the tubulin deacetylase, HDAC6. These data suggest that minus-end-directed transport on microtubules is a mechanism used by cells to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of autophagic degradation of aggregated proteins. Thus, the aggresome and autophagy pathways operate cooperatively to eliminate aggregation-prone proteins that escape surveillance by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Cell Lines Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells, HeLa cells, and neuro2a (N2Aa) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in 95 and 5% CO2. Plasmid transfection was done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Most of the analyses were done after 48 h of transfection unless otherwise noted. For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2 containing 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors. Extracts were passaged ten times with a 21-gauge needle followed by passage through a 25-gauge needle four times. Extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were quantified using Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein was electrophoresed through 18% Tris-glycine gels for LC3-CFP and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with antibody. Protein was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) plus (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using the Typhoon Imager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuaNT software.

Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and collagen, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized by 0.25%Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibody incubation was done at 4 °C for overnight followed by 1-h incubation at room temperature with Alexa 488 or 546 labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 50 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Sigma) for nuclear staining. Conventional epifluorescence micrographs were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 100× oil lens (NA1.4, Zeiss). Digital (12-bit) images were acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) and processed by using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Media, PA). The excitation filters used for conventional microscopy were 365WB50 (bisbenzimide), 440AF21 (CFP), 500AF25 (GFP, Alexa488), and 560AF55 (Alexa546).

Confocal images were obtained using a Leica LSM 510 with a63× oil lens (numerical aperture 1.2, Leica). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells were gently scraped, pelleted, and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 1.5% glutaraldehyde, and 5% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 3 h at room temperature. Cells were washed briefly in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and post-fixed using 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with 0.05 m cacodylate buffer, en bloc stained with 1% uranyl acetate in 10% ethanol for 1 h and rapidly dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol followed by propylene oxide. The cells were placed in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and LX-112 resin (Ladd Research Industries, Williston, VT) overnight, immersed in two changes of LX-112 resin (2 h each), and polymerized at 60 °C for 24-48 h. 60-nm ultrathin sections were contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate for 10 min at room temperature, followed by lead citrate for 2 min at room temperature. Grids were viewed and photographed using a JEOL 1200EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA). RNA Interference—For HDAC6 knock-down, sequence from 117-136 bp of its open reading frame was subcloned to pSUPER vector (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA).

Proteasome Inhibition Induces Autophagy—In yeast and mammalian cells, autophagy is under strict metabolic control, sensing nutrient insufficiency via the inhibitory TOR (mTOR) signaling pathway, and non-selectively breaking down cellular proteins in response to nutrient availability (25Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 51Yoshimori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To test whether autophagy is also activated by intracellular protein aggregation, steady-state levels of the lipid-conjugated form of Atg8/LC3, LC3-II, an established indicator of autophagic activation (52Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar), were assessed in cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Fig. 1). LC3-II levels increased with time following a 1-2 h lag, in response to exposure to ALLN (Fig. 1A) or other proteasome inhibitors (data not shown). Similarly, CFP-LC3-II levels increased in response to proteasome inhibition in cells stably expressing a CFP-tagged form of LC3 (data not shown). The increase in Atg8/LC3-II levels corresponded to the appearance of fluorescent puncta in HEK-293 cells stably expressing CFP-Atg8/LC3 treated with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), ALLN or lactacystin (data not shown), that were indistinguishable in appearance from autophagosomes formed in response to the classic inducer of macroautophagy: amino acid starvation (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Similar punctate structures were observed in untransfected HEK-293 cells labeled with antibodies to endogenous Atg8/LC3 and Atg12 (data not shown; see Fig. 2) but not in cells expressing CFP-Atg8/LC3G120A, a conjugation-defective Atg8/LC3 mutant (Fig. 1B, right panels). Quantification of LC3 puncta formation in HEK-293 cells exposed to ALLN (Fig. 1C), revealed that, at rest, the vast majority of cells had ≤1 LC3-positive puncta, whereas the number of cells with multiple puncta increased by 2 h after administration of the drug. Atg8/LC3 remained soluble following extraction of MG132-treated cells with non-ionic detergent and did not appear to form covalent conjugates with ubiquitin (supplemental Fig. S1). These data demonstrate that autophagy is rapidly induced in response to impaired proteasome activity.FIGURE 2Accumulation of autophagic vacuoles around aggresomes.

In unperturbed cells (Fig. 2A, panels a-c), Atg8/LC3 was present in numerous very fine cytoplasmic puncta that were slightly enriched in the Golgi region. In amino acid-starved cells (Fig. 2A, panels d-f), Atg8/LC3 antibody labeled discrete autophagic structures that were distributed randomly throughout the cytoplasm. No correlation was observed between the distribution of Atg8/LC3 and that of ubiquitin, which maintained a uniformly diffuse distribution in both resting and starved cells. By contrast, overnight exposure to lactacystin (Fig. 2A; g-i) or other proteasome inhibitors (data not shown) resulted in a dramatic redistribution of both ubiquitin and Atg8/LC3 immunoreactivity to a discrete juxtanuclear region, where the two antigens appeared to be extensively colocalized. Juxtanuclear concentration and colocalization of ubiquitin and Atg8/LC3 immunoreactive structures was abrogated by treatment with nocodazole (Fig. 2A, panels j-l). The appearance of LC3-immunopositive puncta in response to proteasome inhibition correlated with the appearance, by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2B), of multilamellar, darkly stained structures that could be identified as degradative autophagosomes by the presence of membrane-enclo"
https://openalex.org/W1985799231,"West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the human epidemic-causing dengue, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses. In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop. Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection. Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments, and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave five-fold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2002276562,"Bacteria communicate by means of chemical signal molecules called autoinducers. This process, called quorum sensing, allows bacteria to count the members in the community and to alter gene expression synchronously across the population. Quorum-sensing-controlled processes are often crucial for successful bacterial--host relationships--both symbiotic and pathogenic. Most quorum-sensing autoinducers promote intraspecies communication, but one autoinducer, called AI-2, is produced and detected by a wide variety of bacteria and is proposed to allow interspecies communication. Here we show that some species of bacteria can manipulate AI-2 signalling and interfere with other species' ability to assess and respond correctly to changes in cell population density. AI-2 signalling, and the interference with it, could have important ramifications for eukaryotes in the maintenance of normal microflora and in protection from pathogenic bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W1997876559,"Most of the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in mammalian cells is synthesized by two pathways, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway and the phosphatidylserine (PS) decarboxylation pathway, the final steps of which operate at spatially distinct sites, the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively. We investigated the importance of the mitochondrial pathway for PE synthesis in mice by generating mice lacking PS decarboxylase activity. Disruption of Pisd in mice resulted in lethality between days 8 and 10 of embryonic development. Electron microscopy of Pisd-/- embryos revealed large numbers of aberrantly shaped mitochondria. In addition, fluorescence confocal microscopy of Pisd-/- embryonic fibroblasts showed fragmented mitochondria. PS decarboxylase activity and mRNA levels in Pisd+/- tissues were approximately one-half of those in wild-type mice. However, heterozygous mice appeared normal, exhibited normal vitality, and the phospholipid composition of livers, testes, brains, and of mitochondria isolated from livers, was the same as in wild-type littermates. The amount and activity of a key enzyme of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PE synthesis, CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, were increased by 35-40 and 100%, respectively, in tissues of Pisd+/- mice, as judged by immunoblotting; PE synthesis from [3H]ethanolamine was correspondingly increased in hepatocytes. We conclude that the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in mice cannot substitute for a lack of PS decarboxylase during development.

Mammalian cells utilize two major pathways for PE biosynthesis, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (1Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the phosphatidylserine decarboxylation pathway (2Borkenhagen L.F. Kennedy E.P. Fielding L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 28-32Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Most of the ethanolamine that is incorporated into PE is derived from the diet but some is generated by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (3Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In rat liver/hepatocytes (4Sundler R. Akesson B. Biochem.

Biochem. 1982; 60: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) the majority of PE has been reported to originate from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. In contrast, in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) produces more than 80% of PE, even when the culture medium is supplemented with ethanolamine, an obligatory substrate of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Many types of mammalian cells grow and divide normally when cultured in the absence of ethanolamine, suggesting that PE production from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway might not be not essential for cell growth (10Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), although it is likely that the relative importance of the two pathways of PE synthesis depends on the type of cell and tissue. In Escherichia coli, in which PE comprises ∼75% of total phospholipids, all PE is derived from PS decarboxylase. Interestingly, E. coli that have been genetically manipulated to reduce the PE content to 0.007% of total phospholipids are viable when supplemented with divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ (11DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The two major pathways for PE synthesis in mammalian cells operate in different subcellular compartments. The final reaction of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, catalyzed by CDP-ethanolamine:1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase, occurs primarily on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear membranes (13Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Henneberry A.L. Wright M.M. McMaster C.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3148-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas PS decarboxylase activity is restricted to the outer surface of mitochondrial inner membranes (15Percy A.K. Moore J.F. Carson M.A. Waechter C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Zborowski J. Dygas A. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential exists for compartmentalization of PE pools originating from these two spatially segregated pathways. Indeed, in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in yeast, the majority of mitochondrial PE is synthesized within mitochondria by PS decarboxylase, whereas only small amounts of mitochondrial PE are derived from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (i.e. imported from the ER, Refs. 17Shiao Y.-J.

Acta. 2004; 1686: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PE synthesized in mitochondria is efficiently exported to other cellular membranes (e.g. ER, Ref. 21Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14671-14676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and plasma membranes, Ref. 22Vance J.E. Aasman E.J. Szarka R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8241-8247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PS decarboxylase is a member of a small family of decarboxylases that contain a pyruvoyl prosthetic group (23Snell E.E. Trends in Biochem. Sci. 1977; 2: 131-135Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Li Q.-X. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

In E. coli, the pyruvoyl moiety of PS decarboxylase is generated by an autocatalytic, endoproteolytic cleavage in which the serine residue within the LGST motif is converted into a pyruvoyl group that is located at the N terminus of the smaller of the two subunits (24Li Q.-X. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11516-11522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LGST motif is conserved in mammalian PS decarboxylases, and a similar endoproteolytic cleavage appears to occur in mammalian cells (26Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We suspected that each pathway for PE synthesis might be essential for specific functions in mammalian cells. In view of the finding that nearly all PE in mitochondria is synthesized within mitochondria by PS decarboxylase, we hypothesized that inactivation of PS decarboxylase in mice would cause mitochondrial defects, and that such abnormalities might be incompatible with normal embryonic development. In this study, we generated mice lacking PS decarboxylase and found that the mice died at about embryonic day 9. Of note, embryonic fibroblasts lacking PS decarboxylase contained fragmented, aberrantly shaped mitochondria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPS Decarboxylase-deficient Mice—A mouse embryonic stem cell line (German Gene Trap Consortium W078F02-06350) containing an insertional mutation in the Pisd gene was identified in a gene-trapping screen (27Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The embryonic stem cells were used to generate male chimeric mice that were bred with heterozygous C57BL/6 mice to produce heterozygous (Pisd+/-) mice. Mice and embryos were genotyped by a PCR-based method with the primers 5′-GTG GTA GTA GCA GGA TTG GTA GC-3′ and 5′-GGG AGT GGA AGC AGT GGT AG-3′ for the wild-type allele, and 5′-ATT TGA CCT GAG CGC ATTTTTACGC-3′ and 5′-CATTAAAGCGAGTGGCAACATGGAA-3′ for the mutated allele. Genotypes were confirmed by quantifying neomycin phosphotransferase II gene dosage by Southern blotting of genomic DNA (28Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Steenbergen R. Sturbois B. Parlow A.F. Sanan D.A.

All mice described here had a mixed genetic background (50% C57BL/6, 50% 129OlaHsd). The mice were weaned at 21 days of age and housed in a barrier facility with a 14-h light, 10-h dark cycle. Mice were fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (LabDiet, Richmond, IN).Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from Pisd-/-, Pisd+/- and Pisd+/+ embryos as follows. The embryos were incubated in cell-dissociation solution (Sigma), and the cells were mechanically dispersed by repeated pipetting. The cell suspension was plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/liter uridine, 110 mg/liter pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acid solution (Sigma), 20 μm β-mercaptoethanol and 5 mg/liter ethanolamine. All cell culture plates and cover slips were coated with 0.1% gelatin.Histology—Female mice were euthanized and mouse embryos were isolated from the uterus. The embryos were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 h, dehydrated, embedded in ultrapure hard paraffin (gold standard-Peel away microcut, Polysciences, Warington, PA) and sectioned (5-μm thick), then stained with Harris hematoxylin/eosin.Examination of Tissues for β-Galactosidase Activity—Cryostat sections (10-μm thick) of frozen tissues from mice were collected on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). The sections were dried, fixed (in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl. 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.2% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.2) for 5 min at room temperature, then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were incubated with an X-gal (Invitrogen) staining solution for 2-6 h at 37 °C. The X-gal staining solution was prepared by mixing 1 ml of a stock solution of X-gal (40 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) with 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate, and 2 mm MgCl2. After staining, the slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice for 2 min with deionized water, and counterstained for 1-2 min with Nuclear Fast Red. The slides were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline and deionized water and coverslips were secured with Gel-mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA).Fluorescence Microscopy—Murine embryonic fibroblasts were grown on cover slips coated with 0.1% gelatin. Mitochondria were stained with 200 nm MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes, OR) for 15-20 min in cell culture medium. The cells were subsequently washed twice with dye-free culture medium, and mitochondria were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The cells were kept at 37 °C during imaging. Images were collected with software provided by Zeiss.Electron Microscopy—Embryos (8- and 9-day-old) were isolated from pregnant females and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde. Embryos were dehydrated and embedded in Araldite. Ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and osmium tetroxide. Sections were examined in a Hitachi H7000 electron microscope operated at 75 kV.Immunoblotting Analysis—Equal amounts of protein from tissue homogenates were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a 17-amino acid peptide (CTKAHHSSQEMSSEYRE) from the human/murine/rat CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferases (a gift from Dr. M. Bakovic, University of Guelph) and immunoprecipitated with protein G-coupled beads (Sigma). The antibody was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with immobilized antigen. The pellets were resuspended and washed three times with T-TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5). After the final wash, the samples were resuspended in loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. The gel was run under non-reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the membranes were subsequently incubated with anti-cytidylyltransferase antibodies as the primary antibody, and donkey anti-rabbit-IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibody. Blots were developed with ECL developing solution (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The band corresponding to CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (∼50 kDa) was quantified by densitometric scanning of the gels.Real-time PCR—Mouse tissue (50-100 mg) was homogenized with a Polytron in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) for 3 × 10 s on ice, and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was confirmed on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel by measurement of the 28 S/18 S ribosomal RNA ratio. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl volume containing oligo(dT)12-18 primer (Invitrogen), and Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for the reference gene, cyclophilin, were 5′-TCC AAA GAC AGC AGA AAA CTT TCG-3′ and 5′-TCT TCT TGC TGG TCT TGC CAT TCC-3′. For PS decarboxylase, the 5′ and 3′-primers were 5′-CAA CCT CAG CGA GTT CTT CC-3′ and 5′-CCT GCT CCA CCT CAG AGT TC-3′, respectively. The 20-μl PCR reaction contained 100 ng of cDNA, 10 μl of Platinum Sybr Green qPCR Supermix UDG (Invitrogen), and 1.6 μm cyclophilin primers, or 3.0 μm PS decarboxylase primers. Real-time PCR was performed with a Rotor-Gene RG-3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia) with samples from three separate mice, and each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Data were normalized to the reference gene with the Pfaffl method (29Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24934) Google Scholar).In Vitro Assay of PS Decarboxylase and CTP:Phosphoethanolamine Cytidylyltransferase Activities—For measurement of PS decarboxylase activity, unlabeled PS and 1,2 dioleoyl-l-3-phosphatidyl-l-[3-14C]serine ([14C]PS) (Amersham Biosciences) were dried together under nitrogen gas. The lipids were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, and 100 μm MnCl2, followed by 10 freeze-thaw cycles to induce formation of multilamellar liposomes. For each 40-μl assay, a sample of tissue homogenate (400 μg of protein) was incubated with 0.2 mm PS (0.9 μCi) for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), then lipids were extracted and dried under nitrogen gas. Phospholipids were separated on thin-layer chromatography plates (silica gel G-60, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, PA) in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water, 70:30:12:4:2 (v/v) then visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. PE was scraped from the silica plate, and radioactivity was determined. Under these assay conditions, the incorporation of radiolabel into PE was linear with respect to time of incubation and amount of protein. Enzymatic activity was calculated as dpm in PE/h/mg homogenate protein.The activity of CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase was measured according to a previously published procedure (30Tijburg L.B.M. Vermeulen P.S. van Golde L.M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture containing 20 μm Tris/HCl, 10 μm MgCl2, 5 μm dithiothreitol, 2 μm CTP, and 0.1 μmol of [3H]phosphoethanolamine (10 μCi/μmol) was added to 250 μg of protein of liver homogenate in a final volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by immersion of the tube in boiling water, and the tube was centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 × g. An aliquot (30 μl) of supernatant was applied to a thin-layer chromatography plate with 0.3 μmol of CDP-ethanolamine and 1 μmol of phosphoethanolamine as carriers. The ethanolamine-containing compounds were separated by thin-layer chromatography in methanol:0.5% NaCl:NH4OH (v/v) and visualized by spraying the plate with a 0.2% aqueous solution of ninhydrin followed by heating the plate at 100 °C for 5 min. CDP-ethanolamine was scraped from the plate, and radioactivity was measured. Enzymatic activity was calculated as nmol of CDP-ethanolamine produced/min/mg protein.Phospholipid Composition of Tissues and Mitochondria—Lipids were extracted from tissue homogenates, and mitochondria isolated from livers (31Vance J.E.

The lower phase from the lipid extraction was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel G60 plates (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, PA) in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water, 70:30:12:4:2, (v/v). Phospholipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. The phospholipids were scraped, and the amount of phospholipid was determined by measurement of inorganic phosphorus (33Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar).Radiolabeling of PE in Hepatocytes with [3H]Ethanolamine—Hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of Pisd+/+ and Pisd+/- mice and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h. The cells were washed twice with the same medium after which medium containing 1.5 μCi/ml [1-3H]ethan-1-ol-2-amine (Amersham Biosciences) was added. The cells were incubated for 0, 30, 60, or 90 min, and then the lipids were extracted from cellular lysates, and PE was isolated by thin-layer chromatography as described earlier. PE was scraped from the plate and radioactivity was measured.Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).RESULTSTissue Pattern of Pisd Expression and Generation of Pisd-/- Mice—We investigated the expression pattern for Pisd in several mouse tissues. Pisd is expressed in a wide range of tissues in adult mice (Fig. 1A). Pisd mRNA levels are particularly high in testis and liver. The expression of Pisd is relatively low in livers of embryos collected 5 days before birth, and also in newborn mice, but is ∼10-fold higher in adult (> 50-day-old) mice (Fig. 1B).To determine whether or not Pisd is essential for mouse viability, we generated Pisd-deficient mice with an ES cell line bearing a gene-trap insertional mutation in intron 5 of Pisd (27Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The mutation results in a fusion transcript consisting of the first five exons of Pisd followed by βgeo sequences from the gene-trap vector (Figs. 2, A and B). The first exons of the Pisd gene encode the mitochondrial targeting sequence, whereas the 3′-end of the gene contains sequences encoding the catalytic site of the enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 25Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fusion transcript is expressed under control of the Pisd promoter; thus, the gene-trap technique permits analysis of the cell type-specific expression of Pisd by staining tissue sections for β-galactosidase. Because the majority of mitochondrial PE is derived from PS decarboxylation, we hypothesized that Pisd would be highly expressed during development in tissues rich in mitochondria, such as the heart. As predicted, β-galactosidase staining of the heart of a 13-day-old Pisd+/- embryo (Fig. 3A) shows that Pisd is indeed expressed highly in embryonic heart. We also observed Pisd expression in other tissues of adult mice, including Sertoli cells of the testis, as shown in Fig. 3B.FIGURE 2Generation of Pisd mutant mice by gene trapping.

No Pisd-/- mice were born (TABLE ONE), nor did we find any Pisd-deficient embryos at stages later than 10 days of development. Until the embryos were 8 days old, however, there was a Mendelian distribution of the three genotypes. A few Pisd-/- embryos, 13 and 4% of total embryos, were found at E9 and E10, respectively. After E8, partially resorbed embryos, likely Pisd-/- embryos, were commonly observed. We conclude, therefore, that disruption of Pisd in mice results in failure of the embryos to develop beyond embryonic days 8-10. In contrast, mice and embryos that are heterozygous for the Pisd mutation are indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates; the heterozygous mice are born at the predicted Mendelian frequency, develop normally, have a normal lifespan, exhibit normal vitality, and are fertile.TABLE ONEGenotype of offspring produced from intercrosses of Pisd+/- miceAgeGenotypeResorbed+/++/––/–Adults68 (32%)142 (68%)0Embryos day 12–147 (25%)12 (43%)09 (32%)Embryos day 1021 (28%)43 (57%)3 (4%)8 (10%)Embryos day 915 (15%)48 (50%)12 (13%)21 (21%)Embryos day 822 (27%)36 (45%)20 (25%)2 (3%) Open table in a new tab Histological Analysis of Pisd-deficient Embryos—Examination of histological sections revealed severe developmental abnormalities in Pisd-deficient embryos, whereas development of heterozygous and wild-type embryos was normal. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was a clear distinction between the embryonic and extra-embryonic components in 8-day-old Pisd+/+ embryos. The initial stage in the formation of the placenta had occurred and the decidua was well developed with a typical open structure. In addition, the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm could be clearly identified and at least four somites were visible at this stage of development (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in 8-day-old Pisd-deficient embryos, differentiation into the three germ layers was not detectable (Fig. 4D). Moreover, no extra-embryonic components, such as the placenta or amnion, were visible. Maternal blood, not normally in direct contact with the embryo because of the presence of extra-embryonic membranes, was visible directly surrounding the Pisd-/- embryo (asterisks in Fig. 4, C and D). Mitotic spindles were present (not shown); thus, some cell division was occurring in Pisd-/- embryos of this age. The decidua was formed although it appeared more compact and irregular than in Pisd+/+ embryos. The length of the 8-day-old fetus with its surrounding decidua was ∼3 mm for both Pisd+/+ and Pisd-/- embryos. At day E9, however, the wild-type and heterozygous implants measured ∼5 mm in length whereas the Pisd-/- embryos were only ∼3-mm long (not shown). At this stage, necrosis of tissue was obvious in Pisd-/- embryos.FIGURE 4Histological analysis of 8-day-old Pisd+/+ and Pisd-/- embryos. Sagittal sections were made from embryos with surrounding deciduas. Tissues were fixed, embedded in paraffin, and serial sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin.

Neither alternative culture methods nor supplementation of the culture medium with various concentrations (1-50 mg/liter) of ethanolamine (a substrate for the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PE synthesis) improved the yield or viability of the cells. We also attempted to culture Pisd-/- fibroblasts in a modified growth medium that had previously been used to support growth of cells with mitochondrial defects (34King M.P. Attardi G.

https://openalex.org/W2052522374,"Bidirectional mismatch repair directed by a strand break located 3′ or 5′ to the mispair has been reconstituted using seven purified human activities: MutSα, MutLα, EXOI, replication protein A (RPA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C (RFC) and DNA polymerase δ. In addition to DNA polymerase δ, PCNA, RFC, and RPA, 5′-directed repair depends on MutSα and EXOI, whereas 3′-directed mismatch correction also requires MutLα. The repair reaction displays specificity for DNA polymerase δ, an effect that presumably reflects interactions with other repair activities. Because previous studies have suggested potential involvement of the editing function of a replicative polymerase in mismatch-provoked excision, we have evaluated possible participation of DNA polymerase δ in the excision step of repair. RFC and PCNA dramatically activate polymerase δ-mediated hydrolysis of a primer-template. Nevertheless, the contribution of the polymerase to mismatch-provoked excision is very limited, both in the purified system and in HeLa extracts, as judged by in vitro assay using nicked circular heteroplex DNAs. Thus, excision and repair in the purified system containing polymerase δ are reduced 10-fold upon omission of EXOI or by substitution of a catalytically dead form of the exonuclease. Furthermore, aphidicolin inhibits both 3′- and 5′-directed excision in HeLa nuclear extracts by only 20–30%. Although this modest inhibition could be because of nonspecific effects, it may indicate limited dependence of bidirectional excision on an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase.

Mismatch repair stabilizes the genome by correction of DNA biosynthetic errors, by ensuring the fidelity of genetic recombination, and in mammalian cells by participation in the cellular response to some classes of DNA damage. Basic features of the reaction responsible for replication error correction are conserved from bacteria to mammals. Study of partial reactions has demonstrated that repair can be divided into three major steps: mismatch recognition, excision, and repair DNA synthesis (1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This strand break serves as an entry point for the excision system, which is comprised of DNA helicase II and an appropriate single strand exonuclease (15Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

A 3′ to 5′ exonuclease is required when the nick that directs excision is located 3′ to the mismatch, whereas a 5′ to 3′ hydrolytic activity is necessary when the strand break is 5′ to the mispair. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is sufficient to repair the ensuing gap, and covalent integrity is restored to the helix by DNA ligase (19Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Analysis of nuclear extracts of human cells has indicated a similar excision repair mechanism for nick-directed mismatch correction in higher cells (20Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and several reconstituted systems that rely on purified human proteins have been described that support nick-directed mismatch-provoked excision (22Genschel J. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In a simple system comprised of MutSα (MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer), EXOI, 3The abbreviations used are: EXOIexonuclease IRPAreplication protein APCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRFCreplication factor C. 3The abbreviations used are: EXOIexonuclease IRPAreplication protein APCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRFCreplication factor C. and RPA, hydrolysis is mismatch-provoked and terminates upon mismatch removal, but always proceeds 5′ to 3′ from the nick that directs excision (22Genschel J. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although MutLα (MLH1·PMS2 heterodimer) is not required for EXOI activation in this system, it does enhance the mismatch dependence of the reaction. Supplementation of MutSα, MutLα, EXOI, and RPA with PCNA and RFC yields a system that supports bidirectional excision, i.e. hydrolysis that is directed in an appropriate manner by a nick located either 5′ or 3′ to the mismatch (23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast to the simpler 5′ to 3′ reconstituted reaction, 3′-directed excision in this 6-component system is absolutely dependent on MutLα. RFC is thought to play two roles in 3′-directed excision (23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It functions as a clamp loader, with the loaded form of PCNA necessary to activate 3′-directed excision, but it also acts directly to suppress EXOI mediated 5′ to 3′ hydrolysis from a strand break located 3′ to the mismatch. exonuclease I replication protein A proliferating cell nuclear antigen replication factor C. exonuclease I replication protein A proliferating cell nuclear antigen replication factor C. Whereas analysis of these purified systems has yielded useful information on mechanism, other activities may play significant roles in mismatch repair in the cell. For example, HMGB1 has been implicated in mismatch repair in nuclear extracts (24Yuan F. Gu L. Guo S. Wang C. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20935-20940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), although it is not required in the purified systems (23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of EXOI-depleted extracts and EXOI-deficient cell lines has indicated that other excision activities may function in a manner that is redundant with respect to EXOI (22Genschel J.

Depletion of human cell extracts and genetic studies in yeast have also implicated DNA polymerase δ in eukaryotic mismatch repair, with the former studies indicating involvement in the repair synthesis step of the reaction (28Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10917-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Amin N.S. Nguyen M.N. Oh S. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3894-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as polymerase δ depends on PCNA for processivity (35Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that PCNA has been implicated in the repair synthesis step of eukaryotic mismatch correction (36Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Analysis of mutant yeast strains with defects in the polymerase δ editing exonuclease has suggested that this activity may also play a role in mismatch-provoked excision (37Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2000-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 38Jin Y.H. Garg P. Stith C.M. Al-Refai H. Sterling J.F. Murray L.J. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Burgers P.M. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although other studies have suggested that the genetic instability associated with such defects may be because of aberrant checkpoint activation (39Datta A. Schmeits J.L. Amin N.S. Lau P.J. Myung K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the observation that 3′-directed mismatch-provoked excision in HeLa extracts is partially inhibited by aphidicolin has also been attributed to editing exonuclease involvement in the excision step of mismatch repair (21Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that a 7-component system comprised of MutSα, MutLα, EXOI, RPA, RFC, PCNA, and DNA polymerase δ supports bidirectional mismatch repair directed by a strand break located either 3′ or 5′ to the mispair. Whereas repair directed by a 5′-strand break can occur in the absence of MutLα, this activity is required for mismatch correction directed by a 3′-strand break. Repair DNA synthesis by polymerase δ depends on the presence of RPA, PCNA, and RFC for optimal activity. Importantly, EXOI is required for both 3′- and 5′-directed repair, and no significant involvement of the polymerase δ editing exonuclease is evident in mismatch-provoked excision in the purified system. Analysis of aphidicolin sensitivity of 3′- and 5′-directed excision reactions in HeLa nuclear extracts also indicates that the editing functions of polymerases δ or ϵ play little if any role in mismatch-provoked excision as scored on nicked circular heteroduplex DNAs. Proteins and Extracts—All fractionation was performed at 0 to 4 °C in the presence of a set of protease inhibitors at the following final concentrations: 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml E64, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, and 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (relative to a saturated solution in isopropyl alcohol). With the exception of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (U. S. Biochemicals), all protease inhibitors were from Roche. Human MutSα, MutLα, EXOIb, hydrolytically defective EXOIb D173A, RPA, PCNA, and RFC were isolated according to Dzantiev et al. (Ref. 23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M.

Partially purified human DNA polymerase δ was isolated from HeLa cells as described previously (28Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol.

The recombinant, 4-subunit form of DNA polymerase δ was expressed using a set of baculoviruses (kindly provided by Dr. Vladimir Podust, Vanderbilt University) and isolated by a modification of the published procedure (34Podust V.N. Chang L.S. Ott R. Dianov G.L. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3894-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Six hundred ml of SF9 cells at 1 × 106/ml in HyQ-SFX medium (HyClone, Inc.) were co-infected with baculoviruses that express p125, His tagged-p66, p50, and p12 subunits of human polymerase δ at multiplicities of infection of 6, 1, 1, and 1, respectively. Cells were harvested 48 h after infection, washed with cold 2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, and lysed in 20 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl) by Dounce homogenization (pestle B). Cytosolic extract was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and mixed with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h. After packing into a small column, the resin was washed with Buffer A and bound proteins were eluted with Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm imidazole). Fractions containing polymerase δ were collected, diluted 5-fold with Buffer Q (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated in Buffer Q containing 20 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a gradient from 20 to 400 mm NaCl in Buffer Q. Fractions containing polymerase δ (eluted at 260 mm NaCl) were combined and loaded directly onto a 1-ml HiTrap-heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl). The column was eluted with a gradient of 250–800 mm NaCl in Buffer C. Polymerase δ eluted at 0.51 m KCl and the final preparation was estimated to be ∼70–80% pure by Coomassie staining and contained all four subunits of polymerase δ as judged by Western analysis. Goat polyclonal antibody against the catalytic subunit of polymerase δ p125 (C-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p50 against full-length p50 protein, rabbit polyclonal anti-p68 against peptide GHGPPASKQVSQQPKG, and rabbit polyclonal anti-p12 against peptide GLEPPPEVWQVLKYHPGD (31Liu L.

Construction of DNA Substrates—5′-GT and 3′-GT heteroduplexes (and corresponding G·C and A·T homoduplex control DNAs, respectively) were prepared from f1 bacteriophage derivatives as described (20Fang W.-h.

Strand-specific Mismatch Repair in Human Cells. 1993; (Ph.D. thesis, Duke University)Google Scholar). The 5′-heteroduplex contained single strand break in the complementary DNA strand 128 base pairs 5′ to the mismatch (shorter path in the circular DNA). 3′-Heteroduplex DNA contained single strand break in the complementary strand 141 base pairs 3′ to the mispair. Gapped homoduplex DNA was prepared by a similar method (22Genschel J. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 41Fang W.-h. Strand-specific Mismatch Repair in Human Cells. 1993; (Ph.D. thesis, Duke University)Google Scholar). The latter DNA contained a 220-nucleotide gap in the complementary strand between the Sau96I and SwaI cleavage sites. Primed single-stranded DNAs for assay of the polymerase δ editing exonuclease were prepared by hybridization of a 5′-32P-labeled 35-residue oligonucleotide to circular single-stranded phage f1 MR3 DNA (6Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide C5650 (d(CCGAATTTCTAGACTCGAGAGCTTGCTAGCAATTC)) is a perfect complement to the viral DNA, whereas the oligonucleotide C5650-GA (d(CCGAATTTCTAGACTCGAGAGCTTGCTAGCAATGA)) yields a hybrid in which the 3′-terminal dinucleotide is unpaired. Annealing was at 60 °C for 30 min in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and the molar ratio of circular viral strand to oligonucleotide was 1.1:1 (110 nm viral DNA and 100 nm oligonucleotide). DNA Synthesis Assays—Synthesis on a poly(dA)·oligo(dT) primer-template was performed in 20-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm glutathione, 20 μm dTTP, 0.165 μm [α-33P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 625 ng of poly(dA)·oligo(dT)12–18 (Amersham Biosciences), 80 fmol of recombinant DNA polymerase δ (or a comparable amount of HeLa DNA polymerase δ as judged by quantitative Western analysis), and 580 fmol of homotrimer PCNA (as indicated). Two-μl samples were quenched in 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH, 10 mm EDTA and spotted on a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Unincorporated label was removed by washing with 0.5 m Na2HPO4, the membrane was rinsed with water, dried, and analyzed by PhosphorImaging. Gap repair DNA synthesis was assayed in 20-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm glutathione, 100 μm each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, 10 μm dCTP, and 0.165 μm [α-33P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 100 ng (24 fmol) of circular f1 DNA containing a 220-nucleotide gap (above), and as indicated 80 fmol of recombinant DNA polymerase δ, 290 fmol of homotrimer PCNA, 100 fmol of RFC, and 900 fmol of RPA. Two-microliter samples were quenched and incorporated label was determined as described above. Assay of Mismatch-provoked Excision and Repair—Mismatch repair and mismatch-provoked excision in nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (20Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Scientific) stock, which was used within 2 months, was prepared by dissolving the compound in Me2SO and storing as aliquots at –80 °C. The stock solution was diluted to 900 μm with H2O immediately prior to use. Mismatch repair using purified proteins was performed by minor modifications of previous procedures (23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Repair reactions (20 μl) contained 24 fmol of 3′-GT or 5′-GT heteroduplex DNA (Fig. 2), 200 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP (Amersham Biosciences), and as indicated 100 ng (390 fmol) of MutSα, 70 ng (390 fmol) of MutLα, 4 ng (42 fmol) of EXOI, 200 ng (1800 fmol) of RPA, 66 ng (220 fmol) of RFC, 25 ng (290 fmol of homotrimer) of PCNA, and 20 ng (80 fmol) of polymerase δ. After incubation for 5 (5′ reaction) or 8 min (3′ reaction) at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by adding 40 μl of 30 mm EDTA, 180 μg/ml proteinase K, and 0.4 mg/ml glycogen. After incubation at 55 °C for 60 min, reactions were extracted with phenol:choloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by chloroform extraction. DNA products recovered by ethanol precipitation were cleaved with HindIII and ClaI, subjected to electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Analysis of mismatch-provoked excision was performed in a similar manner except dNTPs were omitted from the reaction, and excision products were scored by cleavage with NheI and ClaI (23Dzantiev L.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). Excision and repair synthesis tract end points were localized by indirect end labeling (23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Strand-specific Mismatch Repair in Human Cells. 1993; (Ph.D. thesis, Duke University)Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction products were cleaved with an appropriate restriction endonuclease, resolved through alkaline-agarose, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes, which were probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides that hybridize to complementary strand sequences on the appropriate side of the restriction enzyme site. 32P-Labeled probe V5891 (d(ATTTAACGCGAATTTTAACAA)) was used to localize the 3′-termini on 5′-heteroduplex products following SspI digestion. 32P-Labeled probe V194 (d(AACATGTTGAGCTACAGCACC)) was used to map the 3′ termini on 3′-heteroduplex products after BstYI digestion. Fine Mapping of Excision and Repair DNA Synthesis Tracts—Excision and repair reactions in nuclear extracts and with purified proteins were performed as described above. Excision reactions using HeLa nuclear extract were supplemented with 90 μm aphidicolin to inhibit limited DNA synthesis supported by trace dNTP levels present in extract preparations (20Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Repair reactions contained 20 μm α-thio-dCTP (TriLink), 180 μm dCTP, and 200 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. After incubation for 8 min at 37 °C, reactions were processed as described above and DNA digested with SspI. The 10-μl restriction digestion reaction mixture was diluted to 180 μl with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) and divided into two 90-μl aliquots. One aliquot was supplemented with 10 μl of 50 mm iodine in ethanol, which cleaves at sites of α-thio-dCMP incorporation (42Huang J.-C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), with the other aliquot serving as control. After 5 min at room temperature, DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in 5 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and supplemented with 10 μl of 90% formamide (v/v), 89 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA. Reaction products were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to a Hybond N+ membrane, and probed with V5891. Assay of Polymerase δ Editing Exonuclease—Editing exonuclease was assayed using primed single strands that were either perfectly paired or contained a 3′-terminal unpaired dinucleotide. Buffer conditions were identical to those used for assay of reconstituted mismatch-provoked excision (23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) except that the ATP concentration was 0.1 mm. Reactions (20 μl) contained 24 fmol of DNA, 80 fmol of polymerase δ, and when indicated 1160 fmol of PCNA (trimer), 440 fmol of RFC, and 180 μm aphidicolin. Incubation was at 30 °C. 3-μl samples were removed as a function of time and quenched by addition of 9 μl of 90% formamide (v/v), 89 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA. DNA was separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in the Tris borate buffer. DNA products were visualized by phosphorimaging. In Vitro Reconstitution of Bidirectional Mismatch Repair—A single-strand break located 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch is sufficient to determine the stand specificity of mismatch repair or mismatch-provoked excision in extracts of mammalian cells (20Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several reconstituted systems have been recently described that support mismatch-provoked excision using purified human proteins. 5′-Directed excision can be mediated by EXOI in a reaction that is controlled by MutSα and RPA, with specificity enhanced by MutLα (22Genschel J. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A 6-component system consisting of MutSα, MutLα, EXOI, RPA, RFC, and PCNA is sufficient to support mismatch-provoked excision directed by a strand break located either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (23Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because previous work has implicated DNA polymerase δ in the repair synthesis step of mismatch correction in HeLa extract fractions (28Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2003762932,"Over four fifths of the mass in the Universe is ‘dark matter’: it can't be seen directly but we know it's there because the motions of stars show that they are gravitationally attracted by something unseen. Elliptical galaxies, formed by the merger of spiral and disk-shaped galaxies, ought in this picture to contain just as much dark matter as any other galaxies. So the recent suggestion that they contained no dark matter — because the paths of slow-moving stars in ellipticals seemed not to be subject to dark matter's gravitational tug — was a blow to the conventional view of the Universe. Now Dekel et al. present computer simulations of the mergers that produce ellipticals, and they find that these processes can generate stars in slow elongated orbits even when the merged galaxies contain the usual complement of dark matter. There is strong evidence that the mass of the Universe is dominated by dark matter, which exerts gravitational attraction but whose exact nature is unknown. In particular, all galaxies are believed to be embedded in massive haloes of dark matter1,2. This view has recently been challenged by the observation of surprisingly low random stellar velocities in the outskirts of ordinary elliptical galaxies, which has been interpreted as indicating a lack of dark matter3,4. Here we show that the low velocities are in fact compatible with galaxy formation in dark-matter haloes. Using numerical simulations of disk-galaxy mergers5,6, we find that the stellar orbits in the outer regions of the resulting ellipticals are very elongated. These stars were torn by tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first close passage and put on outgoing trajectories. The elongated orbits, combined with the steeply falling density profile of the observed tracers, explain the observed low velocities even in the presence of large amounts of dark matter. Projection effects when viewing a triaxial elliptical can lead to even lower observed velocities along certain lines of sight."

Because topoisomerase I and II create transient single- and double-stranded DNA breaks, respectively, it has been assumed that type I enzymes relax the positive supercoils that precede the replication fork. Conversely, type II enzymes primarily resolve the precatenanes and untangle catenated daughter chromosomes. However, studies on yeast and bacteria suggest that type II topoisomerases may also function ahead of the replication machinery. If this is the case, then positive DNA supercoils should be the preferred relaxation substrate for topoisomerase IIα, the enzyme isoform involved in replicative processes in humans. Results indicate that human topoisomerase IIα relaxes positively supercoiled plasmids >10-fold faster than negatively supercoiled molecules. In contrast, topoisomerase IIβ, which is not required for DNA replication, displays no such preference. In addition to its high rates of relaxation, topoisomerase IIα maintains lower levels of DNA cleavage complexes with positively supercoiled molecules.

These properties suggest that human topoisomerase IIα has the potential to alleviate torsional stress ahead of replication forks in an efficient and safe manner. One of the most striking features of DNA is the intertwining of the two complementary strands of the double helix (1Watson J.D. Crick F.H.C. Nature. 1953; 171: 737-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (8554) Google Scholar). Discovery of this characteristic led to the immediate recognition that biological processes such as replication would be severely affected by the topological state of the genetic material (2Watson J.D. Crick F.H.C. Nature. 1953; 171: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). DNA in all species ranging from bacteria to humans is globally underwound (i.e. negatively supercoiled) (3Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 4Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 369-379Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Wang J.C. Annu.

This underwinding makes it easier to separate complementary DNA strands from one another and greatly facilitates initiation of replication and the assembly of replication forks. Once the fork begins to travel along the DNA template, however, the deleterious effects of topology manifest themselves (Fig. 1). Because helicases separate, but do not unwind the two strands of the double helix, fork movement results in acute overwinding (i.e. positive supercoiling) of the DNA ahead of the replication machinery (Fig. 1B) (3Cozzarelli N.R. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 5Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 6Schvartzman J.B. Stasiak A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). This overwinding has two major consequences. First, it increases the difficulty of separating duplex DNA into individual strands. Therefore, accumulation of positive supercoils presents a formidable block to fork movement (5Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 8Brill S.J. DiNardo S.

Cell. 1998; 94: 819-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Second, DNA overwinding ahead of the fork leads to a compensatory underwinding behind the replication machinery. If the replisome rotates around the helical axis of the DNA, this underwinding allows some of the torsional stress in the prereplicated DNA to be translated to the newly replicated daughter molecules in the form of precatenanes (Fig. 1C) (6Schvartzman J.B. Stasiak A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 11Peter B.J.

If these precatenanes are not resolved, they ultimately lead to the formation of catenated duplex daughter chromosomes. The topological state of DNA in the cell is modulated by enzymes known as topoisomerases (5Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 12Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Nitiss J.L.

Chem. 2003; 3: 1349-1364Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There are two classes of topoisomerases that are distinguished by their catalytic mechanisms. Type I enzymes act by generating a transient single-stranded break in the double helix, followed by either a single-stranded DNA passage event or controlled rotation about the break (14Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 17Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys.

As a result, these enzymes are able to alleviate torsional stress (i.e. remove superhelical twists) in duplex DNA. Type II topoisomerases act by generating a transient double-stranded DNA break, followed by a double-stranded DNA passage event (14Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 15Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Consequently, enzymes in this latter class are able to remove superhelical twists from DNA and resolve knotted or tangled duplex molecules. Whereas lower eukaryotes such as yeast and Drosophila encode only a single type II topoisomerase (20Wyckoff E. Hsieh T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Goto T. Wang J.C.

Although these two enzymes are closely related, they play distinct physiological roles. Gyrase is the only known topoisomerase that can actively underwind DNA (14Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev.

It functions to maintain the superhelical density of the bacterial chromosome and removes positive supercoils that accumulate ahead of DNA tracking systems. In contrast, topoisomerase IV is a potent decatenase that resolves knots in the genome and untangles newly replicated daughter chromosomes (14Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 25Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

Vertebrates express two closely related isoforms of topoisomerase II, α and β (22Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K.

These enzymes display a high degree of amino acid sequence identity and similar enzymological characteristics. However, they differ in their protomer molecular masses (170 versus 180 kDa, respectively) and are encoded by separate genes (14Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 24Velez-Cruz R. Osheroff N. Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry. Vol. 1.

Either topoisomerase IIα or β can complement the loss of topoisomerase II in yeast (28Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C.

The α isoform is up-regulated dramatically during cell proliferation and is tightly associated with mitotic chromosomes (13Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H.

In contrast, expression of the β isoform is independent of proliferative status, and the enzyme dissociates from chromosomes during mitosis (13Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 31Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R.

Thus, topoisomerase IIα is believed to be the isoform that functions in growth-dependent processes, such as DNA replication and chromosome segregation (7Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 13Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although cells can survive the absence of topoisomerase IIβ, this isoform cannot compensate for the loss of topoisomerase IIα (27Austin C.A. Marsh K.L.

The common feature of all of these drugs is that they act by increasing levels of covalent topoisomerase-cleaved DNA complexes (i.e. cleavage complexes) that are requisite catalytic intermediates (15Fortune J.M.

When DNA tracking systems, such as replication forks, collide with these complexes, transient enzyme-associated DNA breaks are converted to permanent breaks in the genome (15Fortune J.M. Osheroff N.

Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). As a result, antibacterial and anticancer agents convert topoisomerases from essential enzymes to potent cellular toxins. Topoisomerases play critical roles during DNA replication in eukaryotic cells (5Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 3: 1349-1364Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because type I topoisomerases can relax positive or negative superhelical twists (14Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 17Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys.

Dulbecco R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), it has been assumed that these enzymes act ahead of replication forks to alleviate torsional stress. Conversely, because type II topoisomerases can untangle duplex DNA molecules (12Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Champoux J.J. Annu.

Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), these enzymes are believed to act exclusively behind forks to resolve precatenanes or later in replication to unlink catenated daughter chromosomes. In marked contrast to this proposed segregation of function, models for anticancer drug action place topoisomerase II ahead of approaching replication forks (15Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 221-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wilstermann A.M. Osheroff N. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1349-1364Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 45Li T.K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12031-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This discrepancy raises the question of whether eukaryotic type II topoisomerases have normal physiological functions ahead of the DNA replication machinery. Two lines of evidence suggest that this may be the case. First, yeast topoisomerase II can compensate for the loss of topoisomerase I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but loss of both enzymes abruptly halts DNA synthesis (8Brill S.J. DiNardo S. Voelkel-Meiman K. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1987; 326: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that the type II enzyme can assume the role of topoisomerase I ahead of the replication machinery. Second, Escherichia coli topoisomerase IV (whose functions in bacteria appear to parallel those of topoisomerase II in eukaryotes) can partially compensate for the loss of DNA gyrase during replication elongation (50Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Schmid M.B. DeRisi J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9419-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, topoisomerase IV relaxes positive DNA supercoils ∼20-fold faster than it does negative supercoils (52Crisona N.J. Strick T.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2881-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 53Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If type II topoisomerases play a role ahead of replication forks in vertebrate species, then positively supercoiled DNA should be the preferred relaxation substrate for topoisomerase IIα, the isoform that is involved in replicative processes. Results indicate that human topoisomerase IIα relaxes positively supercoiled plasmids >10-fold faster than negatively supercoiled molecules. In contrast, human topoisomerase IIβ, which is not required for DNA replication, shows no such preferential relaxation. Finally, topoisomerase IIα maintains lower levels of DNA cleavage complexes with positively supercoiled molecules. These enzymological properties are consistent with those of a topoisomerase that functions ahead of the replication machinery. Enzymes and Plasmid DNA—Human topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ were expressed in S. cerevisiae (54Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (55Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Based on Coomassie- or silver-stained protein gels, both enzymes were at least 95% homogeneous. Archaeoglobus fulgidus reverse gyrase was expressed in E. coli C41(DE3) and purified according to Rodriguez (56Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was prepared from E. coli using a Plasmid Mega Kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Preparation of Positively Supercoiled Plasmid DNA—Positively supercoiled plasmid DNA was prepared by treating negatively supercoiled molecules with reverse gyrase (56Rodriguez A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29865-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 35 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA and 420 nm reverse gyrase in a total of 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. Reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, halted by the addition of 13 μl of 375 mm EDTA, and cooled on ice. Proteinase K was added (10 μl of 4 mg/ml), and the reactions were incubated at 45 °C for 30 min to digest the enzyme. Samples were extracted with phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and positively supercoiled DNA was precipitated with cold ethanol. Plasmids were resuspended in 100 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 500 μm EDTA. To make certain that differences between negatively and positively supercoiled substrates were not influenced by the temperature or other conditions used in the preparation protocol, negatively supercoiled plasmids were treated in a parallel fashion, except that reverse gyrase was omitted from reaction mixtures. The average number of superhelical twists present in DNA substrates and the resulting σ values were determined by electrophoretic band counting relative to fully relaxed molecules. For negatively supercoiled substrates, time courses for the relaxation of pBR322 by topoisomerase I were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in TBE (100 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA) containing 1-2 μg/ml chloroquine (Sigma) as running buffer. Optimal resolution was observed in 1 μg/ml chloroquine. For positively supercoiled substrates, time courses for the generation of positive superhelical twists by reverse gyrase were resolved by electrophoresis as above in TBE containing 5-15 μg/ml netropsin B (Roche Applied Science). Optimal resolution was observed in 7.5 μg/ml netropsin B. Positively supercoiled bands also were counted in time courses of relaxation of positively supercoiled plasmid by topoisomerase I. Calculated σ values were consistent with those obtained from the reverse gyrase time courses. DNA Relaxation—DNA relaxation assays were based on the procedure of Fortune and Osheroff (57Fortune J.M. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17643-17650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, reaction mixtures contained 1 nm human topoisomerase IIα or topoisomerase IIβ, 5 nm negatively or positively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, and 1 mm ATP in a total of 20 μl of relaxation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 175 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol). Samples were incubated at 37 °C, and DNA relaxation was stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 0.77% SDS, 77 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Samples were mixed with 2 μl of agarose gel loading buffer (60% sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)), heated at 45 °C for 5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 100 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA. Alternatively, samples were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first dimension was run for 2 h as described in the preceding paragraph. The gel was soaked for 2 h with gentle shaking in 200 ml of TBE containing 4.5 μg/ml chloroquine and run in the orthogonal dimension (90° clockwise) for 2 h in fresh TBE containing 4.5 μg/ml chloroquine. All of the gels were stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and DNA bands were visualized with ultraviolet light and quantified using an Alpha Innotech digital imaging system. DNA Binding—The ability of human topoisomerase IIα to bind negatively and positively supercoiled DNA was assessed using a competitive nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Binding mixtures contained 400 nm topoisomerase IIα, 5 nm linear pBR322 DNA that was cleaved with Hind III and terminally labeled with [32P]phosphate and 0-20 nm negatively or positively supercoiled DNA in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 or 175 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 6 min. Under the conditions of the assay, a DNA binding equilibrium was established in less than 1 min. Nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm HA, Millipore) were prepared by incubation in binding buffer for 10 min. Samples were applied to the membranes and filtered in vacuo. Membranes were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer, dried, and submerged in 8 ml of scintillation fluid (Econo-Safe Research Products International). Radioactivity remaining on the membranes was quantified using a Beckman LS 5000 TD scintillation counter. The percentage of linear DNA bound to topoisomerase IIα was determined based on the ratio of radioactivity on the membranes versus that of the input DNA. It should be noted that DNA binding experiments were performed in the absence of ATP and Mg2+. This was done to prevent the formation of concatenated DNA multimers, which are too large to pass through the filter, or the generation of covalent enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes during the course of the assay. ATP Hydrolysis—ATPase assays were performed as described by Osheroff et al. (58Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 1 nm human topoisomerase IIα, 55 nm negatively or positively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP in a total of 40 μl of relaxation buffer. Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 2-μl samples were removed at time intervals up to 12 min and spotted on polyethyleneimine-impregnated thin layer cellulose chromatography plates (EMD Chemical"

Recent studies show that when the levels of 6-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate are diminished by the activity of extracellular heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases (Sulfs), fibroblast growth factor 2-, heparin binding epidermal growth factor-, and hepatocyte growth factor-mediated signaling are attenuated. This represents a novel mechanism for regulating cell growth, particularly within the tumor microenvironment where the Sulfs are known to be misregulated. To directly test the role of Sulfs in tumor growth control in vivo, a human myeloma cell line was transfected with cDNAs encoding either of the two known human endosulfatases, HSulf-1 or HSulf-2. When implanted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, the growth of these tumors was dramatically reduced on the order of 5- to 10-fold as compared with controls. In addition to an inhibition of tumor growth, these studies revealed the following. (i) HSulf-1 and HSulf-2 have similar functions in vivo. (ii) The extracellular activity of Sulfs is restricted to the local tumor cell surface. (iii) The Sulfs promote a marked increase in extracellular matrix deposition within tumors that may, along with attenuated growth factor signaling, contribute to the reduction in tumor growth. These findings demonstrate that dynamic regulation of heparan sulfate structure by Sulfs present within the tumor microenvironment can have a dramatic impact on the growth and progression of malignant cells in vivo.

These findings demonstrate that dynamic regulation of heparan sulfate structure by Sulfs present within the tumor microenvironment can have a dramatic impact on the growth and progression of malignant cells in vivo. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as co-receptors for numerous heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines and are thus key regulators of cell signaling (1Selva E.M. Perrimon N. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that growth factor binding to heparan sulfate and the resulting mitogenic activity occur only when specific structural features are present within the heparan sulfate chains. These features include sulfation at specific positions within a disaccharide (N,2-O,3-O,6-O) by the enzymes that orchestrate heparan sulfate synthesis within the Golgi (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). However, recent studies show that following its synthesis and expression, heparan sulfate can also be structurally and functionally modified within the extracellular compartment. The two enzymes presently known to have these effects are heparanase, which cleaves heparan sulfate chains into small, biologically active fragments, and the heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases (Sulfs). 2The abbreviations used are: Sulfheparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfataseAPalkaline phosphataseECMextracellular matrixEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseFGFfibroblast growth factorFR1cfibroblast growth factor receptor 1cHGFhepatocyte growth factorHSheparan sulfateHSulfhuman SulfPBSphosphate buffered salineQSulfquail SulfSCIDsevere combined immunodeficient (mice). Sulfs represent a newly discovered family of enzymes that are secreted via the Golgi and become localized to the cell surface or are released into the extracellular matrix. These enzymes selectively remove the 6-O-sulfate groups from heparan sulfate with preference for the 6-O-sulfates present on trisulfated disaccharides (3Viviano B.L. Paine-Saunders S. Gasiunas N.

The first member of the endosulfatase family to be described was sulfatase-1 from quail (QSulf1), where the activity of this enzyme is required for Wnt-mediated signaling in developing muscle (5Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In separate studies, Qsulf1 was shown to restore bone morphogenetic protein signaling in cells by releasing its functional inhibitor, Noggin, from cell surfaces (3Viviano B.L. Paine-Saunders S. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Saunders S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5604-5611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, QSulf1 can also inhibit growth factor signaling, as removal of the 6-O-sulfation required for the formation of the FGF·HS·FR1c ternary complex blocks FGF2 signaling (6Wang S. Ai X.

Thus, the Sulfs can have activities that promote or inhibit growth factor signaling depending on the specific factor involved. In addition to quail, the Sulf-1 enzyme has also been cloned from rat, mouse, and human, and a second family member, Sulf-2, has been cloned from both mouse and humans (7Morimoto-Tomita M.

Sulf-2 is very similar in structural organization to Sulf-1 but is somewhat divergent in sequence identity (64%) in humans. Both Sulf-1 and Sulf-2 show high specificity for 6-O-sulfates of the trisulfated disaccharides of heparin at neutral pH (7Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Analysis of human tumor tissue and tumor cell lines suggests that HSulf-1 is misregulated in cancer. HSulf-1 is present in a variety of normal tissues but is down-regulated in tumor cell lines originating from ovarian, breast, pancreatic, renal, and hepatocellular carcinoma (9Lai J. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Greene E.L. Matthews T.A. Smith D.I. Kaufmann S.H. Roberts L.R. Shridhar V. J. Biol.

Re-expression of HSulf-1 in an ovarian cell line diminishes FGF-2 and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) signaling and cell proliferation in vitro and enhances drug-induced apoptosis (9Lai J.

Further evidence of the role of HSulf-1 as a negative regulator of tumor cell growth was also found in cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In these cells, expression of HSulf-1 inhibits growth as well as HGF signaling, resulting in inhibition of tumor cell motility and invasion in vitro (10Lai J.P. Chien J. Strome S.E. Staub J.

In tumor tissues harvested from cancer patients, HSulf-1 is sometimes elevated and sometimes diminished as compared with normal tissue, leaving open the question of the role of this enzyme in tumorigenesis and progression in vivo (9Lai J.

To directly assess the effect of Sulf expression on tumor growth in vivo, we implanted human myeloma cells transfected with the cDNA for either HSulf-1 or HSulf-2 into SCID mice. Expression of Sulfs has no effect on tumor cell growth in vitro, but in vivo we find that enhanced Sulf expression dramatically and consistently inhibits growth of these tumors. Tumors formed by cells expressing Sulf exhibit evidence of enhanced extracellular matrix deposition, yet they are unable to assemble the FGF-2 ternary signaling complex on the tumor cell surface. We conclude that 6-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate by myeloma tumor cells is a critical determining factor regulating the in vivo growth of this cancer. Cells and Transfections—CAG cells were established from a bone marrow aspirate of a myeloma patient at our center as described previously (13Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line secretes human κ light chain, is Epstein-Barr virus negative, and will form tumors when injected subcutaneously in SCID mice (14Yang Y. Macleod V. Bendre M. Huang Y. Theus A.M.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-) vector containing the coding region of HSulf-1 or HSulf-2, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. Steven D. Rosen (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (7Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To insert the HSulf-1 or HSulf-2 coding region into the expression plasmid pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), the full-length DNA fragments were amplified by PCR of pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-) vectors. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-GCCCTCTAGACTCGAGACAATGAAGTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGTTAACCTTCCCATCCATCCCATA-3′ (reverse) for HSulf-1 and 5′-GTTTAAACGGGCCCTCTAGACTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTAGAAATTAACCTTCCCAGCCTTCC-3′ (reverse) for HSulf-2. The XhoI restriction site shown in boldface type was introduced into the forward primers, and the stop codons of HSulf-1 and HSulf-2 were restored in the reverse primers. The Expand long template PCR System (Roche Applied Science) was applied in the PCR procedure. Briefly, after initial denaturation, PCR was carried out for the first 10 cycles (94 °C for 10 s; 55 °C for 30 s; and 68 °C for 2 min per cycle) and then for another 25 cycles (94 °C for 15 s; 55 °C for 30 s; and 68 °C for 2 min + 5 s per cycle). PCR products were purified from 1% low melting temperature agarose gels (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). The constructs were confirmed by sequencing and then digested with XhoI and SalI. The digested HSulf-1 and HSulf-2 cDNAs were again purified from 1% low melting temperature agarose and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pIRES2-EGFP, and the inserts were confirmed by sequencing. The pIRES2-EGFP/HSulf-1 or pIRES2-EGFP/HSulf-2 construct (10 μg of DNA) or, as a control, the pIRES2-EGFP vector containing no insert was transfected into the CAG cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Once cell numbers reached 2.0 × 107, both the sulfatase transfectants and control transfectants were sorted by flow cytometry using EGFP expression. Over time, at least three sortings were performed to enhance the population of fluorescent cells. All experiments were performed using populations of cells that had a minimum of 70% cells expressing EGFP. Analysis of Heparan Sulfate Disaccharide Composition—Cells (1 × 107) were harvested and then treated with 70 μg of bacterial heparinase III in 2.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C on a shaker for 1 h. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants were collected, boiled for 15 min, and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The heparan sulfate fragments in the supernatants released by heparinase III digestion were digested overnight at 37 °C with proteinase K. After digestion, residual fragments were extracted via the addition of 1 volume of phenol/chloroform. The aqueous layer containing the heparan sulfate fragments was dried via Speed Vac and resuspended in water. Further digestion of heparan sulfate to disaccharides was accomplished using a mixture of heparinases I–III obtained via recombinant expression of the enzymes in Escherichia coli. Four hundred milliunits of each enzyme were added to the aqueous heparan sulfate material and incubated overnight at 30 °C. The material was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using a high sensitivity flow cell in reverse polarity under conditions of electrophoretic flow with minimal electroendosmotic flow (15Rhomberg A.J. Ernst S. Sasisekharan R. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4176-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for Heparan Sulfate—For immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval on slides was performed using citrate buffer solution (pH 6.0) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in a steamer for 20 min followed by blocking of endogenous peroxide with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. After blocking for 30 min with PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk, sections were incubated with monoclonal antibody 10E4 (Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA) (16David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) followed by biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Vector ABC solution was added to enhance sensitivity of detection. Peroxidase staining was visualized with a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) until the desired stain intensity developed, and the sections were lightly counterstained in Mayer's hematoxylin. Because 3% hydrogen peroxide can degrade heparan sulfates, as a control the tissues were also stained without the 3% hydrogen peroxide blocking step. Removal of the 3% hydrogen peroxide blocking step resulted in overall higher background staining but had no effect on the detection of relative levels of 10E4 staining as compared between control-transfected and HSulf-transfected cells (data not shown). For flow cytometry, cells (1.0 × 106) were harvested from culture, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 45 min on ice with a 1:50 dilution of mouse 10E4 antibody. After washing, cells were stained with 1:100 dilution of phycoerithrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgM for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—Cells in culture (3 × 106) were pelleted by centrifugation, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed on ice in T-PER™ tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce) with the protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide (5 mm), benzamidine (5 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (1 mm). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were frozen at -80 °C. Prior to Western blotting, protein concentrations of lysates were determined using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with polyclonal antibodies against Sulf-1 or Sulf-2 (kindly provided by Dr. Charles P. Emerson, Jr., Boston Biomedical Institute, Boston, MA). Following incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), immunoreactive bands were detected using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Tumor Growth in Vivo—For establishing subcutaneous tumors, control-transfected or Sulf-transfected cells (1.0 × 106) were suspended in 100 μl of PBS and injected subcutaneously into the left flanks of SCID mice. Tumor growth was monitored by visual inspection and by determination of κ light chain levels present in murine serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (17Yang Y. Yaccoby S. Liu W. Langford J.K. Pumphrey C.Y. Theus A. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed in duplicate simultaneously to preclude interassay variability. The standard curve was linear between 0.35 and 300 ng/ml, and samples were diluted to concentrations within this range. Seven weeks after the injection of tumor cells, the animals were euthanized, the primary tumor was excised, and the wet weight was determined. Tumor tissue was then divided, and a portion was immediately frozen at -80 °C. The remaining portion of tumor tissue was fixed in 10% formalin, pH 7.0, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histological examination or with Masson's trichrome stain for visualization of collagen. Analysis of FGF-2 Signaling—Determination of the ERK expression level was used as a reflection of FGF-2 mediated signaling in vitro. Cells (3.0 × 106) were serum starved for 12–15 h and treated with 2 ng/ml FGF-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 1 h at 37°C. Following treatment, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in T-PER™ tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce) with protease inhibitors as described above. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (80 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis on 4–12% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were washed once with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked with TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. The blocking solution was replaced with a fresh solution containing 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Inc., Beverly, MA). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the blot was washed three times for 10 min each in TBST and incubated with 1:2500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST at room temperature for 1 h. After washing four times in TBST, the proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were stripped with Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature and reprobed with 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-total-ERK (Cell Signaling Inc.) at 4 °C, overnight, followed by incubation with 1:2500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST at room temperature for 1 h. After washing four times in TBST, the proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence, and the bands were quantified using ImageJ 1.33u software (National Institutes of Health). Analysis of FGF-2 Binding and FGF-2·HS·FR1cAP Formation—For analysis of the assembly of the FGF-2·HS·FR1c signaling complex in situ, frozen sections (5 μm) of primary tumors were air-dried and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice. Sections were then incubated in PBS at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase (AP). Prior to the binding assays, sections were incubated with PBS containing 2 m NaCl to remove any endogenous FGFs that may have been bound to the heparan sulfate on the tissue sections. Samples were then blocked in binding buffer (PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm Mg2+, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h before the binding assays. First, to determine whether heparan sulfate levels were the same in tumors formed from control- and Sulf-transfected cells, total heparan sulfate distribution was estimated using the monoclonal antibody 3G10 (Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA), which recognizes the unsaturated uronic acid residue of heparan sulfate remaining on the core protein following heparin lyase digestion (16David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). For this purpose, sections were incubated with 10 milliunits/ml heparinase I and III (IBEX Technologies Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) in the binding buffer for 2 h at 37 °C before 3G10 detection (1:200) using the mouse on mouse (M. O. M.™) immunodetection kit from Vector Laboratories, Inc. This was followed by incubation with AP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate (Roche Applied Science) detection of alkaline phosphatase. Sections without prior heparinase treatment were used as the antibody control. To examine FGF-2 binding to tumor heparan sulfate, sections were incubated with 5 nm FGF-2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) in binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. For FGF-2·FR1c complex formation, 5 nm FGF-2 and 5 nm FR1cAP (see below) were added to the binding buffer together and applied to the sections for 1 h at room temperature. FR1cAP is a soluble FGF receptor 1c fusion protein that consists of the three extracellular Ig loop domains of the IIIc splice variant of FR1c fused to the NH2 terminus of human placental alkaline phosphatase (18Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The FR1cAP fusion protein was purified as described previously (19Allen B.L. Filla M.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and quantified based on its AP activity (20Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Following incubation with FGF-2 or FGF-2 and FR1cAP, sections were washed three times in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. Bound FGF-2 was detected with DE6 anti-FGF-2 antibody (1:200, a gift of Dupont) followed by an AP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody. For detection of FGF-2·HS·FR1cAP complexes, sections were incubated directly with the AP substrate nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, which forms purple precipitates at the sites of AP activity. To confirm that the above binding assays were heparan sulfate-dependent, one set of sections was treated with heparinases I and III as described for 3G10 staining before the addition of FGF-2 or FGF-2·FR1cAP. HSulf-1 and HSulf-2 Remove 6-O-Sulfates from the Surface of Myeloma Cells and Attenuate FGF-2 Signaling in Vitro—CAG myeloma cells were transfected with vector containing the cDNA for either HSulf-1 or HSulf-2. Following multiple rounds of selection, cell extracts and conditioned media from cultured cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Results show that both cells and media from HSulf-1 and HSulf-2 transfectants exhibit enhanced levels of enzyme as compared with controls transfected with empty vector alone (Fig. 1A). To determine whether Sulf expression alters heparan sulfate structure on the cell surface, the cells were stained with 10E4, an antibody specific for heparan sulfate chains (16David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that expression of Sulfs reduces the amount of 10E4 epitope detectable on the cell surface (4Ai X. Do A.T. Lozynska O. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Emerson Jr., C.P. J.

However, staining of the Sulf-transfected myeloma cells with antibody 10E4 indicated no difference in the level of staining between controls and cells expressing elevated levels of Sulfs (Fig. 1B). This result raised concern that the Sulfs may not be enzymatically active when expressed in myeloma cells. To directly test whether the Sulfs were active, the transfected cells were treated with bacterial heparinase III, and the released heparan sulfate fragments were analyzed for their disaccharide composition. As compared with control cells, the cells expressing either HSulf-1 or HSulf-2 exhibit a significant reduction (70 and 50%, respectively) in 6-O-sulfates present in ΔU2SHNS,6S trisulfated disaccharides with a concomitant increase in the amount of the disulfated disaccharide ΔU2SHNS (TABLE ONE). The overall levels of 6-O monosulfated (ΔUHNac,6S) and 6-O disulfated disaccharides (ΔUHNS,6S) show generally smaller reductions in their levels as compared with controls. These findings point to a general specificity of the HSulfs for the highly bioactive trisulfated disaccharides as has been described previously (3Viviano B.L. Paine-Saunders S. Gasiunas N.

https://openalex.org/W2158957820,"An increase in fat mass associated with obesity results from recruitment and differentiation of adipocyte progenitor cells. The precise origin of these cells is unknown, although accumulating evidence suggests that circulating stem cells can differentiate into cells of mesenchymal lineage. It is currently unclear whether a progenitor adipocyte population exists in circulation. One potential candidate is the fibrocyte, which may represent a common progenitor cell for several mesenchymal lineages. We demonstrate that these circulating progenitors become adipocytes when cultured under adipogenic conditions, with intracellular lipids accumulation and up-regulation of proteins specific for adipocyte differentiation, including leptin, PPARgamma, and FABP4. cDNA microarray analysis revealed gene clusters that were differentially regulated during adipogenesis of fibrocytes, which were similar to visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue preadipocyte-to-adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, these progenitors engrafted and formed human adipose tissue following injection into SCID mice. Although fibrocytes express an array of chemokine receptors, we observed an up-regulation of CCR2 expression following fibrocytes differentiation into adipocytes, which was associated with increased chemotactic response to CCL2. This paradigm supports the notion that elevated CCL2 levels in visceral adipose tissue associated with Metabolic Syndrome is a chemotactic niche, whereby fibrocytes can home to and differentiate into adipocytes to perpetuate its tissue formation."
https://openalex.org/W1997809789,"The virally encoded NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has emerged as a prime target in the search for specific HCV antivirals. A series of benzimidazole 5-carboxamide compounds inhibit the cellular RNA replication of a HCV subgenomic replicon and we have advanced our understanding of this class of inhibitors through a combination of complementary approaches that include biochemical cross-linking experiments with a photoreactive analogue followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the enzyme. A novel binding site has been localized for these inhibitors at the junction of the thumb domain and the N-terminal finger loop. Furthermore, the isolation and characterization of resistant replicon mutants that co-localize to this region distinguished this class of compounds from other non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors that bind to distinct allosteric sites. Resistant mutations that emerged with the benzimidazole 5-carboxamide and related compounds were found at three amino acid positions in the thumb domain: Pro(495) with substitutions to Ser, Leu, Ala, or Thr; Pro(496) substitutions to Ser or Ala; and a V499A substitution. Mutations at each of these positions conferred different levels of resistance to this drug class: the Pro(495) changes provided the greatest shifts in compound potency, followed by moderate changes in potency with the Pro(496) substitutions, and finally only minor shifts in potency with V499A. Combinations that include the benzimidazole 5-carboxamide polymerase inhibitors and compounds that bind other sites or other HCV targets, including HCV protease inhibitors, are complementary in cell culture models of HCV RNA replication at suppressing the emergence of resistant variants. This novel class of compounds and unique binding site expand the diversity of HCV antivirals currently under development and offer the potential to improve the treatment of chronic HCV infection."

We report molecular and reverse genetic characterization of two mosquito clip domain serine proteases, CLIPB14 and CLIPB15, which share structural similarity to proteases involved in prophenoloxidase activation in other insects. Both CLIPs are expressed in mosquito hemocytes and are transcriptionally induced by bacterial and Plasmodium challenges. Functional studies applying RNA interference revealed that both CLIPs are involved in the killing of Plasmodium ookinetes in Anopheles. Studies on parasite melanization demonstrated an additional role for CLIPB14 in the prophenoloxidase cascade. We further report that both CLIPs participate in defense toward Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings strongly suggest that clip domain serine proteases serve multiple functions and play distinctive roles in several immune pathways of A. gambiae. The malaria vector Anopheles gambiae is capable of multiple immune responses against Plasmodium ookinetes. Accumulating evidence in several insect species suggests the involvement of serine protease cascades in the initiation and coordination of immune responses.

Specific CLIPs have been shown to process immune signals rapidly, leading to localized reactions such as hemolymph clotting in the horseshoe crab (1Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin.

Melanization is a potent insect defense response, in which activation of a serine protease cascade leads to proteolytic conversion of prophenoloxidase (PPO) into active phenoloxidase (PO). In turn, PO catalyzes the formation of quinone reactive intermediates for melanin synthesis (10Cerenius L. Soderhall K. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), which serves several protective functions. CLIPs involved in PPO activation have been well studied in some insect species. They share common structural features including a regulatory N-terminal clip domain and a C-terminal catalytic serine protease domain that contains the catalytic triad His, Asp, Ser as well as a relatively conserved activation cleavage site R(I/V)XXG and two additional cysteine residues positioned after the catalytic His (5Lee S.Y.

In certain genetic backgrounds of Anopheles gambiae (the major vector of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa), notably the L3-5 strain, activation of the PPO cascade leads to melanotic encapsulation of Plasmodium ookinetes as they egress from the midgut epithelium; this phenotype is a prime example of refractory mechanisms associated with a compromised parasite cycle (11Osta M.A. Christophides G.K. Kafatos F.C. Science. 2004; 303: 2030-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 12Collins F.H. Sakai R.K. Vernick K.D. Paskewitz S. Seeley D.C. Miller L.H. Collins W.E. Campbell C.C.

Cell. 2004; 116: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In susceptible strains such as G3, parasite melanization is absent or extremely rare. Previous bioinformatic analysis of the A. gambiae genome has allowed identification of 41 genes encoding CLIPs, which were classified into four subfamilies, A, B, C, and D, according to distinct sequence signatures (14Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G. Lycett G. Meister S. Michel K. Moita L.F. Muller H.M. Osta M.A. Paskewitz S.M. Reichhart J.M. Rzhetsky A. Troxler L. Vernick K.D. Vlachou D. Volz J. von Mering C. Xu J. Zheng L. Bork P. Kafatos F.C. Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Strikingly, A. gambiae subfamily B members share significant features with known insect CLIPs involved in PPO activation. Transcriptional profiling of RNA extracted from whole mosquitoes revealed that two CLIPs, CLIPB14 and CLIPB15, are strongly induced by Plasmodium as well as microbial challenge (15Christophides G.K. Vlachou D. Kafatos F.C. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may be central players in mosquito innate immune responses. Here, we report the molecular and functional characterization of A. gambiae CLIPB14 and CLIPB15. Both CLIPs are expressed exclusively in mosquito hemocytes, from which they are secreted into the hemolymph. Functional analysis by our validated dsRNA knockdown procedure (11Osta M.A. Christophides G.K. Kafatos F.C. Science. 2004; 303: 2030-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 16Blandin S. Moita L.F. Kocher T. Wilm M. Kafatos F.C. Levashina E.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) revealed that both are involved in parasite killing in the susceptible (G3) as well as refractory (L3-5) strains. Silencing the respective genes, singly or jointly, induced a significant increase in the number of developing oocysts in G3 and of melanized ookinetes in L3-5 mosquitoes. Interestingly, neither CLIPB14 nor CLIPB15 silencing prevented ookinete melanization in L3-5 mosquitoes, indicating that these CLIPs do not function in the melanization response of that strain. To explore whether these genes are involved in melanization in a different genetic background, we used as a model the melanizing CTL4 knockdown G3 mosquitoes (11Osta M.A. Christophides G.K. Kafatos F.C. Science. 2004; 303: 2030-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Double knockdown studies of CTL4 and CLIPB14 revealed a substantial reduction in the proportion of melanized ookinetes and a corresponding increase in the proportion of developing, non-melanized parasites. These phenomena were not observed in CTL4/CLIPB15 double knockdowns. Thus, in certain genetic backgrounds, CLIPB14 is indeed specifically involved in the melanization response to Plasmodium berghei ookinetes. In L3-5 mosquitoes, ookinete melanization may either involve different CLIPs or be promoted by a chronic state of oxidative stress as suggested previously (17Kumar S. Christophides G.K. Cantera R. Charles B. Han Y.S. Meister S. Dimopoulos G. Kafatos F.C. Barillas-Mury C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14139-14144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also demonstrate that CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 are involved in defense against Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria. Taken together, our findings suggest that individual CLIPs can serve multiple reactions, suggesting the existence of cross-talk between distinct mosquito immune responses. Mosquito Rearing and P. berghei Infections—Mosquito rearing and parasite infections were performed essentially as described previously (18Richman A.M. Dimopoulos G. Seeley D. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6114-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A P. berghei (ANKA strain) clone expressing GFP constitutively under control of the ef-1 promoter (19Franke-Fayard B. Trueman H. Ramesar J. Mendoza J. van der Keur M. van der Linden R. Sinden R. Waters A. Janse C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) was passaged in CD1 mice. Parasitemias of infected mice were determined from Giemsa-stained blood films. Double-stranded RNA Preparation and Parasite Survival Assays—Double-stranded RNA was prepared as described previously (16Blandin S. Moita L.F. Kocher T. Wilm M. Kafatos F.C. Levashina E.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) using the pll6 vector for expression of control dsGFP and the modified pll10 vector for expressing cloned gene fragments of interest: a 590-bp sequence of CLIPB14 (nucleotide positions 569-1159) or a 546-bp sequence of CLIPB15 (nucleotide positions 542-1088) flanked by two T7 promoters. These fragments were obtained by amplification of CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 full-length clones with the following primers containing restriction sites XhoI (5′) and HindIII (3′): CLIPB14, Fwd 5′-CCC CCT CGA GGA CTG CAA GCA GGT CAA AGG C-3′ and Rev 5′-TAT CAA GCT TTC CAC GGA ACA TCT CCC G-3′; CLIPB15, Fwd 5′-CCC CCT CGA GAC GGA GAA CGA TGA GAG GTC-3′ and Rev 5′-TAT CAA GCT TGC TCC ACA AAC ATA ACC G-3′. In each of the RNA interference experiments (see TABLE ONE), mosquitoes of all tested genotypes were fed on the same P. berghei-infected mouse 4 days after dsRNA injection, and midguts were dissected and fixed 5-7 days later. Oocysts were counted using a UV-light fluorescence microscope, and melanized parasites were counted by light microscopy (Zeiss).TABLE ONENumbers of melanized ookinetes and developing oocysts in gene knockdown mosquitoes Knockdowns were performed in mosquitoes of the susceptible G3 strain (Exp. A-C) or the refractory L3-5 strain (Exp. D). In each experiment, controls were dsGFP mosquitoes processed in parallel, except for experiment C where dsCTL4 served as the control for the double knockdowns. The data sets of experiments A-D include the pooled results of 13, 4, 4, and 7 replicates. Each replicate used different batches of dsRNA and mosquitoes and yet gave comparative results. In each replicate, mosquitoes of all genotypes were fed on the same infected mouse, permitting critical comparison of control and experimental numbers. Mg, number of midguts; TP, total number of parasites; OC, number of oocysts; ML, number of melanized ookinetes. The mean numbers of total parasites, oocysts, and melanized ookinetes per midgut and the associated probabilities (P) are indicated by subscripts. The probabilities that the distribution of numbers in control and experimental samples is actually similar were determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.StrainExp.KnockdownsMgTPMeanTPPTPOCMeanOCPOCMLMeanMLPMLG3AGFP15091956191866190.05CLIPB1415025257168<0.00125249168<0.00180.051.0CLIPB1515017777119<0.00117770119<0.00170.041.0BGFP5827454727384750.09CLIPB14589814169<0.0019813169<0.00110.020.99CLIPB15586209107<0.0016205107<0.00140.071.0CLIPB14/B15584797830.0574793830.05740.070.99CGFP4627906127886120.04CLIPB144674081610.00574081610.00500.01.0CLIPB154658061260.02258031260.02230.071.0CTL43556531620.01489517.9475895CTL4/CLIPB14469182200<0.0017101154<0.0012081450.002CTL4/CLIPB154669611510.00557413.00.13963871390.952L3–5DGFP561429630.05142626CLIPB1456291452<0.001310.60.9912883520.000CLIPB1556500689<0.001250.50.7864981890.000CLIPB14/B15569801175<0.001220.40.99197771750.000 Open table in a new tab RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR—Total RNA from whole mosquitoes or dissected tissues was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript™II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. Specific primers were designed using the Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems): CLIPB14, Fwd 5′-CAC TGT TTC ACC GCA GCA AA-3′ and Rev 5′-GCG CAC CGA GTG GAT TTT-3′; CLIPB15, Fwd 5′-ACC GAA CTG GAA GCT GCT TTA C-3′ and Rev 5′-TTC TCC GTG GTG CAA TTA TCC-3′; ribosomal S7, Fwd 5′-GTG CGC GAG TTG GAG AAG A-3′ and Rev 5′-ATC GGT TTG GGC AGA ATG C-3′. The PCR reactions were assembled using SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix and run in the ABI Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For time point analysis, 20-25 midguts were dissected, and the remaining carcasses were collected from mosquitoes every 3 h between 18-30 h after blood feeding or Plasmodium infection in two independent biological experiments. For time point analysis of bacteria-challenged mosquitoes, 20-25 intact mosquitoes were collected 2, 4, 6, and 12 h after challenge in two independent biological experiments. The efficiency of the CLIP knockdown was analyzed by collection of intact dsCLIPB14, dsCLIPB15, and control dsGFP-treated mosquitoes 4 days after dsRNA injection. For semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis total RNA from various mosquito developmental stages was purified as described previously (20Muller H.M. Dimopoulos G. Blass C. Kafatos F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11727-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and first strand synthesis and semiquantitative RT-PCR were performed (21Danielli A. Kafatos F.C. Loukeris T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4184-4193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The ribosomal gene S7 was amplified in a separate tube and served as internal control for normalization. After electrophoresis on agarose, gels were stained with the sensitive SYBR green dye (Molecular Probes) for 45 min and analyzed with a fluorescence imager (Fuji FLA-2000). The primer sequences and corresponding annealing temperatures in the RT-PCR experiments were as follows: S7 (60 °C), Fwd 5′-GGC GAT CAT CAT CTA CGT-3′ and Rev 5′-GTA GCT GCT GCA AAC TTC GG-3′; CLIPB14 (60 °C), Fwd 5′-TGT GGT TTG CTT TGC TTG CTG-3′ and Rev 5′-CTT GCT CTT TGC TGC GGT GAA-3′; CLIPB15 (60 °C), Fwd 5′-GGA GAC TCC GGT GGA CCG CTG ATG CG-3′ and Rev 5′-CCA CAT TGT AGA AAG CAT ATC ATA C-3′. Cloning and Sequencing—Prior to the genome release, gene-specific amplification primers were available based on the A. gambiae expressed sequence tag sequence 4A3B-aad-d-12-3′ for CLIPB14 and 4A3B-aad-b-06-3′ for CLIPB15 (22Dimopoulos G. Casavant T.L. Chang S. Scheetz T. Roberts C. Donohue M. Schultz J. Benes V. Bork P. Ansorge W. Soares M.B. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6619-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Partial sequences of the protease domain of these CLIPs including the His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad sequence were amplified out of the ZAP Express vector from a pool of the A. gambiae cell line cDNA library 4a-2/3B using the T3 primer and the corresponding reverse expressed sequence tag primers (see above). For CLIPB15, this fragment (1037 bp) was used directly as a probe to screen the cDNA library. For CLIPB14, a new sequence-specific primer was generated (5′-GGG CGA CGT CGT AAT CCT TCC GGC-3′) based on the obtained sequence and was used with a T3 primer to amplify a 584-bp fragment; the latter was used to screen the cDNA library. The isolated CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 clones contained full-length sequences of 1242 and 1158 bp, respectively (GenBank™ accession numbers CAB90819 (CLIPB14) and CAB90818 (CLIPB15)), which were confirmed later by whole genome analysis (14Christophides G.K.

Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Generation of Polyclonal CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 Antiserum—CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 sequence-specific primers were designed for PCR amplification of the complete protease domain using as template full-length sequences subcloned in pBK-CMV phagemid vectors. Forward and reverse primers contained NcoI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, corresponding to cloning sites within the pETM11 protein expression vector. The CLIPB14 primers were: Fwd, 5′-CGC CGG TCT CCC ATG GTC ATC GGT GGC AAC GAT-3′ and Rev, 5′-GGT GCT CGA GTT ACG CCA AAA TTC CAC G-3′. The CLIPB15 primers were: Fwd, 5′-GGC GCC ATG GTC TAC TTC GGC GAG GAA ACG-3′ and Rev, 5′-GGT GCT CGA GTT ACA AAT ATC GCT CCT C-3′. PCR products were digested with NcoI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pETM11. Fusion proteins containing an N-terminal His tag were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified as described previously (23Schrödel A. Volz J. De Marco A. J. Biotechnol. 2005; 120: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) followed by tobacco etch virus cleavage to remove the His tag. For each protein, three rats were immunized with 40 μg of protein each using R-700 adjuvants (RIBI Immunochem Research, Inc.) and were boosted every third week until the final bleed. Immunoblotting—Hemolymph was collected into Schneider medium (without fetal calf serum and protease inhibitors) by proboscis clipping, and the serum after pelleting hemocytes was used for protein analysis (shown in Fig. 2F). Alternatively, hemolymph including hemocytes was collected directly into SDS loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% milk, and detected using CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 antisera at 1:1000 dilution. Anti-rat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega) was used as secondary antibody (1:10,000), and blots were developed using Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 analysis, protein loading and efficient transfer were monitored by blot staining with Coomassie. Hemolymph was collected into PBS containing a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) and treated with N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (24Levashina E.A. Moita L.F. Blandin S. Vriend G. Lagueux M. Kafatos F.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) to cleave off putative asparagine-linked glycan chains of the CLIPs. Immunostaining—Hemocytes were collected in chilled 5-μl Schneider medium (without fetal calf serum and protease inhibitors) on a glass slide by proboscis clipping. After settling for 15 min, hemocytes were fixed in PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After treatment with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 5 min, samples were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Primary rat antibody against CLIPB14 1:500, rat antibody against CLIPB15 1:500, and rabbit antibody against PPO6 1:500 (20Muller H.M. Dimopoulos G. Blass C. Kafatos F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11727-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) were added, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and treated with secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory, 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Applied Science, 1:2000), and samples were mounted with Dabco/Moviol. For sectioning, mosquito abdomens were cut off, fixed for 3 h in ice-cold PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, incubated for 2 h in a 1:1 paraffin/xylene emulsion at 42 °C, changed to fresh paraffin at 60 °C, incubated overnight, and embedded at 4 °C. Sagittal sections (6 μm) were taken using a microtome (Microm HM310) and stretched on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and allowed to dry overnight at 42 °C. After paraffin removal and rehydration of the samples, antigens were unmasked by the high temperature technique by cooking glass slides in unmasking solution (0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6.4) for 20 min in a 600-watt microwave oven. Samples were blocked (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, 5% goat serum in PBS) for 1 h and subjected to immunostaining. Mosquito Survival Assays—Mosquito survival assays were performed as described previously (16Blandin S. Moita L.F. Kocher T. Wilm M. Kafatos F.C. Levashina E.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, mosquitoes were injected with 69 nl of E. coli (A600 = 0.005) or Staphylococcus aureus (A600 = 0.4) suspensions in PBS 4 days after injection of dsRNA; their survival was followed up to 7 days after challenge. Cloning and Molecular Characterization of CLIPB14 and CLIPB15—To obtain full-length sequences of CLIPB14 and CLIPB15, a cDNA library (4a-2/3B) constructed from an A. gambiae cell line was screened with CLIPB14- and CLIPB15-specific probes that were amplified from the same cDNA library, using a gene-specific reverse primer and a T3 primer. This allowed the identification of full-length CLIPB14 (1242 bp) and CLIPB15 (1158 bp) clones, corresponding to the predicted cDNA sequences (14Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E. Barillas-Mury C. Birney E. Blandin S. Blass C. Brey P.T. Collins F.H. Danielli A. Dimopoulos G. Hetru C. Hoa N.T. Hoffmann J.A. Kanzok S.M. Letunic I. Levashina E.A. Loukeris T.G. Lycett G. Meister S. Michel K.

Science. 2002; 298: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 belong to subfamily B clip domain serine proteases, which are most similar in sequence architecture to the known PPO-activating CLIPs (5Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M.

Rev. 2004; 198: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) of Holotrichia diomphalia, Bombyx mori, and Manduca sexta (Fig. 1A). Protein sequence alignment of CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 reveals that they share ∼40% sequence identity (Fig. 1B). Both proteins contain the catalytic serine protease triad as well as all conserved cysteine residues. Several predicted N-glycosylation sites suggest that CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 are glycosylated proteins. Developmental Expression—Expression analysis in mosquito developmental stages revealed that CLIPB14 is strongly expressed in adult females; only modest expression is detected in the second and third larval as well as pupal stages. (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the CLIPB15 transcript is detected throughout development and is relatively abundant in the late larval and pupal stages. The presence of CLIPB15 transcripts in freshly laid eggs indicates additional maternal inheritance. CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 Are Hemocyte-specific—To identify the immune tissues that synthesize CLIPB14 and CLIPB15, we utilized paraffin-embedded sections prepared from whole mosquitoes 30 h after blood feeding (Fig. 2B). Immunostainings indicated that both CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 are produced by a subpopulation of mosquito hemocytes that also stain positive for PPO (Fig. 2C, lower panels). Some of the circulating hemocytes in hemolymph, harvested by proboscis clipping, also expressed these CLIPs, which invariably co-localized with PPO (Fig. 2D, left upper and lower panels). No CLIPB14 or CLIPB15 expression was observed in pericardial cells, the midgut epithelial layer, fat body cells, muscle cells, or ovaries (data not shown). Thus, in adult mosquitoes CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 are produced exclusively by the hemocyte subpopulation that produces PPO. These CLIPs were almost completely absent from hemocytes isolated from CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 knockdown mosquitoes, respectively (Fig. 2D, right upper and lower panels). At the transcript level, the efficiency of the knockdown was confirmed 4 days after dsRNA injection in G3 mosquitoes and was on the order of 90% for both genes (Fig. 2E). No cross-silencing was observed between CLIPB14 and -B15, confirming that the knockdowns are gene-specific (data not shown). Reproducibility of silencing at the RNA level was confirmed by use of two different preparations of dsRNA with consistent results in both the G3 and L3-5 strains. The predicted sequences of CLIPB14 and CLIPB15 reveal the presence of a signal peptide, suggesting that these proteins are secreted (Fig. 1B). We confirmed this prediction by detecting both proteins in immunoblots on hemolymph extracted from adult female mosquitoes, which was separated from hemocytes. Immunoblots with the CLIPB14 antibody reveal a major band at 55 kDa and two weaker bands at 80 and 37 kDa (Fig. 2F, left lane). These bands are specific, as they are significantly reduced in hemolymph extracts from CLIPB14 knockdown mosquitoes (Fig. 2G, left panel and data not shown). The 55-kDa band that represents full-length CLIPB14 is larger than the theoretical mass of the predicted protein (41.1 kDa), suggesting that the native protein might be glycosylated. The sequence predicted four N-glycosylation sites in CLIPB14 (Fig. 1B), but hemolymph treatment with N-glycosidase F induced only a slight reduction in the size of full-length CLIPB14. This suggests that N-linked glycosylation is not the major contributor to the increased apparent size of the protein detected in immunoblots (Fig. 2H, lanes 1 and 2). The weaker 80-kDa band (Fig. 2F) may represent a stable protein complex involving CLIPB14; it is known that serine proteases associate with serpins to form SDS-resistant complexes (25Tong Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14932-14942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Tong Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14923-14931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The 37-kDa band may represent a cleaved form of CLIPB14. Similarly, the CLIPB15 antibody recognizes a major band at 45 kDa corresponding to full-length CLIPB15 and minor bands of lower apparent molecular mass, most probably corresponding to cleavage forms (Fig. 2F, right lane). The slower mobility of CLIPB15 relative to the theoretical mass of the predicted protein (40.6 kDa) could well be attributed to N-linked glycosylation, as a significant reduction in apparent size occurs after treatment with N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2H, lanes 3 and 4). The abundance of CLIPB15 is significantly and reproducibly reduced in hemolymph from CLIPB15 knockdown mosquitoes (Fig. 2G, right panel).

Seven mammalian STATs have been identified. Their structural organization is known in molecular detail from several crystal structures. At the N terminus they contain a helical domain, which mediates cooperative binding of STATs to sequential DNA binding sites (2Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The structures of the phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 core fragments, lacking the N-terminal domain as well as the C-terminal transactivation domain, were solved in complex with DNA (3Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 4Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). They consist of an N-terminal large four-helix bundle, a central IgG-like domain, which constitutes the actual DNA binding domain, a helical, so-called linker domain, and the SH2 domain. The phosphotyrosine residue is located in all mammalian STATs within the 30 amino acids C-terminal to the SH2 domain. In most mammalian STATs the C-terminal part is constituted by a mostly disordered transactivation domain, which mediates the interactions of STATs with other components of the transcription machinery. Three-dimensional information for this domain so far has only been obtained from the complex of a short fragment of the STAT6 transactivation domain with the PAS-B domain of the nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (5Razeto A. Ramakrishnan V. Litterst C.M. Giller K. Griesinger C. Carlomagno T. Lakomek N. Heimburg T. Lodrini M. Pfitzner E. Becker S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). STAT3 homodimers and STAT3-STAT1 complexes have been co-immunoprecipitated from untreated cells (6Novak U. Ji H. Kanagasundaram V. Simpson R. Paradiso L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Haan S. Kortylewski M. Behrmann I. Muller-Esterl W. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Next, large multiprotein complexes containing STAT3 were identified (8Ndubuisi M.I. Guo G.G. Fried V.A. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25499-25509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, FRET measurements with STAT3 (9Kretzschmar A.K. Dinger M.C. Henze C. Brocke-Heidrich K. Horn F. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) demonstrated that at least a part of it should already be dimeric before activation. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer measurements additionally suggested that STAT3 should undergo strong conformational changes upon phosphorylation (10Schroder M. Kroeger K.M. Volk H.D. Eidne K.A. Grutz G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently the crystal structure of unphosphorylated STAT1, lacking only the transactivation domain, has been solved (11Mao X. Ren Z. Parker G.N. Sondermann H. Pastorello M.A. Wang W. McMurray J.S. Demeler B. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chen X. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this structure the N-terminal domains seem to stabilize the interaction between the core fragments, well in agreement with these biochemical and cell biological data. The connecting region between the N-terminal domain and the core fragment is not visible in the STAT1 structure, resulting in two possible dimerization modes of the two proteins because of their tetrameric arrangement in the crystal. In one mode the two core domains are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, employing the four-helix bundle domain and the β-barrel domain of the monomers to form the interface. The second mode of dimerization involves a parallel arrangement of the STAT1 core fragments, which puts the SH2 domains on the same end of the dimer. Functional relevance has been attributed to both dimerization modes with respect to interaction with the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors and dephosphorylation by phosphatases (12Zhong M. Henriksen M.A. Takeuchi K. Schaefer O. Liu B. ten Hoeve J. Ren Z. Mao X. Chen X. Shuai K. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of an unphosphorylated mouse STAT5a core fragment, lacking both the N-terminal and the transactivation domains. The structure of this fragment shows an antiparallel dimerization mode very similar to the one found for STAT1. We present a docking model for the N-terminal domains onto this dimer assuming preservation of the overall 2-fold symmetry. We also performed live cell FRET measurements, which demonstrate the separation of the N-terminal domains following activation and nuclear translocation of STAT5a. Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNA encoding fragment 129-712 of mouse STAT5a was cloned into the expression vector pET32a (Novagen) to express the STAT5a fragment without a tag. This expression construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Protein expression was carried out at 23 °C after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 8 h after induction and purified according to the protocol established for STAT3β (13Becker S. Corthals G.L. Aebersold R. Groner B. Muller C.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cell lysis nucleic acids were first removed by precipitation with polyethyleneimine (0.1% final). Next the STAT5a fragment was precipitated with 35% saturated (NH4)2SO4. Then the protein was sequentially purified by hydrophobic interaction on a phenyl Superose column (Amersham Biosciences) and by affinity chromatography on a heparin column (Amersham Biosciences). Before crystallization a final gel filtration on a Superdex200 column (Amersham Biosciences) was performed. Crystallization and Data Collection—STAT5a crystallized at 20 °C in hanging drops containing equal volumes of well solutions (1.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) and protein solution containing 7 mg/ml protein (in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Crystals grew over 2 weeks and were harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in a freezing buffer containing 30% glycerol, 1.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2. Data were collected at BESSY Berlin (BL2, Mar image plate detector) and processed using the program XDS (14Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The STAT5a core fragment crystallizes in the space group C2, with 3 molecules per asymmetric unit. The structure has been solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (15Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) using the STAT3β model (Protein Data Bank entry 1BG1) after removing the DNA and water molecules. Density modifications were performed with RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) allowing good quality maps because of the high solvent content (72%). Refinement took advantage of 3-fold noncrystallographic symmetry and was performed at all stages with REFMAC5 (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) to a final R-factor/R-free of 0.266/0.299 (TABLE ONE). Model building was carried out with Coot (18Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) and XtalView (19McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The final model contains no Ramachandran violations and has 80.2% of dihedral angles in the most favored, 17.6% in the additionally allowed, and 2.2% in the generally allowed regions (20Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular figures were created with Pymol (pymol.sourceforge.net/), and the electrostatic potential surfaces were generated with DELPHI (21Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Docking—The docking has been done using DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer 3.7 (www.expasy.org/spdbv) for pre-orienting the two dimers. The final orientation has been obtained with the docking function of Hex 4.2 (22Ritchie D.W. Proteins. 2003; 52: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with the search rotation range of 45 for both dimers. Live Cell FRET Microscopy Experiments—NIH3T3 cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h cells were transfected with plasmids coding for CFP-STAT5a, YFP-STAT5a (23Litterst C.M. Kliem S. Marilley D. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45340-45351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the prolactin receptor, CFP and YFP, or with the positive control construct pECFP-15AA-EYFP using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells co-expressing CFP and YFP were used as a negative control. After expression for 16-20 h, FRET measurements were performed using an inverted microscope (Axiovert200, Zeiss) equipped with a 37 °C thermostated incubator, a 5% CO2-air mix system, and a 532-nm laser for acceptor photobleaching. CFP was detected using a filter set composed of an excitation filter of 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm, and an emission filter of 480/40 nm; for YFP an excitation filter of 500/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 515 nm, and an emission filter of 535/30 nm were used. The FRET filter set consisted of an excitation filter of 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm, and an emission filter of 535/30 nm. Images were acquired using a cooled charge-coupled device camera and the Metamorph software. The results were analyzed using the program Imspector (provided by Andreas Schönle). For analysis, the images were corrected for background, pixel shift, and CFP bleed-through into the YFP channel. The normalized FRET values (NFRET) were calculated according to the following equation (24Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), NFRET = (IFRET - IYFP × y - ICFP × z)/v(IYFP × ICFP) where IFRET, IYFP, and ICFP correspond to the FRET, the CFP, and the YFP images, respectively, and y and z correspond to YFP and CFP bleed-through emissions into the FRET images. In this way the FRET signal was also normalized for the protein expression levels. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—HeLa cells overexpressing STAT5a and the prolactin (PRL) receptor were stimulated with PRL (5 μg/ml) for 10 min or left untreated. Whole cell extract was prepared as described previously (25Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a single STAT5 binding site from the β-casein promoter was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction for the whole cell extract was performed as described previously (26Pfitzner E. Kirfel J. Becker P. Rolke A. Schule R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using 8 μg of whole cell extract and 50,000 cpm (corresponding to ∼0.5 ng) of labeled probe. In the binding reaction for the recombinant STAT5a core fragment 0.3 μg of the protein was also combined with 8 μg of whole cell extract from unstimulated cells to allow for comparable assay conditions. Competition experiments were performed by adding unlabeled oligonucleotides representing the STAT5 binding site of the β-casein promoter or the STAT3 binding site of the c-fos promoter (SIE). Overall Structure—The core fragment of unphosphorylated STAT5a (residues 128-712) used for crystallization was chosen from an alignment with the STAT3 fragment that had been crystallized in complex with DNA (4Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Crystals of this core STAT5a fragment diffracted to 3.21-Å resolution using synchrotron radiation. In the crystal this unphosphorylated STAT5a fragment is packing as dimers with dimensions of 166 × 65 × 45 Å3 (Fig. 1A), whereas in solution, based on sizing by gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering, the unphosphorylated core STAT5a fragment is most likely monomeric (data not shown). A view perpendicular to the 2-fold axis of the dimer (Fig. 1B) shows a boat-like shape, with the linker domain and the SH2 domain of each monomer pointing to the same side of the dimer. Each monomer bears the general architecture already found in the phosphorylated STAT core fragments (Fig. 1A): an N-terminal four-helix bundle (residues 138-331), an eight-stranded β-barrel (residues 332-470), an α-helical linker domain (residues 471-592), and a SH2 domain (residues 593-712). The residues 128-137, 423-432, and 691-712 are not ordered, and they are not included in our model (the integrity of the purified STAT5a fragment was verified by mass spectrometry). The r.m.s. deviation of a superposition of the STAT5a monomer with the monomers of STAT1 and STAT3 is only 2.1 and 2.3 Å, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1a). A significant difference between the STAT5a and STAT1/STAT3 monomers is the bend of the long helices α1 and α2 in STAT5a compared with STAT1/STAT3 (secondary structure elements are denoted according to the STAT3β structure), probably as an effect of the dimerization. These two helices are also considerably longer in STAT5a. Next, in the β-barrel domain of STAT5a the long loop connecting strands βc and βx has been flipped over in the direction of the basal portion of the β-barrel. In its opposite orientation this loop interacts with DNA in the STAT1 and STAT3 structures. In STAT5 it may only have a stabilizing role and might not be essential for DNA recognition. Also the loop connecting strands βa and βb, which is involved in DNA binding in STAT3, is much shorter in STAT5a. Dimerization—Despite the limited resolution of the structure, the quality of the electron density (Fig. 2A) is sufficient to identify a number of weak polar interactions and weak hydrogen bonds between the monomers, which are consistent with the hydrophilic nature of the four-helix bundle as well as the β-barrel. Thus the dimer is mostly stabilized by an elaborate network of interactions between the β-barrel domains, which constitutes the central portion of the interface. These contacts are mediated through the side chains and backbones of the residues Asn-361, Val-362, His-363, Met-364, and Asn-365 belonging to the loop joining βb-βc as well as Ser-449 and Ser-452 belonging to the loop joining βf-βg (Fig. 2B). Additional weak H-bonds connect residues located on helices α1 and α3 of the N-terminal four-helix bundle and residues on strand βe of the eight-stranded β-barrel of each monomer. A similar network of polar interactions, most of them between the β-barrel domains, also stabilizes the antiparallel STAT1 dimer. Hydrophobic interactions at the STAT5a dimer interface are not quite as strong as in STAT1. Although the residues Val-389 and Leu-383, which are essential for the hydrophobic interactions at the interface of STAT1, are conserved in STAT5a (Val-402 and Leu-397), Phe-172 of STAT1 is replaced by Ile-174 in STAT5a. The arrangement of the STAT5a core fragments is very similar to the antiparallel dimerization mode of the STAT1a core fragments (r.m.s. deviation, 3.6 Å) (supplemental Fig. 1b), resulting in an interface of comparable size (1559 Å2 for STAT5 and 1504 Å2 for STAT1, as calculated with the program MSMS (27Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The third monomer in the asymmetric unit has crystal contacts with one of the monomers of the anti-parallel dimer, resulting in an interface of only 500 Å2. Although the size of the interface within the antiparallel dimer clearly points to biological relevance (28Ponstingl H. Henrick K. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 2000; 41: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), this can be clearly ruled out for the alternative interface. The third monomer is related via a 2-fold axis to the homologous monomer of the second asymmetric unit, forming again an antiparallel dimer with the same interface. The occurrence of this interface in the crystal structures of two different STATs strongly indicates that the antiparallel dimerization mode is relevant for the observed aggregates of unphosphorylated STATs (6Novak U.

Docking of the N-Terminal Domain Dimer—The arrangement of the core fragments in both dimerization modes of STAT1 shows 2-fold symmetry. On the other hand the arrangement of the N-terminal domain dimers with regard to the overall symmetry of the dimer is symmetric only in the parallel dimerization mode. In the antiparallel dimerization mode one N-terminal domain packs against the SH2 domain of one core domain, whereas the other N-terminal domain packs against the four-helix bundle of the second core domain, thus breaking the overall symmetry of the protein dimer. This breaking of the symmetry in the antiparallel arrangement might be due to crystallization because the intrinsic symmetry of the N-terminal domain, which is also found in the arrangement of the N-terminal domain of STAT4 (29Chen X. Bhandari R. Vinkemeier U. Akker Van Den F. Darnell J.E. Jr. & Kuriyan J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggests that these domains should have an identical chemical environment. A symmetric arrangement of the N-terminal domains with regard to the antiparallel core fragment dimer would be possible assuming coincidence of the 2-fold axes of both dimers. Based on this assumption we manually docked the STAT4 N-terminal domain into the groove formed by the helical bundles of the STAT5 core fragment monomers (Fig. 3A). Besides the substantial shape complementarities, the surface charge along the concave side of the STAT5a dimer is positive (Fig. 3B), whereas the surface charge of the STAT4 N-terminal domain around the 2-fold axis side is negative (Fig. 3B). This is also the case for the STAT1 core fragment and the STAT1 N-terminal domain. Thus, the two domains can be fitted exactly on the basis of shape and charge (Fig. 3). The distance between the N termini of the two STAT5a fragments in the dimer (50 Å) is in agreement with the distance between the C termini of the STAT4 N-terminal domains (60 Å). In the resulting model the C termini of the N-terminal domains have a distance of 15 Å from the N termini of the STAT5a core domains. In all mammalian STATs about 10 residues link the C terminus of the N-terminal domain and the N terminus of the core domain. The distance between the two domains in our docking model can be easily spanned by this number of residues. Live Cell FRET Measurements—Our docking model as well as both dimerization modes found in the structure of unphosphorylated STAT1 imply that during the rearrangement taking place upon activation by phosphorylation both the N-terminal domain and the core domain interface have to be disrupted. To follow this transition we performed FRET measurements in NIH3T3 cells co-expressing full-length STAT5a carrying either YFP (the fluorescence acceptor molecule) or CFP (the fluorescence donor molecule) at its N terminus, which form mixed STAT dimers after expression. The functionality of these N-terminal fusion constructs was verified by a reporter gene assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). Before activation a significant FRET signal (about 18% of the positive control considered as the maximum FRET value in our system) was obtained (Fig. 4a) and confirmed by an increase of donor fluorescence after acceptor bleaching (Fig. 4a). This result supports the structural data suggesting that the N-terminal domain stabilizes the dimeric state of latent, cytoplasmic STATs. Importantly, no or a negligible FRET signal was detectable after STAT5a activation by prolactin (Fig. 4b), indicating separation of the N-terminal domains. Interestingly, FRET data obtained in cells co-expressing STAT3 carrying either YFP or CFP at the C terminus show an increase of the FRET signal after activation (9Kretzschmar A.K. Dinger M.C. Henze C. Brocke-Heidrich K. Horn F. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This increase in FRET signal was consistent with an increase of SH2 domain-mediated dimeric STAT3 formation upon phosphorylation. Taken together, FRET measurements with both N-terminally and C-terminally labeled STATs are consistent with a major structural rearrangement from a core domain- and N-terminal domain-stabilized unphosphorylated STAT dimer to a SH2 domain-driven dimer after phosphorylation. Finally it should be noted that our FRET data are compatible with the two possible dimerization modes of STAT1, as both modes require the separation of the N-terminal domains upon the rearrangement following tyrosine phosphorylation. Rearrangement of STATs upon Interaction with DNA—Unphosphorylated full-length STATs, except for STAT1 (30Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), do not bind DNA (31Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B.

Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal domain and possibly also the C-terminal transactivation domain might be involved in preventing the STAT core fragment from binding to DNA. Our docking model and the structure of unphosphorylated STAT1 are consistent with this hypothesis, as they allow us to predict that the N-terminal domain stabilizes the latent core domain dimer and thus prevents conformational rearrangement into the DNA binding conformation found in phosphorylated STATs. The monomeric state of the STAT5a and the STAT1 core fragments in solution (11Mao X. Ren Z. Parker G.N. Sondermann H. Pastorello M.A. Wang W. McMurray J.S. Demeler B. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chen X. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) is in line with the importance of the N-terminal domain for stabilizing the unphosphorylated full-length dimer. Accordingly, in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay the unphosphorylated STAT5a core fragment, uninhibited by the N-terminal domain, interacts with DNA, whereas the full-length STAT5a in unstimulated cell extracts does not (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 4). A 5-fold higher amount of the unphosphorylated STAT5a core fragment as estimated by Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. 4) was necessary to obtain a shift comparable with STAT5a from stimulated cells (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 11). Core domain binding to DNA could be reduced by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the β-casein promoter recognition site for STAT5a but less efficiently using unlabeled oligonucleotides with a recognition site for STAT3 (SIE), suggesting specific interaction of the core domain with the STAT5a recognition sequence. However competition of DNA binding with unlabeled oligonucleotides was substantially less efficient with the unphosphorylated STAT5a core fragment as compared with the full-length STAT5a from cell extracts (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4-7 with 11-14). A much higher amount of unlabeled β-casein oligonucleotide was required to compete the binding of the unphosphorylated STAT5a core fragment. This could be suggestive of a higher specificity of the full-length protein for the STAT5a recognition site or differences in binding kinetics. In contrast to STAT5a and other mammalian STATs, full-length unphosphorylated STAT1 protein was shown to interact with specific DNA binding sites in gel shifts (30Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, for STAT1 the stabilization brought about by the N-terminal domain is probably considerably weaker or might be overcome by interaction with other transcription factors like IRF1. In essence this work confirms that the antiparallel dimerization mode of the STAT5a core fragment, as found also in the crystal structure of STAT1, may be a general feature of unphosphorylated mammalian STATs. Docking of the N-terminal domain dimer onto the unphosphorylated STAT5a core fragment dimer, assuming 2-fold symmetry of the overall dimer, is in good agreement with the perfect shape and charge complementarity of the involved surfaces. In the future further structural investigations will be necessary to test this docking model. We thank Prof. G. M. Sheldrick for valuable support and advice and Prof. C.

Cyanobacteria make a major contribution to world photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, but their dense and often toxic “blooms” in marine, brackish, and fresh waters are of growing concern to public health (1Whitton B.A. Potts M. Ecology of Cyanobacteria: Their Diversity in Time and Space. 1st Ed. Kluwer, Dordrecht, Netherlands2000Google Scholar). The sequences of a wide range of cyanobacterial genomes are becoming available and constitute an important resource both for the rational management and exploitation of these organisms, as well as the study of topics as diverse as carbon fixation, cell differentiation, plant and fungal symbioses, secondary product biosynthesis, and evolution. 3www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html and genome.ornl.gov/microbial/npun/22dec03/npun.html. 3www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html and genome.ornl.gov/microbial/npun/22dec03/npun.html. Why is one of the key groups of organisms in the Precambrian still one of the most important groups of phototrophs today? Almost certainly their success stems, in large part, from a capacity to withstand multiple, superimposed, environmental stresses. Those cyanobacteria with a cosmopolitan distribution are excellent model systems for molecular and biochemical studies of complex stress response pathways. A feature of some of these populations is that they are often dominated by what appears to be a single morphological form. Because such forms may be readily identified, but occur in diverse localities, the term “form species” has been used to describe such colonies. Macroscopic, readily identifiable communities of bacteria such as these, provide a unique opportunity to question how structure-function relationships contribute to our growing awareness of metagenomics (the genetic diversity in naturally occurring populations of cells; Ref. 2Venter J.C.

Nostoc commune (3Wright D. Prickett T. Helm R.F. Potts M. Int. J. Syst. Evol.

In the context of the present study, it can be emphasized that as the first documented biofilm, the cyanobacterium N. commune has had recognition since Medieval Times (6Potts M. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 584Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), yet is now an endangered species in the European Union and in neighboring countries (5Mollenhauer D. Bengtsson R. Lindstrom E.-A. Eur. J.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands,2000: 465-504Google Scholar). An understanding of the biological chemistry of N. commune is relevant in view of the simultaneous and overlapping extremes of desiccation, UV irradiation, oxidative stress, long-term metabolic arrest, and nutrient deficiency, to which this cyanobacterium is subjected (7Potts M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 755-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One feature of N. commune that warrants special emphasis is its biochemically complex extracellular matrix (8Hill D.R. Peat A.

Greater than 70% of the total soluble protein in desiccated colonies of N. commune is a group of acidic polypeptides, of cryptic function, referred to as Wsp with pI values between 4.3 and 4.8 and masses of 33-39 kDa (9Scherer S.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7726-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goals of this study were to isolate and characterize the water stress protein gene wspA and its genomic locus, identify its role in the stress tolerance of N. commune, and to identify structure/function relationships within the extracellular matrix. Bacterial Strains—Desiccated colonies of the cyanobacterial form species N. commune were collected from the field (3Wright D. Prickett T. Helm R.F. Potts M. Int. J. Syst. Evol.

Cells of N. commune DRH1 and Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 were grown as shallow suspensions to optimize gas exchange and minimize attenuation of incident radiation (see below).

Open table in a new tab UV Irradiation of Cells—Cell suspensions of N. commune DRH1 (200 ml) were grown in flat 800-ml capacity polystyrene Nunclon® Surface cell culture bottles (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark). Suspensions were agitated on a rotary shaker at 70 rpm, at 25 °C. Irradiation was provided by Sylvania soft white Duluz® compact fluorescent 23 W bulbs (Osram Sylvania Ltd., Mississauga, Canada), a 20 W RS UV-B medical light with a spectral maximum at 310 nm (model “TL,” Philips, Holland), and 15 W black lights each with a spectral maximum at 368 nm (model F15T8-BL, General Electric). Total quantum scalar irradiance was measured with a model QSL-100 meter (Biospherical Instruments Inc., San Diego, CA). The flux densities of the UV-A and UV-B components of the spectrum were measured with DIX series UV-B and 365A sensors, respectively, with a Spectroline DRC-100X digital radiometer (Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY). In these experiments full illumination represented a continuous photon flux density in the visible range of 330 μmol of photons m-2 s-1, with UV-A and UV-B maxima of 3.8 × 106 and 0.8 × 106 μWm2, respectively. Cells were also grown under reduced illumination, and in the dark, as specified in the figure legends. All values reported were the incident fluxes within culture vessels at the immediate surface of the cell suspensions. Desiccation and Rehydration of Cells—Cell suspensions (see above) were grown in Petri dishes and, after removing the lid partially, allowed to dry overnight, at room temperature and at ∼20% relative humidity, under a stream of sterile air. The desiccated cells, with a residual water content of 0.05 g of H2O/g of cell solids, were rehydrated with distilled water containing protease inhibitors at final concentrations of: 1 mm leupeptin, 0.07 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, in 0.1 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.2) for 5 min, before repeating the desiccation step. After subsequent rehydration (for different time periods) the cell-free supernatant fraction was recovered and subjected to ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa cut-off Centricon centrifugal filter cartridge (Amicon, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Exopolysaccharide Purification—Purified glycan of N. commune DRH1 for use in binding assays (prepared in both ionized and deionized form) was obtained as described (14Helm R.F. Huang Z. Edwards D. Leeson H. Peery W. Potts M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Crude samples were obtained after centrifugation of cell suspensions at 30,000 × g, for 30 min. The supernatant fraction was lyophilized and the residue (∼3.5 mg of residue/ml of supernatant fraction) was mixed with a minimal volume of distilled water and allowed to dissolve overnight at 4 °C before further analysis. Extracellular polysaccharide was stained with Alcian Blue at pH 7.0. Scytonemin Purification and Binding Assay—Scytonemin was prepared from N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 as described (13Hunsucker S.W. Tissue B.A. Potts M. Helm R.F. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 288: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant WspA (wspA cloned in pRSET C and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-AI, Invitrogen) was purified from a whole cell lysate. The band corresponding to WspA was excised from 20-cm SDS-PAGE gels. Protein was eluted using a microelectroeluter (Centrilutor, Millipore), centrifuged in a 30-kDa cut-off Centriprep spin cartridge, and dialyzed exhaustively against 50 mm, pH 7.5, Tris·HCl buffer. Scytonemin (dissolved in dimethyl formamide), glycan, and WspA were mixed in different ratios (see text), incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h, and resolved in 12.5% Criterion pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad). Synthesis of Fluorescein 6-Aminopenicillanic Acid and Binding Assay—Fluorescein 6-aminopenicillanic acid (F-APA) was synthesized from 6-aminopenicillanic acid (F-APA; 2 mg ml-1 in distilled water) and 5(6Potts M. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 584Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar)-carboxyfluorescein N-succinimidyl ester (2 mg ml-1 in distilled water). The reagents (Fluka Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) were mixed and left at room temperature for 15 h. Analytical thin layer chromatography was used to assess the degree of coupling and the Rf values of the product and reactants. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (250 μl) were resolved with Whatman silica preparative TLC plates using 80:20, acetonitrile:water. F-APA was scraped from plates and resuspended in a minimal amount of 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4). The supernatant fraction was recovered following high-speed centrifugation and used immediately. Freshly prepared F-APA was used in each independent series of binding assays. Aliquots of concentrated N. commune DRH1 cell-free extracellular supernatant fractions (10 μl; 0.0528 mg ml-1) were mixed with different concentrations of F-APA and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Competition assays were designed with unlabeled 6-APA as described in the figure legends. The mixtures were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min to disrupt any nonspecific aggregates of protein and F-APA. The samples were then resolved through SDS-PAGE (0.25 μg of protein/lane) and transferred to Immobilon P membrane using a CAPS buffer system (18Potts M. Angeloni S.V. Ebel R.E. Bassam D. Science. 1992; 256: 1690-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For further details of the assay see the supplemental materials and methods. Protein and Peptide Purification—Several methods were used to obtain protein sequence information. Desiccated colonies of N. commune CHEN/1986 (5-20 g) were frozen under liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder using a pestle and mortar. The powder was mixed with 200 to 600 ml of sterile-distilled water containing protease inhibitors (above) and the cells were allowed to rehydrate for 30 min to release soluble protein. Aliquots of the cell-free supernatant fraction were subjected to ultrafiltration (using a 10-kDa cut-off Centricon centrifugal filter cartridge; Millipore; Amicon, Billerica, MA), and analytical fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described (10Hill D.R. Hladun S.L. Scherer S. Potts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7726-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); using a Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchanger, a Mono S HR 5/5 cation exchanger, a Mono P 5/20 chromatofocusing column, a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 hydrophobic interaction column, or a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel exclusion chromatography column. Protein sequence analysis was performed on purified fractions of WspA protein, and on partially purified fractions of WspA that were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes via Western blotting (18Potts M. Angeloni S.V. Ebel R.E. Bassam D. Science. 1992; 256: 1690-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Conditions for the treatment of Wsp with Glu-C endoprotease and Lys-C endoprotease were as described (9Scherer S. Potts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12546-12553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hill D.R. Hladun S.L. Scherer S. Potts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7726-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of the supernatant fraction was reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol prior to alkylation of any potential cysteine residues with iodoacetamide. After dialysis the sample was concentrated and an aliquot was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE (10% w/v gels). A polypeptide with a molecular mass of ∼35-kDa was excised from multiple lanes and recovered through electroelution in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.1% SDS buffer (w/v). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on 7.47 mg (202 pmol) of protein. An equivalent amount of protein was taken to dryness and hydrolyzed in gas phase 6 n HCl for 20 h at 110 °C. After hydrolysis the sample was dissolved in borate buffer prior to compositional analysis. An equivalent amount of the alkylated sample was dialyzed to exchange the sample buffer and incubated with trypsin overnight, followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to isolate peptides (Hewlett Packard model HP1090) and Edman degradation analysis. Preparative Isoelectric Focusing—A sample (39 mg of total protein) at a pH of 6.5 was added to 16 ml of deionized 5 m urea and 1.8-ml ampholytes (Bio-Rad) and loaded onto a Mini Rotofor Cell (Bio-Rad) for initial fractionation in the range pH 3-5. Constant power (10 W) was applied for 5 h, with the system cooled to 4 °C, and was terminated when the voltage had stabilized (1982 V) for about 30 min. Fractions were collected for protein determinations and SDS-PAGE. After evaluation, fractions of interest were pooled, diluted in additional 5 m urea, and separated further in the Mini Rotofor Cell. LC-MS/MS—Mass spectrometric analyses were as described (19Hunsucker S.W. Klage K. Slaughter S.M. Potts M. Helm R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Full details are presented in supplemental materials and methods. Nucleic Acid Manipulations and Analyses—Genomic DNAs from N. commune DRH1 and N. commune UTEX 584 were isolated in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and purified through cesium chloride buoyant-density ultracentrifugation as described (11Shirkey B.

Detailed protocols for polymerase chain reaction assay, construction of gene libraries, synthesis of hybridization probes, screening of gene libraries, Northern analysis, and primer extension assays are provided in supplemental materials and methods. Accession Number—The nucleotide and protein sequence data described in this study were deposited in NCBI with assigned accession numbers DQ155425 and DQ155426. Primary Sequence Analysis of Native WspA—To isolate wspA we first obtained data on the primary amino acid sequence of the native WspA from N. commune CHEN/1986 through limited endoproteolysis and Edman degradation assays. In multiple independent sequence assays, with seven of eight peptide preparations, the yield (pmol cycle-1) at cycles 10, 11, and 12 dropped sharply (to <10 pmol cycle-1), and then high yields were recovered during further cycles of sequencing (Fig. 1A). Under the assumption that residues 10 through 12 may include a cysteine we treated one preparation (peptide 7; Fig. 1A) with 2-mercaptoethanol prior to alkylation of any such residues with iodoacetamide. This treatment led to increased yields and it became possible to make the unambiguous assignment for residues 10, 11, and 12 as DRD. However, subsequent studies confirmed that WspA is devoid of both S-containing amino acids and histidine; subsequent determination of a lack of methionine also explained our inability to generate proteolytic fragments with cyanogen bromide in an earlier study (10Hill D.R. Hladun S.L. Scherer S. Potts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7726-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we analyzed native WspA from desiccated N. commune CHEN/1986 material through LC-MS we identified no N-terminal peptides other than those with the sequence ALYGY..., however, LC-MS analysis did identify polymorphic peptides (Fig. 1, B and C; supplemental materials Figs. S1 and S2). Analysis of two tryptic peptides, derived from the same field isolate, and with their assigned sequences as determined by de novo sequencing, are described in detail in supplemental Fig. S3, A and B. Isolation of wspA—The peptide sequence analysis of native WspA from N. commune CHEN/1986 (Fig. 1A) permitted the design of primers for PCR amplification of a region of wspA from the derivative strain N. commune DRH1. Subsequently, a wspA probe was used to isolate a 13.4-kb genomic DNA fragment including wspA and its 5′ and 3′ flanking regions (Fig. 2A; supplemental materials and methods). The 12 putative ORFs in the region of wspA have obvious orthologues in other strains of cyanobacteria (supplemental materials Table S1), with obvious syntenic conservation. These included an enolpyruvyl transferase (orfT71) involved in aromatic amino acid and/or cell wall synthesis, and di-iron aerobic oxidative cyclases (orfT34 and orfT35); all with >90% sequence identity to putative proteins in N. punctiforme ATCC 29133. The translation stop codon of orfT34 and initiation codon of orfT35 overlap and presumably function through translation coupling; in addition the putative product of orfT34 contains 10% phenylalanine. Structural Organization of wspA and Its Flanking Regions—The full-length wspA ORF has three potential ATG translation initiation codons within the first 40 codons (Fig. 2B). The third ATG codon precedes immediately the sequence identified in multiple trials at the N terminus of WspA through protein sequencing (Fig. 1A, ALYGY ...), and is located 10-15 bases downstream of the putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence 5′-AAGGAG-3′. Inspection of the N-terminal region of WspA failed to identify potential sequences that would permit the protein to enter the secretory pathway (21Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). However, a 14-residue putative signal sequence, fulfilling criteria of SignalP for Gram-positive bacteria, was identified at the C terminus with a putative cleavage site between residues 309 and 310 in one of three regions predicted to be disordered (Fig. 2C, arrowhead). Following isolation of wspA from N. commune DRH1, PCR was used to amplify the gene from different sources of N. commune that were characterized through phylogenetic analysis based upon their Group I intron sequences (3Wright D. Prickett T. Helm R.F. Potts M. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 1839-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); our analysis confirmed microheterogeneity in this collection of genomic wspA clones (Fig. 2D). The wspA Promoter Region—We focused our attention on the region proximal to and upstream of wspA, as well as physiological profiling to determine under which conditions wspA was transcribed, and questioned whether wspA occurred in a mono- or polycistronic operon. Primer extension assay of wspA mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B) identified a primary reverse transcriptase-PCR product of ∼475 bp and additional products ∼345, ∼250, and ∼200 bp in low yield. Inspection of sequences upstream of the sites of extension termination, and comparison of the intergenic region with -35 and -10 promoter sequences identified in a detailed study of the genome of cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4 (22Vogel J. Axmann I.M. Herzel H. Hess W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2890-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), located two regions of interest (Fig. 3, A and C). Region one, predicted as a putative wspA promoter contained 5′-TATAGT-3′ (-10), spaced 16 nucleotides from a 14-bp region that corresponded with a consensus -35 element found in Prochlorococcus genes including petH2 and ftsZ (Fig. 3C). A second 5′-TATAGT-3′ sequence in region two was 16 nucleotides from a putative -35 sequence that corresponded in sequence, and again in spacing, with the -35 region of other Prochlorococcus genes including ccmK and kaiB. The latter gene also had 5′-TATAGT-3′ as its -10 sequence (22Vogel J. Axmann I.M. Herzel H. Hess W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2890-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AT-rich region from nucleotides 9003 to 9326 (upstream of wspA; Fig. 2B) contains 18 sequences that conform to the consensus -10 sequence 5′-TANNNT-3′, and 13 of these are very frequent -10 elements in the Prochlorococcus genome. wspA Is Found Solely in N. commune—WspA has no counterpart in the proteomes of those cyanobacteria for which full genome sequence data are available, and shares no obvious identity with sequences in the public databases. The top BLASTP scores (∼20% identity for residues ∼40 through 280) included: a putative surface-exposed protein in Burkholderia pseudomallei (accession YP_110805); the Hep_Hag family protein/hemagglutinin motif and/YadA-like domain protein in Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344 (accession YP_105401); type I flagellin FliC in Burkholderia cepacia (accession AAC38200); muconate cycloisomerase in Solfolobus solfataricus P2 (accession AAK43295); and nucleoporin, autotransporter, and adhesion sequences. The sequence DRD, which was recalcitrant to sequence assay (Fig. 1A), occurs in the most hydrophilic region of WspA; in a region predicted to be disordered (supplemental materials Fig. S1) (23Linding R. Russell R.B. Neduva V. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). There was little commonality in the codon usage of wspA, sodF, icfA, or orfT71 (see Fig. 2A). Other Proteins in the Extracellular Matrix—A fraction of WspA and SodF, in relatively pure form, is secreted by desiccated field materials of N. commune CHEN/1986, simply upon rehydration, but upon cell lysis the majority of the protein is distributed in a dark brown to black, highly viscous extract, which requires considerable purification before resolution in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 4A) (9Scherer S.

However, direct modulation of transcription factors by CaM has been poorly understood. In this study, we isolated a putative transcription factor by screening a rice cDNA expression library by using CaM:horse-radish peroxidase as a probe. This factor, which we have designated OsCBT (Oryza sativa CaM-binding transcription factor), has structural features similar to Arabidopsis AtSRs/AtCAMTAs and encodes a 103-kDa protein because it contains a CG-1 homology DNA-binding domain, three ankyrin repeats, a putative transcriptional activation domain, and five putative CaM-binding motifs. By using a gel overlay assay, gel mobility shift assays, and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that OsCBT has two different types of functional CaM-binding domains, an IQ motif, and a Ca2+-dependent motif. To determine the DNA binding specificity of OsCBT, we employed a random binding site selection method. This analysis showed that OsCBT preferentially binds to the sequence 5′-TWCG(C/T)GTKKKKTKCG-3′ (W and K represent A or C and T or G, respectively). OsCBT was able to bind this sequence and activate β-glucuronidase reporter gene expression driven by a minimal promoter containing tandem repeats of these sequences in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. Green fluorescent protein fusions of two putative nuclear localization signals of OsCBT, a bipartite and a SV40 type, were predominantly localized in the nucleus. Most interestingly, the transcriptional activation mediated by OsCBT was inhibited by co-transfection with a CaM gene.

In plants as well as in animals, Ca2+ has a vital role in mediating cellular responses to external stimuli of both abiotic and biotic origins (1Jabs T. Tschöpe M. Colling C. Hahlbrock K. Schell D.

BioEssays. 2002; 24: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM can bind to some members of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, inhibit their DNA binding, and directly influence downstream gene transcription (14Corneliussen B. Holm M.

However, the CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) of TGA3 has not been identified. Recently, Yoo et al. (18Yoo J.H. Park C.Y. Kim J.C. Heo W.D. Cheong M.S. Park H.C. Kim M.C. Moon B.C. Choi M.S. Kang Y.H.

All of these homologues contain the conserved CG-1 homology DNA-binding domain, the TIG domain, several ankyrin (ANK) repeats, and a variable number of CaM-binding motifs.

Bouchè et al. (19Bouché N. Scharlat A. Snedden W. Bouchez D. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21851-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) showed that one Arabidopsis homologue, AtCAMTA1, binds to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner and verified its ability to activate transcription in yeast. Moreover, they suggested that this family of proteins is conserved in a wide range of multicellular eukaryotes, including human and Drosophila, based on a bioinformatics analysis (19Bouché N.

Even though the physical interaction between CaM and this family of proteins has been extensively characterized, the mechanism by which CaM regulates their activity has not yet been elucidated.In this study, we isolated a putative CaM-binding transcription factor (having structural features and amino acid sequences with a high degree of similarity to the AtSRs/AtCAMTAs family) by screening a rice cDNA expression library using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated CaM (CaM:HRP) as a probe. We designated this cDNA clone OsCBT (Oryza sativa CaM-binding transcription factor). By using CaM overlay assays with several deletion mutants, a gel mobility shift assay, and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that OsCBT possesses two distinct types of CaM-binding domains, Ca2+-dependent CaM dissociation and Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding motifs, and that CaM binding to OsCBT has an inhibitory effect on transcriptional activation. Our results suggest that OsCBT encodes a transcriptional activator regulated by CaM binding.MATERIALS AND METHODSScreening of a Rice cDNA Expression Library—Screening of the rice cDNA expression library using HRP-conjugated soybean CaM (GmCaM-1) was carried out as described in previous reports (24Kim C.Y.

First, a SmaI site was introduced downstream of the TGA codon of a full-length cDNA clone (named OsCBT.B) by PCR. The OsCBT.B clone was digested by SmaI, MfeI, NdeI, or EcoRI and blunted by T4 DNA polymerase. The fragments were cut with NcoI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into a pAK-SS vector digested with BamHI and SmaI. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs were named according to the fragments they contained as follows: D0 for NcoI/SmaI (amino acids 1-927); D1 for NcoI/MfeI (amino acids 1-720); D2 for NcoI/NdeI (amino acids 1-540); and D3 for NcoI/EcoRI (amino acids 1-253). The five putative CaMBDs (amino acids 440-476) of OsCBT were amplified using a 5′ primer containing a BamHI site and a 3′ primer containing a SmaI site. The 5′ primer and 3′ primer sequences used are as follows: for Da, 5′ primer, 5′-GGC CCC ATG GCT CTA GCA GCC TAT CGC-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TAT CCC GGG GCA GAT GCT TCA ATC TCA GG-3′; for Db, 5′ primer, 5′-CGG GAT CCG CTA ATC CTG AGA TTG AAG C-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TAT CCC GGG GCC TGT ATT CGT GCA GCA GC-3′; for Dc, 5′ primer, 5′-CGG GAT CCG CAA TGA GAG CTG CTG CAC G-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TAT CCC GGG CGG TAC GCA GCT TGT ATC C-3′; for Dd 5′ primer, 5′-CGG GAT CCA TGC GAA GAC AAG TTA TCA GG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TAT CCC GGG TCA ACA ATT CCA ACA GAC C-3′; for De, 5′ primer, 5′-CGG GAT CCC AAC AAG CCG AGG ACA GG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CGG GAT CCC AAC AAG CCG AGG ACA GG-3′. Each amplified fragment was also subcloned into a pAK-SS vector (GST:OsCBT.CaMBD a-e, denoted by Da-De). To identify the critical domains in the interaction between CaM and OsCBT, we introduced several point mutations into the GST:OsCBT CaMBD b and e clones. Substitutions of single amino acids were performed using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sequences used are as follows: for I764A of CaMBD I, F, 5′-GAG ATA GTT GCT GCT TTG AAG GCT CAA CAT GCA TTT CGG AAC TAC-3′, and R, 5′-GTA GTT CCG AAA TGC ATG TTG AGC CTT GAA AGC AGC AAC TAT CTC-3′; for V829R of CaMBD II, F, 5′-GGT AAT ATG GTC TGT TGG AAT TCG TGA GAA AGC AAT TTT GCG ATG G-3′, and R, 5′-CCA TCG CAA AAT TCG TTT CTC ACG AAT TCC AAC AGA CCA TAT TAC C-3′; for W836R of CaMBD II, F, 5′-GAG AAA GCA ATT TTG CGA CGG AGA AAG AAG AGA AAA GCC-3′, and R, 5′-GGC TTT TCT CTT CTT TCT CCG TCG CAA AAT TGC TTT CTC-3′.Expression of Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia coli and the CaM Binding Assay—All the clones were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and expressed. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced by application of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 25°C. The cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml lysozyme), and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixture was sonicated for 1 min at a 50% pulse and then centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was used for Western blotting and a CaM:HRP gel overlay assay. E. coli crude cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (PVDF, Millipore, Billerica, MA). GST fusion proteins were detected by a polyclonal GST-specific antiserum. To examine the CaM binding ability of the recombinant proteins, a duplicate blot was probed with OsCaM-1:HRP in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. The CaM:HRP overlay assay was carried out as described previously (26Kim M.C. Lee S.H. Kim J.K. Chun H.J. Choi M.S. Chung W.S. Moon B.C. Kang C.H. Park C.Y. Yoo J.H. Kang Y.H. Koo S.C. Koo Y.D.

The bound CaM was visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).CaM Mobility Shift Assay with a Synthetic Peptide—The 826VGIVEKAILRWRKKRKALRG845 peptide, corresponding to a stretch of 20 amino acids in the CaMBD II of OsCBT, was synthesized at a peptide synthesis facility (EURO-GENETEC S. A., Belgium). The CaM binding ability of the synthetic peptide was measured by determining the relative mobility shift of CaM in the presence of this peptide (27Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). CaM (303 pmol) was incubated with increasing concentrations of the peptide (molar ratios: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0) in a binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) plus 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) at room temperature for 1 h. The samples were separated by gel electrophoresis at a constant voltage of 100 V in an electrode buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine containing either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA probes were generated by annealing oligonucleotides spanning the regions of interest and filling in the 5′ overhangs with a Klenow fragment polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), [32P]dATP, and unlabeled dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The DNA-binding reactions were allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 20 min in 10 μl of 1× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) (28Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), 50-150 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 1-5 μg of poly[dI·dC], and 0.5 μg of bacterially produced fusion protein that had been purified with glutathione-Sepharose. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min after adding 40,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probe. The reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at 80 V for 3 h. The gel was dried onto 3MM paper and mounted for autoradiography at -70 °C with intensifying screens.Random Binding Site Selection (RBSS)—The in vitro binding site selection procedure was derived from Pollock and Treisman (29Sundaresan V. Springer P. Volpe T. Haward S. Jones J.D. Dean C. Ma H. Martienssen R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and we modified some of the procedures as described below. The oligonucleotide synthesized for the binding selection was TN66 (5′-CGC TAC GTC GGA AGA CAA GCT TGT AA(N)15ATA GGA TCC CTC ACC TCA GAC AGA C-3′), containing a randomized sequence of 15 nucleotides flanked by 26 nucleotides at the 5′-end containing a HindIII site and 25 nucleotides at the 3′-end containing a BamHI site. For PCR amplification, the oligonucleotides TNF20 (5′-CGC TAC GTC GGA AGA CAA GC-3′) and TNR20 (5′-GTC TGT CTG AGG TGA GGG AT-3′) were the forward and reverse primers, respectively. In order to produce double-stranded random binding DNA sequences, the oligonucleotides TN66 (400 pmol) and TNR20 (800 pmol) were annealed, and the second strand was synthesized with the Klenow fragment polymerase in the presence of dNTPs (final concentration, 0.25 mm each). OsCBT DNA-binding (OsCBT. DB) protein was preincubated with 5 μg of poly[dI·dC] as a nonspecific competitor for 10 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 15% glycerol prior to addition of the 32P-labeled probe (40,000 cpm) to give a final volume of 30 μl. After additional 15 min of incubation, the DNA-protein complex was separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) containing 0.5× TBE and 3% glycerol for 1.5-2 h at 15-20 V/cm. The DNA-protein complex was excised from gel and electroeluted into a dialysis bag. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The recovered DNA was resuspended in an appropriate volume of deionized water. PCR amplifications were carried out in a final volume of 100 μl containing 80 pmol of each primer, 20 nmol of dNTPs, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. After an initial denaturation at 92 °C for 30 s, selected binding sequences were amplified with 30 cycles of 30 s at 92 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C in a thermal cycler (Amersham Biosciences). The amplified DNA of 66 bp in length was purified on a 2% agarose gel, eluted as described above, and used as the template for the following round of selection. Out of five selection cycles (binding/gel shift/elution/PCR amplification) carried out, the first three selections were performed using binding conditions of 50 mm KCl, whereas the latter two selections were carried out at 50 and 150 mm KCl independently. The final pool of oligonucleotides were digested with BamHI and HindIII, ligated into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene), and transformed into XL-1 Blue MRF. Out of the transformants, 100 clones were randomly chosen from the 150 mm KCl selected transformants. The sequences of the inserted DNA were determined by dideoxynucleotide chain termination using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI 377, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA).Subcellular Localization and Transient Expression Assays—For preparation of protoplasts, leaf tissue (5 g) of 3-4-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown on MS medium were digested with 50 ml of an enzyme solution (1.2% cellulase R-10 (Yakult, Japan), 0.3% macerozyme R-10, 10 mm MES-KOH (pH 5.6), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 8 mm CaCl2, and 0.4 m mannitol, at a final pH 5.8) at 22 °C with gentle agitation (50-75 rpm) overnight. All centrifuges were carried out at 40-60 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The protoplasts were isolated from the undigested material with a sieve (100 mesh), and the protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 5-10 ml of W5 solution (154 mm NaCl, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1.5 mm MES-KOH (pH 5.6)). The protoplasts over-laid 20 ml of 21% sucrose and were centrifuged for 10 min at 78 × g. The intact protoplasts at the interface were transferred to a new Falcon tube containing 20 ml of W5 solution (30Lee Y.J. Kim D.H. Kim Y.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2175-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The protoplasts were pelleted again by centrifugation for 5 min at 55 × g and resuspended in 20 ml of W5 solution. For the transfection experiments, polyethylene glycol-mediated DNA uptake methods were performed following the protocol of Jin et al. (31Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).For testing the subcellular localization of OsCBT, we fused the N- or C-terminal half of OsCBT into the N terminus of smGFP by using a restriction enzyme site (named N-term::smGFP (amino acid 1-547) and C-term::smGFP (amino acid 540-927), respectively). To map the NLS, the deletion mutant for both predicted NLS motifs (named del NLS) and two putative NLS motifs of OsCBT (named NLS-N and NLS-C) were amplified by using a 5′ primer containing a BamHI site and a 3′ primer containing a SmaI site. The 5′ primer and 3′ primer sequences used are as follows: for NLS-N::smGFP (amino acid 70-96), 5′ primer, 5′-GGA TCC ATG CTA TAT GAT CGT AAA GTA-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CCC GGG ACC GTC CTG CCA TCC TTC TT-3′; for NLS-C::smGFP (amino acid 830-851), 5′ primer, 5′-GGA TCC ATG GCG GGA GCG GGC GGA TGG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CCC GGG ACT GGC ATT CCA GAT GCG AT-5′; for del NLS::smGFP (amino acid 91-835), 5′ primer, 5′-GGA TCC ATG GAT GGC AGG ACG GTC CAA-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CCC GGG CCT CCT CCT CCC CAT CGC AAA ATT GCT TTC TC-3′. Expression of the fusion constructs was monitored at 24 h after transformation by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Jena, Germany), and the images were captured with a cooled CCD camera. The filter sets used were XF116 (exciter, 474AF20; dichroic, 500DRLP; emitter, 510AF23) and XF33/E (exciter, 535DF35; dichroic, 570DRLP; emitter, 605DF50) (Omega, Inc., Brattleboro, VT) for green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein, respectively.The reporter plasmid was a pUC19-derived plasmid containing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of a 35S minimal promoter (32Sheen J. Science. 1996; 274: 1900-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). A synthetic OsCBT-binding site (OsCBT BS C4) was inserted in front of the CaMV 35S minimal promoter. For effector plasmids, full-length fragments of OsCBT or OsCaM1 cDNA were inserted into a plant expression vector (HBT95) containing the 35S C4PPDK promoter and nos terminator (33Raghothama K.G. Maggio A. Narasimhan M.L. Kononowicz A.K. Wang G. D'Urzo M.P. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transient expression of these constructs was performed as described previously (34Liu Z. Wu X. Pan N. Chen Z. Chin. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 9: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar). In each transfection, 2 × 106 protoplasts were transfected with 30 μg of plasmid DNA carrying a reporter construct alone or with plasmid DNA carrying an effector construct or a vector DNA control. The transfected protoplasts were incubated for 16 h in the dark. A construct carrying the 35S promoter fused to the luciferase gene was used as an internal control in each transfection where the OsCBT BS-m35S-GUS reporter construct was tested. In each sample, the GUS activity of the cell lysate was divided by the luciferase activity, thereby normalizing the data to control for variations in transfection efficiency.RESULTSMolecular Cloning of a cDNA Encoding a CaM-binding Transcription Factor—To understand the roles of Ca2+/CaM in plant sensing and response to environmental signals and to identify the molecular components of Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling pathways, we isolated CaMBPs by screening a fungal elicitor-treated rice cDNA expression library using HRP-conjugated soybean CaM-1 (GmCaM-1:HRP) as a probe (24Kim C.Y.

From the in vitro protein-protein interaction-based screening of 5 × 105 recombinant phages, we isolated a 3,134-bp full-length cDNA clone encoding a 927-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼103 kDa.Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence shows that this putative CaMBP contains several structural features of transcriptional regulators (Fig. 1). This clone has two different types of nuclear localization sequences (NLS), a bipartite NLS in the N terminus (amino acids 73-90), and an SV40-type NLS in the C terminus (amino acids 837-840). The N-terminal 147 amino acids show high homology to the CG-1 domain of parsley CG-1, which is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (21da Costa e Silva O. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A TIG domain, involved in nonsequence-specific DNA contacts in various transcription factors (19Bouché N. Scharlat A. Snedden W.

Three ankyrin repeat domains, each composed of 33 amino acids and known to mediate protein-protein interactions, are found in the central region of the protein (amino acids 374-462) (36Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). At the C-terminal end (amino acids 861-920), acidic amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate, as well as proline and glutamine, are enriched, suggesting that this region functions as a transcriptional activation domain (Fig. 1B) (37Schwechheimer C. Zourelidou M. Bevan M.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal region of the protein (amino acids 726-845) contains a cluster of several putative CaM-binding domains, four Ca2+-dependent CaM dissociation domains (IQ motifs), and a Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding domain (38Rhoads A.R.

https://openalex.org/W1983211817,"Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) mediated proteolysis is responsible for the degradation of majority of cellular proteins, thereby playing essential roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating a number of cellular functions. UPS dysfunction was implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous disorders, including neurodegenerative disease, muscular dystrophy, and a subset of cardiomyopathies. However, monitoring in vivo functional changes of the UPS remains a challenge, which hinders the elucidation of UPS pathophysiology. We have recently created a novel transgenic mouse model that ubiquitously expresses a surrogate protein substrate for the UPS. The present study validates its suitability to monitor in vivo changes of UPS proteolytic function in virtually all major organs. Primary culture of cells derived from the adult transgenic mice was also developed and tested for their applications in probing UPS involvement in pathogenesis. Applying these newly established in vivo and in vitro approaches, we have proven in the present study that doxorubicin enhances UPS function in the heart and in cultured cardiomyocytes, suggesting that UPS hyper-function may play an important role in the acute cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2013711717,"Ribosomal P0, P1, and P2 proteins, together with the conserved domain of 28 S rRNA, constitute a major part of the GTPase-associated center in eukaryotic ribosomes. We investigated the mode of assembly in vitro by using various truncation mutants of silkworm P0. When compared with wild type (WT)-P0, the C-terminal truncation mutants CΔ65 and CΔ81 showed markedly reduced binding ability to P1 and P2, which was offset by the addition of an rRNA fragment covering the P0·P1-P2 binding site. The mutant CΔ107 lost the P1/P2 binding activity, whereas it retained the rRNA binding. In contrast, the N-terminal truncation mutants NΔ21-NΔ92 completely lost the rRNA binding, although they retained P1/P2 binding capability, implying an essential role of the N terminus of P0 for rRNA binding. The P0 mutants NΔ6, NΔ14, and CΔ18-CΔ81, together with P1/P2 and eL12, bound to the Escherichia coli core 50 S subunits deficient in L10·L7/L12 complex and L11. Analysis of incorporation of 32P-labeled P1/P2 into the 50 S subunits with WT-P0 and CΔ81 by sedimentation analysis indicated that WT-P0 bound two copies of P1 and P2, but CΔ81 bound only one copy each. The hybrid ribosome with CΔ81 that appears to contain one P1-P2 heterodimer retained lower but considerable activities dependent on eukaryotic elongation factors. These results suggested that two P1-P2 dimers bind to close but separate regions on the C-terminal half of P0. The results were further confirmed by binding experiments using chimeric P0 mutants in which the C-terminal 81 or 107 amino acids were replaced with the homologous sequences of the archaebacterial P0.

The ribosomal large subunits from all organisms contain an active site termed the “GTPase-associated center” that is responsible for the GTPase-related events in protein biosynthesis. This active site is composed of the two highly conserved domains around 1070 and 2660 (Escherichia coli numbering is used throughout) of 23 S/28 S rRNA and the ribosomal proteins bound to the 1070 region (1Cundliffe E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20608-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although direct evidence has not been shown. In the case of mammalian counterparts, isolated P0 is insoluble in aqueous solution, but the P1-P2 binding to P0 makes P0 soluble (23Gonzalo P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19762-19769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that silkworm P0, however, is soluble and useful for biochemical assays (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By using the silkworm proteins, we demonstrated that binding of P1 and P2 to P0 induced the binding activity of P0 to rRNA (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that binding of P1-P2 to P0 at its C-terminal region affects the overall structure of P0. To clarify the individual binding sites for two P1-P2 dimers and for rRNA on P0 in vitro, we here constructed 11 kinds of truncation mutants of silkworm P0 and used them for protein-protein and protein-rRNA binding experiments. We identified two neighboring sites for P1-P2 heterodimers within the C-terminal half and a crucially important site for rRNA binding at the N terminus of P0 and suggested that the protein-protein and protein-RNA bindings mutually affect each other. To evaluate the in vitro binding data on the basis of ribosome function, we used a hybrid ribosome system developed previously (19Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in which E. coli L10·L7/L12 complex and L11 on the 50 S subunit were replaced with the eukaryotic counterparts P0·P1-P2 complex and eL12, respectively. Whenever efficient RNA binding could be observed, complexes containing the truncated P0 mutants bound to E. coli core ribosomes and induced activities dependent on eukaryotic elongation factors. It is interesting that ribosomes carrying a P0 variant accessible to only one P1-P2 heterodimer retained reduced but significant activity. Plasmid Construction, Protein Expression, and Purification—The cDNAs for Bombyx mori ribosomal proteins P0, P1, P2, and eL12 (a eukaryotic homologue of prokaryotic L11) were provided by Dr. K. Mita (National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences). The coding region in each cDNA was amplified by PCR (29Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Sharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar), inserted to E. coli expression vector pET28c or pET3a (Novagen), and cloned. Proteins expressed in E. coli cells were purified, as described previously (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments coding for various truncated P0 were also amplified by PCR using cDNA encoding full-length (WT, 1-316 amino acids) of P0 as a template (see Fig. 1). The overlapping PCR method (30Zhong D. Bajaj S.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 874-878PubMed Google Scholar) was used to construct the chimeric P0 mutants composed of the N-terminal 1-235 (CΔ81) and 1-209 (CΔ107) amino acid sequences of silkworm P0 fused to the C-terminal sequences of the archaebacterial (Pyrococcus horikoshii) P0-like protein, which are homologous to the 236-316 and 210-316 sequences of silkworm P0, respectively. The genomic DNA was used as a template of PCR to amplify the DNA fragments for the two C-terminal amino acid sequences of P. horikoshii P0. 3Y. Maki, J. Ohta, and T. Uchiumi, manuscript in preparation. Each DNA fragment was cloned into pET28c, and the P0 mutant was expressed and purified as described above. In Vitro RNA Synthesis—The rat rDNA fragment containing residues 1841-1939 that correspond to 1029-1127 of E. coli 23 S (designated here the 1070 domain) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pSPT 18 (Roche Applied Science). The RNA fragment was synthesized using the plasmid DNA and SP-6 RNA polymerase and purified, as described previously (31Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). P0·P1-P2 Complex Formation—After the amounts of isolated proteins were determined with the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce), the concentrations of individual protein samples (pmol/μl) were estimated considering that 1 μg of WT-P0 (or P0 mutants), P1, and P2 correspond to 29.3 (or 26.6-42.2), 87.3, and 86.6 pmol, respectively. The protein samples were mixed together at a molar ratio of P0 sample: P1:P2 of 1:3:3, and the complex was reconstituted, as described previously (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The P0·P1-P2 complex formation in the presence or absence of a 2-fold excess of the rRNA fragments of the 1070 domain was confirmed by 6% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 39:1) native gel electrophoresis at 6.5 V/cm with a buffer system containing 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Samples were electrophoresed for 6 h at constant voltage and 4 °C with buffer recirculation (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Ribosomal Subunits and the 50 S Core Particles—E. coli ribosomal subunits were prepared as described previously (20Uchiumi T. Honma S. Endo Y. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41401-41409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 50 S cores deficient in L10·L7/L12 and L11 were prepared by extraction of the 50 S subunits from the L11-deficient E. coli mutant AM68 (32Dabbs E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 734-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a solution containing 50% ethanol and 0.5 m NH4Cl solution at 0 °C, as described previously (19Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Gel Retardation—[32P]RNA fragments covering the 1070 domain (5 pmol) synthesized as described above were mixed with 10 pmol of P0·P1-P2 complex sample and 10 pmol of eL12 (28Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in 10 μl of a solution containing 20 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The RNA-protein complexes were separated by 6% polyacrylamide native gel, as described above. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Acrylamide/Agarose Composite Gel Electrophoresis—50 S core particles (10 pmol) were mixed with various P0·P1-P2 complex samples (20 pmol each) together with eL12 (20 pmol). The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on acrylamide/agarose composite gel composed of 3% acrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 19:1) and 0.5% agarose (33Tokimatsu H. Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as described previously (19Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Azur B. Binding of proteins to the 50 S core particles was revealed by gel mobility shift. Quantitative Analysis of P1 and P2 Incorporated into the Ribosome— Isolated P1 and P2 (25 μg of each) were incubated with 500 units of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) and 5 nmol of [32P]ATP (250 μCi/μmol) for 30 min at 30 °C in a solution (50 μl) containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The 32P-labeled P1 (86 cpm/pmol) was mixed with non-labeled P0 (or CΔ81) and P2, and the complex was reconstituted as described above. For the E. coli 50 S core (78 pmol), excess amounts (195 pmol) of the P0·[32P]P1-P2 complex were added, together with 154 pmol of eL12. The sample was then layered on a 10-28% sucrose gradient in a solution containing 50 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and fractionated after centrifugation at 40,000 rpm and 4 °C for 3 h in a Hitachi P-45 ST rotor. The 50 S fraction was collected, and the amount of the associated P1 was estimated by its radioactivity. The 32P-labeled P2 (105 cpm/pmol) was mixed with non-labeled P0 (or CΔ81) and P1, and its incorporation into 50 S core particles was analyzed as described for 32P-labeled P1. Ribosome Functional Assays—Eukaryotic elongation factors eEF-1α and eEF-2 were isolated from pig liver as described by Iwasaki and Kaziro (34Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). eEF-2-dependent GTPase and polyphenylalanine synthesis by using poly(U), eEF-1α, and eEF-2 were assayed according to our previous report (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Preparation of Various Truncated Mutants of Animal Ribosomal Protein P0—The eukaryotic ribosomal protein P0 plays a central role in the assembly of the active GTPase-associated center. Here we investigated the structural elements required for binding of two P1/P2 dimers and rRNA by using truncated mutants that are summarized in Fig. 1A. All P0 mutants including five C-terminal mutants (CΔ18, CΔ55, CΔ65, CΔ81, and CΔ107) and six N-terminal truncation mutants (NΔ6, NΔ14, NΔ21, NΔ48, NΔ66, and NΔ92) were expressed in E. coli cells but found to be insoluble. The proteins were solubilized in 6 m urea and purified by using ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography. The purity of all the isolated P0 samples, P1, P2, and eL12, is shown in Fig. 1B. By adding P1 and P2 to individual P0 samples, P0·P1-P2 complexes were reconstituted as described under “Materials and Methods” and used in the following experiments. Effect of the C-terminal Truncation of P0 on P0·P1-P2 Assembly—The formation of P0·P1-P2 complexes was examined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). The complex of WT-P0 with P1 and P2 was detected as a shifted band (Fig. 2A, lane 1), in a similar manner as the authentic proteins from silkworm ribosomes (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The complexes were also formed efficiently even with P0 mutants, the C-terminal amino acids of which, 299-316 (CΔ18, lane 2) and 262-316 (CΔ55, lane 3), were truncated. However, only weak smearing bands were observed in the complexes with the CΔ65 (lane 4) and CΔ81 (lane 5) mutants of P0. No complex formation was detected in the sample with the CΔ107 mutant (lane 6). Each protein mixture was tested for rRNA binding by gel mobility shift assay using a small amount of the 32P-labeled RNA fragment covering the 1070 region (Fig. 2B). Strong RNA binding was observed for all reconstituted complexes (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-6). The CΔ107 mutant, which had no binding ability to P1/P2, showed reduced but significant binding affinity to the RNA (lane 7). The same mobility shift was observed in the isolated CΔ107 without P1 and P2 (not shown), suggesting that the CΔ107 mutant retains rRNA binding. This is an unexpected result because the WT-P0 fails to bind rRNA without P1 and P2 (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2620-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The same experiment as Fig. 2A was performed after the addition of an excess amount of the rRNA fragment (Fig. 2C). In the presence of the rRNA fragment, bands of the P0·P1-P2 complexes with all the P0 samples except CΔ107 were more distinct (Fig. 2C) than those in the absence of the RNA (Fig. 2A). Particularly, the complexes with CΔ65 and CΔ81 were stabilized markedly with the RNA fragment (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). The complex formation of CΔ107 with P1-P2 was not detected even after the addition of the RNA (lane 6). To confirm that the complexes formed in Fig. 2C all contain P0 (or its mutants), P1 and P2, the bands of the complexes were cut out of the gel and subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with a fluorescent dye, SYPRO Orange, to quantitate roughly the relative amounts of P1/P2 by fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2D). The three protein components were detected in all complexes formed. The intensity of both P1 and P2 in the complexes with CΔ65 and CΔ81 (lanes 4 and 5) was approximately half of that in the other complexes (lanes 1-3). To eliminate a possibility that the effects of the truncation shown in Fig. 2 result from severe alteration of the tertiary structure of P0 rather than from deletion of the binding sites for P1/P2, we also performed binding experiments using chimeric P0 instead of truncation mutants. Because archaebacterial (P. horikoshii) ribosomes contain a eukaryotic P0-like protein that does not cross-bind to silkworm P1/P2, we replaced the C-terminal 81- and 107-amino acid sequences of silkworm P0 with the homologous sequences of P. horikoshii P0. As shown in Fig. 3, chimeric P0 samples did not form stable complexes with silkworm P1/P2 in the absence of the rRNA fragments (lanes 2 and 3). In the presence of the rRNA fragment, however, the chimeric P0, the C-terminal 81-amino acid sequence of which is from the corresponding region of P. horikoshii protein, could form a complex with silkworm P1/P2 (lane 5). In contrast, the chimeric P0, the C-terminal 107-amino acid sequence of which is from P. horikoshii, had no ability to bind silkworm P1/P2 (lane 6). The abilities of chimeric P0 mutants to complex with P1/P2 are comparable with those of the CΔ81 and CΔ107 P0 mutants (Fig. 2C). It should be added that the chimeric P0, the C-terminal 107-amino acid sequence of which is from P. horikoshii, could bind the P. horikoshii stalk dimers and form a functional complex.3 These results supported the binding data with the C-terminal truncation mutants. Effect of the N-terminal Deletion of P0 on P0·P1-P2 Assembly—The formation of P0·P1-P2 complexes was also examined with the N-terminal truncation mutants of P0 (Fig. 4A). Unlike the C-terminal truncation, all the N-terminal mutants NΔ6-NΔ92 formed complexes that appeared as distinct bands in the presence of P1-P2 (lanes 2-7). The SDS gel electrophoretic analysis of the complexes showed that all contained P0 (or its mutants), P1, and P2 (data not shown), suggesting that the N-terminal truncations did not disrupt the binding potentials between P0 and P1-P2. In contrast, the N-terminal deletions caused marked effect of the rRNA binding (Fig. 4B). When N-terminal amino acids 1-6 (NΔ6) were truncated, the rRNA binding ability of P0·P1-P2 complex was reduced (Fig. 4B, lane 3). By further deletions (NΔ14-NΔ92, lanes 4-8), the binding ability was lost. However, the rRNA bindings of the complexes with NΔ6 and NΔ14, but not with NΔ21-NΔ92, were recovered by the addition of eL12 (data not shown). Assembly of the Truncated P0 Mutants onto the E. coli 50 S Particles— Unlike prokaryotic L10, eukaryotic P0 was hardly released from the animal 60 S subunit by standard high salt/ethanol conditions, and reconstitution experiments of the GTPase-associated center with animal ribosomes are much harder than those with E. coli ribosomes. We have established conditions to form a hybrid ribosomal particle in which L10·L7/L12 complex and L11 within the E. coli 50 S subunit are replaced with animal P0·P1-P2 and eL12, respectively (19Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore used the E. coli 50 S subunits to investigate the assembly of animal P0·P1-P2 and eL12 forming an active GTPase-associated center. The formation of hybrid 50 S particles by mixing E. coli 50 S cores with various truncated P0 mutants, P1/P2, and eL12 was confirmed by acrylamide/agarose composite gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). The gel mobility of E. coli 50 S cores (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 1) was shifted upwards by the addition of only recombinant silkworm eL12 (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 2) and then supershifted by the further addition of WT-P0·P1-P2 complex (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 3), indicating efficient binding of both proteins to E. coli 50 S core particles. Likewise, the complexes with the C-terminal truncation mutants of P0 (CΔ18-CΔ81) strongly bound to the core particles (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-7), whereas a clear supershift was not detected by the addition of CΔ107 (lane 8). In the case of the complexes with the N-terminal deletion mutants of P0, the supershifts were observed only in the NΔ6- and NΔ14-containing complexes (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5). By further deletions of P0, the ability of ribosome binding was completely lost (lanes 6-9). As shown in Fig. 2A, there is a notable difference in P1/P2 binding property between a group including WT-P0, CΔ18, and CΔ55 and another group of CΔ65 and CΔ81. The former members could bind efficiently P1/P2 without the RNA fragment, whereas the latter mutants required the rRNA fragment. To quantitate the amounts of P1 and P2 bound to P0 and compare them between the two groups, P1 and P2 were labeled in vitro by 32P phosphorylation and then incorporated into the hybrid 50 S particles with WT-P0 (Fig. 6, A and B, left) and CΔ81 (Fig. 6, A and B, right). After sucrose gradient centrifugation, the hybrid particles were collected, and the incorporated P1 and P2 were quantified. When WT-P0 was used, 2.2 copies of P1 (Fig. 6A, left) and 1.7 copies of P2 (Fig. 6B, left) were incorporated per 50 S particle. However, when CΔ81 was used, only 1.1 copies of P1 (Fig. 6A, right) and 1.0 copy of P2 (Fig. 6B, right) were present on the 50 S particles. The results are consistent with those in Fig. 2D and indicate that the WT-P0 binds two copies of both P1 and P2 but that CΔ81 binds only one copy each. Considering previous evidence that P1 and P2 form a heterodimer (16Shimizu T. Nakagaki M. Nishi Y. Kobayashi Y. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T.

Because growing evidence implicates accessory proteins in this process, we developed a method by which proteins interacting with the intact transporter could be identified. cDNAs encoding wild-type ABCA1 and a mutant lacking the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of ABCA1 were transfected into 293 cells, and the expressed proteins were solubilized using detergent conditions (0.75% CHAPS, 1 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine) predicted to retain high affinity protein-protein interactions. Proteins that co-purified with ABCA1 on an antibody affinity column were identified by liquid chromatographymass spectrometric analysis. A novel interaction with the PDZ protein β1-syntrophin was identified using this approach, and this interaction was confirmed in human THP-1 macrophages and in mouse liver. Small interference RNA inhibition of β1-syntrophin expression reduced cholesterol efflux from primary skin fibroblasts by 50% while decreasing efflux 30% in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Inhibition of β1-syntrophin decreased ABCA1 protein levels, whereas overexpression of β1-syntrophin increased ABCA1 cell-surface expression and stimulated efflux to apolipoprotein A-I. These findings indicate that β1-syntrophin acts through a class-I PDZ interaction with the C terminus of ABCA1 to regulate the cellular distribution and activity of the transporter. The approach used to identify β1-syntrophin as an ABCA1-binding protein should prove useful in elucidating other protein interactions upon which ABCA1 function depends.

Because HDL levels inversely correlate with cardiovascular disease, and cholesterol-engorged macrophages in the vessel wall are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a normally functioning ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway is thought to play a critical role in preventing coronary artery disease (12Miller N.E. Thelle D.S. Forde O.H. Mjos O.D. Lancet. 1977; 1: 965-968Abstract PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 13Cohen J.C. Kiss R.S. Pertsemlidis A. Marcel Y.L. McPherson R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2004; 305: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar).The ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway appears to be tightly regulated via a complex set of mechanisms that regulate ABCA1 expression at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. In response to increased cellular cholesterol levels, ABCA1 gene transcription is activated, with the liver X receptor, a member of the nuclear hormone family of transcriptional factors, playing a key role in this induction (14Costet P.

Evidence for post-translational regulation includes the finding that binding of apoA-I to the transporter prolongs its half-life by inhibiting a calpain-mediated degradation pathway (16Arakawa R.

Discordance between ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels, the very rapid turnover of the transporter protein, and the modulation of cholesterol efflux activity by a variety of protein kinases (including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, janus kinase 2, and protein kinase 2) all combine to suggest that the post-translational regulation of ABCA1 could play a central role in the regulation of the cellular cholesterol efflux pathway (19Yamauchi Y.

Schaefer E.J. Dupuis J. Eustace B. Van Eerdewegh P. Goldkamp A.L. Thurston L.M. FitzGerald M.G. Yasek-McKenna D. O'Neill G. Eberhart G.P. Weiffenbach B. Ordovas J.M. Freeman M.W. Brown Jr., R.H.

This mutation removes a putative PDZ protein-binding motif located in the terminal 3 residues of the cytoplasmic tail of the transporter. We originally speculated that this motif might be important for ABCA1 function, because PDZ proteins are involved in assembling protein complexes that contribute to the function of receptor and channel proteins (26Brousseau M.E. Schaefer E.J. Dupuis J. Eustace B. Van Eerdewegh P. Goldkamp A.L. Thurston L.M. FitzGerald M.G. Yasek-McKenna D. O'Neill G. Eberhart G.P. Weiffenbach B. Ordovas J.M. Freeman M.W. Brown Jr., R.H.

Named for the founding members of the group (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1), PDZ proteins carry one or more copies of a 90-amino acid domain that binds proteins ending in several distinct consensus motifs (27Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The ABCA1 C terminus (ESYV) conforms to the consensus motif (S/T-X-V-COOH) bound by class-I PDZ proteins, and we have previously shown that the PDZ domains of both PSD-95 and Dlg-1 bind to this sequence (28Fitzgerald M.L.

Recently, two other groups, using yeast two-hybrid screens employing either the last 165 or 120 amino acids of the ABCA1 C terminus as bait, identified three PDZ-containing proteins (α1 and β2 syntrophins and Lin7) as putative interactors with the transporter (29Buechler C.

The functional relevance of the β2-syntrophin and Lin7 interactions with ABCA1 are unclear, but α1-syntrophin was demonstrated to stabilize transporter expression and increase efflux activity in transfected cells (30Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S. Furuya A. Shitara K. Imamura M. Yokota T. Takeda S. Amachi T. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol.

Once developed, we then planned to exploit this method to probe the structural domains within ABCA1 required for these protein interactions. Using a monoclonal antibody affinity column, we were able to purify ABCA1 from transfected 293-EBNA-T cells using detergent conditions previously used to purify a close homolog of ABCA1, ABCA4. Under these conditions, which preserved the biological activity of ABCA4, we found ABCA1 co-purified with additional proteins. To minimize the evaluation of nonspecific, co-purifying proteins, and to expand our previous work showing the functional importance of the C terminus of the transporter, we also utilized a mutant ABCA1 protein lacking the C-terminal 40 amino acids. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteins that associated with wild-type and mutant ABCA1, permitting us to focus on the specific protein interactions lost when the last 40 amino acids of the transporter were deleted. This work led to the discovery of a novel interaction between ABCA1 and β-1 syntrophin. We further demonstrate that this interaction occurs under physiological conditions in murine liver and macrophages and that the interaction of β-1 syntrophin with ABCA1 is involved in regulating the cellular distribution and activity of the transporter.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—M2 anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal agarose-conjugated antibody (Sigma), anti-syntrophin mouse monoclonal antibody (Clone 1351, Affinity BioReagents), anti-utrophin mouse monoclonal antibody (Vector Laboratories), and rabbit anti-cyclophilin B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. The rabbit anti-ABCA1 antibody has been previously described (31Fitzgerald M.L. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the rabbit anti-β1-syntrophin antibody (syn251) was generously provided by Dr. Stanley Froehner (University of Washington, Seattle WA). SMARTpool siRNA duplexes were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Radionucleotides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Cell Transfection—Full-length and C-terminally truncated (Δ40) FLAG-tagged ABCA1 cDNAs were used as previously described (28Fitzgerald M.L.

Following trypsinization, a single cell suspension of HEK293-EBNA-T cells (5.6 × 108 cells) was transfected with cDNAs or empty vector using Lipofectamine-DNA complexes (750 μg of DNA/1.875 ml of LF-2000) in OptiMem serum-free media (4.98 × 106 cells/ml) with gentle agitation for 20 min at 37 °C. After transfection, the cells were plated into fifteen 150 mm tissue culture plates and incubated for 24 h prior to use.Affinity Purification of FLAG-ABCA1—A 15,000 × g post-nuclear membrane pellet that contains the majority of ABCA1 was isolated from transfected cells as previously described (31Fitzgerald M.L. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In brief, chilled cells were lifted by scraping in a hypotonic sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and disrupted in a Dounce with 20 strokes with a tight fitting pestle. Non-lysed cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The 15,000 × g pellet was solubilized under either stringent (1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) or mild detergent (0.75% CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 10% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) conditions as previously described by Sun et al. (33Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). After clarification, the soluble material was incubated on an anti-FLAG antibody affinity column, washed extensively (40 column volumes), and eluted with a 100 μg/ml solution of competing FLAG peptide. The column eluate from FLAG-ABCA1 or mock-transfected cells was concentrated by ultrafiltration, separated on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels and Coomassie stained to visualize eluted proteins. The amount of ABCA1 eluting from the column was assessed by Western blotting as previously described (31Fitzgerald M.L. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Proteins Co-purified with Wild-type and Δ40 ABCA1—Wild-type and Δ40 FLAG-ABCA1-expressing cells were lysed using CHAPS/PC buffer and affinity-purified as described above. Determination of protein concentration in the 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel samples was performed by staining with Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes) and quantification of fluorescent intensity of unknowns and bovine serum albumin standards using an Alpha Innotech FlourChem 8800 Imager. The amount of purified FLAG-ABCA1 was quantitated by immunoblotting using an anti-ABCA1 antibody that recognizes the N-terminal extracellular loop and was compared with a standard curve of the purified recombinant extracellular loop. Manipulations of the proteins were performed in a dual isolation BioSafety Cabinet to minimize exogenous keratin contamination. Stained gels were divided into five regions based on molecular mass (<200, 200-100, 100-65, and 50-30 kDa). Regions of the gel below 30 kDa were not analyzed due to potential contamination by the FLAG peptide. Gel pieces were placed in 1.5-ml Axygen tubes, destained with three washes of 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid, and rinsed with three alternating washes of ammonium bicarbonate (100 mm) and acetonitrile. Gel slices were dried and hydrated on ice in Promega Sequencing grade trypsin (5.5 μg/ml, 25 μl) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min, an equal volume of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added, and the tubes were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The peptide solutions were extracted with two 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate washes (75 μl), two 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid washes (75 μl), and then lyophilized. The lyophilate was dissolved in 24 μl of 5% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid. The samples were analyzed on a LCQ DECA XP plus mass spectrometer equipped with a Famos Autosampler, and Surveyor MS Pump (Thermo Electron) with split flow to deliver ∼200 nL/min to the in-house packed C18 column (75 μm inner diameter × 18 cm). For each run, 10 μl of reconstituted samples was injected and separated using a gradient of 5-60% buffer B (Buffer A was water with 0.1% formic acid, Buffer B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over the course of 90 min. In between each set of samples, standards (a mix of five Angiotensin peptides, Michrom BioResources) were analyzed to ascertain column performance and to determine any potential carryover. The LCQ was operated in the data-dependent mode with a top five configuration (one full MS scan followed by five MS/MS scans). Dynamic exclusion was set to 1 with a limit of 30 s. Peptides were identified using the Sequest software package through the Bioworks Browser 3.1. Sequential data base searches were made using the NCBI RefSeqHuman Data base using differential carbamidomethyl-modified cysteines and oxidized methionines. Peptide score cutoff values were chosen at a cross-correlation of 1.8 for singly charged ions, 2.5 for doubly charged ions, and 3.0 for triply charged ions, along with ΔCN values of 0.1 or greater, and RSP values of 1. The cross correlation values chosen for each peptide assure a high confidence match for the different charge states, whereas the ΔCN cutoff insures the uniqueness of the peptide hit. The rank score preliminary (RSP) value of 1 insures that the peptide matched the top hit in the preliminary scoring.Immunoprecipitations and Overlay Assays—ABCA1/β1-syntrophin complexes were co-precipitated from differentiated (100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 72 h) human THP-1 macrophage protein lysates or from mouse liver lysates using the anti-syntrophin monoclonal antibody. 15,000 × g pellets were isolated as described above and solubilized in TX100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and protease inhibitor mixture). Clarified supernatants were incubated with 50 μg of anti-pan-syntrophin Ab or mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured on protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with TX100 buffer, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the rabbit anti-ABCA1 and anti-β1-syntrophin antibodies.Binding of β1-syntrophin to the ABCA1 C terminus was assayed using bacterial His-tagged polypeptides representing the terminal 185 amino acids of wild-type ABCA1 or ABCA1 lacking the PDZ protein binding motif (Δ4). These polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membrane was then incubated with a total cell lysate (TX100 buffer) of 293-EBNA-T cells transfected with either empty vector or with the β1-syntrophin cDNA for 1 h at room temperature (280 mg of total cell protein diluted in 20 ml of blocking solution, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% milk protein, 1% bovine serum albumin). After washing (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20), binding of β1-syntrophin was detected with the anti-β1-syntrophin antibody, and the membrane was stripped and reprobed with the anti-C-terminal ABCA1 antibody to demonstrate equal loading of the two His-tagged polypeptides. The interaction of the ABCA1 C terminus with the PDZ domain of β1-syntrophin was further analyzed using a biotinylated peptide representing the final 20 amino acids of the ABCA1 C terminus. The ABCA1 peptide was used to probe an array of 34 purified GST-PDZ domain protein fusions from 24 proteins, including β1-syntrophin (Panomics TranSignal™ PDZ Domain Array IV). 15 μl of the biotin-ABCA1 peptide (50 μm) was mixed with 15 μl of avidin-horseradish peroxidase (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The peptide/avidin mix was added into 5 ml of 1× Blocking buffer (final ABCA1 peptide concentration 15 nm) and incubated with the array for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, binding of the peptide was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and quantitated using the Alpha Innotech FlourChem 8800 Imager.Determination of ABCA1 Turnover and Synthesis—Fibroblasts treated with β1-syntrophin siRNA were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) for 1 h, pulsed with a 35S-protein labeling mix for 2 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in complete media for the indicated times. ABCA1 protein was determined by immunoprecipitation with a protein-A purified anti-ABCA1 antibody. The synthesis rate of ABCA1 was assayed in HEK293 cells transfected with the ABCA1 cDNA and empty vector, or with the ABCA1 and β1-syntrophin cDNAs incubated as above in the 35S-protein labeling mix for increasing periods of time. ABCA1 was directly quantitated by immunoprecipitation followed by phosphor imaging of the 35S-labeled ABCA1 on a STORM 860 scanner (GE Healthcare).The measurement of ABCA1 cell-surface expression by the radioimmunodetection of the FLAG epitope and assessment of the distribution of GFP-ABCA1 by confocal microscopy were performed as previously described (31Fitzgerald M.L.

Primary 1056 human fibroblasts (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, cells were treated with 50 pmol of siRNA and 2 μl of Dharmafect 4 (Dharmacon). 24 h after transfection, cholesterol efflux was measured as we previously described (31Fitzgerald M.L. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with DMEM (10% fetal bovine serum) containing 10 μg/ml cholesterol, 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h, and the medium was replaced with DMEM containing and 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for another 24 h. Cells were then incubated with DMEM (2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) with or without 10 μg/ml apoA-I for 20 h. Media was collected, cleared of cellular debris by an 800 × g spin for 10 min, and the cell layers were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and percent cholesterol efflux (media cpm/(cpm of media + cell associated cpm) × 100) was calculated by scintillation counting. The effectiveness of siRNA inhibition was measured by immunoblotting on a parallel set of unlabeled cells. For mouse bone marrow macrophages, marrow cells were isolated from C57/BL6 mice and cultured for 6 days in L29-conditioned medium as described previously (34Kim W.S. Fitzgerald M.L. Kang K.

BMDM in 24-well plates were treated with 5 pmol of siRNA and 1 μl of Dharmafect 4 in each well. Following 24 h of transfection, cholesterol efflux was measured as described above.RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from siRNA transfected fibroblasts using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random primers (Promega), and cDNAs were used as the template in quantitative real-time amplifications using the Bio-Rad iCycler. Each reaction (50 μl) contained 0.3 μm primers, 25 μl of 2× Bio-Rad SYBR green Supermix and 2 μl of template, and was amplified by 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C and 30 s), annealing (60 °C and 30 s), and extension (72 °C and 30 s). Standards were prepared from full-length cDNAs serially diluted from 5 ng/μl to 5 fg/μl. Transcript levels were normalized to the amount of β-actin transcript and were expressed as a percentage of the control siRNA sample.Statistical Analysis—An analysis of variance was used to determine the significance of siRNA knockdown on apoA-I-dependent efflux activity. The data set consisted of four independent efflux experiments with triplicate sampling comparing the negative control siRNA (n = 12), the duplex pool targeting utrophin (n = 9), the duplex pool targeting β1-syntrophin (n = 12), and the duplex pool targeting β2-syntrophin (n = 9). A factorial comparison was done comparing apoA-I-dependent efflux versus the siRNA treatment groups.RESULTSAffinity Purification of ABCA1—To purify adequate amounts of protein for subsequent liquid chromatography-MS"
https://openalex.org/W1981789279,"Oxidized abasic sites are a major form of DNA damage induced by free radical attack and deoxyribose oxidation. 2-Deoxyribonolactone (dL) is a C1′-oxidized abasic site implicated in DNA strand breakage, mutagenesis, and formation of covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) with repair enzymes such as DNA polymerase β (polβ). We show here that mammalian cell-free extracts incubated with Ape1-incised dL substrates under non-repair conditions give rise to DPCs, with a major species dependent on the presence of polβ. DPC formation was much less under repair than non-repair conditions, with extracts of either polβ-proficient or -deficient cells. Partial base excision DNA repair (BER) reconstituted with purified enzymes demonstrated that Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) efficiently excises a displaced oligonucleotide containing a 5′-terminal dL residue, as would be produced during long-patch (multinucleotide) BER. Simultaneous monitoring of dL repair and dL-mediated DPC formation demonstrated that removal of the dL residue through the combined action of strand-displacement DNA synthesis by polβ and excision by FEN1 markedly diminished DPC formation with the polymerase. Analysis of the patch size distribution associated with DNA repair synthesis in cell-free extracts showed that the processing of dL residues is associated with the synthesis of ≥2 nucleotides, compared with predominantly single nucleotide replacement for regular abasic sites. Our observations reveal a cellular repair process for dL lesions that avoids formation of DPCs that would threaten the integrity of DNA and perhaps cell viability.

Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar, 4Atamna H. Cheung I. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). AP sites are formed by spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bonds or through the removal of damaged or mismatched bases by various DNA glycosylases (5Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 6Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In either case, the resulting AP sites are repaired by the base excision DNA repair (BER) pathway. In mammalian cells, the major AP endonuclease, Ape1 (also called Apex, HAP1, or Ref-1), incises the 5′-phosphodiester bond of the AP site to generate a BER intermediate that contains a single-strand break bracketed by 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (5′-dRP) termini.Subsequent steps may follow either of two distinct BER sub-pathways that replace either a single nucleotide (short-patch BER) or multiple nucleotides (long-patch BER). In short-patch BER, most 5′-dRP excision is attributable to DNA polymerase β (polβ), specifically the dRP lyase activity of its amino-terminal 8-kDa domain (7Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 8Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The DNA polymerase activity of polβ is also the major enzyme for DNA synthesis during short-patch BER, as demonstrated in vitro by using purified enzymes and cell extracts from wild-type and polβ-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (9Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The long-patch BER pathway involves strand displacement repair synthesis of at least two nucleotides and the excision of the 5′-dRP residue as part of a flap oligonucleotide released by the FEN1 nuclease (11Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Klungland A. Lindahl T.

Chem. 2001; 40: 809-813Google Scholar). A reconstituted enzyme system was developed for long-patch BER of a reduced AP site utilizing purified Ape1, polβ, polδ, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), FEN1, and DNA ligase I, where polδ substituted for polβ when PCNA was present in the reaction (12Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). PCNA-dependent long-patch BER has also been demonstrated in extracts of polβ-deficient MEFs, but it was shown to be dependent on using a circular DNA substrate (9Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Bennett S.E. Sung J.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42588-42600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An additional variation of BER has been suggested, because some bifunctional DNA glycosylases associated with AP lyase activity can carry out incision of AP sites by β-elimination, resulting in 3′-blocked ends that must be removed by enzymes such as Ape1 and polynucleotide kinase prior to repair DNA synthesis (18Demple B. DeMott M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8926-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Karimi-Busheri F. Rasouli-Nia A. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Izumi T. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).Oxidative damage to DNA, mediated by free-radicals and reactive oxygen species, produces structurally distinct AP sites that are handled differently by BER enzymes (18Demple B. DeMott M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8926-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such lesions include 2-deoxyribonolactone (dL), a C1′-oxidized AP site, which has been reported to be introduced into DNA by numerous genotoxic agents including long-wave UV and ionizing radiation, organometallic oxidants, copper-phenanthroline chemical nuclease, and the chromophore of the antitumor agent neocarzinostatin (20von Sonntag C. Basic Life Sci. 1991; 58: 287-317PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sigman D.S. Mazumder A. Perrin D.M. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2295-2316Crossref Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 22Pratviel G. Pitie M. Bernadou J. Meunier B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6283-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Little was known about repair of dL until the recent development of synthetic oligonucleotides that yield a site-specific dL through a photosensitive nucleotide analog (23Hwang J.T. Tallman K.A. Greenberg M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3805-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Jourdan M. Garcia J. Defrancq E. Kotera M. Lhomme J.

Initial investigation of the reaction of dL with Escherichia coli endonuclease III, a DNA glycosylase with an associated AP lyase activity, revealed formation of a stable DNA-protein cross-link (DPC) between the dL lesion and the catalytic lysine of the enzyme (27Hashimoto M. Greenberg M.M. Kow Y.W. Hwang J.T. Cunningham R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3161-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the AP endonuclease activity of E. coli exonuclease III (Exo III) and endonuclease IV (Endo IV) process dL lesions efficiently (28Greenberg M.M. Weledji Y.N. Kim J. Bales B.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8178-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and such 5′-incision would prevent AP lyase enzymes from acting on dL. Consistent with these observations, the dL-induced mutation frequency was highly elevated in E. coli-deficient in both major AP endonucleases (29Faure V. Constant J.F. Dumy P. Saparbaev M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The major human AP endonuclease Ape1 also incises dL residues rather efficiently, leaving a 5′-terminal oxidized AP residue (30Xu Y.J. DeMott M.S. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, an Ape1-incised dL residue forms stable DPC with polβ, the next BER enzyme, dependent on its catalytic lysine (residue 72) for its dRP lyase activity (31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This DPC linkage is evidently a stable amide bond between the lysine-72 ϵ-nitrogen and the dL C1′-carbonyl (18Demple B. DeMott M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8926-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Although in vitro studies with purified E. coli proteins and mammalian polβ have provided useful information about chemical mechanisms involved in dL-mediated DPC (31DeMott M.S.

Kow Y.W. Greenberg M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2449-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the biological significance of such DPC formation and the cellular repair of dL lesions remains unclear. In the present study, we utilized mammalian cell-free extracts to determine whether different cellular proteins are prone to dL-mediated DPC formation. To explore possible repair of dL lesions, and its correlation with DPC formation, the complete repair of closed circular DNA substrate with a defined dL residue was analyzed for evidence of both sub-pathways of BER. We found that polβ is indeed the major cellular protein associated with formation of dL-specific DPC, but that DPC formation can be largely prevented by rapid removal of dL through mechanisms of long-patch BER.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Oligonucleotides containing a dL precursor residue (1′-t-butylcarbonyluridylate; tBU) (31DeMott M.S.

Greenberg (Johns Hopkins University, MD). Other oligonucleotides were synthesized and high-performance liquid chromatography purified by Operon Technologies. pGEM-3Zf (+) plasmid and helper phage (R408) were obtained from Promega. Radionucleotides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HeLa and polβ-proficient (MB16tsA, clone 1B5) or -deficient (MB19tsA, clone 2B2) SV-40 immortalized MEF cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow fragment DNA polymerase, E. coli Exo III, and all restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Proteinase K was from Sigma/Aldrich. Recombinant human Ape1 and E. coli Endo IV were purified as described previously (33Masuda Y. Bennett R.A. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Human polβ was kindly provided by Drs. R. Prasad and S. H. Wilson (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). Goat anti-Poβ polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant human FEN1 was expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity as previously described (34Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), by utilizing an expression vector pET-FCH that was provided by Dr. R. Bambara (University of Rochester). E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung) was provided by Dr. D. W. Mosbaugh (Oregon State University). The p21 peptide GRKRRQTSMTDFYHSKRRLIFS that binds PCNA (35Pan Z.Q. Reardon J.T. Li L. Flores-Rozas H. Legerski R. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Duplex 31-mer DNA substrates were prepared by hybridization of tBU-30 or U-30 to T1. The substrates utilized for FEN1 cleavage were constructed by hybridization of upstream primer (Up-19) and downstream primer (U-17 or tBU-17) with T2 template DNA. Each substrate was 3′-end labeled by incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP using the exonuclease-free Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Closed circular pGEM-3Zf (+) plasmid DNA containing a site-specific lesion was constructed as previously described (36Sung J.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4613-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), except that different primers were employed. Briefly, single-stranded pGEM plasmid (+) DNA was produced with the aid of helper phage (R408) and purified by the CTAB DNA precipitation method (36Sung J.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4613-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Each upstream primer (Up-T, Up-U, and Up-tBU) was 5′-phosphorylated and annealed to single-stranded pGEM DNA. During the preparation of 32P-labeled pGEM DNA substrates that were employed in patch size distribution analysis, each upstream primer was 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and a molar excess of [α-32P]ATP. To construct 32P-labeled pGEM DNA substrates used for DPC detection, 5′-32P-labeled downstream primer (Down), in addition to the upstream primer Up-tBU, was also hybridized to single-stranded pGEM DNA. Each primed template was subjected to a primer extension reaction followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase. Covalently closed circular duplex DNA for either unlabeled or 32P-labeled pGEM (T/A), (U/A), and (tBU/A) were isolated by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation as described previously (36Sung J.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4613-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Typically, isolated plasmid DNA was found to contain >98% form I molecules as determined by 1% agarose gel.TABLE ONEDNA oligonucleotides used for DNA substrate constructionsOligonucleotides DNA substratesaThe underlined nucleotides U and tBU denote uridine and 1′-t-butylcarbonyluridylated residues, the precursor for dL, respectivelyDNA sequencesPrimersU-305′-GTCACGTGCTGCAUACGACGTGCTGAGCCT-3′tBU-305′-GTCACGTGCTGCAtBUACGACGTGCTGAGCCT-3′Up-195′-GTCACGTGCTGCATTGCTG-3′U-175′-UACGACGTGCTGAGCCT-3′tBU-175′-tBUACGACGTGCTGAGCCT-3′TemplatesT15′-GAGGCTCAGCACGTCGTGTGCAGCACGTGAC-3′T25′-GAGGCTCAGCACCAGCAATGCAGCACGTGAC-3′Plasmid DNA substratesUp-T5′-ATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGG-3′Up-U5′-ATCCTCTAGAGUCGACCTGCAGG-3′Up-tBU5′-ATCCTCTAGAGtBUCGACCTGCAGG-3′Down5′-CATGCAAGCTTGAGTATTCTAT-3′a The underlined nucleotides U and tBU denote uridine and 1′-t-butylcarbonyluridylated residues, the precursor for dL, respectively Open table in a new tab To generate a site-specific dL residue in DNA substrates, 2–5 pmol of DNA duplex containing a tBU residue was subjected to the photolysis reaction as previously described (31DeMott M.S.

The efficiency of the photo-conversion was typically >90% when monitored by dL-specific DNA cleavage using hot-alkali treatment and subsequent analysis of DNA by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Where indicated, DNA containing a dL lesion was subjected to the treatment with catalytic amounts of either Endo IV or Ape1 to generate a site-specific dL-5-phosphate (5′-dL) residue. Oligonucleotide and plasmid DNA containing a uracil residue was treated with a catalytic amount (1–10 units) of uracil-DNA glycosylase to prepare DNA substrates containing a site-specific AP site.Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—HeLa and MEF cell-free extracts were prepared from confluent cells as previously described (17Bennett S.E. Sung J.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42588-42600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Hepes-KOH (PH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations of the cell-free extracts were determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent. The levels of polβ in cell-free extracts were monitored by Western blot analysis as described previously (37Chen K.H. Yakes F.M. Srivastava D.K. Singhal R.K. Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Van Houten B. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Analysis of Cross-linking Reactions—Standard cross-linking reactions contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 nm 3′-32P-labeled 31-mer DNA substrate, and protein concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Following incubation at 30 °C for the specified times, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. DPCs and free DNA were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and 32P radioactivity associated with DNA-protein cross-links was quantified using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro DNA Repair Assay with Purified Enzymes—A partial reconstitution of long-patch BER was performed in reactions containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 nm 3′-end 32P-labeled 31-mer DNA substrate, and various BER enzymes as indicated. Where indicated, 50 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP were included to permit only limited repair related strand displacement DNA synthesis. For the FEN1 assay, reactions also contained the indicated concentrations of FEN1 enzyme and duplex DNA substrates bearing unannealed 5′-flap structures. After incubation at 30 °C for the specified times, reactions were terminated by addition of formamide loading buffer (31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and heating at 100 °C for 3 min. 32P-DNA products were resolved by 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel electrophoresis.Analysis of BER Reaction Products—BER reactions were performed at 30 °C using a standard reaction buffer containing 100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm β-NAD, 20 μm each of dNTPs, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 200 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 5–10 μg/ml of the appropriate pGEM DNA substrate, and cell-free extract as indicated in the figure legends. To monitor DPC formation with unrepaired dL residues, a 32P-labeled pGEM (dL/A) substrate was employed in the reaction. Following incubation for the specified times, reaction products were digested with 10 units of BamHI and HindIII for 1 h at 37°C,and then analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. To distinguish between either the short- or long-patch BER pathways, a modified restriction analysis method was used that differed slightly from that previously described (38Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, unlabeled pGEM DNA substrates were incubated with cell-free extract under standard BER conditions, except reactions contained, as indicated, 20 μm of either 32P-dTTP or a combined mixture of dTTP and 32P-dCTP. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated, and DNA products were isolated as previously described (36Sung J.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4613-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Samples (100 ng) were removed for digestion with various restriction endonucleases, as indicated, for 1 h at 37°C. The resulting 32P-DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel.Determination of Repair Patch Size Distribution—Standard BER reactions (100 μl) were prepared as described above except that 2′-deoxyribonucleoside α-thiotriphosphate (dNTP[αS]) were substituted for normal dNTPs. pGEM DNA substrates contained a 32P-labeled dAMP residue located 11 nucleotides upstream of the target residue. After BER reactions were performed, DNA products were isolated as described above, and 100 ng of each DNA sample was digested with 10 units of HindIII for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated at 70 °C for 10 min, and samples were incubated with 100 units of Exo III for 1 h at 37 °C. Exonuclease III was inactivated at 70 °C for 10 min, and the 32P-DNA was then cleaved with BamHI for 30 min at 37 °C. The resulting 32P-DNA fragments were resolved by 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel electrophoresis, and quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSdL-mediated DPC Formation in Cell-free Extracts—We showed previously that Ape1 efficiently incises DNA at dL lesions to yield 5′-terminal dL-5-phosphate (5′-dL) residues (30Xu Y.J. DeMott M.S. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). During attempted excision of a 5′-dL residue, polβ becomes covalently cross-linked to the oxidized lesion (31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To understand the biological significance of such DPC formation, we have now conducted in vitro assays with cell-free extracts and determined major cellular proteins involved in dL-mediated DPCs. A 32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA substrate bearing a site-specific dL residue (formed from the precursor by UVA exposure) was incubated with a HeLa cell-free extract, and the profile of DNA and DPC products was examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Initial reactions were conducted in the presence of EDTA to suppress nuclease activity; AP lyases and dRP lyases are usually active under these conditions and might form DPC (27Hashimoto M. Greenberg M.M. Kow Y.W. Hwang J.T. Cunningham R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3161-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31DeMott M.S. Beyret E. Wong D. Bales B.C. Hwang J.T. Greenberg M.M. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7637-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To allow incision of dL residues under these conditions, we added catalytic amounts of the EDTA-resistant enzyme E. coli Endo IV (39Levin J.D. Johnson A.W. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8066-8071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the incised dL substrate with purified polβ produced the expected DPC product (Fig. 1, lane 3). Incubation with the cell-free extract revealed several new labeled bands migrating more slowly than the DNA substrate (Fig. 1, lane 4). These new species were not produced with DNA containing the unconverted precursor residue (Fig. 1, lane 2), and they were completely eliminated upon post-treatment with proteinase K (Fig. 1, lane 6). These observations indicate the formation of dL-specific DPCs.Heat treatment of the extracts was used to test for those proteins that required a folded structure for the formation of cross-links. At least one of the DPCs with Mr ∼20,000 was heat-insensitive, but the major DPC species with Mr ∼45,000 was lost when the cell extract was pretreated by heating (Fig. 1, lane 7). A similar profile of DPCs was also observed when the dL-DNA was pre-incised by a catalytic amount of Ape1 and incubated with cell-free extract in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). Thus, the formation of the major DPC appeared to be mediated by a Mg2+-independent, heat-sensitive HeLa protein.The Mr of the major HeLa DPC product formed with AP endonuclease-incised dL was very close to that formed with purified polβ (Fig. 1. compare lanes 3 and 4; see also supplemental Fig. S1). To address directly whether the major protein for dL-mediated DPC in mammalian cells was indeed polβ, experiments were performed with cell-free extracts from POLB+/+ or POLB-/- MEFs. The Mr 45,000 DPC product initially appeared after a 10-min incubation with a POLB+/+ cell extract and increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–6). Extracts of POLB-/- MEFs did not produce this DPC product after incubations as long as 120 min (Fig. 2A, lane 8), which indicates that polβ was the major protein forming DPCs with 5′-dL residues. Western blot analysis confirmed the POLB genotypes and indicated that the extract of wild-type cells contained ∼0.2 pmol of polβ per cross-linking reaction (Fig. 2B). Thus, DPC formation with endogenous polβ extracts was 8-fold less efficient than the reaction with purified polβ (Fig. 2A, lane 1 versus 6). However, both the POLB+/+ and POLB-/- cell-free extracts gave a time-dependent increase of minor DPC species, which appeared as additional faint bands on the gel (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–8; indicated by arrows). These results imply that DPCs may be formed with various mammalian proteins, although polβ is the main activity responsible for DPC formation with AP endonuclease-incised dL.FIGURE 2Major DPC formed with dL in MEF cell-free extracts dependent on polβ.

https://openalex.org/W2009021135,"The frequency with which replication forks break down in all organisms requires that specific mechanisms ensure completion of genome duplication. In Escherichia coli a major pathway for reloading of the replicative apparatus at sites of fork breakdown is dependent on PriA helicase. PriA acts in conjunction with PriB and DnaT to effect loading of the replicative helicase DnaB back onto the lagging strand template, either at stalled fork structures or at recombination intermediates. Here we showed that PriB stimulates PriA helicase, acting to increase the apparent processivity of PriA. This stimulation correlates with the ability of PriB to form a ternary complex with PriA and DNA structures containing single-stranded DNA, suggesting that the known single-stranded DNA binding function of PriB facilitates unwinding by PriA helicase. This enhanced apparent processivity of PriA might play an important role in generating single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks upon which to load DnaB. However, stimulation of PriA by PriB is not DNA structure-specific, demonstrating that targeting of stalled forks and recombination intermediates during replication restart likely resides with PriA alone."

The rDNA intergenic spacer of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains four polar or orientation-specific fork barriers, Ter1–3 and RFP4. Whereas the transcription terminator Reb1p binds Ter2 and Ter3 to arrest replication, the factor(s) responsible for fork arrest at Ter1 and RFP4 remain unknown. Using linker scanning mutagenesis, we have narrowed down minimal Ter1 to 21 bp. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a consensus binding motif for the essential switch-activating and genome-stabilizing protein Sap1p within this region. Recombinant Sap1p bound Ter1 with high specificity, and endogenous Ter1 binding activity contained Sap1p and comigrated with the Sap1p-Ter1 complex. Circular permutation analysis suggested that Sap1p bends Ter1 and SAS1 upon binding. Targeted mutational analysis revealed that Ter1 mutations, which prevent Sap1p binding in vitro, are defective for replication fork arrest in vivo, whereas mutations that do not affect Sap1p binding remain competent to arrest replication. The results confirm the hypothesis that the chromatin organizer Sap1p binds site-specifically to genomic regions other than SAS1 and support the notion that Sap1p binds the rDNA fork barrier Ter1 to cause polar replication fork arrest at this site but not at SAS1.

Replication forks often stall during normal DNA replication because of encounters with DNA lesions, breaks, or genotoxic stress (1McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Stalled forks may be recombinogenic, and regression of these forks without proper restart can lead to genomic instability (1McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Such Ter sites are usually polar or orientation-specific and, depending on the organism, presumably control proper completion of replication, chromosome segregation, recombination events, and even mating type switching in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (3Bastia D.

Thus, unraveling the mechanisms and consequences of fork arrest is critical to understanding the physiology of DNA replication and genome stability. termination ribosomal DNA wild type Four fork barriers, Ter1–3 and RFP4, function within the rDNA of S. pombe. Ter1–3 are polar and are located within the intergenic spacer region. Each remains functional when present on a plasmid replicon, suggesting that the sites function as bona fide Ter sites. Furthermore, the intra S-phase checkpoint proteins Swi1p and Swi3p are absolutely necessary for stable fork arrest at Ter1–3. In contrast, RFP4 is located within the terminus of the rDNA transcription unit and is inactive extrachromosomally, suggesting that this barrier may be dependent on rDNA transcription (13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most mechanistic knowledge regarding replication fork arrest derives from work in prokaryotic systems in which site-specific binding of terminator proteins to their cognate Ter sites causes polar fork arrest by inhibiting DNA unwinding of replicative helicases and thereby fork progression (18Sahoo T. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29138-29144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D.

The paradigm that site-specific terminators are required for fork arrest at eukaryotic Ter sites seems to hold true as well, as binding of Fob1p to the rDNA Ter sites is required for polar fork arrest in S. cerevisiae (22Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1932-1941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Kobayashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9178-9188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, mammalian TTF-1 mediates fork arrest at the terminators in mouse rDNA (24Gerber J.K. Gogel E. Berger C. Wallisch M. Muller F. Grummt I. Grummt F. Cell. 1997; 90: 559-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, binding of the transcription terminator protein Reb1p to its repeated cognate binding sites at Ter2 and Ter3 is required to pause replication forks at these barriers (13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Sanchez-Gorostiaga A. Lopez-Estrano C. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B. Hernandez P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that forks colliding with DNA-bound terminator proteins, such as Reb1p at Ter2 and Ter3, are temporarily stalled at these sites, and that the stalled complex is subsequently stabilized by Swi1p and Swi3p (13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cause of fork pausing at Ter1 has not been identified. Theoretically, the Ter1 sequence alone could pause replication by folding into a polymerase-stalling secondary structure. Alternatively, Ter1 is likely to bind a terminator protein. Clearly, a necessary prerequisite to studying and understanding the biochemistry of stalled replication forks is to identify all of the factors involved and their respective interactions. In addition to rDNA fork arrest, natural fork pausing occurs also at two sites near the mating type switch locus mat1. Four transacting factors, rtf1, rtf2, swi1, and swi3 act at the barrier RTS1 to ensure that mat1 is replicated uni-directionally, a prerequisite for imprinting and subsequent mating type switching (26Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 153-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Swi1p and Swi3p likely act at RTS1 to stabilize stalled forks in a manner analogous to their action at the rDNA Ter sites. Forks also pause in a Swi1p- and Swi3p-dependent manner at the site of the imprint (27Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 29Vengrova S. Dalgaard J.Z. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 794-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Imprinting requires in addition the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α Swi7p (30Singh J. Klar A.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as well as Sap1p, which binds to its cognate site SAS1, located ∼160 bp from the site of the imprint (31Arcangioli B. Klar A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3025-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Arcangioli B. Copeland T.D. Klar A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although necessary for the formation and/or maintenance of the imprint, neither Swi7p nor Sap1p are required for the initial fork pausing event (27Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Arcangioli B. Klar A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3025-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sap1p is an essential DNA-binding protein and is required for viability independently of its function in mating type switching (32Arcangioli B. Copeland T.D. Klar A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), perhaps because of its chromatin-organizing function (33de Lahondes R. Ribes V. Arcangioli B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 910-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Loss of Sap1p causes defects in chromosome segregation, whereas overexpression of Sap1p is also toxic, causing pleiotropic effects including chromosome fragmentation and abnormal mitosis. These phenotypes occur after the initiation of DNA replication (32Arcangioli B. Copeland T.D. Klar A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although these effects are likely initiated by Sap1p binding to numerous sites throughout the genome, the targets remain elusive as no binding sites apart from SAS1 have yet been identified. In our ongoing efforts to understand more clearly the mechanisms and functional consequences of rDNA replication fork arrest, we have narrowed down the minimal Ter1 site to 21 bp using linker scanning mutagenesis and two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the Ter1 sequence revealed a consensus binding motif for Sap1p. Sap1p bound specifically to Ter1 in vitro, and binding of Sap1p to both Ter1 and SAS1 was shown to bend the DNA. Furthermore, a specific Ter1 binding activity from S. pombe extracts co-migrated with the Sap1p-Ter1 complex and supershift assays suggested that endogenous Sap1p was present within the Ter1-bound complex. Targeted mutagenesis of the Ter1 site revealed that mutations which decreased or inhibited Sap1p binding in vitro also decreased or abolished replication fork arrest in vivo. In contrast, mutations that did not affect Sap1p binding were fully functional for fork arrest. Taken together, these results support the notion that the essential chromatin-organizing protein Sap1p binds within the rDNA at Ter1 and causes polar replication fork arrest at this site. Strains—S. pombe SP976 (h90, ade6-M210, ura4-D18, leu1-32) was used for all yeast experiments. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for all cloning. E. coli BL21 DE3(plysS) was used for expression and purification of His6-Sap1. Linker-scanning Mutagenesis—Linker-scanning mutants of the Ter1 region were generated by a PCR-mediated method essentially as described (34Gustin K.E. Burk R.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 22-24PubMed Google Scholar), using pIS8F2 as a template. Successive 10-bp sequences of the Ter1-containing fragment in pIS8F2 were thus replaced with the NcoI restriction site. The resulting mutant PCR products were digested with SacI and SphI and cloned directionally into pIRT2 in blocking orientation with respect to ars1. All primers and oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Sequences are available upon request. Plasmids—Various overlapping fragments were amplified by PCR from Ter1-containing pIS8 (13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and cloned into the unique BamHI site of pIRT2. One of these clones, pIS8F2, retained Ter1 activity within a 113-bp fragment as analyzed by two-dimensional agarose electrophoresis (see Fig. 2). To generate pTer1.IRT2, the oligonucleotides GATCTCCATGGATAGCTCCTTGCACTGCGTTAAATCCCG and GATCCGGGATTTAACGCAGTGCAAGGAGCTATCCATGGA were annealed, kinased with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and cloned into BamHI of pIRT2. All Ter1 mutants were generated in an analogous manner, using the mutant sequences indicated in the text, excepting that SacI/SphI sites were substituted at the ends to facilitate directional cloning into pIRT2. To create pSAS1.IRT2A and pSAS1.IRT2B, oligonucleotides corresponding to SAS1 (38Arcangioli B. Ghazvini M. Ribes V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were annealed, kinased, and ligated into the unique BamHI site of pIRT2 in either orientation. pBend2 was a gift from Dr. Dhruba Chattoraj (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To generate pTer1.Bend2 and pSAS1.Bend2, oligonucleotides corresponding to the respective sites were annealed, kinased, and ligated into the unique XbaI site of pBend2. To create pHis6-Sap1, sequences corresponding to the sap1 open reading frame were amplified by PCR and cloned into the BamHI site of pET15b. Plasmids were sequenced by the MUSC Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. Sequences of all oligonucleotides used are available upon request. Gel Shift and Supershift Assays—To generate probes for gel shift assays, 1 pmol of oligonucleotides corresponding to Ter1, Ter1 mutants, or SAS1 were end-labeled with optikinase (USB) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After removal of free γ-32P using G-25 Sephadex spin columns, the oligonucleotides were mixed with a 3-fold excess of cold complementary oligonucleotides in 600 mm NaCl, 1× TE, pH 8, boiled for 5 min, and allowed to return slowly to room temperature overnight. The annealed probes were desalted using G-25 Sephadex spin columns. For gel shift assays, 3 fmol of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were incubated with the indicated amounts of His6-Sap1 or S. pombe crude whole cell extracts in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and either 100 ng or 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, respectively, for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were also performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol with no appreciable difference in DNA binding. Bound and free probes were electrophoresed through 6% native polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5% glycerol using 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA running buffer. Wet gels were directly exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) at -80 °C. For competition experiments, protein was incubated with indicated amounts of excess cold double-stranded oligonucleotides in the same binding buffer prior to addition of the probe. Supershift assays were performed in a similar manner as gel shift assays, except that bound complexes were further incubated with indicated dilutions of anti-Sap1p antiserum directed at the N terminus of Sap1p (generously provided by Dr. Benoit Arcangioli, Institute Pasteur, Paris Cedex, France) for 10 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis. To test the specificity of the antiserum to Sap1p, the antiserum was depleted of anti-Sap1p antibody by first passing it over His6-Sap1 immobilized on Talon metal ion affinity beads (BD Biosciences) prior to supershift analysis. Mock-depleted antisera were prepared in an identical manner by passing it over Talon affinity beads lacking bound His6-Sap1. Protein Expression and Purification—His6-Sap1 was expressed in BL21 DE3(plysS). Briefly, cells were grown to A600 nm ∼0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested and lysed on ice with 0.75 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) in Buffer A (20 ml 12 mm HEPES, pH 8, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, containing incomplete (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), followed by one cycle of freeze-thawing. Lysed extracts were briefly sonicated with three 10-s pulses and cleared by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were bound in batch for 1 h at 4 °Cto 4 ml of Talon metal ion affinity resin beads prewashed in Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The beads were subsequently thoroughly washed with 12 column volumes of the same buffer 5 times for 10 min each plus one wash in Buffer A with KCl adjusted to 400 mm. The beads were then packed into a 10-ml disposable column (Bio-Rad) and again washed with 10 column volumes. Protein was eluted in Buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole (Sigma) into 20 1-ml fractions. Fractions were immediately adjusted to 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 mm MgCl2 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Positive fractions were pooled. The protein was >98% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (see Fig. 4A). Preparation of Crude S. pombe Extracts—Cells were grown to mid-log phase, harvested in ice-cold 133 mm EDTA, 33% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Thawed pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) was added, and cells were lysed by vigorous vortexing 15× 1 min each with 1 min pauses on ice inbetween. Glass beads and cell debris were spun out at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the lysate was subsequently cleared by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were either stored on ice for immediate use or frozen in 30% glycerol at -80 °C. Two-dimensional Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—DNA was prepared and two-dimensional gel experiments were performed as previously described (13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were directed at the LEU2 gene of pIRT2. DNA Bending—DNA-bending experiments were performed essentially as described (35Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The indicated restriction fragments of pTer1.Bend2 or pSAS1.Bend2 were eluted from agarose gels (Qiagen) and end-labeled with optikinase (USB) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Excess free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by G-25 Sephadex spin columns. Binding was performed under conditions identical to those used for gel shift assays, and the complexes were electrophoresed through 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Relative mobilities were calculated for the free and bound probes by measuring the distance each migrated from the wells. Minimal Ter1 Activity Is Functionally Contained within a 21-bp Region of the S. pombe rDNA—We have previously identified four replication fork barriers, Ter1–3 and RFP4 within the S. pombe intergenic rDNA region (Fig. 1A). Although Ter1–3 were all found to require the intra-S phase checkpoint proteins Swi1p and Swi3p for activity (13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the initiating cause for polar fork pausing was only identified for Ter2 and Ter3, which correspond to binding sites for the RNA polymerase I transcription terminator Reb1p (13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Sanchez-Gorostiaga A. Lopez-Estrano C. Krimer D.B. Schvartzman J.B. Hernandez P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Zhao A. Guo A. Liu Z. Pape L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, Reb1p functions also as a replication terminator at these sites, presumably by pausing the oncoming replication fork as a prerequisite for Swi1p- and Swi3p-dependent stable fork arrest. However, whether a DNA-binding terminator protein or DNA structure is responsible for polar fork arrest at Ter1 (Fig. 1B) remained unanswered. To identify the factor(s) responsible for fork arrest at Ter1, we chose to first define the Ter1 region at higher resolution. A 252-bp fragment was previously shown to contain Ter1 activity when analyzed in a plasmid replicon (pIS8; Ref. 13Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To further narrow down the sequences required, various overlapping fragments were subcloned into the S. pombe shuttle vector pIRT2, and replication of the plasmid was analyzed in vivo using two-dimensional agarose electrophoresis of PvuII-digested replication intermediates. A 113-bp fragment (pIS8F2) was found to retain Ter1 activity (Fig. 2B). To define the site further, this fragment was mutagenized using PCR-based linker scanning mutagenesis, thereby replacing successive 10 bp of sequence with NcoI restriction sites. Eight such linker scanning mutants spanning the majority of IS8F2 are shown schematically in Fig. 2A. Two-dimensional gel analyses identified two mutants (C and D) in which fork arrest was fully abolished, whereas the other mutants retained fork-arresting activity (Fig. 2B). Thus, minimal Ter1 seems to be confined to the region mutated by linker scanners C and D (Figs. 2B and 3A, arrowheads). As expected, when cloned into pIRT2, this region was able to independently arrest replication (pTer1.IRT2; Fig. 2C). The formal possibility remains that sequence context flanking this region may contribute to Ter1 activity, yet these flanking regions are not required for minimal Ter1 activity.FIGURE 3Ter1 contains a consensus binding site for Sap1p.A, DNA sequence of Ter1. The sequence is oriented to arrest replication forks arriving from the right (arrow) but not the left. Boundaries of the sequence replaced by linker scanning mutants C and D are depicted by arrowheads. The consensus Sap1p binding site TTAACGCAGT is shown in larger font size, and the TAACG conserved core motif is underlined. B, DNA sequence of the conserved intermediate affinity Sap1p consensus binding motif, as previously identified by a binding site selection scheme (37Ghazvini M. Ribes V. Arcangioli B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4939-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The TA(A/G)CG core motif is underlined and shown in increased font size. Note that the Ter1 sequence reveals 100% identity to the consensus sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ter1 Contains a Consensus Binding Motif for Sap1p—Having identified the minimal sequence required for Ter1 activity, the sequence was analyzed for potential secondary structures and/or protein binding sites. Surprisingly, a 10-bp stretch was identified with 100% identity to a consensus binding motif for the essential mating type switch-activating and chromatin-organizing protein Sap1p (Fig. 3A; Ref. 37Ghazvini M. Ribes V. Arcangioli B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4939-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3A, the sequence TTAACGCAGT exactly matches a hypothesized binding site for Sap1p as identified by a stringent synthetic binding site selection scheme (37Ghazvini M. Ribes V. Arcangioli B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4939-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The core TA(A/G)CG motif is found in all high and low affinity Sap1p-selected binding sites either alone or in direct or inverted repeat configuration. SAS1, the only other known binding site for Sap1p, contains three core motifs: two as direct repeats and the last inverted with respect to the others. Ter1 contains a single perfect TAACG core element. No other identifiable elements were found. Purified Sap1p Specifically Binds Ter1 in Vitro—To begin to address the question whether Sap1p binds to Ter1 and thereby functions as a terminator protein, the protein was tagged with an N-terminal His6 tag and overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity from E. coli (Fig. 4A). Bacterial expressed His6-Sap1p has previously been shown to retain its conformational integrity and DNA binding activity (38Arcangioli B. Ghazvini M. Ribes V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2930-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Gel shift experiments were performed to assay for Ter1 DNA binding activity. Indeed, Sap1p bound to Ter1 with relatively higher affinity than it bound to SAS1, its only previously known genomic binding site (Fig. 4B). Sap1p has been shown to bind to DNA as a dimer. Specifically, an N-terminal dimerization domain has been implicated in inverted repeat binding, whereas a C-terminal dimerization domain is required for SAS1 and direct repeat binding (37Ghazvini M. Ribes V. Arcangioli B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4939-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As expected, Sap1p apparently also bound Ter1 as a dimer, as judged by relative migration of the complex in gel shift assays, which was identical to migration of the Sap1p-SAS1 complex (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, deletion of the C-terminal dimerization domain prevented Ter1 binding without affecting inverted repeat binding (data not shown). The specificity of the Sap1p-Ter1 interaction was studied by competition gel shift experiments. His6-Sap1p was incubated with varying amounts of excess competitor wild-type or mutant Ter1 prior to gel shift analysis. For these experiments, a mutant competitor binding site was constructed based on available knowledge regarding Sap1p-SAS1 interaction. Specifically, a double mutation within the core motif (or α-region) has been shown to abolish Sap1p-SAS1 interaction (31Arcangioli B. Klar A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3025-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We created an analogous mutation in the Ter1 core motif (DM1), which is similarly defective for binding to recombinant Sap1p (see Fig. 8). Indeed, when His6-Sap1p was incubated with excess wild-type non-labeled Ter1, binding to the labeled Ter1 probe was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D, left panel). In contrast, the DM1 mutant was unable to compete for His6-Sap1p binding, even when present at 60× times molar excess (Fig. 4D, right panel). Therefore, Sap1p bo"

The extent of STAT activation and hence the specificity of signaling is primarily determined by structural complementarity between the SH2 domain of the STATs and the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor chains. Here, we identified constitutive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as another mechanism that controls the differential activation of STAT transcription factors. Our analysis of nucleocytoplasmic cycling of STAT1 revealed that the expression of the alternatively spliced transactivation domain and its signal-dependent serine phosphorylation maximized the rate of nuclear export. Export modulation occurred independently of retention factors or the export receptor CRM1, and was observed both before and during stimulation of cells with cytokines. Our data indicated a dual role for the transactivation domain. It enhanced the nuclear retention of activated STAT1, but had the opposite effect on inactivated molecules. Accordingly, and despite their identical receptor recognition, the STAT1 splice variants differed strongly in the amplitude of tyrosine phosphorylation and in the duration of the cytokine signal. Thus, regulated nuclear export determined the cytokine sensitivity of the shuttling STAT1 transcription factors by controlling their availability at the receptor kinase complex.

Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway by IFNγ induces the phosphorylation of an intracellular tyrosine residue in the α-chain of the IFNγ receptor. This, in turn, creates the docking site specifically for the SH2 domain of STAT1. Subsequently, phosphorylation of residue tyrosine 701 of STAT1 triggers the dissociation from the receptor and SH2 domain-mediated STAT1 homodimerization that transforms the latent transcription factor into a high affinity DNA-binding protein (2Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The STATs are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that make use of both carrier-independent and carrier-mediated translocation mechanisms (3Vinkemeier U. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Before tyrosine phosphorylation, direct binding to proteins of the nuclear pore (nucleoporins) allows carrier-independent transportation of STAT1 (4Marg A. Shan Y. Meyer T. Meissner T. Brandenburg M. Vinkemeier U. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Additionally, the exportin CRM1 supports nuclear export to a minor extent (4Marg A. Shan Y. Meyer T. Meissner T. Brandenburg M. Vinkemeier U. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 dimers, on the other hand, are barred from further carrier-independent nucleocytoplasmic exchange (4Marg A. Shan Y. Meyer T. Meissner T. Brandenburg M. Vinkemeier U. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Instead, association with importin α5 and importin β is necessary for continued nuclear import (5Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30072-30078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation triggers the nuclear retention of the shuttling STAT1, which is kept in the nucleus until tyrosine dephosphorylation takes place. The inhibition of the dephosphorylation reaction afforded by DNA binding suffices to bring about the easily observable accumulation of STAT molecules in the nucleus (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Despite that, given a half-life of no more than 15 min for activated STATs even at optimal DNA binding sites (8Lerner L. Henriksen M. Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the majority of STAT molecules returns to the cytoplasm in only a few minutes or less.In the nucleus, the activated STATs function as sequence-specific transcription factors. Gene activation by STAT1 is dependent on the C-terminal transactivation domain of 38 residues (9Müller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), expression of which is regulated by alternative splicing, generating full-length STAT1α comprising 750 residues or truncated STAT1β (10Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation on serine 727 of a conserved PMSP motif in the transactivation domain maximizes gene transcription (11Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 12Kovarik P. Mangold M. Ramsauer K. Heidari H. Steinborn R. Zotter A. Levy D.E. Müller M. Decker T.

In human cells serine phosphorylation occurs independent of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (14Zhu X.J. Wen Z.L. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and several stimuli (UV irradiation, tumor necrosis factor α) can induce the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (15Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 15: 2628-2637Crossref Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Interferon-γ, on the other hand, promotes both Ser727 as well as Tyr701 phosphorylation, but these events occur independently of one another (14Zhu X.J. Wen Z.L. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Given the diverse set of stimuli that induce serine phosphorylation of STAT1, it is not surprising that numerous kinases have been implicated in this process (15Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 15: 2628-2637Crossref Scopus (705) Google Scholar).The duration and degree of gene activation in response to cytokine signals is primarily dictated by the number of activated cell surface receptors (16Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms have been described that exert a negative influence on the activity of STAT proteins, e.g. tyrosine dephosphorylation, the inhibition of DNA binding, receptor degradation, or the inhibition of Jak kinases (17Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about signal enhancing mechanisms. Best characterized is the increased incorporation of STATs in transcription complexes at cytokine responsive promoters via their transactivation domain (TAD). The STAT1 TAD is responsible for the selective recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and other coactivators of transcription, several of which bind more strongly to serine 727-phosphorylated STAT1 (18Zakharova N.

The results disclose a novel function of the transactivation domain and its serine phosphorylation in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of STAT1, and demonstrate a stimulatory role for nuclear export in cytokine signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—HeLa-S3 cells and U3A cells were grown as described (21Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Human IFNγ (Calbiochem) was used at a concentration of 50 units/ml (5 ng/ml) or as indicated; human Epo was purchased from Roche Applied Science. MG132 (50 nm final), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml final), and staurosporine were from Sigma. Ratjadone A was a kind gift of M. Kalesse, Universität Hannover.Purification of Recombinant STAT1, in Vitro Tyr701 Phosphorylation, and Microinjection—STAT proteins were expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 insect cells. Protein purification, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation, purification of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, and microinjection, were done essentially as described (4Marg A. Shan Y. Meyer T. Meissner T. Brandenburg M. Vinkemeier U. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).In Vitro Ser727 Phosphorylation of STAT1—GST-p38 and malE-SKK3-DD were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21p(Lys)S. GST fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose affinity matrix as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and purification of the malE-fusion protein was essentially as described (22Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). STAT1 prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells was virtually devoid of phosphorylation at position Ser727 (mass spectrometric limit of detection ∼5%, data not shown). In vitro Ser727 phosphorylation of recombinant STAT1α was carried out for 3 h at 30 °C in a volume of up to 2 ml. Unphosphorylated or Tyr701-phosphorylated recombinant STAT1α (3 μm) was incubated in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO3, 5 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor) with GST-p38 and malE-SKK3-DD (1.5 μm each). The two kinases were removed by Tag-specific affinity purification. STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blotting with a phospho-Ser727-specific antibody (Upstate Biotech). Subsequent mass spectrometric analyses indicated Ser727 phosphorylation of at least 80 and 50% of the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated and Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1, respectively (not shown).EMSA—For EMSA analyses, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from reconstituted U3A cells were pooled and mixed with a radiolabeled M67 probe essentially as described (21Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Where indicated, c-Eyk tyrosine kinase was coexpressed to maximize STAT1 activation (21Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Quantitative Western Blotting—U3A or HeLaS3 cells growing on 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with the indicated STAT1 constructs using the Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) method. After 24 h, cells were split according to the number of time/dosage points needed. For Epo stimulation, cells were cotransfected with a 3-fold molar excess of pRcCMV-EgΔBglII. This construct misses the BglII fragment of the human gp130 receptor, therefore the major STAT3 phosphorylation site at residue Tyr767 is not expressed, whereas the STAT1 phosphorylation sites are retained (23Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cell lysis and Western blotting were performed essentially as described (21Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: phosphospecific anti-Tyr701 STAT1 (Cell Signaling), phosphospecific anti-Ser727 Stat1 (Upstate), anti-STAT1 (p84/p91) (E23, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Sigma). Blots were developed with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were recorded in a Roche Lumi-Imager and quantitation (arbitrary units) was done using the LumiAnalyst 3.0 software (Roche Applied Science). To allow for the comparison of signal intensities between different blots, blotting was done side by side on the same blotting apparatus, and the blots were developed side by side in the same antibody solutions as indicated in the figures. To determine the specific tyrosine phosphorylation (ratio of [phosphospecific signal/STAT signal]), the bound phosphospecific anti-Tyr701 antibody was stripped off the blot, and the same blot was incubated with an anti-STAT1 antibody. Antigen concentrations and exposure times were adjusted not to exceed the linear signal range.FRAP, Conventional, and Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Conventional fluorescence microscopy and image quantitation were as described (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was done with a LSM410 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 100×/1.3-numerical aperture oil immersion objective and a 30-milliwatt argon laser. Fluorescence images of single z-sections (optical slice of 0.7 μm) were scanned. High frequency imaging was done with transiently transfected HeLa cells that displayed similar GFP fluorescence in the nucleus. Stimulation with IFNγ was for 30 min. Approximately 100 images were acquired before bleaching, the last ten of which were used to calculate the average prebleach intensity. A region of interest (ROI) comprising 0.5% of the nucleus z-section was bleached (30 laser pulses of maximal intensity comprising a total bleach time of 4.35 ms over a time period of 0.55 s). Subsequently, imaging continued at the prebleach rate for 10 s. Fluorescence recovery of the ROI was subjected to curve fitting by using two exponentials (PRISM program) to determine bleach depth (first image after bleaching), equilibration (fluorescence recovery), and half time of equilibration (time until half recovery).In Vitro Transcription and Reporter Gene Assays—Standard 60-min in vitro transcription and primer extension analysis was performed as reported previously (24Castaño E. Gross P. Wang Z.X. Roeder R.G. Oelgeschläger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pDL(GAS2)HIV(-33/+80)(-) contains two STAT1 binding sites (Ly6E-GAS) in front of the HIV-1 core promoter from -33 to +80. See supplementary information for cloning details. To analyze STAT1 transcription activation, promoter templates were preincubated with recombinant STAT1 protein (50, 150, or 500 ng) for 15 min at 30 °C under transcription conditions. STAT1-activated transcription from pDL(GAS2)HIV(-33/+80)(-) and transcription from the control construct pTOG5HIV(-33/+68)(-) was measured in parallel by primer extension using the same radiolabeled oligonucleotide. The integrity of serine-phosphorylated recombinant STAT1 during in vitro transcription was confirmed by Western blotting with a phospho-Ser727-specific antibody (not shown). Luciferase reporter gene assays were performed as described (21Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 6C were analyzed by Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.FIGURE 6Accelerated nuclear export of Ser727-phosphorylated STAT1 increases its transcriptional activity. A, STAT1-dependent transcriptional activation on DNA in a purified transcription system. Reactions contained general transcription factors, a DNA template with tandem STAT1 binding sites ([GAS]2HIV-1) and a control template ([GAL4]5HIV-1). As indicated, increasing amounts (50, 150, and 500 ng) of non-phosphorylated, Tyr701-, Ser727-, or doubly phosphorylated STAT1α were added. B, wild-type STAT1α or the indicated point mutants were coexpressed with an IFNγ-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid in U3A cells. Luciferase activity was determined 30 h post-transfection in non-stimulated cells (hatched bars) or after stimulation with IFNγ for 6 h (black bars). The bars indicate the mean ± S.D. of six independent experiments. The examination was repeated twice. C, data shown in B expressed as percentage of the maximal activity (signals of the respective S727A mutants divided by the mean signal for wild type or F77A). The contribution to transcription of facilitated export because of Ser727 phosphorylation is indicated. Differences were analyzed by Student's t test and found to be statistically highly significant (p = 0.0006).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plasmids, Peptide Synthesis, and Coupling to GST-GFP—See supplementary information.RESULTSThe Transactivation Domain Facilitates the Nuclear Export of STAT1—We have previously examined the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of non-phosphorylated STAT1 in resting cells (4Marg A. Shan Y. Meyer T. Meissner T. Brandenburg M. Vinkemeier U. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It was found that truncated STAT1 (STAT1tc), a mutant generated by the concurrent deletion of N- and C-terminal domains, was still capable of constitutive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Yet, whereas nuclear import remained unaffected, the nuclear export of truncated STAT1 was diminished. To dissect which domain deletion reduced export, nuclear microinjections of purified recombinant full-length STAT1α, STAT1β (the splice variant lacking the C-domain), STAT1ΔN (lacking the N-terminal 126 residues), and STAT1tc were performed (Fig. 1B). As is shown in Fig. 1C, removal of the N-domain was without effect on nuclear export (1ΔN), whereas the translocation of the C-terminally truncated STAT1β and STAT1tc was markedly reduced. These results suggested that the transactivation domain facilitated the translocation to the cytoplasm of unphosphorylated STAT1.The Transactivation Domain Regulates STAT1 Nuclear Export during the Cytokine Stimulation of Cells—Stimulation of cells with cytokines triggers the nuclear accumulation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated dimers, which precludes the direct observation of the concurrent nuclear export of non-phosphorylated molecules. To circumvent this problem we devised an assay that takes advantage of the different translocation requirements of tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1. We reasoned that precluding the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 dimers to importin α should abrogate the nuclear accumulation of STAT1 during cytokine stimulation, whereas the nuclear export should not be affected. Under these conditions the ensuing accumulation of activated STAT1 in the cytoplasm might therefore lay bare the ongoing nuclear export of STAT1 from the nucleus. A schematic outline of this assay is shown in Fig. 2A. STAT1 harbors two non-conventional nuclear localization signals that both are necessary specifically for the import of activated dimers. One is a short stretch of amino acids in the DNA binding domain, whereas the amino-terminal domain of 120 residues constitutes the other one (5Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30072-30078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U.

Cell. 2004; 119: 587-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Inactivation of either signal precludes the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 to importin α (5Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30072-30078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Meissner T. Krause E. Lödige I. Vinkemeier U. Cell. 2004; 119: 587-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and thus prevents the nuclear import (supplementary Fig. S1A). In addition to its effect on nuclear import, the deletion of the N-domain is associated with a dephosphorylation failure that renders the activation of STAT1 virtually irreversible (25Meissner T. Krause E. Lödige I. Vinkemeier U. Cell. 2004; 119: 587-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell.

We found that the N-domain deletion mutants used in this study did not differ in their very low dephosphorylation rates (supplementary Fig. S2A). Thus, during the cytokine stimulation of cells, the pool of non-phosphorylated STAT1 variants available for carrier-independent nuclear import will be depleted. Nevertheless, in all other respects that are of importance here the ΔN mutants are indistinguishable from wild-type STAT1.

Moreover, the deletion of the N-domain does not affect SH2 domain-mediated dimerization and DNA binding (supplementary Fig. S1B, see also Refs. 26Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, N-domain deletion mutants were used in this assay.FIGURE 2Influence of the STAT1 C-domain on nuclear export in cytokine-stimulated cells. A, model of nucleocytoplasmic cycling of STAT1 N-domain deletion mutants at the onset of cytokine stimulation. Carrier-free nucleocytoplasmic cycling and CRM1-dependent nuclear export of non-Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1 occur irrespective of the presence of the N-domain (gray arrows). In contrast, the nuclear import of the Tyr701-phosphorylated N-domain deletion mutant is blocked (blue arrow). B, top, HeLa-S3 cells transiently expressing GFP fusion proteins of the indicated STAT1 variants were left untreated or stimulated with IFNγ for the indicated times. 10 ng/ml ratjadone A (+Ratj.) were added 1 h before IFNγ stimulation. Shown is the GFP fluorescence of fixed cells. Bar,20 μm. Bottom, quantitative analysis of B. At the indicated time points, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence density was determined for 30–60 cells that expressed STAT1ΔN, STAT1tc, or the Ser727 to Ala mutant of STAT1ΔN. Cells were scored positive for cytoplasmic accumulation if the [nuclear fluorescence density/cytoplasmic fluorescence density] ≤ 0.5. C, graph showing the results of live cell fluorescence imaging of STAT1-negative U3A cells coexpressing STAT1ΔN-GFP or STAT1tc-GFP and chimeric Epo receptor (3-fold molar excess of DNA). After taking the first image (t = 0), cells were stimulated with Epo (7 units/ml), and further confocal microscopical images of the median slice were taken every 10 min for another 3 h. Shown is the ratio of nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence density (mean ± S.D.) of five cells for each STAT1 mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine nuclear export during cytokine stimulation, mammalian cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the N-domain deletion mutants STAT1ΔN, STAT1tc, or STAT1ΔNSer727Ala. First, the respective proteins were characterized in terms of expression levels and DNA binding ability. Differences among the mutants or with wild-type STAT1 were not found (see supplementary Fig. S1B, S1C, and S1D). Moreover, similar to wild-type STAT1, these STAT1 variant proteins were present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Next, the response to IFNγ was tested. As expected, control cells expressing full-length STAT1α showed the well described nuclear accumulation during the stimulation with IFN (Fig. 2B). In striking contrast, but in accordance with the model of STAT1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling depicted in Fig. 2A, the N-terminally truncated mutants reacted inversely to IFNγ and gradually disappeared from the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Notably, the mutation to phenylalanine of the Tyr701 phosphorylation site abolished the IFN responsiveness (Fig. 2B), indicating that phosphodimers of STAT1 were required for the observed effects. Treatment of cells with MG132 to inhibit proteasomal degradation, or with cycloheximide to suppress protein translation did not influence the clearance of STAT1 from the nucleus (not shown). However, time course experiments with IFN-stimulated cells revealed differences in the rate of clearance from the nucleus. STAT1ΔN achieved discernible nuclear clearance in more than 60% of the cells already after 1 h of IFNγ stimulation, and after 2 or 3 h in the presence of IFNγ, STAT1ΔN was depleted from the nucleus in more than 80% of the cells. The nuclear clearance of STAT1tc, which additionally lacks the transactivation domain, occurred much more slowly. After 1 h of IFN stimulation, STAT1tc was depleted from the nucleus in about 10% of the cells. Nevertheless, after IFN treatment for 3 h or longer STAT1tc was cleared from the nuclei of more than 80% of cells. Remarkably, the mutation to alanine of the Ser727 phosphorylation site in the transactivation domain generated an intermediate phenotype. Although cytoplasmic accumulation of the serine mutant was apparent in 80% of the cells after 2 h of IFNγ, the rise in nuclear clearance was slower. This became apparent at the 1-h time point, when only slightly more than 20% of cells displayed nuclear clearance (Fig. 2B), indicating that serine phosphorylation of the transactivation domain is required for maximal nuclear export.To rule out IFNγ-specific effects and to exclude interference from endogenous wild-type STAT1, the nuclear clearance experi"

Proteins encoded by Bcl-2 family interact with each other and either promote or inhibit metazoan apoptosis.

The BI-1 protein has several transmembrane domains and is thought to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (4Kawai-Yamada M. Jin L. Yoshinaga K. Hirata A. Uchimiya H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We reported previously that the expression of mammalian Bax in Arabidopsis plants results in apoptotic cell death, which could be suppressed by the coexpression of AtBI-1 (4Kawai-Yamada M. Jin L.

Furthermore, rice cultured cells overexpressing AtBI-1 demonstrate a reduced hypersensitive response induced by an elicitor obtained from rice blast pathogen (21Matsumura H. Nirasawa S. Kiba A.

The role of BI-1 in Mlo-mediated resistance to Blumeria graminis was also demonstrated by an overexpression analysis of barley BI-1 (22Hückelhoven R. Dechert C. Kogel K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and H2O2- and heat shock-induced cell death of yeast are also suppressed by overexpression of plant BI-1 gene (18Chae H.J. Ke N. Kim H.R. Chen S. Godzik A. Dickman M. Reed J.C. Gene. 2003; 323: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).In the present study, we devised a yeast genetic screening that allowed us to isolate plant genes responsible for cell death. For this purpose, we utilized the plant cell death suppressor AtBI-1 and found that overexpression of Cdf1 gene of Arabidopsis could induce apoptosis-like cell death in yeast. The effects of Cdf1 in yeast are partially similar to the mammalian Bax-induced lethality.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Methods—S. cerevisiae strain W303-1A (MATa leu2 his3 trp1 ade2 ura3 can1) was used in the present study. Bax- resistant mutant (BRM1) and its wild type (EGY48) strains were kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Reed (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). To obtain the Δatp4 strain, the ATP4 gene was disrupted in the W303-1A strain by HIS3 insertional mutagenesis. Yeast strains were cultured in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or SD medium with appropriate supplements at 30 °C. Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method.Screening of the Arabidopsis cDNA That Causes Growth Defect in Yeast—Screening of the cDNA library was based on the rescue of a growth defect in yeast by AtBI-1 gene, which is a suppressor of Bax-mediated yeast lethality. The Arabidopsis cDNAs that cause yeast growth inhibition and whose effects are inhibited by AtBI-1 were identified. Thus, wild type yeast strain W303-1A, possessing galactose-inducible AtBI-1 gene (NMV4-AtBI-1, constructed using pYX112-AtBI-1 as described in Ref. 16Kawai M. Pan L. Reed J.C. Uchimiya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was transformed with Arabidopsis cDNA library (in pYX112 expression vector, TPI promoter (24Umeda M. Bhalerao R.P. Schell J. Uchimiya H. Koncz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5021-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and plated onto the SD-galactose solid medium in which AtBI-1 is expressed. The transformants were replicated to a SD-glucose plate to obtain a clone that survives on the galactose-containing medium, but not on glucose-containing medium. The plasmid was recovered from each candidate clone and re-introduced into a W303-1A to confirm the reproducibility. The isolated cDNA (Cdf1) was connected under the GAL1 promoter, and the resultant plasmid, pTS-Cdf1, was used for further analysis.Plasmid Construction and Spot Assay—The coding regions of Cdf1 and the mammalian apoptotic gene Bax, tagged with SphI recognition sequence using the PCR method, were introduced into a SphI-digested pTS909 expression vector (GAL1 promoter, a Trp-marked, 2-μm replicon; a kind gift from Dr. Y. Kikuchi, University of Tokyo, Japan). For the expression of the Cdf1-GFP fusion protein, the same fragment was cloned into the pTS909-GFP plasmid. To express the mammalian anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, the coding region tagged with the EcoRI recognition sequence was ligated to the EcoRI site of the expression vector pYX112 (TPI promoter, a Ura-marked, 2-μm replicon). The expression vectors pYX112-AtBI-1 and pYX112-OsBI-1 used in this study have been described previously (16Kawai M. Pan L. Reed J.C. Uchimiya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The mouse Bax and rat Bcl-2 genes were kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Reed (The Burnham Institute).In the spot assay, yeast cells grown in SD-glucose medium for 1 day were adjusted to A600 of 0.1, and diluted to various concentrations (A600 = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, and 0.0005). The aliquot (5 μl) from each dilution was spotted onto SD-glucose or SD-galactose medium and incubated for 2 days (glucose medium) or 3 days (galactose medium) at 30 °C.Cytological Analysis—Microscopic examination was conducted using a fluorescent microscope system (DMRD; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For the detection of GFP fluorescence, yeast strains cultured in SD-glucose medium for 1 day were switched to SD-galactose medium for 4 h and examined at a 488-nm excitation wavelength. The plasmids pYX142-mt-gfp and p414GPD-mt-RFP, used for the observation of mitochondrial morphology, were kindly provided by Dr. K. Okamoto (University of Utah School of Medicine). To visualize active mitochondria with a transmembrane potential, yeast cells were stained with the fluorescent probe MitoTracker Red (650 nm; Invitrogen) for 5 min and examined under a fluorescent microscope at a wavelength of 568 nm. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was monitored by treatment with 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (0.1 mm; Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) for 5 min and observed under a fluorescent microscope.The number of viable cells was counted by the addition of Evans blue (0.05%, Nakalai, Kyoto, Japan), which penetrates only dead cells and results in blue staining of the cellular contents (25Kawai M. Uchimiya H. Ann. Bot. 2000; 86: 405-414Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The percentage of dead cells under each treatment was determined by scoring several hundred cells under the microscope.For electron microscopic analysis, yeast cells cultured on the SD-galactose plate for 3 days were fixed by the freeze-substitution method, treated with 4% osmium tetraoxide (OsO4), and embedded in Spurr's resin. Serial sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (UA/Pb) were observed using the electron microscope (Hitachi H-7600; Hitachi High Technologies, Tokyo, Japan).Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from various tissues (leaf, stem, flower, and root of 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants, 3-day-old suspension cells, and mature or senescent leaves of 8-week-old plants) using the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described previously (16Kawai M. Pan L. Reed J.C. Uchimiya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Total RNAs, electrophoresed on a denaturing 1.2% agarose gel, were transferred onto a nylon membrane (Biodyne B; Pall Biosupport Division, Port Washington, NY) and then hybridized to the 32P-labeled, 3′-untranslated region fragment of Cdf1 in 10% dextran sulfate, 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.1 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon testis DNA. Washing was performed under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). The membrane was analyzed with a BAS1500 imaging plate scanner (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).RESULTSScreening of Plant Genes with Growth Suppression Effect Inhibited by AtBI-1—BI-1 is an antiapoptotic factor that can inhibit Bax-induced cell death in mammalian, plant, and yeast cells (15Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 16Kawai M. Pan L. Reed J.C. Uchimiya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To screen plant genes that can induce Bax-like cell death, we utilized the yeast system. Wild type yeast strain W303-1A harboring NMV4-AtBI-1, which produces AtBI-1 under the control of galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter, was transformed with the Arabidopsis cDNA library (TPI promoter) and plated on the SD-galactose medium. To obtain clones that were growth-inhibited on glucose-containing medium, these transformants were duplicated onto the SD-glucose plate. After 2 days of incubation at 30 °C, clones that survived on galactose-containing medium but were growth inhibited on the glucose medium were picked up. Plasmids were isolated from the candidate clones, followed by DNA sequencing. Through successive screening of 2 × 104 transformants, a single clone containing Arabidopsis cDNA (At5g23040) was isolated and named Cdf1 (cell growth defect factor-1). We found two more possible Cdf homologues in the Arabidopsis genome, At3g51140 and At2g20929. As shown in Fig. 1, Cdf-related genes were conserved in plant species. The Cdf1 encoded a polypeptide of 258 amino acids and had an estimated molecular mass of 28.8 kDa. The Cdf1 protein showed sequence homology to At3g51140 (32.9%), At2g20920 (22.4%), and Synechocystis slr1918 (23.5%). These proteins have no reported homology with any known animal protein and do not contain any recognizable protein motifs. Hydrophobicity analysis revealed that Cdf1 and At3g5r1140 contained three transmembrane domains, whereas other Cdf-related proteins, including Synechocystis slr1918 and At2g20920, possessed four transmembrane domains.Cdf1 Induces Yeast Cell Death in a Bax-like Manner—To confirm the activity of Cdf1 as a cell growth suppressor, isolated cDNA was connected under the GAL1 promoter, and plasmid pTS-Cdf1 was constructed. Yeast strains transformed with pTS, pTS-Cdf1, and pTS-Bax were cultured in SD-glucose medium for 1 day and subjected to the spot assay (Fig. 2 A). Cdf1 showed yeast growth inhibitory effects.FIGURE 2Comparison of the growth-suppression activities of Cdf-related genes in yeast.A, spot assay of yeast expressing Cdf1. The mouse Bax gene was also used as a control for the cell growth defect. Yeast cells transformed with plasmids containing galactose-inducible Cdf1 (pTS-Cdf1) and Bax (pTS-Bax) were cultured in glucose-containing SD medium. After 1 day of continuous shaking, the A600 of each culture was adjusted to 0.1, and each dilution was spotted onto SD solid medium containing glucose or galactose. Photographs were taken 2 days (Glucose) or 3 days (Galactose) after incubation at 30 °C. B, distribution of Cdf1-GFP and mt-RFP in yeast. The yeast cells expressing Cdf1-GFP and mt-RFP were observed under a fluorescence microscope after 4 h of culture in SD-galactose medium. The yeast cells expressing GFP and mt-RFP were also observed as a control. C, mitochondrial morphology in yeast expressing Cdf1 or Bax. The yeast cells possessing plasmid pYX142-mt-gfp were transformed with pTS-Cdf1 or pTS-Bax, and the fluorescence of mt-GFP localized in the mitochondria after 4 h of culture in SD-galactose medium was observed. D, MitoTracker Red staining of yeast expressing Cdf1-GFP. Transformants cultured in SD-glucose liquid medium for 1 day were transferred to SD-galactose medium and cultured for 4 h. Active mitochondria were stained with the fluorescent probe MitoTracker Red. DIC, differential interference contrast image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To clarify the intracellular localization of Cdf1 protein in yeast, a plasmid containing Cdf1 fused to the N terminus of GFP was constructed. The yeast cells expressing Cdf1-GFP demonstrated similar growth defect as those expressing Cdf1 alone (data not shown). After 4 h of culture in the SD-galactose liquid medium, yeast cells expressing both Cdf1-GFP and mt-RFP were collected and observed under a fluorescent microscope. As shown in Fig. 2B, the fluorescence signals of Cdf1-GFP and mt-RFP were co-localized and showed punctate structures. To make clear the mitochondrial shape in yeast expressing Cdf1, yeast cells expressing Cdf1 and mt-GFP were also observed under a fluorescent microscope. As shown in Fig. 2C, without Cdf1 or Bax expression the mitochondria kept an elongated shape. On the other hand, Cdf1 or Bax caused dramatic morphological change in mitochondria. We then visualized functional mitochondria with a transmembrane potential using MitoTracker Red, a vital mitochondrial fluorescent probe (Fig. 2B). In GFP-expressing yeast cells, MitoTracker Red clearly stained active elongated mitochondria. In contrast, the expression of Cdf1-GFP caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2D.To evaluate whether Cdf1 induces cell death in yeast, we counted the number of dead cells by Evans blue staining. As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, ∼20% of cells started to die after 14 h of Cdf1 expression. One of the key mechanisms that trigger the Bax-mediated lethality in yeast is production of ROS (26Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 438: 61-65Google Scholar). To detect ROS generation, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used. This reagent diffuses through cell membranes and is subsequently enzymatically deacetylated by intracellular esterases to the non-fluorescent molecules; then it is oxidized by ROS to the highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (27Possel H. Noack H. Augustin W. Keilhoff G. Wolf G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cdf1-induced growth defect in yeast is also accompanied by ROS generation, Cdf1-expressing yeast cells cultured in SD-galactose medium were stained with 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, fluorescence was noted in ∼50% of cells expressing Cdf1 or Bax after 9 h of culture. The majority of cells of the control strain with an empty vector showed no fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3C, the ROS generation preceded dead cell stimulation.FIGURE 3Progression of Cdf1-induced yeast lethality.A, comparison of Cdf1- and Bax-expressing yeast cells stained with Evans blue at 14 h after culture in SD-galactose medium.

Numerous cells showed morphological change of nuclei, accumulation of autophagic bodies, and increased intracellular vacuolization (Fig. 3D). In contrast, intracellular structures of control cells possessing empty vector were homogenous in shape and cytoplasmic electron density.BI-1 Suppresses Cdf1-induced Lethality—As a first step toward determining the role played by this protein, we tested whether the mammalian Bcl-2 and plant BI-1 (OsBI-1 and AtBI-1) genes could suppress the Cdf1-induced growth defect in yeast. The expression plasmids containing Bcl-2, AtBI-1, and OsBI-1 (pYX-Bcl-2, AtBI-1, and OsBI-1) were transformed into a yeast strain containing galactose-inducible Cdf1 plasmid (pTS-Cdf1). As shown in Fig. 4A, when plated on the galactose medium the cells transformed with AtBI-1 and OsBI-1 demonstrated partial recovery of cell growth, whereas the cells transformed with empty vector and Bcl-2 did not. As shown in Fig. 4B, AtBI-1 suppressed the cell death caused by Cdf1 or Bax expression, whereas the ROS generation was not suppressed. Furthermore, BI-1 suppressed the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as shown by the stainability with MitoTracker Red. In contrast, morphological change of mitochondria was not prohibited by the BI-1 expression (data not shown).FIGURE 4Effects of cell death suppressors on Cdf1-mediated lethality in yeast.A, spot assay of cell death suppression activities of BI-1 genes (AtBI-1 and OsBI-1) and Bcl-2 against Cdf1-induced lethality. Yeast cells possessing pTS-Cdf1 were transformed with pYX yeast expression plasmids containing OsBI-1, AtBI-1, and Bcl-2, respectively. Transformants cultured in SD-glucose medium for 1 day were used for the spot assay. Photographs were taken 2 days (Glucose) or 3 days (Galactose) after incubation at 30 °C. B, the effect of AtBI-1 on Cdf1-induced ROS generation and lethality. ROS generation was examined in each yeast stain by 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining at 9 h after culture in SD-galactose medium.

An unknown genetic mutation in BRM1 results in resistance against Bax-induced lethality (28Matsuyama S. Xu Q. Velours J. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that disruption of the ATP4 gene caused tolerance to Bax (28Matsuyama S. Xu Q.

Using these strains, a growth assay was performed to clarify whether Cdf1- and Bax-mediated effects are similar in terms of the cell death inducer in yeast. Wild type strains (EGY48 for BRM1 and W303-1A for Δatp4) and mutant strains were transformed with pTS-Bax or pTS-Cdf1, respectively. Yeast cells cultured in SD-glucose for 1 day were transferred to the SD-galactose medium for 8 h, and their growth (A600) was determined. As shown in Fig. 5A, the BRM1 strain was resistant against both Bax- and Cdf1-induced growth defect. In contrast, the Δatp4 strain demonstrated tolerance against Bax but sensitivity to Cdf1-mediated effect (Fig. 5B). The same results were obtained by the Evans blue staining method (data not shown).FIGURE 5Cell death induction activity of Cdf1 on Bax-resistant mutants.A, growth comparison of Bax-resistant Cdf- and Bax-expressing strains. EGY48 (wild type strain) and BRM1 (Bax-resistant strain) possessing galactose-inducible Cdf1 or Bax cultured in SD-glucose medium for 1 day were transferred to SD-galactose medium (A600 = 0.1) and cultured for 8 h at 30°C. The measured A600 represented relative growth. B, growth comparison of Cdf1- and Bax-expressing Δatp4 strains. One-day cultures of W303 (wild type) and Δatp4 (Bax-resistant strain) possessing galactose-inducible Cdf1 or Bax were transferred to SD-galactose medium (A600 = 0.1) and cultured at 30 °C for 8 h. A600 was measured and expressed relative to the control vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression Pattern of Cdf Gene in Plant Tissues—To confirm the expression of Cdf1 in plants, mRNA accumulation was examined in several tissues obtained from 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants. Cdf1 showed higher expression in the above ground parts (leaf, stem, and flower) (Fig. 6A). We then examined the possible involvement of this gene in the leaf senescence stage. Leaf senescence is also known to be one of the stages of programmed cell death in plant species (reviewed in Ref. 30Pennell R.I. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2072963506,"Peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibitors have a strong potential to be used as a new class of antibiotics. However, recent studies have shown that the mitochondria of most eukaryotes, including humans, contain an essential PDF, PDF1A. The crystal structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana PDF1A (AtPDF1A), considered representative of PDF1As in general, has been determined. This structure displays several similarities to that of known bacterial PDFs. AtPDF1A behaves as a dimer, with the C-terminal residues responsible for linking the two subunits. This arrangement is similar to that of Leptospira interrogans PDF, the only other dimeric PDF identified to date. AtPDF1A is the first PDF for which zinc has been identified as the catalytic ion. However, the zinc binding pocket does not differ from the binding pockets of PDFs with iron rather than zinc. The crystal structure of AtPDF1A in complex with a substrate analog revealed that the substrate binding pocket of PDF1A displays strong modifications. The S1′ binding pocket is significantly narrower, due to the creation of a floor from residues present in all PDF1As but not in bacterial PDFs. A true S3′ pocket is created by the residues of a helical CD-loop, which is very long in PDF1As. Finally, these modified substrate binding pockets modify the position of the substrate in the active site. These differences provide guidelines for the design of bacterial PDF inhibitors that will not target mitochondrial PDFs.

In all organisms, the protein synthesis machinery requires newly synthesized peptides to start systematically with methionine. In eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, the N-terminal methionine is N-formylated. This is due to the initiator methionyl-tRNA, the methionine moiety of which must be formylated by a formyltransferase. However, the N-terminal methionine is removed by a methionine aminopeptidase (MAP; EC 3.4.11.18) in about two-thirds of mature proteins (for a review, see Ref. 1Giglione C. Boularot A. Meinnel T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1455-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Methionine aminopeptidase activity is essential for cell growth in bacteria, fungi (1Giglione C. Boularot A. Meinnel T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1455-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and higher eukaryotes (2Boxem M. Tsai C.W. Zhang Y. Saito R.M. Liu J.O.

Fo removal is therefore an essential first step in N-terminal processing.PDFs behave as monomeric metal cation hydrolases (for a review, see Ref. 5Giglione C. Pierre M. Meinnel T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments for PDFs from various eubacteria have identified three conserved regions, comprising the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and involved in metal cation and substrate binding: (i) GϕGϕAAXQ (motif 1), (ii) EGCLS (motif 2), and (iii) HEϕDH (motif 3), where ϕ is a hydrophobic amino acid (6Mazel D. Coic E. Blanchard S. Saurin W. Marliere P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Villoing S. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Cys of motif 2 and the two His residues of motif 3 are involved in metal ion binding in the active site (8Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fourth ligand of the tetrahedrally coordinated metal ion corresponds to a water molecule. Bacterial PDFs are mononuclear iron enzymes (9Groche D. Becker A. Schlichting I. Kabsch W. Schultz S. Wagner A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Rajagopalan P.T.R Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this is in contrast to most metalloproteases with a conserved HEXXH motif (part of motif 3 in PDFs), which use zinc instead of iron as catalytic cation (for a review, see Ref. 11Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). The ferrous cation of PDF is extremely sensitive to oxidation, making the enzyme unstable (9Groche D. Becker A. Schlichting I. Kabsch W. Schultz S. Wagner A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Rajagopalan P.T. Pei D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to give stable variants with little or no loss of catalytic activity. Zinc substitution results in inactive enzymes. A detailed discussion on the topic of metal cation activation of PDF was published recently (5Giglione C. Pierre M. Meinnel T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).PDF folds into a single compact domain consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, a two-stranded β-ribbon, two regular α-helices, and two short 310 helices (for a review, see Ref. 5Giglione C. Pierre M. Meinnel T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Two types of bacterial PDF, PDF1 and PDF2, have been described based on sequence and structural data (TABLE ONE) (5Giglione C. Pierre M. Meinnel T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Giglione C. Meinnel T. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 566-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These two types can be differentiated on the basis of two insertion sequences around helix α1 and their C-terminal domain folds (16Guilloteau J.P. Mathieu M. Giglione C. Blanc V. Dupuy A. Chevrier M. Gil P. Famechon A. Meinnel T. Mikol V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, these differences do not affect folding of the active site. We and others have reported the three-dimensional structures of PDFs from various bacteria, in complex with the catalytic metal cation and/or with a ligand, such as an inhibitor or a product of the deformylation reaction (17Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Becker A. Schlichting I. Kabsch W. Groche D. Schultz S. Wagner A.F. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). No significant differences in overall or active site structure were observed between the two forms. The determination of these structures led to identification of the metal and peptide binding modes and elucidation of a catalytic mechanism for the deformylation reaction (13Ragusa S. Mouchet P.

Since this enzyme is essential in bacteria, bacterial PDF was therefore recognized as an attractive target for the design of new antibacterial agents (5Giglione C. Pierre M. Meinnel T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Yuan Z. Trias J. White R.J. Drug Discovery Today. 2001; 6: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Pei D. Emerg. Ther. Targets. 2001; 5: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since PDF was also shown to be present in several human parasites, such as the causative agent of malaria, it was also considered a good target for antiparasitic agents (23Meinnel T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The structural comparison of several PDFs in complex with an inhibitor has provided guidelines for the design of high affinity PDF inhibitors (PDF-In) (16Guilloteau J.P. Mathieu M. Giglione C. Blanc V. Dupuy A. Chevrier M. Gil P. Famechon A. Meinnel T. Mikol V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Hao B. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T. Zhou Y. Pei D. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Actinonin, a pseudotripeptide hydroxamate derivative, has been shown to target peptide deformylases specifically and therefore to have natural antibiotic activity (24Chen D.Z. Patel D.V. Hackbarth C.J. Wang W. Dreyer G. Young D.C. Margolis P.S. Wu C. Ni Z.J. Trias J. White R.J. Yuan Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 25Gordon J.J. Kelly B.K. Miller G.A. Nature. 1962; 195: 701-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Many actinonin derivatives have been synthesized and shown to display potent antibiotic activity (26Boularot A. Giglione C. Artaud I. Meinnel T. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 5: 809-822PubMed Google Scholar). Phase I clinical studies were recently completed for two such potent peptide deformylase inhibitors derived from actinonin (27Ramanathan-Girish S. McColm J. Clements J.M. Taupin P. Barrowcliffe S. Hevizi J. Safrin S. Moore C. Patou G. Moser H. Gadd A. Hoch U. Jiang V. Lofland D. Johnson K.W. Antimicrob.

Microbiol. 2004; 7: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which have now gone on to phase II and III trials. PDF-In therefore appear promising as a class of new antibiotics.Recent studies, together with the release of complete genome sequences for differentiated organisms, have led to the identification of peptide deformylases in eukaryotes; these enzymes are targeted to the plastids and mitochondria of plants and to animal mitochondria (15Giglione C. Meinnel T. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 566-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Giglione C. Serero A. Pierre M. Boisson B. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5916-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Two PDFs have been identified in plants and one in humans. Since they do not contain the two insertions typical of PDF2 molecules, all eukaryotic PDFs are unambiguously of type 1 (PDF1; TABLE ONE). However, the amino acid sequence of the PDF specific to mitochondria differs from those of other PDF1s in a number of specific features. There is a long insertion between β-strands β2 and β3 and systematic amino acid changes in the vicinity of the active site (see an alignment in Ref. 31Serero A. Giglione C. Sardini A. Martinez Sanz J. Meinnel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52953-52963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PDF1 molecules therefore form two classes: PDF1A and PDF1B (TABLE ONE). PDF1Bs correspond to bacterial and plastid PDFs, whereas PDF1As correspond to mitochondrial PDFs. Unlike PDF1B, which is specific to plants and Apicomplexa, PDF1A is found in almost all eukaryotes. Both classes of PDF1 are functional in deformylation and potently inhibited by actinonin (31Serero A. Giglione C. Sardini A. Martinez Sanz J. Meinnel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52953-52963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Serero A. Giglione C. Meinnel T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Deformylation has been shown to be an essential process in eukaryotes (33Giglione C. Vallon O. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Lee M.D. She Y. Soskis M.J. Borella C.P. Gardner J.R. Hayes P.A. Dy B.M. Heaney M.L. Philips M.R. Bornmann W.G. Sirotnak F.M. Scheinberg D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since PDF1As are very sensitive to actinonin and probably also to most of the derivatives currently in clinical trials, this necessity for deformylation represents a major obstacle to the use of PDF-In as antibiotics. Indeed, the inhibition of mitochondrial PDF by PDF-In could be extremely toxic in the medium term, as reported for other antibiotics with a mitochondrial target. Unlike eukaryotic PDF1Bs, which do not differ significantly from bacterial PDFs in terms of their biochemistry (32Serero A. Giglione C. Meinnel T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or three-dimensional structures (35Kumar A. Nguyen K.T. Srivathsan S. Ornstein B. Turley S. Hirsh I. Pei D. Hol W.G. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), PDF1As have a number of specific features. They are active and stable with a zinc cation bound at the active site (TABLE ONE). Enzymatic studies have also shown that PDF1As from plants and animals differ from bacterial PDFs in a number of ways. We investigated these differences, with a view to developing guidelines for the design of PDF-In devoid of anti-PDF1A activity (31Serero A. Giglione C. Sardini A. Martinez Sanz J. Meinnel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52953-52963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Serero A. Giglione C. Meinnel T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As actinonin derivatives inhibit cell proliferation by inhibiting human PDF1A (HsPDF1A), HsPDF1A has been proposed as a target for new anticancer agents (34Lee M.D. She Y. Soskis M.J. Borella C.P. Gardner J.R. Hayes P.A. Dy B.M. Heaney M.L. Philips M.R. Bornmann W.G. Sirotnak F.M. Scheinberg D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to determine the three-dimensional structure of PDF1A.We describe here the structure of the representative PDF1A, that from Arabidopsis thaliana, free and in complex with the tripeptide Met-Ala-Ser. Our findings provide guidelines for the design of PDF-In specific for bacterial enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—AtPDF1AΔH is a 197-amino acid-long protein. It corresponds to full-length AtPDF1A (259 residues) deleted of residues 2-68 and 258-259 (i.e. 191 residues). AtPDF1AΔH displays an artificial Ser residue followed by a His6 tag fused to the C-terminal Gly. AtPDF1AΔH was expressed from derivative-containing plasmid (pQdefAtD was described in Table 3 of Ref. 30Giglione C. Serero A. Pierre M. Boisson B. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5916-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Bacteria expressing AtPDF1AΔH were cultured to an A600 of ∼0.5 at 20 °C in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, as previously described (Fig. 2 of Ref. 30Giglione C.

Cells were induced at 20 °C by incubation with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 6000 rpm) and resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl). We added 100 μm lysozyme and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated the cells for 15 min at room temperature. The sample was subjected to sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 15,000 rpm). The supernatant (∼30 ml) was applied to a 5-ml Hi-Trap chelating HP (Amersham Biosciences) nickel affinity column equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, 0.5 m NaCl). The sample was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 40% of buffer B (20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 m imidazole) in 10 column volumes. This purification step was carried out at room temperature, with the buffers on ice. Samples of the collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 14% acrylamide gels. The buffer of the pooled purified AtPDF1AΔH preparation was exchanged using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) to give a solution of protein in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. The protein was concentrated on a Centriprep YM-10 and then on a Microcon YM-10 centrifugal concentrator (Millipore Corp.). The resulting AtPDF1AΔH preparation was frozen in aliquots and stored at -80 °C. The typical yield was 10-15 mg of AtPDF1AΔH/liter of culture. 15N-Labeled AtPDF1AΔ was produced in culture and purified as previously described (17Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5916-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Protein Analysis—Protein concentration was monitored spectrophotometrically, using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 12,210 m-1 cm-1. We carried out a coupled assay of peptide deformylase and formate dehydrogenase activity, as previously described (36Lazennec C. Meinnel T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation with a gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 492). The phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives generated at each sequencing cycle were identified and quantified online with an Applied Biosystems model 140C high pressure liquid chromatography system, using the data analysis system for protein sequencing from Applied Biosystems model 610A (software version 2.1). The phenylthiohydantoin-derivative standard kit (PerkinElmer P/N 0310040) was used and reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions (900776 Rev D). The procedures and reagents used were as recommended by the manufacturer. Chromatography was used to identify and quantify the amino acid derivative removed at each sequencing cycle. Retention times and integration values of peaks were compared with the chromatographic profile obtained for a standard mixture of amino acid derivatives.Gel permeation experiments were performed on a Superdex75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. Samples with a protein concentration of 2 or 10 mg/ml were centrifuged (10 min, 14,000 rpm at 4 °C), and 200 and 100 μl, respectively, was loaded onto the column, which had been calibrated with molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins present in the eluted fractions were analyzed and characterized by SDS-PAGE.Crystallization, Soaking Experiments, and X-ray Diffraction—Crystallization conditions were screened by a robot, using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Two different crystallization conditions were obtained and optimized at 20 °C: (i) 16% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 5000 MME, 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 5.5; (ii) 12% PEG 6000, 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 5.5. Crystals were obtained in a hanging drop formed by a 1:1 mixture of the protein (2-10 mg/ml) and reservoir crystallization solution. The two crystal types belong to the space group P212121 with equivalent cell parameters. Crystals of AtPDF1AΔH grown in PEG 5000 MME were soaked by adding formylated Met-Ala-Ser tripeptide (Fo-Met-Ala-Ser) to the drop at a final concentration of 33 mm. Cryoprotection was achieved by adding 20% glycerol before cryocooling at 100 K.X-ray diffraction data were collected on the FIP-BM30A beamline (37Roth M. Carpentier P. Kaikati O. Joly J. Charrault P.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of AtPDF1AΔH crystallized in PEG 5000 MME was solved by molecular replacement with the Molrep program of CCP4 (39Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1225Crossref Scopus (4118) Google Scholar). We used the Leptospira interrogans PDF structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1Y6H) (40Zhou Z. Song X. Li Y. Gong W. J. Mol.

The structures of AtPDF1AΔH crystallized in PEG 6000 or crystallized in PEG 5000 MME and then soaked by Fo-Met-Ala-Ser were solved by molecular replacement with Molrep, using the structure of one subunit of the protein crystallized in PEG 5000 MME as a starting model, with and without exclusion of the regions corresponding to residues 70-90 and 170-191. The three structures were refined using similar protocols. After rigid body refinement with the CNS program (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar) combined with refinement using only calculated phases. Local noncrystallographic symmetry was imposed on the two subunits in the asymmetric unit during refinement. Statistics for the three refined models are given in TABLE TWO.

Quicksand acts as an effective trap because it becomes unstable if forced to move. It first liquefies, then collapses. But there is good news: a simple test shows that it is impossible to sink beads with a density of 1 g per ml. So animals and humans, with a similar average density, will not be drawn into quicksand completely. They should sink only half-way. People or animals caught in quicksand find it very hard to escape1. Here we show that quicksand acts as a trap because it becomes unstable when it is forced to move — first it liquefies, and then it collapses. But a simple sinking test demonstrates that it is impossible for a human to be drawn into quicksand altogether."
https://openalex.org/W2019348750,"Faithful propagation of eukaryotic chromosomes usually requires that no DNA segment be replicated more than once during one cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are critical for the re-replication controls that inhibit the activities of components of the pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) following origin activation. The origin recognition complex (ORC) initiates the assembly of pre-RCs at origins of replication and Cdk phosphorylation of ORC is important for the prevention of re-initiation. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster ORC (DmORC) is phosphorylated in vivo and is a substrate for Cdks in vitro. Cdk phosphorylation of DmORC subunits DmOrc1p and DmOrc2p inhibits the intrinsic ATPase activity of DmORC without affecting ATP binding to DmOrc1p. Moreover, Cdk phosphorylation inhibits the ATP-dependent DNA-binding activity of DmORC in vitro, thus identifying a novel determinant for DmORC-DNA interaction. DmORC is a substrate for both Cdk2·cyclin E and Cdk1·cyclin B in vitro. Such phosphorylation of DmORC by Cdk2·cyclin E, but not by Cdk1·cyclin B, requires an “RXL” motif in DmOrc1p. We also identify casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a kinase activity in embryonic extracts targeting DmORC for modification. CK2 phosphorylation does not affect ATP hydrolysis by DmORC but modulates the ATP-dependent DNA-binding activity of DmORC. These results suggest molecular mechanisms by which Cdks may inhibit ORC function as part of re-replication control and show that DmORC activity may be modulated in response to phosphorylation by multiple kinases.

Prevention of re-replication in eukaryotic cells is essential for the maintenance of genomic ploidy, and mechanisms preventing such reinitiation-associated events are needed because unscheduled or uncontrolled DNA replication initiation can lead to genomic instability (1Bell S.P.

Re-replication control is achieved through (i) the prevention of repeated origin firing during one S phase and (ii) coordination of chromosomal replication with the segregation of the sister chromatids in mitosis.

Additional studies in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, substantiated these findings and demonstrated that some Cdk activity is required for one round of replication and that higher levels accumulating in S phase prevent re-initiation. Thus Cdks have both negative and positive roles in the initiation of DNA replication (9Dahmann C. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It is now known that in all eukaryotes studied Cdks contribute to the prevention of re-replication through direct inactivation of pre-RC proteins via multiple redundant mechanisms. This redundancy ensures that deregulation of any single mechanism is not sufficient to induce genomic re-replication (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 2Diffley J.F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 10Hayashi S.

For example, in S. cerevisiae, Cdk phosphorylation destabilizes Cdc6 and induces nuclear exclusion of Cdt1 and the minichromosome-maintenance 2–7 complex. cyclin-dependent kinase D. melanogaster ORC recombinant DmORC λ protein phosphatase 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole electrophoretic mobility shift assay prereplication complex origin recognition complex Tris-buffered saline tandem mass spectrometry adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) casein kinase 2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC. cyclin-dependent kinase D. melanogaster ORC recombinant DmORC λ protein phosphatase 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole electrophoretic mobility shift assay prereplication complex origin recognition complex Tris-buffered saline tandem mass spectrometry adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) casein kinase 2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC. Initiation of DNA replication involves the ordered assembly of large protein complexes at origins of replication. Pre-replication complex (pre-RC) assembly in late M/G1, when Cdk activity is low, is essential for proteins associated with an origin of replication to acquire competence to initiate DNA synthesis in the ensuing S phase (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 2Diffley J.F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This “licensing” process involves the binding of the hetero-hexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) in its ATP-bound form to an origin of replication, followed by a stepwise assembly of proteins, including Cdc6 and Cdt1, and finally, the presumed replicative helicase, the hetero-hexameric minichromosome-maintenance 2–7 complex. At the G1/S transition, pre-RCs are somehow activated by the action of both Cdk and the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase, allowing for the recruitment of additional protein complexes into pre-initiation complexes at the licensed origin. This assembly and remodeling ultimately result in the loading of the replicative DNA polymerases and the formation of functional replisomes at replication forks. How these modifications actually change the pre-initiation complex, or allow for the activity of additional factors required in subsequent steps, and thus lead to the engagement of an active replisome is unknown. In metazoans, other levels of regulation that involve the repressive component geminin, and that do not involve direct phosphorylation of pre-RC components, significantly increased the complexity of re-replication control (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 2Diffley J.F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R778-R786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, regulation of pre-RC components themselves is divergent throughout eukaryota. For example, phosphorylation by Cdk2·cyclin A negatively regulates Cdc6 activity in Xenopus egg extracts via nuclear exclusion rather than degradation, and Cdk phosphorylation contributes to increased protein instability of human and Drosophila Cdt1 rather than regulating their subcellular localization (15Pelizon C.

Although progress has been made in the elucidation of mechanisms regulating the activities of Cdc6, Cdt1, and the minichromosome-maintenance 2–7 complex, little is known about how ORC activity itself may be regulated by the Cdk activities during the cell cycle (18DePamphilis M.L. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, binding of Cdk1-Clb5 to Orc6 following origin activation has been shown to contribute to the prevention of origin re-firing (19Wilmes G.M. Archambault V. Austin R.J. Jacobson M.D. Bell S.P. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may operate in S. pombe, where ORC-dependent association of Cdc2-Cdc13 with replication origins prevents re-entry into S phase in the absence of mitosis (20Wuarin J. Buck V. Nurse P. Millar J.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 419-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cdk phosphorylation of Orc2 and Orc6 in S. cerevisiae and Orc2 in S. pombe contributes to re-replication control (14Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 21Vas A. Mok W. Leatherwood J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5767-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, neither ORC stability nor ORC-chromatin association appear to be regulated in the yeasts, leaving open the question of what aspect of ORC activity is regulated by phosphorylation (22Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 23Lygerou Z. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3703-3712PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the yeasts, metazoan cells may control ORC function through differential regulation of the chromatin-association of ORC or ORC subunits (18DePamphilis M.L. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis ORC is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in egg extracts, and chromatin association of X. laevis ORC varies during the cell cycle in an inverse relationship to its phosphorylation status (24Romanowski P.

For example, in Drosophila imaginal disks, the bulk of Orc1 persists from late G1 into metaphase at which time most of the protein is abruptly degraded before entry into the next G1 phase (33Araki M. Wharton R.P. Tang Z. Yu H. Asano M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These and other studies suggest that, while the protein levels and chromatin association of Orc2–6 remain constant throughout the cell cycle, Orc1 is selectively removed following origin activation until the next cell cycle. However, it is not clear how the biochemical or cytological behavior of the bulk population of ORC contributes to DNA replication regulation (34McNairn A.J. Okuno Y. Misteli T. Gilbert D.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the effect of phosphorylation on the biochemical activities of Drosophila melanogaster ORC (DmORC). We found that DmORC is phosphorylated in vivo on subunits DmOrc1p and DmOrc2p and that DmORC is a substrate for Cdks both in vivo and in vitro. Cdk hyperphosphorylation of DmORC inhibits the ability of DmORC to hydrolyze ATP and to form ATP-dependent complexes with DNA in vitro, suggesting possible mechanisms for ORC inactivation by Cdk phosphorylation without affecting DmORC integrity. Unexpectedly, we also found that DmORC is a substrate for CK2 in vivo and in vitro. Hyperphosphorylation by CK2 has no effect on the ATPase activity of DmORC but affects its DNA-binding activity. In each case, phosphorylation and the associated effects on the activities of DmORC were reversed by removal of the inhibitory phosphates. These results suggest molecular mechanisms for how Cdk phosphorylation can regulate ORC activity and indicate that DmORC is a target for multiple kinases. In Vivo Labeling of Drosophila Tissue Culture Cells—L2 cells were grown to 75% confluency on ten T-150 flasks in M3 medium/5% fetal calf serum. Cells were split into 3 equal fractions, washed subsequently 1× with TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl), 1× with phosphate-free M3 medium (M3 lacking yeast extract, Bactopeptone, and NaH2PO4)/5% fetal calf serum (dialyzed against TBS), 1× with phosphate-free M3/5% fetal calf serum supplemented with 0, 10, or 50 μm TBB (0.1% Me2SO final), respectively, resuspended in 3 ml of phosphate-free M3/5% fetal calf serum with or without TBB, respectively, and incubated in a 6-well dish at 25 °C. After 1.5 h, 1.5 mCi of 32Pi (ICN) was added, and cells incubated for another 2.5 h at 25 °C. Cells were washed 2× with 10 ml of ice-cold TBS, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm LiCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), incubated on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf). The resulting supernatant constituted the whole cell extract. DmORC was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4°C from 0.3 ml of labeled whole cell extract with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads coupled to affinity-purified polyclonal αDmOrc2p antibody. The immunoprecipitate was washed 2× in TBS/0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2× in TBS (0.3 mm NaCl)/0.05% Nonidet P-40, and resuspended in 20 μl of TBS plus SDS sample buffer. Half of each sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After exposure of the membrane to autoradiography film, the membrane was probed with antibodies against DmOrc1p, DmOrc2p, and DmOrc6p. In Vitro 32P Labeling of DmORC—Nuclear extract was prepared from 0–12 h Drosophila embryos as described previously (35Lewis P.W. Beall E.L. Fleischer T.C. Georlette D. Link A.J. Botchan M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2929-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The ammonium sulfate-precipitated extract pellet was redissolved in buffer A (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol)/0.15 m KCl/5 mm MgCl2/1 mm dithiothreitol/0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/protease inhibitor mixture. 0.2 ml of extract were supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Following the labeling period extracts were diluted 1:4 with TBS/0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, and DmORC immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C using either polyclonal αDmOrc2p or polyclonal αDmOrc1p antibody. The immunoprecipitate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was exposed to autoradiography film. In vitro kinase reactions with purified CK2 or Cdk were performed in 30 μl of buffer A/0.15 m KCl/5 mm MgCl2/0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, including 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 200 ng of rDmORC (∼16.5 nm) as indicated. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C and stopped by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer. Half of each sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained with silver, dried on Whatman paper, exposed to autoradiography film, and radiolabeled bands quantitated on a PhosphorImager. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Radiolabeled DmORC was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membrane exposed to autoradiography film, and radiolabeled protein bands corresponding to DmOrc1p or DmOrc2p excised from the membrane. The membrane pieces were pre-wet in methanol, incubated for 60 min at 110 °C in 0.1 ml of constant boiling (6 n) HCl (Pierce), the resulting supernatant was lyophilized, and phosphoamino acids were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described before (36Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Purification of Drosophila melanogaster CK2—Nuclear extract was prepared from 200 g of 0–12 h Drosophila embryos. One-seventh of ammonium sulfate-precipitated extract was redissolved in 50 ml of buffer A/0.1 m KCl/2 mm β-mercaptoethanol/0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Ti45 rotor, the resulting supernatant dialyzed for 3 h at 4°C against the same buffer, re-centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 rpm and 4 °C using a Ti45 rotor, and 20 ml of the dialyzed extract (0.1 m KCl) fractionated on a 10-ml Poros heparin column. The fraction eluting at 0.4–0.6 m KCl was subjected to ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography as outlined in Fig. 5B. In the final glycerol sedimentation step, 150 μl of the pooled peak fractions off the Mono Q column were loaded onto a 4-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient in buffer A/0.2 m KCl, and the gradient was spun for 16 h at 42,000 rpm and 4 °C using a SW60 rotor. Kinase assays directed against rDmORC were performed in 50 μlof buffer A/0.2 m KCl/5 mm MgCl2/0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin/2 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing 2 μg of purified rDmORC, 5 μl of respective fraction, 50 μm ATP, including 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, subsequently chilled on ice, diluted with 350 μl of buffer A/0.2 m KCl/10 mm imidazole, and the rDmORC re-purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose using His-Microspin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were rotated for 30 min in pre-spun columns at 4 °C, spun for 1 min at 3,000 rpm and 4 °C, the beads washed 1× with 500 μl of Ni-buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6/0.3 m KCl/0.05% Nonidet P-40/10% glycerol)/10 mm imidazole, and bound material eluted with 50 μl of Ni-buffer/200 mm imidazole. 20% of the eluate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel stained with silver, dried on Whatman paper, and exposed to autoradiography film. Antibodies against CK2α and CK2β were kind gifts of Dr. Claiborne V. C. Glover III (University of Georgia). Histone H1 Kinase Assay—Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 25 °C in 50 μl of buffer A/0.2 m KCl/5 mm MgCl2/0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin/50 μm ATP/1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1 mg/ml histone H1 (Upstate), 5 μl of respective fraction, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, and 10% of each reaction was fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was Coomassie-stained, dried on Whatman paper, and subsequently exposed to autoradiography film. Purification of Modified rDmORC—Untreated rDmORC was purified as described (37Chesnokov I. Remus D. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11997-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Baculovirus expressing ORC-1-LRN was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis from DmOrc1-wt containing vectors using the following primer pair: 5′-CCGGGCCTCGGCAGCCCGCCTCCGCAACAATCTCAGCCTGGATCG-3′ and 5′-CGATCCAGGCTGAGATTGTTGCGGAGGCGGGCTGCCGAGGCCCGG-3′. To obtain a concentrated stock of dephosphorylated rDmORC (ORCλPPase), a preparation of rDmORC (∼500 μg) was diluted before the final Mono S chromatography step with buffer A to reduce the salt concentration to 0.15 m KCl, supplemented with 2 mm MnCl2, and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 8,000 units of λPPase (New England Biolabs). The reaction was subsequently chilled on ice and then fractionated on Mono S. To generate ORCCK2, ORCCdk2·cyclinE, and ORCCK2/Cdk2·cyclinE, respectively, 15 μg of ORCλPPase was incubated for 45 min at 25 °C in 100 μl of buffer A/0.2 m KCl/5 mm MgCl2/1 mm ATP with either ∼5 μg of purified CK2, Cdk2·cyclin E, or both. Phosphorylated rDmORC was re-purified by centrifugation of the kinase reactions for 16 h at 42,000 rpm and 4 °C through a 4-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient containing buffer A/0.3 m KCl. Baculoviruses expressing His6-tagged human cyclin B, glutathione S-transferase-tagged human cyclin E, and untagged human Cdc2 and Cdk2, were kindly provided by David Morgan (University of California, San Francisco) and Brian Dynlacht (New York University). Cyclin·Cdk complexes were purified from whole cell extracts of Sf-9 insect cells using nickel-chelate or glutathione affinity chromatography, respectively, followed by conventional chromatography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions were carried out as described (37Chesnokov I. Remus D. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11997-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Remus D. Beall E.L. Botchan M.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), except that 2 mm MnCl2 was included in the reaction buffer to allow for simultaneous λPPase treatment. Where indicated λPPase was included at 200 units per reaction. When 6-dimethylaminopurine (Sigma) was tested for its ability to inhibit Cdk, binding reactions included 3 μl (∼100 ng) of glycerol gradient-purified DmORC, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm, 5 mm, or 10 mm 6-dimethylaminopurine, and ∼50 ng of purified Cdk2·cyclin E. ATPase Assays—Reactions were carried out at 25 °C in 50 μl of buffer A/0.15 m KCl/0.02% Nonidet P-40/2 mm MnCl2/5 mm MgCl2/0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin/50 μm ATP/1 μCi of α-[32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol and 2 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences). Glycerol gradient-purified rDmORC was used at 15–20 nm. Where indicated, a ∼320-bp PCR-amplified DNA fragment comprising ori-β (38Remus D. Beall E.L. Botchan M.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was included. Reactions were stopped and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography as described (38Remus D. Beall E.L. Botchan M.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). ATP Cross-linking—Reactions were performed in 30 μl of buffer A/0.15 m KCl/5 mm MgCl2/0.02% Nonidet P-40/0.5 mm dithiothreitol, including 3 μl of 8-azidoadenosine [α-32P]triphosphate (2–10 mCi/mmol, MP Biomedicals) and ∼35 nm glycerol gradient-purified rDmORC as indicated. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C followed by 2 min of UV (254 nm) irradiation using a hand-held UV lamp. Proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid to remove unbound nucleotide, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was silver-stained, dried on Whatman paper, and exposed to autoradiography film. Radioactive bands were quantitated on a PhosphorImager. Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Purified ORC was subjected to a triple digest protocol as described (39MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates 3rd., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) with the difference that chymotrypsin (Roche Diagnostic) was used instead of subtilisin. The three digested protein samples containing 5% formic acid were pooled and desalted on separate fused silica capillary desalting columns containing 3 cm of Polaris C18-A packed into a 250-μm inner diameter capillary with a 2-μm filtered union (UpChurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA). The desalting columns were washed with 5% MeCN, 5% formic acid and eluted with 80% MeCN, 5% formic acid. The samples were lyophilized and stored dried. The dried samples were resuspended in 5% MeCN, 5% formic acid and loaded onto a biphasic 100-μm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with 10 cm of 5-μm Polaris C18-A material and 1 cm of 5-μm Partisphere strong cation exchanger. After loading the peptide digests, analysis was performed using a 9-step multidimensional separation as described previously (40Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates 3rd., J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar) using 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid as the counter ion. The MS/MS spectra were analyzed sequentially. First, the MS/MS spectra were searched by using a parallel virtual machine version of SEQUEST running on a 16-node IBM computing cluster against the Drosophila complete protein data base generated from GadFly version 4.0. The resulting SEQUEST output files were filtered using the program DTASelect (41Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd., J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). A subset data base was made containing just the proteins identified. This subset data base was then used to expedite all subsequent differential modification searches (42Yates 3rd, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The MS/MS data were searched against the subset data base to look for phosphorylation (+80 on STY) and oxidation (+16 on MWY). DmORC Phosphorylation in Vivo and in Vitro—In our previous DNA binding studies of DmORC, we used gel-shift assays to measure the formation of an ATP-dependent complex between DmORC and various DNA fragments (37Chesnokov I. Remus D. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11997-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Remus D. Beall E.L. Botchan M.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Curiously, we noticed variations in the binding efficiencies between different protein preparations and that DmOrc2p staining after SDS-PAGE displayed a characteristically fuzzy appearance. Such heterogeneity in electrophoretic mobility can be indicative of phosphorylation variations. Consistent with this hypothesis we found that in the steady state, DmORC2p is the maj"
https://openalex.org/W2029185066,"We have shown previously that a highly sulfated sequence, GalNAc(4,6-SO4)-GlcA(2SO4)-GalNAc(6SO4), is present at the nonreducing terminal of chondroitin sulfate (CS), and this structure was synthesized from a unique sequence, GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA(2SO4)-GalNAc(6SO4), by sulfation with N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase. Uronosyl 2-O-sulfotrasferase (2OST), which transfers sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to position 2 of the GlcA residue of CS, is expected to be involved in synthesis of these structures; however, the specificity of 2OST concerning recognition of the sulfation pattern of the acceptor has largely remained unclear. In the present study, we examined the specificity of 2OST in terms of recognition of the sulfation pattern around the targeting GlcA residue. The recombinant 2OST could sulfate CS-A, CS-C, and desulfated dermatan sulfate. When [35S]glycosaminoglycans formed from CS-A after the reaction with the recombinant 2OST and [35S]PAPS were subjected to limited digestion with chondroitinase ACII, a radioactive tetrasaccharide (Tetra A) was obtained as a sole intermediate product. The sequence of Tetra A was found to be ΔHexA-GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA(2SO4)-GalNAc(6SO4) by enzymatic and chemical reactions. These observations indicate that 2OST transfers sulfate preferentially to the GlcA residue located in a unique sequence, -GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4)-. When oligosaccharides with different sulfation patterns were used as the acceptor, GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) and GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) were the best acceptors for 2OST among trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides, respectively. These results suggest that 2OST may be involved in the synthesis of the highly sulfated structure found in CS-A.

Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38443-38452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis and functional roles of the highly sulfated nonreducing terminal structure has remained to be studied. We found previously that 6-O-sulfation of the GalNAc(4SO4) residue at the nonreducing end by GalNAc4S-6ST was markedly stimulated by 2-O-sulfation of the penultimate GlcA residue (22Ohtake S. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38443-38452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that 2-O-sulfation of the GlcA residue may occur prior to 6-O-sulfation of the nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4SO4). Uronosyl 2-O-sulfotrasferase (2OST, gene name UST) (23Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

However, the mechanism by which these sequences are generated has not been fully understood because the strict substrate specificity of 2OST, especially recognition of the sulfation pattern around the targeting GlcA residue, has remained largely unclear. In the present study, we determined acceptor substrate specificity of the affinity purified recombinant 2OST using various glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfate, and found that 2OST preferentially sulfated the GlcA residue located in the sequence GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4).

Disaccharide compositions of glycosaminoglycans were determined by absorbance at 232 nm of unsaturated disaccharides separated by SAX-HPLC after chondroitinase ACII or ABC digestion. Analytical data of these glycosaminoglycans are shown in TABLE ONE. The tetrasaccharides GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4) (Tetra-44), GlcA-GalNAc-(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) (Tetra-46), GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4) (Tetra-64), and GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc-(6SO4) (Tetra-66), and trisaccharides GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc-(4SO4) (Tri-44), GalNAc(4SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) (Tri-46), GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(4SO4) (Tri-64), and GalNAc(6SO4)-GlcA-GalNAc(6SO4) (Tri-66) were prepared as described (22Ohtake S.

The first PCR was carried out using oligonucleotides 2OST-F1, GGGTGACCTTTTCCTGGCAC, and 2OST-R1, GTCCCTTAAGGATTTTACTTCCCCAAAC, which were synthesized according to the sequence of the 2OST cDNA clone (GenBank® accession number AB020316), as primers, and the QUICK-Clone® cDNA derived from human pancreas (Clontech) as a template. Amplification was carried out by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The second PCR was carried out using oligonucleotides 2OST-F2, CAGGAATTCGATGAAGAAGAAGCAGCAGCATC, and 2OST-R2, CGCAGATCTTCACCTCTTATAAATATCTTCCAGCCA, as primers, and the first PCR mixture as the template. At the 5′-ends of oligonucleotides 2OST-F2 and 2OST-R2, restriction enzyme recognition sites were introduced; an EcoRI site for 2OST-F2 and a BglII site for 2OST-R2. Amplification was carried out by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min. The reaction products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplified DNA band was cut out and the DNA fragment was recovered from the gel, digested with EcoRI and BglII, and subcloned into these sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 plasmid (Eastman Kodak). Recombinant 2OST was expressed in COS-7 cells as a fusion protein with FLAG peptide and affinity purified (29Ohtake S. Ito Y. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43894-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The purified protein was visualized with Western blot as described below before or after N-glycosidase F digestion (Fig. 1). After N-glycosidase F digestion, a single protein band was detected at the migration position of 49 kDa that agreed well with the molecular mass, 48,909, calculated from the cDNA. Western Blot Analysis—The affinity purified 2OST was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol containing 1.3% (w/v) potassium acetate and digested with recombinant N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by the methods recommended by the manufacturer. After digestion, the samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and stained with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The blot was developed with polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase using an ECL detection kit and a Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Assay of Sulfotransferase Activity—2OST activity was assayed by the method described previously (23Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10474-10480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.6 μg of protamine chloride, 25 nmol (as galactosamine) of CS-A, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5.0 × 105 cpm), and enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. 35S-Labeled glycosaminoglycans were isolated by precipitation with ethanol followed by gel chromatography with a Fast Desalting Column as described previously (31Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and radioactivity was determined. For determining the activity toward various glycosaminoglycans, CS-A was replaced with 25 nmol (as galactosamine for chondroitin, CS-C, DS, and oligosaccharides, or glucosamine for heparan sulfate, completely desulfated N-resulfated heparin, and keratan sulfate) of glycosaminoglycans or oligosaccharides. When oligosaccharides were used as the acceptors, the reaction mixtures were applied directly to the Superdex 30 column as described below, and the 35S-labeled oligosaccharides were separated from 35SO4 and [35S]PAPS. Digestion with Chondroitinase ACII, Chondroitinase ABC, Chondro-6-sulfatase, Chondro-4-sulfatase, and β-Glucuronidase—Unless otherwise stated, digestion with chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC under standard conditions was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 25 μl, 1.25 μmol of Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC. For degrading 35S-labeled trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides with chondroitinase ABC, a strong condition was used under which digestion with chondroitinase ABC was carried out in the reaction mixtures described above three times successively; first with 120 milliunits of enzyme for 28 h, second with 100 milliunits of enzyme for 18 h, and finally with 100 milliunits of enzyme for 7 h. The new enzymes were added after heating the reaction mixtures at 100 °C for 1 min. Digestion with chondro-6-sulfatase of Tetra A or Tetra B was carried out for 5 h at 37°C in the reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 25 μl, 1.25 μmol of Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 50 milliunits of chondro-6-sulfatase. After digestion of 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans or oligosaccharides with chondroitinase ACII or chondroitinase ABC, digestion with chondro-6-sulfatase or chondro-4-sulfatase was carried out twice successively in the reaction mixtures described above; first with 100 milliunits of enzyme for 17 h and second with 100 milliunits of enzyme for 5 h. Digestion with β-glucuronidase was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing, in a final volume of 40 μl, 35S-labeled tetrasaccharide (∼40 nmol as galactosamine), 2 μmol of sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 20 nmol of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactonic acid-1,4-lactone, 0.8 μmol of sodium fluoride, and 18 units of β-glucuronidase. Under these conditions, removal of the nonreducing terminal GlcA was complete and no release of inorganic sulfate was observed. Removal of Unsaturated Uronic Acid by Mercuric Acetate Treatment— Removal of unsaturated uronic acid was carried out as described (32Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Roden L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled or -unlabeled tetrasaccharide containing unsaturated uronic acid were dried and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 35 mm mercuric acetate in 25 mm Tris with 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The reaction was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. After the reaction was over, the samples were applied to a Dowex 50 (H+) column (bed volume of 1 ml). The column was washed with 3 ml of water. The flow-through fractions and the washings were combined and lyophilized. The lyophilized materials were further purified with Superdex 30 and SAX-HPLC. Sulfation of the Trisaccharide, Which Was Derived from Tetra A by Mercuric Acetate Treatment, with GalNAc4S-6ST—The sulfotransferase reaction was carried out as described (26Ito Y. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34728-34736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Habuchi O. Moroi R. Ohtake S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 2.5 μmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 μmol of CaCl2,1 μmol of reduced glutathione, the 35S-labeled trisaccharide derived from Tetra A by mercuric acetate treatment (about 6000 cpm), 1.35 nmol of Oligo I (final 27 μm), 100 nmol of unlabeled PAPS (final 2 mm), and 180 ng of the purified squid GalNAc4S-6ST. The reaction mixture was incubated at 15 °C for 24 h and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tube in a boiling water bath for 1 min. After the reaction was stopped, the reaction mixture was applied to the Superdex 30 column. Fractions containing the radioactive oligosaccharide were collected, lyophilized, and separated with SAX-HPLC. Superdex 30 Chromatography and HPLC—A Superdex 30 16/60 column was equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3, and run at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected. Separation of the degradation products formed from 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans and 35S-labeled oligosaccharides were carried out by HPLC using a Whatman Partisil-10 SAX column (4.6 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 5 mm KH2PO4. The column was developed with a gradient (5 mm KH2PO4 for 10 min followed by a linear gradient from 5 to 500 mm KH2PO4). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a column temperature of 40 °C. Sulfation of Various Glycosaminoglycans by the Recombinant 2OST— The rates of transfer of sulfate to various glycosaminoglycans were determined (TABLE TWO). Among these glycosaminoglycans, desulfated DS was the best acceptor. CS-A from whale cartilage and sturgeon notochord were both better acceptors than CS-C. The rate of sulfation of chondroitin was much lower than the rate of sulfation of CS-A. Unlike a previous report (23Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10474-10480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), DS was a poor acceptor. The rate of sulfation of DS was increased when the concentration of protamine was increased as described previously in the activity of C4ST-1 (34Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CS-E, keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and completely desulfated re-N-sulfated heparin hardly served as acceptor. To determine the position to which sulfate was transferred, the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans derived from whale cartilage CS-A and CS-C were digested with chondroitinase ACII and subjected to SAX-HPLC (Fig. 2, A and C). The radioactivity was exclusively detected at the position of ΔDi-diSD. After chondro-6-sulfatase digestion, the radioactivity was shifted to the position of ΔDi-2S (Fig. 2, B a"

Among the NAD kinase homologs, the primary structure of MJ0917 of hyperthermophilic archaeal Methanococcus jannaschii is unique. MJ0917 possesses an NAD kinase homologous region in its C-terminal half and an inositol-1-phosphatase homologous region in its N-terminal half. In this study, MJ0917 was biochemically shown to possess both NAD kinase and phosphatase activities toward NADP+, NADPH, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, but not toward inositol 1-phosphate. With regard to the phosphatase activity, kinetic values indicated that NADP+ is the preferred substrate and that MJ0917 would function as a novel NADP phosphatase/NAD kinase showing conflicting dual activities, viz. synthesis and degradation of an essential NADP+. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of MJ0917 showed that, although MJ0917 could supply NADP+, it prevented excess accumulation of NADP+; thus, it has the ability to maintain a high NAD+/NADP+ ratio, whereas 5′-AMP would decrease this ratio.

Furthermore, in vitro analysis of MJ0917 showed that, although MJ0917 could supply NADP+, it prevented excess accumulation of NADP+; thus, it has the ability to maintain a high NAD+/NADP+ ratio, whereas 5′-AMP would decrease this ratio. The evolutionary process during which MJ0917 arose is also discussed. The functions of the well known molecules NAD+ and NADP+ are distinguishable. NAD+ is involved primarily in catabolic reactions, whereas NADP+ participates in anabolic reactions (1Moat A.G. Foster J.W. Avramovic D.D.O. Poulson R. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes: Part A. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 1-24Google Scholar) and in defense against oxidative stress (2Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). NAD+ functions as a substrate for mono- and poly-ADP ribosylations and is involved in the formation of cyclic ADP-ribose (3Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). NADP+ is the substrate in the synthesis of nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP+) 2The abbreviations used are:NAADP+nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphateNADPaseNADP phosphataseIns-1-Paseinositol-1-phosphataseFru-1,6-Pasefructose-1,6-bisphosphatasepoly(P)inorganic polyphosphatepNPPasep-nitrophenylphosphataseFru-1,6-P2fructose 1,6-bisphosphateNMN+nicotinamide mononucleotideNADPHaseNADPH phosphatase 2The abbreviations used are:NAADP+nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphateNADPaseNADP phosphataseIns-1-Paseinositol-1-phosphataseFru-1,6-Pasefructose-1,6-bisphosphatasepoly(P)inorganic polyphosphatepNPPasep-nitrophenylphosphataseFru-1,6-P2fructose 1,6-bisphosphateNMN+nicotinamide mononucleotideNADPHaseNADPH phosphatase (3Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Poly-ADP-ribosylation has been implicated in the regulation of several processes, including DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis, whereas both cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP+ have been reported to participate in cytosolic calcium regulation in concert with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (3Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular balance of NAD+/NADP+ appears to be important for a large number of cellular processes.A key enzyme regulating the balance of NAD+/NADP+ is NAD kinase (EC 2.7.1.23); it phosphorylates NAD+ to form NADP+. Another key enzyme involved in regulating this balance is NADP phosphatase (NADPase); is catalyzes the reverse reaction of NAD kinase, i.e. the dephosphorylation of NADP+ to NAD+. However, little information is available regarding NADPase because the enzyme has not yet been identified. NADPase activity has been detected in rat liver mitochondria (4Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in bacteria (5Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Murata K. J. Basic Microbiol. 2004; 44: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and it was also found to correlate with the circadian rhythm of Euglena (6Laval-Martin D.L. Carre I.A. Barbera S.J. Edmunds Jr., L.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and with seed dormancy in Avena sativa L. (7Gallais S. de Crescenzo M.A. Laval-Martin D.L. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 1389-1394PubMed Google Scholar). Although NADPase activity has been detected in an outer membrane-associated acid phosphatase found in Hemophilus influenzae, this enzyme physiologically functions in the uptake and utilization of exogenous NADP+ (8Reidl J. Schlor S. Kraiss A. Schmidt-Brauns J. Kemmer G. Soleva E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to NADPase, NAD kinase has been biochemically characterized in various organisms such as Gram-positive bacteria (9Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Hashimoto W. Murata K.

Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); however, NAD kinase has not yet been reported in Archaea. Presently, >273 NAD kinase homologs are found in available data bases such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (available at www.genome.jp/kegg/).Among the NAD kinase homologs found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, the primary structures of only two archaeal proteins (MJ0917 of Methanococcus jannaschii and MMP1489 of Methanococcus maripaludis) are characteristic and consist of two clearly distinguishable regions, viz. a C-terminal NAD kinase region and an N-terminal inositol-1-phosphatase (Ins-1-Pase) region (see Fig. 1A). M. jannaschii and M. maripaludis are hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Archaea whose entire genomic sequences have been determined (17Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G.

Ins-1-Pase (EC 3.1.3.25) is known to dephosphorylate d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate, yielding myo-inositol, which is necessary for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (20Berridge M.E. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar).A homolog (MJ0109) of the N-terminal region of MJ0917 (MJ0917-N) exists in M. jannaschii, but not in M. maripaludis. MJ0109 comprises 252 residues and has been shown to be a bifunctional Ins-1-Pase/fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-Pase) (21Chen L. Roberts M.F. Appl. Environ.

Other archaeal MJ0917-N homologs (AF2372 of Archaeoglobus fulgidus and TK0787 of Thermococcus kodakaraensis) and a hyperthermophilic bacterial homolog (TM1415 of Thermotoga maritima) have also been shown to be bifunctional Ins-1-Pases/Fru-1,6-Pases (22Stec B.

We hypothesized that MJ0917 and MMP1489 may be novel bifunctional NADPases/NAD kinases with the potential to generate intracellular NADP+ and to maintain a suitable balance of NAD+/NADP+. To confirm this hypothesis, we chose MJ0917 and analyzed its biochemical properties.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAssays—ATP-dependent NAD kinase activity was assayed in a 1.0-ml reaction mixture (5.0 mm NAD+, 5.0 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5)) at 85 °C (12Ochiai A. Mori S. Kawai S. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of 200 mm EDTA. The NADP+ formed was determined using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as described (12Ochiai A. Mori S. Kawai S. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Less than 30 μl of the enzyme solution was added to the reaction mixture. When NAD+ was replaced with NADH, NADPH was determined using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase after oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ by glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) (12Ochiai A. Mori S. Kawai S. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was assayed in a 0.10-ml reaction mixture (1.0 mm phosphorylated compound, 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5)) at 85 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of 10% SDS (5Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Murata K. J. Basic Microbiol. 2004; 44: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and the released Pi was determined as described previously (27Bretaudiere J.P. Spillman T. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grabl M. Methods Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Vol. IV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984: 76-82Google Scholar). In the presence of inorganic polyphosphate (poly(P)) or ATP, Pi was assayed by another method (26Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). p-Nitrophenylphosphatase (pNPPase) activity was also assayed by measuring p-nitrophenol liberated at A405 (ϵ = 18.8 mmol-1 cm-1) in a 0.5-ml reaction mixture of the phosphatase assay (27Bretaudiere J.P. Spillman T. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grabl M. Methods Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Vol. IV. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984: 76-82Google Scholar). Non-enzymatically released Pi or p-nitrophenol was subtracted from the total Pi or p-nitrophenol released. Less than 10 μl (0.1-ml reaction) or 50 μl (0.5-ml reaction) of the enzyme solution (after 10-fold dilution with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) at 4 °C) was routinely added to the reaction mixture. In all assays for NAD kinase and phosphatase, reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme to reaction mixtures preincubated at 85 °C for 3 min. During purification, NAD kinase and pNPPase activities were assayed by measuring the amount of p-nitrophenol liberated in the presence of 5.0 and 10 mm MgCl2, respectively. Assays were linear with respect to time (at least 30 s and 1 min) and enzyme concentration (three points). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1.0 μmol of product formed in 1 min at 85 °C, and specific activity is expressed in units/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The amount of NAD+ was enzymatically determined using alcohol dehydrogenase and semicarbazide (28Klinenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grabl M. Methods Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VII. Academic Press, Inc., New York1985: 251-271Google Scholar). TLC was performed using a solvent system of 5:3 (v/v) isobutyrate and 500 mm NH4OH (5Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Murata K. J. Basic Microbiol. 2004; 44: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Vmax and Km values were calculated from a Hanes-Woolf plot. A Hill plot was used to determine the Hill coefficient (nH) and the apparent substrate concentration (S0.5) that gives one-half of Vmax. These kinetic values are presented as the means ± S.D. for more than three determinations.Cloning and Expression—Genes encoding MJ0917 (full-length, residues 1–574), MJ0917-N (N-terminal half, residues 1–297), and MJ0917-C (C-terminal half, residues 298–574) were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from M. jannaschii (ATCC 43067D, American Type Culture Collection) as a template and inserted into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET-21b (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Ile-298 (an initial residue of MJ0917-C) was changed to Met in the cloned gene encoding MJ0917-C. The integrity of the cloned gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resultant plasmids and only pET-21b were introduced into Escherichia coli Origami B(DE3) (Novagen), yielding MK1206 for the expression of MJ0917, MK1205 for the expression of MJ0917-N, MK1204 for the expression of MJ0917-C, and MK257 for the control. These strains were cultivated in LB medium according to the pET system manual (Novagen) at 18 °C for 108 h after the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 25 μm). Soluble MJ0917 and MJ0917-C were expressed under these conditions. Compared with the use of BL21(DE3) (Novagen) (data not shown), the use of Origami B(DE3) increased the amount of soluble MJ0917 and MJ0917-C. In Origami B(DE3) and BL21(DE3), MJ0917-N was expressed as an insoluble protein (data not shown).Purification—E. coli cells were suspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 1.0 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and disrupted by sonication using an Insonator 201M sonicator (Kubota Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The clear supernatant that was obtained following centrifugation of the sonicated cell suspension at 20,000 × g for 10 min was used as the cell extract. For purification of MJ0917, the activities of pNPPase and ATP-dependent NAD kinase were measured. The cell extract containing MJ0917 was heated at 85 °C for 2.5 min. After removing aggregated proteins by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was applied to a Toyopearl AF-Blue HC-650 M column (1.0 × 3.2 cm; Tosoh Corp., Tokyo) equilibrated with TE buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–3000 mm) in the same buffer (40 ml). The active fractions were combined and used as purified MJ0917. MJ0917-C was partially purified by heating the cell extract containing MJ0917-C at 85 °C for 2.5 min and then removing the aggregated proteins as described above.Other Analytical Methods—SDS-PAGE was conducted with a 12.5% gel as described (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Proteins in the gel were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 prep grade column (1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) with an ÅKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer using 5.0 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl as the elution buffer and the standards in a high molecular weight calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence, the purified enzyme was directly analyzed with a Procise 492 protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). The DNA sequence was determined using an automated DNA sequencer (Model 377, Applied Biosystems). BLAST homology analysis (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar) was conducted on the GenomeNet web site (available at blast.genome.jp/) against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes GENES plus DGENES Databases. Cluster analysis was performed on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes web site (available at www.genome.jp/kegg/).RESULTSExpression and Purification—MJ0917 (full-length, residues 1–574), MJ0917-N (N-terminal half, residues 1–297), and MJ0917-C (C-terminal half, residues 298–574) were expressed in E. coli as recombinant proteins. SDS-PAGE of the E. coli cell extracts showed that MJ0917 (Fig. 1B, lane 3) and MJ0917-C (data not shown) were expressed as soluble proteins, but that MJ0917-N was expressed only as an insoluble protein (data not shown). The cell extract containing only the vector (pET-21b) did not show pNPPase or ATP-dependent NAD kinase activity, probably due to the high reaction temperature employed (85 °C). The cell extract containing soluble MJ0917 (full-length) showed both pNPPase and ATP-dependent NAD kinase activities (TABLE ONE). In contrast, the cell extract containing soluble MJ0917-C showed ATP-dependent NAD kinase activity, but no pNPPase activity (data not shown). Thus, MJ0917 was considered to be a fusion protein consisting of a phosphatase and an NAD kinase located in its N- and C-terminal halves, respectively. The pNPPase activity of MJ0917-N could not be confirmed because it could not be expressed as a soluble protein.TABLE ONEPurification of MJ0917ProteinNAD kinaseaNAD kinase activity was assayed in the presence of 5.0 mm ATP and 5.0 mm Mg2+PhosphatasebPhosphatase activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate was assayed in the presence of 1.0 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate and 10 mm Mg2+ by measuring liberated p-nitrophenolActivityYieldSpecific activity-FoldActivityYieldSpecific activity-Foldmgunits%units/mgunits%units/mgCell extract36923041006.241.0319.21000.871.0Heat16.0649.328.240.66.5110.934.76.938.0Toyopearl3.49347.015.199.415.9132.441.837.943.6a NAD kinase activity was assayed in the presence of 5.0 mm ATP and 5.0 mm Mg2+b Phosphatase activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate was assayed in the presence of 1.0 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate and 10 mm Mg2+ by measuring liberated p-nitrophenol Open table in a new tab MJ0917 (full-length) was purified by measuring the activities of pNPPase and NAD kinase (TABLE ONE). Purified MJ0917 had a molecular mass of 64 kDa, which is in accordance with the calculated value (64,118 Da) (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified MJ0917 was determined as MVIMEGFK, which is the same as the N-terminal sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the MJ0917 gene. Upon gel filtration chromatography, purified MJ0917 eluted as a single peak with an approximate molecular mass of 290 kDa, suggesting that MJ0917 is a homotetramer.MJ0917 pNPPase and ATP-dependent NAD kinase activities were optimum under alkaline conditions (Fig. 2A) and were completely dependent on Mg2+. pNPPase and NAD kinase showed maximum activities at 20 and 50 mm Mg2+, respectively (Fig. 2B). MJ0917 pNPPase and ATP-dependent NAD kinase showed the highest activity at 100 °C and were inactive below 60 °C (Fig. 2C). M. jannaschii preferably grows at 85 °C (17Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J.

Therefore, the phosphatase and NAD kinase activities of MJ0917 were hereafter determined at 85 °C in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+ at pH 8.5 unless stated otherwise.FIGURE 2pH (A), Mg2+ (B), and temperature (C) dependence of pNPPase (▴) and ATP-dependent NAD kinase (•) activities of MJ0917.A, pNPPase activity was assayed in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ by measuring the amount of p-nitrophenol generated. NAD kinase activity was assayed in the presence of 5.0 mm Mg2+. The pH at 85 °C is indicated and was adjusted with Tris. The activity was assayed for 1 and 2 min. Each of the relative activities at pH 8.5 (pNPPase) and pH 7.7 (NAD kinase) was taken as 100%. B, pNPPase and ATP-dependent NAD kinase activities were assayed in a manner similar to that described for A at various concentrations of Mg2+. Each of the relative activities at 20 mm Mg2+ (pNPPase) and 50 mm Mg2+ (NAD kinase) was taken as 100%. C, pNPPase and ATP-dependent NAD kinase activities were assayed in a manner similar to that described for A at different reaction temperatures, with the exception that assay times were 30 s and 1 min at 100 °C. Each of the relative activities at 100 °C (pNPPase and NAD kinase) was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Substrate Specificities of MJ0917—The substrate specificity (phosphoryl donor and acceptor) of MJ0917 NAD kinase was determined (TABLE TWO). As a phosphoryl donor, MJ0917 utilized nucleoside triphosphates and poly(P) as substrates, but not ADP or 5′-AMP, which is reminiscent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAD kinase (9Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, poly(P) is not considered to be the true phosphoryl donor in M. jannaschii because orthologs of the genes for poly(P)-synthesizing enzymes (poly(P) kinase-1 and -2), which occur in M. tuberculosis, are not found in M. jannaschii (31Zhang H. Ishige K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16678-16683Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). MJ0917 used NADH as a phosphoryl acceptor but to a lesser extent, suggesting that NADH is not the physiological substrate.TABLE TWOSubstrate specificity of MJ0917 for NAD kinase activity MJ0917 (<0.40 units, determined by ATP-dependent NAD kinase activity) was used, and the assay was conducted for 30 s and 1 min.SubstrateRelative activity%Phosphoryl donoraPhosphoryl donors (Sigma) were used at a concentration of 1.0 mm, but 0.1% (1.0 mg/ml) hexametaphosphate (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was used.

MJ0917 exhibited high activity toward NADP+, NADPH, and 2′-AMP (analog of NADP+ and NADPH). Enzymatic formation of NAD+ from NADP+ was confirmed by TLC (data not shown). MJ0917 also showed high phosphatase activity toward fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2). The phosphatase activities toward NADP+, NADPH, and Fru-1,6-P2 were lower at pH 6.5 than at pH 8.5 (<10% activity) and preferred a high reaction temperature (optimum at 100 °C in a 1-min reaction). They also had an absolute requirement for Mg2+ (maximum activity at ∼20 mm Mg2+). Partially purified MJ0917-C showed NAD kinase activity, but not NADPase activity, indicating that the NADPase activity of full-length MJ0917 is due to the phosphatase activity of the N-terminal Ins-1-Pase region (MJ0917-N) and not due to the reverse reaction of the C-terminal NAD kinase region (MJ0917-C).TABLE THREESubstrate specificity of MJ0917 for phosphatase activity Activity at pH 8.5 (85 °C) is indicated by considering the relative activity for p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as 100%.

A diverse family of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons possesses chromodomains in their integrases (IN), suggesting that the chromodomains may control integration. The LTR-retrotransposon Tf1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is highly active and possesses a chromodomain in the COOH terminus of its IN.

The INs of retroviruses possess an additional activity termed 3′ processing that must remove 2-3 nucleotides from the 3′ ends of the viral cDNA before insertion can occur. These additional nucleotides are added during reverse transcription because of the position of the minus strand primer downstream of the LTR. The position of the primer for Tf1 suggests no nucleotides are added 3′ of the LTR. It was therefore surprising that Tf1 IN was capable of 3′ cleavage. The most unexpected result reported here was that the IN lacking the chromodomain had significantly higher activity and substantially reduced substrate specificity.

Post-translational modifications of histones, such as the acetylation or methylation of lysines, establish the accessibility of DNA to the transcription machinery (1Iizuka M. Smith M.M. Curr. Opin.

This is intriguing because it suggests that the transposons acquired chromodomains to regulate integration. long terminal repeat integrase the chromodomain-deleted IN human immunodeficiency virus type 1 dimethyl sulfoxide nucleotide(s) reverse transcriptase overhang 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid LTR-retrotransposons are closely related to retroviruses. Both types of elements encode Gag, protease, reverse transcriptase, and IN proteins and both depend on IN to insert their cDNA into the genome of a host cell. The LTRs, positioned at the ends of the cDNA, are subdivided into an upstream segment, U3, a central region, R, and a downstream segment, U5. A large number of biochemical studies with purified IN have characterized the chemistry of insertion (10Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 161-204Google Scholar, 11Hindmarsh P. Leis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23213-23216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The INs of retroviruses have two activities that are necessary for the integration of the viral cDNA. At first, 2 or 3 nucleotides are removed from the 3′ ends of the LTRs. This site-specific nucleolytic cleavage or “3′ processing reaction” is required to position the “CA” dinucleotides at the 3′ ends of the cDNA. The CA dinucleotides are conserved among all retroviruses and their position at the 3′ ends of the cDNA is required for the second step of retrovirus integration, the “strand transfer reaction.” During this second step, the 3′ hydroxyls of the terminal “A” act as nucleophiles in a pair of transesterification reactions that cleave the phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA and simultaneously make a covalent bond between the 3′ ends of the viral DNA and the 5′ ends of the target DNA. In retroviruses, the minus strand primers initiate reverse transcription 2 or 3 nucleotides from the LTR and this results in additional nucleotides at the cDNA termini that IN removes during the processing reaction. In the case of most LTR-retrotransposons the minus strand primers initiate reverse transcription with no added nucleotides. As a result, these LTR-retrotransposons are thought to proceed to the strand transfer reaction without a processing step (13Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcription and the Generation of Retroviral DNA. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1997Google Scholar). The INs of retroviruses have three protease-resistant domains and the functions of these domains have been studied extensively (12Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23213-23216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14Grandgenett D. Quinn T. Hippenmeyer P.J. Oroszlan S. J. Biol.

The NH2-terminal domain contains a conserved motif similar to zinc fingers. Although this domain does bind zinc, little else is known about its function. The central domain is the catalytic core that contains highly conserved acidic residues, Asp, Asp, and Glu, that are juxtaposed on an RNase H-like fold. These three amino acids are conserved in all the INs of retroviruses, LTR-retrotransposons, and DNA transposons (16Craig N.L. Science. 1995; 270: 253-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The central domain of HIV-1 IN was shown to be sufficient for catalytic activity in in vitro assays for the reverse reaction of strand transfer known as disintegration (17Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield P. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain is less well conserved but has nonspecific binding activity to DNA. Although the structure of individual domains has been determined for several INs, no single structure yet contains all three domains (18Chiu T.K. Davies D.R. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Tf1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is one of the LTR-retrotransposons that contains a chromodomain at the COOH terminus of IN (8Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its high level of transposition activity allows Tf1 to be studied as a model for reverse transcription and integration. Expression of Tf1 from a high copy plasmid results in the formation of virus-like particles, the reverse transcription of the Tf1 mRNA, and the integration of the cDNA into intergenic sequences (19Atwood A. Lin J.H. Levin H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Singleton T.L. Levin H.L.

A novel mechanism of self-priming initiates minus strand reverse transcription from the upstream LTR (22Levin H.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After initiation, reverse transcription proceeds through the same intermediates typical of other LTR elements. The IN of Tf1 that inserts this cDNA into the genome of S. pombe contains putative zinc binding, catalytic core, and COOH-terminal domains that are necessary for integration (23Atwood A. Choi J. Levin H.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation analysis indicated that its high level of activity and the tools available to study it make Tf1 uniquely suited for examining the function of the chromodomain in integration. In this report the activities of Tf1 IN and the function of its chromodomain were studied. IN and IN without the chromodomain (CH-) were expressed in bacteria and purified. Biochemical assays for disintegration and strand transfer showed that IN possessed substantial activity. Because Tf1 cDNA was predicted to terminate with CA, it was surprising that IN also had strong 3′ processing activity. This indicates that the position of the minus strand primer relative to the LTR is not sufficient to predict the presence of processing activity. The most unexpected result was that CH- had significantly higher specific activity than IN. In addition, CH- was much less dependent on specific sequences at the termini of the donor DNA than was IN. These results reveal that the chromodomain in the Tf1 IN modulates both the level and specificity of integration. Plasmid Constructions and Cell Growth—The construction of pHL2468, the plasmid for the expression of the full-length Tf1 IN has been previously described (19Atwood A. Lin J.H. Levin H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IN-coding DNA segment of Tf1 was amplified by PCR. The resulting fragment was flanked with SalI sites that were introduced into the BamHI site of pET15B and sequenced. The NH2 terminus of the Tf1 IN was predicted based on the amino terminus of the IN from a closely related element, Ty3 (24Kirchner J. Sandmeyer S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of the recombinant Tf1 IN started with the sequence TDDFK- and the COOH terminus ended with the sequence -NNLNI. The resulting protein was 477 residues long and was fused at its amino terminus to a 21-residue peptide containing the His6 tag and the thrombin cleavage site. The plasmid expressing CH-, pHL2469, generated by a similar method. The CH-, coding DNA segment was amplified by PCR with the primers HL1167 and HL1168, using the Pfu Turbo thermostable DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The DNA generated was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI, cloned into the vector pET15b, and sequenced. The CH- protein had the same amino terminus as the full-length IN but ended with the sequence -RHNSE. Altogether CH- was 406 + 21 (tag) residues long. Both plasmids were introduced into the strain BL21. The bacteria were grown in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml of carbenicillin. The culture temperature was 32 °C and the cells were grown until they reached an A600 of about 0.6. Induction was performed with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for an additional period of 3 h at 32°C. The cells were harvested, and the pellets were stored at -80 °C. Purification of the Recombinant Full-length IN and CH- Proteins—All steps were performed at 4 °C, unless otherwise stated. Lysis of the Bacteria—The bacterial pellets were brought up in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. After a thorough mixing, the solutions were kept for 15 min on ice followed by the addition of more NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m. Then, the solutions were sonicated on ice, followed by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), and gentle mixing. We have found that the presence of this detergent is critical to dissociate the recombinant INs off the bacterial DNA (data not shown). The insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation for 1 h in the Beckman SW28 rotor at 26,000 rpm and the clear yellowish supernatants were subjected to affinity purification. Affinity Purification on Sepharose-Co2+ Columns—Sepharose-Co2+ columns (BD Talon, BD Biosciences) with bed volumes of 5 ml were equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and then loaded with the supernatant from the ultracentrifugation. The column was then washed twice, once with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the second with the same buffer, supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Elution was performed with the same buffer but with a final concentration of 50 mm imidazole. The fractions were all analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the peak IN protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The proteins were fully soluble after this dialysis. Heparin-Sepharose Column Purification—Five-ml heparin-Sepharose (6, Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences) columns were pre-washed with about 100 ml of the same buffer used for dialysis, and then loaded with the dialyzed protein solution. The same buffer was also used for extensive washing (about 500 ml) of the column after loading was completed. Finally, the proteins were eluted off the affinity resin with a similar buffer, supplemented with NaCl at a final concentration of 0.4 m. The recombinant INs emerged off the columns at sharp peaks with protein concentrations as high as 1.5 mg/ml. The proteins were stored at -80 °C in small aliquots. Each aliquot was thawed only once for conducting the enzymatic assays. Oligonucleotides—All oligonucleotides were gel purified. Their sequences and designations are presented in the supplemental material. Substrates Used in IN Assays—The appropriate DNA oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled. Aliquots containing 0.4 μg of each oligo were 32P end-labeled using 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 20 μl using the buffer supplied. After an incubation of 1 h at 37°C, 1 μl of 0.25 m EDTA was added to each sample and the mixtures were treated for 5 min at 95 °C to inactivate the enzyme. After adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.1 m and increasing the volume to 40 μl, the labeled DNA was annealed to three times the equimolar ratio of the appropriate non-labeled DNA. After 5 min at 95 °C, the mixtures were allowed to cool slowly to room temperature for about 2 h. The duplexes generated were then stored at -20 °C and were used after freezing and thawing for up to 1 month. Assays for IN Activities—Unless otherwise stated, assays of IN and CH- were performed in final volumes of 20 μl containing 25 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.2, 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 6.25% (v/v) of freshly prepared dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 mm MnCl2. Each reaction mixture contained between 0.2 and 1 μg of the enzymes and 1 pmol of the labeled DNA substrates. Incubations were performed for 1 h at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 0.5 mg/ml xylene cyanole FF) to each sample. The samples were then treated for 3 min at 95 °C, quickly cooled on ice and loaded on an 8 m urea, 13.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel in Tris borate/EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, the wet gels were subjected to phosphorimaging, using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 instrument. Purified recombinant HIV-1 IN (a generous gift of R. Craigie) was assayed with the specified substrates under the optimal conditions of this enzyme that differ from those suitable to the Tf1 enzymes. Reactions were performed each in 20 μl of 25 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m NaCl, and 7.5 mm MnCl2 using 0.25 μg of the purified IN. All other steps, including preparation of the substrates, incubation times, and analyses of the reaction products were performed as described for the Tf1 INs. Recombinant IN and CH- of Tf1 Have Significant Levels of Disintegration Activity—To investigate the function of the chromodomain in Tf1 IN we studied the integration activities of the full-length IN and of a truncated IN that lacked the chromodomain (CH-). Both proteins were expressed with His6 tags in bacteria and were purified to a high degree using chromatography with Co2+-agarose (Talon, BD Biosciences) followed by chromatography with heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 1). Under in vitro conditions INs can catalyze the reverse of DNA strand transfer in a reaction designated disintegration (10Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 161-204Google Scholar). This activity can be assayed using oligonucleotides that mimic a single ended insertion (25Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 26Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disintegration activity of Tf1 IN was studied first because the substrate sequence and structural requirements for this reaction are less stringent than those for the forward reactions. The model substrate designed to measure disintegration activity is shown in Fig. 2A. The 5′ end of the target DNA was labeled with 32P. The reaction results in a concerted cleavage-ligation where the donor DNA is excised and the disrupted target is repaired. This results in the production of a 63-nt product labeled with 32P at its 5′ end. Because of its size, the 63-nt product could be readily distinguished from the initial species labeled with 32P, the 20-nt substrate. Separate substrates were designed that mimicked either the U3 or U5 ends of the Tf1 LTR. The IN and CH- proteins produced substantial amounts of the 63-nt product using either the U3 or U5 substrates (Fig. 2B). We tested whether the disintegration substrates as designed for Tf1 IN could be recognized by another IN, that of HIV-1. Interestingly, HIV-1 IN is at least as active with the U3 and U5 substrates as the two Tf1 INs (Fig. 2B, right panel). This is despite the low homology between the Tf1 and HIV-1 sequences at the ends of their donor DNAs. To optimize the reaction conditions we measured the influence of NaCl, MnCl2, and MgCl2 on the activities of IN and CH- (Fig. 3). NaCl greatly inhibited the activities of both proteins and a strong preference for MnCl2 over MgCl2 was observed. The highest disintegration activity was obtained with 25 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.2, 4% polyethylene glycol 8000, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 6.25% Me2SO, and 1 mm MnCl2. Other additives, often used to enhance IN activities, such as, bovine serum albumin, spermidine, Triton X-100, or Me2SO at final concentrations above 6.25% were all found to inhibit the Tf1 INs (data not shown). Having established the assay conditions for the Tf1 IN and the CH enzymes, dose-dependent reactions were performed with increasing amounts of each protein. The quantitative data presented in Fig. 4 show that for the U3 substrate the activity of IN increased with protein content up to 275 ng, whereas no maximum was observed with the U5 substrate. The data with CH- revealed the surprising result that the CH- protein was substantially more active than the full-length IN. Although this was true for both the U3 and U5 substrates, it was with the U3 substrate that CH- exhibited the greatest increase in activity over that of IN. Recombinant IN and CH- Possess Strand Transfer Activities—Strand transfer assays are a more relevant measure of IN activities because they represent the forward reaction of integration. The strand transfer activities of IN and CH- were assayed to determine whether these proteins were capable of mediating integration. The substrates for these assays were double-stranded oligonucleotides designated to mimic either the U3 or U5 ends of Tf1. Initially, we used double-stranded oligonucleotides with blunt ends that terminated with the CA dinucleotide (Fig. 5A). The oligonucleotide with the 3′ CA was labeled at its 5′ end with 32P. Strand transfer results in the insertion of the oligonucleotides into other identical molecules and as a result oligonucleotides are created that are both bigger and smaller than their original size (Fig. 5A). We found that the conditions established for the disintegration reaction are also optimal for the strand transfer activity of the Tf1 enzymes (data not shown). Fig. 5B shows that relative to protein dose, both the IN and CH- generated oligonucleotide products longer than the original U3 and U5 substrates. The lengths of these products varied because the integration into the acceptor DNA was relatively random. However, it was apparent for both IN and CH- that with the U5 substrate there were preferred positions. Interestingly, a significant fraction of the extended products were longer than twice the size of the 24-nt substrate and products as long as 70-mers were observed. This indicates that both versions of Tf1 INs were capable of three or more integration events in which products of the first round of integration served as substrates for further integration events. To our knowledge, such multiple round integrations have not been reported for other INs. We tested whether the chromodomain played a role in strand transfer by comparing the activity of IN to CH-. To evaluate the levels of strand transfer activity we calculated the amount of the oligonucleotide species longer than 24 nt as a percentage of the total amount of the labeled oligonucleotides. Fig. 5C shows that CH- was substantially more active than IN with both the U3 and U5 ends. The elevated activity of CH- correlated well with the results of the disintegration assays. However, the difference between the strand transfer activity of CH- and IN was more pronounced than observed for disintegration. The maximal differences in activity between CH- and IN were approximately 7- and 4-fold when observed with the U3 and U5 end-derived substrates, respectively. These results indicate that the presence of the chromodomain inhibits both the disintegration and strand transfer activities of Tf1 IN. CH- and IN Possess 3′ End Processing Activity—It is currently thought that the role of the 3′ end processing activity of INs is solely to remove the 2 or 3 nucleotides 3′ of the CA that result from the position of the minus strand primer 2 or 3 nucleotides downstream of the first LTR. The primer for the minus strand of Tf1 is positioned adjacent to the LTR so it is predicted that no processing activity is required (28Levin H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Levin H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5645-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, sequences of Tf1 cDNA extracted from particles revealed the surprising result that 85% of the 3′ ends had one or more untemplated nucleotides. 4Atwood-Moore, A., Ejebe, K., and Levin, H. L. (2005) J. Virol., in press. Because these nucleotides are added to the 3′ ends after the CA dinucleotide, they are expected to block integration. We therefore speculated that Tf1 IN would have a processing activity that would remove these nucleotides to expose the CA dinucleotides and allow integration. We tested IN and CH- for the 3′ processing activity using the assay already described for the strand transfer activity. In this case, the 5′ end-labeled substrates contained nucleotides positioned 3′ to the critical CA (Fig. 6A). Processing activity would cause a reduction in length of the labeled substrate after the extra sequences are removed from the 3′ end. Processing the U5 End of the LTR—The IN and CH- enzymes were tested for processing activity using a set of substrates that mimicked the U5 end of the LTR with sequences that extended past the conserved CA. Each of the oligonucleotide pairs were designed such that processing activity that removes nucleotides 3′ of the CA would produce the same 24-nt product. The 3′ end extensions were either in the form of a single-stranded overhang (Ov) beyond the CA or they were base paired in the form of a blunt end (Bl). The sequences of the extensions were chosen based on their presence at the 3′ ends of the DNAs that were isolated in vivo from particles. For example, the most prominent sequences observed after the U3 and U5 ends were “TT” and “AT,” respectively. 4Atwood-Moore, A., Ejebe, K., and Levin, H. L. (2005) J. Virol., in press. In addition, longer stretches of “T”s were observed. As indicated by the 24-nt product, both IN and CH- exhibited processing activity that specifically removed the nucleotides 3′ of the CA (Fig. 6B). The processing activity of IN produced the 24-nt sequence as the dominant product from the substrates with “tt,” “at,” “ttt,” and “ttttt” as single-stranded extensions. In the one case of a substrate with a Bl end (“at”), IN generated the 24-nt species along with several other smaller products. These additional products are seen to a lesser extent with the other substrates and are likely because of nonspecific nuclease activity of IN. This type of nonspecific activity is observed with other INs (30Craigie R. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 613-630Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is reported that a variety of INs possess an intrinsic DNA hydrolysis or alcoholysis activity that is responsible for nonspecific nuclease activity similar to what we observed (31Skinner L.M. Sudol M. Harper A.L. Katzman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 114-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For retrovirus INs, the product of the processing activity is the only substrate suitable for strand transfer. Therefore, reactions with efficient processing activity also exhibit strand transfer. The processing activity of Tf1 IN with either the “at “ or “tt” extensions was high and strand transfer was detected (Fig. 6B). The processing activity with the 3- and 5-nucleotide extensions was less efficient and no strand transfer was observed. Thus, the IN of Tf1 was similar to INs of retroviruses in that processing was required for strand transfer. The amounts of processed products accumulated by CH- were similar to that of IN (Fig. 6B). However, CH- generated substantially more products of strand transfer than IN. The levels of these strand transfer products greater than 24 nt were quantified. The activity of CH- with all substrates was significantly higher than that of IN. For example, the activities with the tt-Ov was 57% and with at-Ov was 38% relative to that produced with the pre-processed substrate. The comparable figures for IN were 11 and 15%, respectively. Because the increase in strand transfer requires enhanced 3′ end processing, these data indicate that the 3′ end processing activity of CH- is higher than that of IN. The efficient processing of the U5 substrates suggested that the Tf1 proteins specifically recognized and removed the extensions beyond the CA dinucleotide. To test whether other sequences in the substrate were recognized, IN and CH- were assayed for activity using a substrate with the U5 sequence of HIV-1 (Fig. 6B, far right). The HIV-1 substrate was 21 nt long"

Herein, we present the solution structures and backbone dynamics of both the reduced and oxidized forms of arsenate reductase from B. subtilis. The overall structures of both forms are similar to those of bovine low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase and arsenate reductase from Staphylococcus aureus. However, several features of the tertiary structure and mobility are notably different between the reduced and oxidized forms of B. subtilis arsenate reductase, particularly in the P-loop region and the segment Cys82-Cys89. The backbone dynamics results demonstrated that the reduced form of arsenate reductase undergoes millisecond conformational changes in the functional P-loop and Cys82-Cys89, which may facilitate the formation of covalent intermediates and subsequent reduction of arsenate. In the oxidized form, Cys82-Cys89 shows motional flexibility on both picosecond-to-nanosecond and possibly millisecond time scales, which may facilitate the reduction of the oxidized enzyme by thioredoxin to regenerate the active enzyme. Overall, the internal dynamics and static structures of the enzyme provide insights into the molecular mechanism of arsenate reduction, especially the reversible conformational switch and changes in internal motions associated with the catalytic reaction.

Arsenate (As(V)) enters the cell through the phosphate transport system because of its chemical similarity to phosphate (1Silver S. Keach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6114-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Arsenic compounds are ubiquitous and abundant in nature. They are toxic to nearly all kinds of life forms and cause skin, kidney, lung, and bladder cancers in mammals (2Smith A.H. Hopenhayn-Rich C. Bates M.N. Goeden H.M. Hertz-Picciotto I. Duggan H.M.

Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As a consequence, many organisms have developed unique systems to confer arsenic resistance (4Cervantes C. Ji G. Ramirez J.L. Silver S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 355-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In bacteria, arsenic resistance is conferred by the ars operon, which contains at least three genes: arsR, arsB, and arsC (6Silver S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The ArsR protein is the arsenite (As(III))-responsive repressor of transcription; the ArsB protein is a membrane-associated arsenite efflux pump; and the ArsC protein functions as a cytoplasmic arsenate reductase that converts arsenate to arsenite (7Sato T. Kobayashi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ji G. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).The arsC gene product, arsenate reductase (ArsC), is the key enzyme in the arsenate reduction process. Several families of ArsC have been identified and characterized (10Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Mukhopadhyay R.

These studies revealed that three redox active cysteine residues (Cys10, Cys82, and Cys89) are critical for arsenate reduction. A disulfide bridge (Cys82-Cys89) is formed after a single catalytic reaction cycle, converting the enzyme into the inactive form. ArsC is subsequently regenerated by thioredoxin, which converts the enzyme into the reduced form (21Messens J. Van Molle I. Vanhaesebrouck P. Limbourg M. Van Belle K. Wahni K. Martins J.C. Loris R. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The arsC gene of the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis is located in the SKIN element in the chromosome and shares 64% identity with S. aureus ArsC (7Sato T. Kobayashi Y. J.

The conserved CX5R anion-binding motif containing Cys10, known as the P-loop, is proposed to be the arsenate-binding site (23Su X.-D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Four cysteine residues (Cys10, Cys15, Cys82, and Cys89) are conserved between the two ArsC proteins.The crystal structure of the reduced form of B. subtilis ArsC has been reported and contains four molecules (chains A-D) in an asymmetric unit (22Bennett M.S. Guan Z. Laurberg M. Su X.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13577-13582Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The segment Cys82-Val96 is missing in two chains (chains C and D) of the crystal structure, indicating a mixture of different conformations. To investigate the mechanism of arsenate reduction of B. subtilis ArsC, especially the conformational changes associated with the catalytic reaction, we have determined the solution structures of both the reduced and oxidized forms of B. subtilis ArsC by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the changes in internal dynamics associated with arsenate reduction were determined by NMR relaxation measurements. A comparison of the solution structures and backbone dynamics between the oxidized and reduced forms of B. subtilis ArsC provided further insights into the molecular mechanism of arsenate reduction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—A detailed description of the protein production and purification of reduced B. subtilis ArsC was reported previously (24Peng K. Su X.-D. Xia B. Jin C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 459-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, the B. subtilis arsC gene was cloned into the pET28a expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 pLysS(DE3). The culture was grown in LB medium; centrifuged; and resuspended in M9 minimal medium with antibiotics and 15NH4Cl in the presence and absence of [13C6]glucose for preparation of 13C/15N-labeled and 15N-labeled samples, respectively (25Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). B. subtilis ArsC was purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q) and gel filtration (Superdex 75) using an ÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The purity was determined to be >95% as judged by SDS-PAGE.NMR samples were prepared with 2 mmB. subtilis ArsC in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.85), 40 mm KCl, and 20 mm Na2SO4 in 95% H2O and 5% D2O and were argon-flushed. The reduced form of ArsC was obtained by adding excess dithiothreitol (DTT 3The abbreviations used are:DTTdithiothreitolHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation ; 25 mm). DTT titration experiments were performed to probe the DTT concentration dependence of ArsC conformations, which were monitored using a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra. The optimized molar ratio of DTT to enzyme is 5 or greater to obtain the pure reduced form of ArsC. For the preparation of the oxidized form, ArsC was first reduced by excess DTT, followed by dialysis to remove DTT, and then incubated with excess arsenate. The oxidization process of ArsC by arsenate was monitored using a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectra. ArsC purified without DTT showed an HSQC spectrum identical to that of the enzyme incubated with arsenate, demonstrating that the enzyme purified in the absence of DTT was in the oxidized form, which was used as the oxidized sample for the NMR experiments.NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker Avance 500- and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with four RF channels and triple resonance probes with pulsed field gradients. The chemical shifts were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid. A set of two-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited HSQC spectra and three-dimensional HNCA, HNCO, HNCACB, HBHA(CO)NH, CBCA(CO)NH, and (H)CC(CO)NH total correlation spectroscopy and (H)CCH COSY spectra were collected to obtain the backbone and side chain assignments (26Kay L.E.

The three-dimensional 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy (NOESY)-HSQC spectra (mixing times of 50 and 100 ms) were collected to confirm the backbone assignments and in combination with the three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (mixing times of 50 and 100 ms) to obtain distance restraints for structure calculations (31Marion D.

The three-dimensional HNHA experiment was performed to obtain dihedral angle restraints (32Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The side chain assignments were confirmed with the three-dimensional 15N-edited total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC spectrum (mixing time of 80 ms). All NMR data were processed using the program NMRPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11386) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the program NMRView (34Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). A series of hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments were performed to obtain hydrogen bond information.Structure Calculations—The structures of the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC were calculated using the program CYANA and refined by AMBER (35Güntert P.

Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from inter-proton NOEs. Dihedral angles (φ and ψ) were derived from backbone chemical shifts using TALOS (37Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar), and φ angles were confirmed by the HNHA experiment (32Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, the χ1 values were obtained based on three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC and 13C NOESY-HSQC spectra. Hydrogen bond restraints were derived from the hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments and intermediate-range NOEs in conjunction with secondary structural information. Two-hundred structures were calculated by CYANA, and the 100 lowest energy structures were used as initial structures and refined using AMBER. Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures were selected to represent the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC, respectively. The final structures were analyzed using the program packages MOLMOL and PROCHECK_NMR (38Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6469) Google Scholar, 39Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C. Spectral widths of 11,160.7 Hz for 1H and 2432.8 Hz for 15N were used. For the R1 and R2 measurements, 512 (1H) and 128 (15N) complex data points were collected with 32 transients/increment and a recycle delay of 2.5 s. The delays used for the R1 experiments were 10 (×2), 100, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2500, and 2800 ms, and those used for the R2 experiments were 8 (×2), 32, 56, 80, 104, 128, 152, 176, 200, and 240 ms. The relaxation rate constants were obtained by fitting the peak intensities to a single exponential function using the nonlinear least-squares method as described (41Fushman D. Cahill S. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The {1H}15N NOE experiments were performed in the presence and absence of a 3-s proton presaturation period prior to the 15N excitation pulse and using recycle delays of 2 and 5 s, respectively (42Markley L.J. Horsley W.J. Klein M.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1971; 55: 3604-3605Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Forty-eight transients were collected for each experiment.Accession Numbers—The chemical shift assignments of the reduced and oxidized forms of B. subtilis ArsC have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (available at www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under BMRB accession numbers 6075 and 6563. The coordinates of the corresponding structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1Z2D and 1Z2E).RESULTSCharacteristics of the Reduced and Oxidized Forms of B. subtilis ArsC—ArsC is a reductase that uses cysteine residues as electron donors. ArsC has four cysteine residues, and their redox states in both the reduced and oxidized forms of the enzyme were evaluated. Incubation of reduced ArsC with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) released ∼4.0 mol of dianionic 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid/mol of ArsC, indicating that all four cysteine residues (Cys10, Cys15, Cys82, and Cys89) were in the reduced state. In addition, the Cβ chemical shifts of these cysteine residues were ∼30 ppm, supporting the absence of disulfide bonds (43Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The reduced state of all four cysteine residues was further confirmed by the NOE contacts from the three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra (44Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 93-99Google Scholar).Incubation of oxidized ArsC with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) demonstrated that two of the four cysteine residues were in the oxidized state. We examined the Cβ chemical shifts of the cysteine residues. Cys82 and Cys89 showed Cβ chemical shifts of ∼40 ppm, suggesting the formation of a disulfide bridge (Cys82-Cys89). However, Cys10 and Cys15 showed Cβ chemical shifts of ∼30 ppm, characteristic of free cysteine residues. Formation of a Cys82-Cys89 (but not Cys10-Cys15) disulfide bridge was further confirmed by the NOE contacts from the three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra.Next, we examined the enzyme activity of ArsC in either the reduced or oxidized form. As expected, the reduced form was able to reduce arsenate to arsenite, whereas the oxidized form was catalytically inactive.Reversible Conformational Transition Coupled with Arsenate Reduction—The conformational differences between the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC were examined using two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectra. First, an HSQC spectrum of reduced ArsC without DTT was collected. The enzyme was then incubated with excess arsenate, and a series of HSQC spectra were acquired until a spectrum with a set of unique peaks corresponding to a single conformation (the oxidized form) was obtained. Fig. 1A shows an overlay of the HSQC spectra of the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC, and Fig. 1B shows the composite 1H and 15N chemical shift changes versus residue number. Significant differences in many resonance peaks between the two spectra indicate considerable conformational changes upon arsenate reduction coupled with enzyme oxidization. The largest chemical shift changes between the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC were observed in the Cys82-Val96 segment, suggesting significant structural changes in this region. This observation was further confirmed by the solution structures of both forms (see below). After addition of excess DTT, the spectrum of the oxidized form became identical to that of the reduced form. The reversible conformational transitions monitored by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy along with the catalytic reaction provide insights into the mechanism of arsenate reduction. A similar result regarding the conformational switch in S. aureus ArsC was reported previously (18Messens J. Martins J.C. Van Belle K. Brosens E. Desmyter A. De Gieter M. Wieruszeski J.M. Willem R. Wyns L. Zegers I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8506-8511Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Solution Structures of the Reduced and Oxidized Forms of B. subtilis ArsC—To fully characterize the conformational changes associated with arsenate reduction, the NMR solution structures of the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC were determined. The structures were calculated using inter-proton NOE-derived distance restraints in combination with the dihedral angle and hydrogen bond information.

All four cysteine residues (Cys10, Cys15, Cys82, and Cys89) are reduced in reduced ArsC, whereas a Cys82-Cys89 disulfide bridge is formed and the other two cysteine residues (Cys10 and Cys15) are free in oxidized ArsC.

As determined by PROCHECK_ NMR analysis, 85.5% of the residues are within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, 15.4% of the residues are in the allowed regions, and 0.1% of the residues are in the disallowed regions. For residues 3-139, the overall backbone r.m.s.d. from the mean structure is 0.31 ± 0.06 Å, and that of the regular secondary structural elements is 0.18 ± 0.03 Å.The overall folds of the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC are very similar, containing a single α/β-domain and showing a typical proteintyrosine phosphatase I-like fold (22Bennett M.S. Guan Z. Laurberg M. Su X.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13577-13582Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The reduced form of ArsC consists of seven helices (residues 16-27 (α1), 46-54 (α2), 60-62 (310 helix 1), 69-72 (α3), 83-88 (310 helix 2), 106-108 (310 helix 3), and 113-137 (α4)) and a four-stranded β-sheet (residues 4-10 (β1), 32-38 (β2), 77-80 (β3), and 97-100 (β4)), which are packed into a single α/β-domain containing a central four-stranded parallel open twisted β-sheet flanked by four α-helices (Fig. 2, A and B). For the region from Gly83 to Lys88 in the reduced form of ArsC, the amide peaks of Gly83, Asp84, and Ala85 are missing in the NMR spectra, whereas the side chain atoms are assigned, except that of Asp84. The 310 helical structure in this region was determined using a total of 15 NOE-derived distance restraints. The oxidized form retains most of the tertiary structure of the reduced form (Fig. 2, C and D), whereas significant local structural differences are observed. The Cys82-Cys89 segment forms a short 310 helix in the reduced form, but is looped out in the oxidized form. As mentioned above, a Cys82-Cys89 disulfide bridge is formed, whereas residues Cys10 and Cys12 are in the reduced state.Structural Comparison—Although the overall structures of the reduced and oxidized forms of ArsC are similar, significant differences are found. The backbone r.m.s.d. between the two forms is 2.48 Å, but is 3.29 Å for the Cys82-Val96 segment. This difference is consistent with the results from DTT titration experiments mentioned above, in which the same segment showed the largest chemical shift changes. After excluding this segment, the backbone r.m.s.d. decreases to 1.12 Å. An overlay of the Cα trace of the mean structures (energy-minimized using AMBER) is shown in Fig. 3A. In the oxidized form, Ala85 and Ala86 move 11.4 and 12.2 Å away from their positions in the reduced form, respectively. Cys89 shifts a distance of 8.5 Å toward Cys82 and forms a disulfide bridge (Cys82-Cys89) in the oxidized from. Therefore, the Cys82-Cys89 segment has a significant conformational change upon the formation of the Cys82-Cys89 disulfide bridge. This region has a helical structure in the reduced form and a coil conformation in the oxidized form, indicating that a helix-to-coil transition is coupled with the oxidization of ArsC.FIGURE 3Structural comparison.A, overlay of the Cα trace of the solution structures of the reduced (red) and oxidized (green) forms of B. subtilis ArsC; B, comparison of the local structures of the P-loop of the reduced (left) and oxidized (right) forms of ArsC; C, the Cα trace of reduced B. subtilis ArsC in solution (red) superimposed with chain A of the crystal structure (blue); D, the Cα trace of reduced B. subtilis ArsC (red) superimposed with that of bovine low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (magenta); E, the Cα trace of reduced B. subtilis ArsC (red) superimposed with that of S. aureus ArsC (cyan); F, the Cα trace of oxidized B. subtilis ArsC (green) superimposed with that of S. aureus ArsC (yellow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The P-loop region consisting of Leu9-Ser17 is important for both substrate binding and catalysis. The structures of this region are similar in both forms, and the backbone r.m.s.d. between them is 0.56 Å. However, local structural differences exist (Fig. 3B). The H-N bond of Ser14 in the P-loop has different orientations between the two forms. Moreover, the side chain of Arg108 is in the vicinity of the Cys82-Cys89 segment and is spatially close to Ala85 and Ala86 in the oxidized enzyme, resulting in shrinking of the substrate entry to the P-loop.The crystal structure of reduced ArsC has been reported (Protein Data Bank code 1JL3) and contains four chains (chains A-D) in an asymmetric unit (22Bennett M.S.

The DEs react with the exocyclic amino groups of dG and dA residues in DNA to form trans and cis ring-opened adducts (20Jerina D.M. Chadha A. Cheh A.M. Schurdak M.E. Wood A.W. Sayer J.M. Witmer C.M.

In the present study we report kinetic analyses of human pol η translesion synthesis on DNA oligomers, each of which contained a single, stereospecific N6-dA adduct (Fig. 1B) (A*) of BaP DE-2 or a corresponding adduct derived from 9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo-[a]pyrene (BaP H4E, Fig. 1A), which has the 7- and 8-hydroxyl groups of BaP DE-2 replaced by hydrogens. Although the predominant DNA adducts formed by BaP DEs are generally at dG (22Sayer J.M. Chadha A. Agarwal S.K. Yeh H.J.C. Yagi H. Jerina D.M. J. Org.

Although mammalian cell studies involving high doses of (+)-BaP DE-2 showed mostly G·C to T·A mutations in cells in culture, lower doses, which may be more reflective of environmental exposures, increased the frequency of mutations at A relative to mutations at G (23Wei S.-J.C.

The present study is consistent with a possible link between pol η bypass synthesis opposite BaP DE-2-modified dA residues, and the observed A·T to T·A transversions arising in mammalian cells administered low doses of BaP DE-2. Assays of base incorporation opposite two BaP DE-2 dA adducts using a single dNTP concentration and a fixed reaction time (26Rechkoblit O. Zhang Y. Guo D. Wang Z. Amin S. Krzeminsky J. Louneva N.

Translesion synthesis beyond the trans S adduct was also fairly efficient, whereas the trans R adduct completely blocked extension beyond the adduct site. Pol η incorporated more T than A opposite the trans S and largely A opposite the trans R adduct in a 5′-CA*A-3′ template sequence. The present, more extensive kinetic analysis using a different sequence (5′-GAT-3′) also indicated higher incorporation and extension efficiency for pol η opposite the trans S relative to the trans R adduct. However, in marked contrast to the previous results, pol η showed little discrimination among A, G, and T incorporation opposite the trans S adduct and preferentially incorporated T opposite the trans R adduct. We explored a possible relationship between the efficiency of base incorporation opposite BaP DE-dA adducts and adduct-induced changes in overall DNA structure and conformation, as reflected by altered gel electrophoretic mobility. With BaP DE-2 dG adducts, a decrease in mobility was observed when a trans S but not a trans R adduct was placed at a template-primer junction (28Rechkoblit O. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11834-11840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Retardation by the trans S BaP DE-2 dG adduct was subsequently shown to be highly sequence-dependent (29Huang X. Kolbanovskiy A. Wu X. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zhuang P. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2456-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study we measured the effect of an adduct on the electrophoretic mobility of a series of template-primers containing each of the four isomeric cis- and trans-opened R and S BaP DE-2 dA adducts as well as two structurally related BaP H4E adducts. In addition, the sequence dependence of the electrophoretic mobilities of template-primers containing each of the BaP DE-2 adducts was investigated. The stereochemistry of the dA adducts affected gel electrophoretic mobility, and lower mobility was correlated with higher rates of nucleotide incorporation opposite the adduct by pol η. However, in contrast to the observations with BaP DE-2 dG adducts, varying the nearest neighboring DNA sequence around a BaP DE-2 dA adduct at a template-primer junction had little impact on gel electrophoretic mobility.

Studies of the effect of sequence on the gel electrophoretic mobility of adducted duplexes used BaP DE-2 adducted oligomers with sequences 5′-TTXA*YAGTCTGCTCCC-3′, where the neighboring bases X and Y were varied. Characterization of these oligonucleotides is described in the supplemental material. Unmodified templates and primers were synthesized and purified by Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR. DNA Polymerase Eta Reactions—His-tagged recombinant human DNA polymerase η was produced as described (14Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase reactions contained final concentrations of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, various concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 60 mm KCl, 2.5% glycerol, 40 nm 5′-32P-labeled 12-mer primer previously annealed to 60 nm 16-mer template (by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooling), and 2 nm pol η in a 10-μl volume for incorporation assays and one of four 13-mer primers ending in each of the four DNA bases for extension assays. Reactions proceeded at 37 °C for 15 min and were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 90% aqueous formamide containing 25 mm EDTA and gel sequencing dye solution followed by heating in a boiling water bath. Kinetic Analysis of DNA Polymerization—Reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gels run at 60 watts. Nucleotide incorporation across from adducts and extension beyond them was quantitated with a Fujifilm Fluorescent Image Analyzer and Image Gauge V3.12 software. Standing start, steady state kinetic experiments were performed as described previously (21Chiapperino D. Kroth H. Kramarczuk I.H. Sayer J.M. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Jerina D.M. Cheh A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11765-11771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to quantitate the degree of misincorporation opposite the BaP DE-2-adducted dA. Michaelis-Menten Vmax/Km values were obtained from hyperbolic fits of V versus S as suggested by Creighton et al. (33Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Misincorporation efficiency, finc, was calculated by dividing the Vmax/Km for an incorrect nucleotide by the Vmax/Km for the correct T incorporation. Mispair extension efficiency, fext, was calculated by taking the Vmax/Km for dCTP extension of a mispair (X·A*, where X = G, A, or C) and dividing by the Vmax/Km for dCTP extension of the correctly paired T·A*. Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Assays—The 12-mer and 13-mer primers were annealed with adducted or non-adducted template strands and subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels in a Hoefer 660 apparatus at 0–4 °C. Bands were positioned with the imaging methods above. Gel electrophoretic mobility was calculated as Rf = distance traveled by the adducted duplex/distance traveled by the unadducted duplex. Patterns of Nucleotide Incorporation Opposite BaP DE-2 dA Adducts—The patterns of misincorporation by human pol η at BaP DE-2 dA adducts in the 16-mer/12-mer sequence described are shown semiquantitatively in Fig. 2. In the absence of adducts, pol η preferred to incorporate the correct T (virtually all the primer is extended in the T lane), whereas misincorporation of G or A exceeded misincorporation of C. When all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) were present, pol η was able to process to the end of the unadducted template. All adducts sharply reduced incorporation of the correct T but had much less effect on the various misincorporations. Trans S BaP DE-2 dA adducts gave equivalent incorporations of G, A, and the correct T, whereas trans R adducts gave less misincorporation of G and A than incorporation of T. Cis R or cis S dA adducts also induced approximately similar levels of misincorporation of A and G and correct incorporation of T. The overall levels of (mis)incorporation were highest with the trans S adduct. This adduct gave rise to the greatest enzymatic processivity when all four dNTPs were present; some full-length product was seen. (Mis)incorporation appeared to be the least efficient overall opposite the cis R adducts, and no extension beyond the adducted base was observed when either one or all four dNTPs were present. With all four stereoisomeric BaP DE-2 adducted dA templates, misincorporation of A was slightly greater than misincorporation of G, and misincorporation of C was the least efficient. Adducts with S configuration gave more (mis)incorporation and enzymatic processivity than the corresponding adducts with R configuration. Kinetic Comparisons of the Rates of Incorporation at Stereoisomeric BaP DE-2 or BaP H4E dA Adducts—Steady state kinetic data for incorporation opposite dA in the presence and absence of BaP DE-2 adducts are presented in TABLE ONE. Even in the absence of adducts, pol η was error-prone at template dA. Thus, values of finc, defined as (Vmax/Km)incorrect/(Vmax/Km)correct, ranged from 2 × 10–2 to 5 × 10–2 for the unmodified template. In the presence of BaP DE-2 adducts, values of Vmax/Km for correct incorporation of T decreased by factors of 18–160, whereas Vmax/Km values for misincorporation generally decreased less or even increased relative to the control. In consequence, finc values for base misincorporation opposite the four stereoisomeric BaP DE-2 adducts were large (from 0.1 to 3.0) when compared with those with the unadducted template.TABLE ONEMisincorporation efficiency of pol η opposite BaP DE-2 and BaP H4E-adducted dA and extension efficiency by a correct base following the (mis)pairAdduct isomerParent epoxide(Mis)pairVm/Km for (mis)incorporation of X in A*·X pairfincVm/Km for extension with correct dCTP after A*·X (mis)pairfextfinc × fext×10-6×10-6Trans R7S,8R,9R,10S DEA*·G2.1 ± 0.440.230.19 ± 0.0560.120.028A*·A3.0 ± 0.320.331.5 ± 0.200.940.31A*·T9.0 ± 2.711.6 ± 0.5211A*·C0.99 ± 0.120.110.62 ± 0.0590.390.043TR-4H9R,10S H4EA*·G0.84 ± 0.190.300.73 ± 0.090.180.05A*·A2.27 ± 0.370.824.36 ± 0.621.050.86A*·T2.78 ± 0.4814.15 ± 0.0711A*·C0.70 ± 0.190.251.50 ± 0.350.360.09Trans S7R,8S,9S,10R DEA*·G13 ± 2.11.01.1 ± 0.0350.270.27A*·A15 ± 2.91.22.9 ± 0.290.710.86A*·T13 ± 0.9714.1 ± 1.111A*·C6.0 ± 1.40.461.3 ± 0.210.320.15Cis R7R,8S,9S,10R DEA*·G1.9 ± 0.331.30.11 ± 0.0370.130.17A*·A2.5 ± 0.371.70.94 ± 0.0811.11.9A*·T1.5 ± 0.5310.85 ± 0.2511A*·C0.95 ± 0.240.630.29 ± 0.0470.340.22CR-4H9S,10R H4EA*·G0.41 ± 0.031.220.98 ± 0.200.580.71A*·A1.19 ± 0.093.51.08 ± 0.100.642.2A*·T0.34 ± 0.0511.68 ± 0.4011A*·C0.39 ± 0.061.162.48 ± 0.221.481.72Cis S7S,8R,9R,10S DEA*·G7.5 ± 0.441.81.2 ± 0.170.631.13A*·A12 ± 1.73.04.6 ± 1.52.47.2A*·T4.1 ± 0.9811.9 ± 0.5311A*·C2.4 ± 0.500.592.4 ± 0.291.30.77Unadducted controlA·G6.0 ± 1.90.02515 ± 4.00.0710.0018A·A13 ± 3.40.05419 ± 4.10.0900.0049A·T240 ± 791211 ± 5711A·C4.9 ± 0.310.0205.8 ± 1.10.0270.00056 Open table in a new tab The stereochemistry of the adduct had a substantial effect on both the rate and fidelity of base incorporation. Thus, the four isomeric BaP DE-2 dA adducts exhibited a nearly 9-fold variation in their Vmax/Km values for correct T incorporation, with a corresponding effect on the finc values. With a trans R adduct present, the Vmax/Km for incorporation of T exceeded the rate for A by 3-fold, whereas the other three adduct isomers showed an opposite selectivity such that the rate of incorporation of A exceeded that of T by up to 3-fold (with the cis S adduct). With each of the four isomeric BaP DE-2 dA adducts, Vmax/Km for G misincorporation was about 70% of the Vmax/Km for A misincorporation, and misincorporation of C was least efficient. Nucleotide incorporation opposite the trans R adduct was the least error-prone, with all values of finc for incorrect bases <1.0. Although the highest Vmax/Km for correct T incorporation was observed opposite the trans S adduct, this was accompanied by parallel increases in Vmax/Km for incorporation of the incorrect bases, such that this adduct exhibited the highest rate of incorporation of each nucleotide, correct or incorrect, but fidelity opposite this adduct was low, with finc values close to 1 for misincorporation of G or A. Cis R and cis S BaP DE-2 dA adducts exhibited similar poor fidelity (high finc). As suggested qualitatively by Fig. 2, the S adducts generally exhibited about a 5-fold greater rate of G, A, and C misincorporation compared with their R counterparts. This is true whether the comparison is between trans R versus trans S adducts and cis R versus cis S adducts, derived from enantiomeric BaP DE-2 isomers, or trans R versus cis S and cis R versus trans S adducts, derived from the same BaP DE-2 isomer. The presence of an R adduct lowered the Vmax/Km for G, A, or C misincorporation 3–5-fold compared with the unadducted template, whereas in most cases an S adduct either caused no change or a slight increase (up to 2-fold) in Vmax/Km. Nucleotide incorporation by pol η opposite two BaP H4E adducts with R configuration, which lack the 7- and 8-hydroxyl groups present in the DE adducts, is generally less efficient compared with BaP DE-2 adducts with the same absolute configuration. The reduction in rate was less for misincorporation of A than for any other nucleotide, with two consequences. The finc values for A misincorporation were higher with BaP H4E adducts than with the corresponding BaP DE-2 adducts, and the rates for A misincorporation were ∼3 times that for G with the BaP H4E adducts, in contrast to the less than 2-fold rate difference between these nucleotides observed with the DE adducts. Kinetic Comparisons of the Rates of Extension and Overall Translesion Synthesis Beyond (Mis)pairs Containing BaP DE-2 or BaP H4E dA Adducts—Kinetic data for extension of 13-mer primers with a correct or incorrect base opposite the adduct are also presented in TABLE ONE. Vmax/Km for extension beyond a correctly or incorrectly paired dA DE adduct was generally smaller than Vmax/Km for either correct or incorrect base incorporation opposite the adduct. Vmax/Km for extension beyond adduct (A*)-containing mispairs was well below Vmax/Km for mispair extension in the absence of adduct. Although for unadducted DNA mispair extension was more than 10 times less efficient than extension beyond a correct A-T base pair, extension of the adducted template-primers showed less discrimination between mispairs and correctly paired A*·T. In particular A*·A mispairs were extended with nearly equal or greater efficiency than correct A*·T pairs. A*·C mispairs were extended somewhat less efficiently, whereas A*·G mispairs were extended the least well. Extension is more efficient past BaP DE-2 adducts with S configuration compared with R adducts, in keeping with the greater processivity seen in the four dNTP lanes with S adducts compared with R adducts (Fig. 2). The Vmax/Km for extension when an S adduct was present was 2–10-fold greater than the value for the comparable R adduct, with the greatest difference in the rate of extension at R versus S adducts seen with extension of A*·G mispairs. The differences in rate between trans and cis adducts with the same absolute configuration at C-10 were small, and extension past the cis R adduct was the least efficient. With BaP H4E adducts, Vmax/Km values for extension ranged from equal to severalfold greater than the corresponding Vmax/Km values for incorporation, the opposite of what was seen with BaP DE-2 adducts. Whereas rates for either correct or incorrect nucleotide incorporation opposite BaP H4E adducts were lower than for the comparable reactions opposite BaP DE-2 adducts, 13-mer primers with A and T across from BaP H4E trans R adducts gave extension rates equal to the highest rates of extension seen with BaP DE-2 adducts. With the trans R BaP H4E adduct, Vmax/Km values for extension were equal to or higher than those for incorporation regardless of which nucleotide was extended, yielding fext values similar to finc. With the cis R BaP H4E adduct, Vmax/Km for extension was highest when a pyrimidine (C or T) was opposite the adduct, in contrast to the greater efficiency of A incorporation opposite this adduct.
