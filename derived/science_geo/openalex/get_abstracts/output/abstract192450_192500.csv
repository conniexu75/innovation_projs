This type of elution with a continuously changing solvent appeared to be of special value for separations of metal ions in butanol containing hydrochloric acid, as the R F values change considerably from low to high acid concentrations."

Experiments have shown that, for the rat on a rachitogenic ration, the bone ash response to a fixed dose of vitamin D is depressed by increasing doses of a green-feed extract in the manner indicated in Table 1."

Guha, has actually suggested that the term ‘Veddoid’ or ‘Veddian’ should be replaced by the word ‘Proto-Australoid’1. Whether the Veddoid element is equally strong in all Australian aboriginals is not certain. Birdsell2divides the Australian aboriginals into three groups; that in the Northern Territories is considered to have more Veddoid connexions than the other two, which are more intimately related to Negritos and Europoid Ainus respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1992804238,"MANY workers have found that the multiplication of viruses occurs in definite cycles, each involving several stages, namely, adsorption and entry to host cell, a loss of part or all of the infectivity, a ‘lag’ phase during which no new infective virus can be demonstrated, a period of intracellular rise in infectivity, and finally release of this virus followed by invasion of a fresh population of susceptible cells. We have studied the intracellular multiplication of ectromelia virus in mouse liver, using intravenous inoculation and assaying the infective titre of the liver at intervals. We have found that over a range of inocula from 106 to 1010 LD50 about 30 per cent of the inoculum is adsorbed to the liver in five minutes. Inocula of 109 LD50 infect practically all the liver cells within five minutes, as measured by a histological method1."

In hill sheep, where the environment constitutes the limiting factor to production, a study of the milking capacity of the ewe would seem to be of special interest, as it forms a large part of the lamb's environment at a most important period of growth."

Recently, doubt has been cast on their lack of specificity. I consider that (complete) auto-agglutinins might consist of multiple specific components1–3. Recently, Crawford, Cutbush and Mollison4 have shown that incomplete cold auto-agglutinins present in all human sera have the specificity anti-H. The degree of sensitization of cells of various groups by these antibodies could be arranged in the following descending order, O—A
2—B—A
1—A
1
B. Such reactions correspond to the relative amounts of H present in these various cells, O cells containing the most H and A
1
B cells the least. Further the action of incomplete cold auto-antibodies was inhibited by H substance, and their reactions closely agreed with those of an eel anti-H serum. Absorption of the antibodies in the cold by cells of various groups revealed that if A
1
B cells are used the amount of antibody absorbed is inappreciable, whereas if O cells are used ability to sensitize group O cells or cells of groups A
1 and A
2 was completely abolished. These workers consider that the specificity of other non-specific antibodies needs to be re-examined. Davidsohn and Oyamada5 have shown that the warm auto-agglutinins associated with haemolytic anaemias are predominantly specific for the individual's own cells. Weiner et al.
6 have demonstrated that such an auto-agglutinin had the specificity anti-e."

https://openalex.org/W2086964968,"DURING a study of the inhibitory action of cocaine on cellular respiration, we found that the oxidations of added pyruvate by brain homogenate and by the respiring yeast, Torulopsis utilis, were inhibited to a similar degree, a 0.002-M concentration of the drug causing an inhibition of about 50 per cent in each case. It had previously been shown, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that the inhibition of fermentation by cocaine could also be attributed to the blocking of pyruvate metabolism, carboxylase being inhibited1,2."
