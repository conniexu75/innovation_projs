Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most fatal cancers, and its molecular basis needs to be delineated to identify biomarkers for its potential treatment without resection. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the metabolism status of HCC by evaluating the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and glutamine transporter ASCT2. We enrolled 192 patients with surgically resected HCC in this study. Their tissue samples were subjected to immunohistochemistry to detect GLUT1 and ASCT2 expression. The prognostic value of GLUT1 and ASCT2 expression and their combined metabolic index was determined by Kaplan–Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model. We found that GLUT1 and ASCT2 expression was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues as compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and was positively associated with tumor size. Survival analysis revealed that patients with high GLUT1 or ASCT2 expression had poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). In HCC patients, ASCT2 expression was an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.760; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.124−2.755; p = 0.013) and the metabolic index was an independent negative prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.672, 95% CI = 1.275−2.193, p < 0.001) and RFS (HR = 1.362, 95% CI = 1.066−1.740, p = 0.013). In conclusion, the tumor metabolism status determined by expression of GLUT1 and ASCT2 and their metabolic index is a promising prognostic predictor for HCC patients."

The aim of the present work was to study the effects of ad libitum milk replacer (MR) feeding on the growth, metabolic adaptation, health, and immune status of newborn calves. Twenty-eight newborn Holstein and Holstein x Charolais crossbred calves were fed ad libitum (ADLIB) or in restricted amounts (6 liters per day; RES) during the first five weeks of life. The MR intake in the ADLIB treatment was gradually reduced at weeks 6 and 7, and all calves then received 6 liters of MR per day until day 60. Blood samples were collected to measure the plasma concentrations of metabolites, insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), immunoglobulins, and acute phase proteins. The expression of mRNA associated with both the somatotropic axis and gluconeogenic enzymes was measured in the liver on day 60. Intensive feeding improved MR intake and growth in ADLIB without influencing concentrate intake. Carcass weight, perirenal fat, and muscle mass were greater in ADLIB. Plasma concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and IGF-I were greater, whereas plasma concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate, total protein, albumin, urea, IGFBP-2 and -4, and fibrinogen were lower at distinct time points in ADLIB. The hepatic mRNA expression of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was greater in ADLIB. Most metabolic and endocrine differences occurred during the MR feeding period, but a slightly greater concentrate intake was associated with increased plasma IGF-I and insulin at the end of the study. The immune and health status of the calves were not affected by MR feeding. However, increased plasma fibrinogen in the RES group suggested differences in the acute phase response."
https://openalex.org/W2569242943,"Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shigella flexneri are well-known food-borne pathogens causing severe food poisoning at low infectious doses. Bacteriophages have been approved for food applications by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been suggested as natural food preservatives to control specific food-borne pathogens. To develop a novel natural food preservative against E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri, a new bacteriophage needs to be isolated and characterized.Bacteriophage HY01 infecting both E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri was isolated from a swine fecal sample. HY01 belongs to the family Myoviridae and is stable under various temperature and pH conditions. One-step growth curve analysis showed relatively short eclipse and latent periods as well as large burst size. The 167-kb genome sequence of HY01 was sequenced, and a comparative genome analysis with T4 for non-O157:H7 E. coli suggests that the receptor recognition protein of HY01 plays an important role in determination of host recognition and specificity. In addition, food applications using edible cabbage were conducted with two E. coli O157:H7 strains (ATCC 43890 and ATCC 43895), showing that treatment with HY01 inhibits these clinical and food isolates with >2 log reductions in bacterial load during the first 2 h of incubation.HY01 can inhibit both E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri with large burst size and stability under stress conditions. The ability of HY01 to infect both E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri may be derived from the presence of two different host specificity-associated tail genes in the genome. Food applications revealed the specific ability of HY01 to inhibit both pathogens in food, suggesting its potential as a novel biocontrol agent or novel natural food preservative against E. coli O157:H7 and potentially S. flexneri."
https://openalex.org/W2568347586,"The crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci (COTS) has contributed greatly to declines in coral cover on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, and remains one of the major acute disturbances on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Despite uncertainty about the underlying causes of outbreaks and the management responses that might address them, few studies have critically and directly compared competing hypotheses. This study uses qualitative modelling to compare hypotheses relating to outbreak initiation, explicitly considering the potential role of positive feedbacks, elevated nutrients, and removal of starfish predators by fishing. When nutrients and fishing are considered in isolation, the models indicate that a range of alternative hypotheses are capable of explaining outbreak initiation with similar levels of certainty. The models also suggest that outbreaks may be caused by multiple factors operating simultaneously, rather than by single proximal causes. As the complexity and realism of the models increased, the certainty of outcomes decreased, but key areas that require further research to improve the structure of the models were identified. Nutrient additions were likely to result in outbreaks only when COTS larvae alone benefitted from nutrients. Similarly, the effects of fishing on the decline of corals depended on the complexity of interactions among several categories of fishes. Our work suggests that management approaches which seek to be robust to model structure uncertainty should allow for multiple potential causes of outbreaks. Monitoring programs can provide tests of alternative potential causes of outbreaks if they specifically monitor all key taxa at reefs that are exposed to appropriate combinations of potential causal factors."
https://openalex.org/W2570856291,"Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment is the leading factor in angiogenesis. Angiogenesis can be identified by dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI (DCE MRI). Here we investigate the relationship between perfusion parameters on DCE MRI and angiogenic and prognostic factors in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Perfusion parameters (Ktrans, kep and ve) of 81 IDC were obtained using histogram analysis. Twenty-fifth, 50th and 75th percentile values were calculated and were analyzed for association with microvessel density (MVD), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and conventional prognostic factors. Correlation between MVD and ve50 was positive (r = 0.33). Ktrans50 was higher in tumors larger than 2 cm than in tumors smaller than 2 cm. In multivariate analysis, Ktrans50 was affected by tumor size and MVD with 12.8% explanation. There was significant association between Ktrans50 and tumor size and MVD. Therefore we conclude that DCE MRI perfusion parameters are potential imaging biomarkers for prediction of tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2568562949,"Hypoxia has been shown to be a key factor inhibiting the successful treatment of solid tumours. Existing strategies for reducing hypoxia, however, have shown limited efficacy and/or adverse side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for reducing tumour hypoxia using an orally delivered suspension of surfactant-stabilised oxygen nanobubbles. Experiments were carried out in a mouse xenograft tumour model for human pancreatic cancer (BxPc-3 cells in male SCID mice). A single dose of 100 μL of oxygen saturated water, oxygen nanobubbles or argon nanobubbles was administered via gavage. Animals were sacrificed 30 minutes post-treatment (3 per group) and expression of hypoxia-inducible-factor-1α (HIF1α) protein measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis of the excised tumour tissue. Neither the oxygen saturated water nor argon nanobubbles produced a statistically significant change in HIF1α expression at the transcriptional level. In contrast, a reduction of 75% and 25% in the transcriptional and translational expression of HIF1α respectively (p<0.001) was found for the animals receiving the oxygen nanobubbles. This magnitude of reduction has been shown in previous studies to be commensurate with an improvement in outcome with both radiation and drug-based treatments. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in this group and corresponding increase in the expression of arrest-defective protein 1 homolog A (ARD1A)."
https://openalex.org/W2568281025,"The food- and airborne fungal genus Wallemia comprises seven xerophilic and halophilic species: W. sebi, W. mellicola, W. canadensis, W. tropicalis, W. muriae, W. hederae and W. ichthyophaga. All listed species are adapted to low water activity and can contaminate food preserved with high amounts of salt or sugar. In relation to food safety, the effect of high salt and sugar concentrations on the production of secondary metabolites by this toxigenic fungus was investigated. The secondary metabolite profiles of 30 strains of the listed species were examined using general growth media, known to support the production of secondary metabolites, supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl, glucose and MgCl2. In more than two hundred extracts approximately one hundred different compounds were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). Although the genome data analysis of W. mellicola (previously W. sebi sensu lato) and W. ichthyophaga revealed a low number of secondary metabolites clusters, a substantial number of secondary metabolites were detected at different conditions. Machine learning analysis of the obtained dataset showed that NaCl has higher influence on the production of secondary metabolites than other tested solutes. Mass spectrometric analysis of selected extracts revealed that NaCl in the medium affects the production of some compounds with substantial biological activities (wallimidione, walleminol, walleminone, UCA 1064-A and UCA 1064-B). In particular an increase in NaCl concentration from 5% to 15% in the growth media increased the production of the toxic metabolites wallimidione, walleminol and walleminone."
https://openalex.org/W2570194574,"The genus Brucella comprises various species of both veterinary and human medical importance. All species are genetically highly related to each other, sharing intra-species average nucleotide identities (ANI) of > 99%. Infections occur among various warm-blooded animal species, marine mammals, and humans. Until recently, amphibians had not been recognized as a host for Brucella. In this study, however, we show that novel Brucella species are distributed among exotic frogs worldwide. Comparative recA gene analysis of 36 frog isolates from various continents and different frog species revealed an unexpected high genetic diversity, not observed among classical Brucella species. In phylogenetic reconstructions the isolates consequently formed various clusters and grouped together with atypical more distantly related brucellae, like B. inopinata, strain BO2, and Australian isolates from rodents, some of which were isolated as human pathogens. Of one frog isolate (10RB9215) the genome sequence was determined. Comparative genome analysis of this isolate and the classical Brucella species revealed additional genetic material, absent from classical Brucella species but present in Ochrobactrum, the closest genetic neighbor of Brucella, and in other soil associated genera of the Alphaproteobacteria. The presence of gene clusters encoding for additional metabolic functions, flanked by tRNAs and mobile genetic elements, as well as by bacteriophages is suggestive for a different ecology compared to classical Brucella species. Furthermore it suggests that amphibian isolates may represent a link between free living soil saprophytes and the pathogenic Brucella with a preferred intracellular habitat. We therefore assume that brucellae from frogs have a reservoir in soil and, in contrast to classical brucellae, undergo extensive horizontal gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2569851255,"Mathematical modelling approaches have granted a significant contribution to life sciences and beyond to understand experimental results. However, incomplete and inadequate assessments in parameter estimation practices hamper the parameter reliability, and consequently the insights that ultimately could arise from a mathematical model. To keep the diligent works in modelling biological systems from being mistrusted, potential sources of error must be acknowledged. Employing a popular mathematical model in viral infection research, existing means and practices in parameter estimation are exemplified. Numerical results show that poor experimental data is a main source that can lead to erroneous parameter estimates despite the use of innovative parameter estimation algorithms. Arbitrary choices of initial conditions as well as data asynchrony distort the parameter estimates but are often overlooked in modelling studies. This work stresses the existence of several sources of error buried in reports of modelling biological systems, voicing the need for assessing the sources of error, consolidating efforts in solving the immediate difficulties, and possibly reconsidering the use of mathematical modelling to quantify experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2568710328,"Prolongation of the heart rate corrected QT (QTc) interval is a sensitive marker of torsade de pointes risk; however it is not specific as QTc prolonging drugs that block inward currents are often not associated with torsade. Recent work demonstrated that separate analysis of the heart rate corrected J-Tpeakc (J-Tpeakc) and Tpeak-Tend intervals can identify QTc prolonging drugs with inward current block and is being proposed as a part of a new cardiac safety paradigm for new drugs (the ""CiPA"" initiative).In this work, we describe an automated measurement methodology for assessment of the J-Tpeakc and Tpeak-Tend intervals using the vector magnitude lead. The automated measurement methodology was developed using data from one clinical trial and was evaluated using independent data from a second clinical trial.Comparison between the automated and the prior semi-automated measurements shows that the automated algorithm reproduces the semi-automated measurements with a mean difference of single-deltas <1 ms and no difference in intra-time point variability (p for all > 0.39). In addition, the time-profile of the baseline and placebo-adjusted changes are within 1 ms for 63% of the time-points (86% within 2 ms). Importantly, the automated results lead to the same conclusions about the electrophysiological mechanisms of the studied drugs.We have developed an automated algorithm for assessment of J-Tpeakc and Tpeak-Tend intervals that can be applied in clinical drug trials. Under the CiPA initiative this ECG assessment would determine if there are unexpected ion channel effects in humans compared to preclinical studies. The algorithm is being released as open-source software.NCT02308748 and NCT01873950."
https://openalex.org/W2564388338,"Sertoli cells play a significant role in regulating fetal testis compartmentalization to generate testis cords and interstitium during development. The Sertoli cell Wilms' tumor 1 (Wt1) gene, which encodes ~24 zinc finger-containing transcription factors, is known to play a crucial role in fetal testis cord assembly and maintenance. However, whether Wt1 regulates fetal testis compartmentalization by modulating the development of peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) and/or fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) remains unknown. Using a Wt1-/flox; Amh-Cre mouse model by deleting Wt1 in Sertoli cells (Wt1SC-cKO) at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), Wt1 was found to regulate PMC and FLC development. Wt1 deletion in fetal testis Sertoli cells caused aberrant differentiation and proliferation of PMCs, FLCs and interstitial progenitor cells from embryo to newborn, leading to abnormal fetal testis interstitial development. Specifically, the expression of PMC marker genes α-Sma, Myh11 and Des, and interstitial progenitor cell marker gene Vcam1 were down-regulated, whereas FLC marker genes StAR, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1 and Hsd3b1 were up-regulated, in neonatal Wt1SC-cKO testes. The ratio of PMC:FLC were also reduced in Wt1SC-cKO testes, concomitant with a down-regulation of Notch signaling molecules Jag 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, and Hes1 in neonatal Wt1SC-cKO testes, illustrating changes in the differentiation status of FLC from their interstitial progenitor cells during fetal testis development. In summary, Wt1 regulates the development of FLC and interstitial progenitor cell lineages through Notch signaling, and it also plays a role in PMC development. Collectively, these effects confer fetal testis compartmentalization."
https://openalex.org/W2568323503,"The main goal of the present work is to test the hypothesis that small-scale turbulence affected physiological activities and the morphology of cyanobacteria in high turbulence environments. Using quantified turbulence in a stirring device, we conducted one set of experiments on cultures of two strains of cyanobacteria with different phenotypes; i.e., unicellular Microcystis flos-aquae and colonial Anabaena flos-aquae. The effect of small-scale turbulence examined varied from 0 to 8.01×10−2 m2s-3, covering the range of turbulence intensities experienced by cyanobacteria in the field. The results of photosynthesis activity and the cellular chlorophyll a in both strains did not change significantly among the turbulence levels, indicating that the potential indirect effects of a light regime under the gradient of turbulent mixing could be ignored. However, the experiments demonstrated that small-scale turbulence significantly modulated algal nutrient uptake and growth in comparison to the stagnant control. Cellular N and C of the two stains showed approximately the same responses, resulting in a similar pattern of C/N ratios. Moreover, the change in the phosphate uptake rate was similar to that of growth in two strains, which implied that growth characteristic responses to turbulence may be dependent on the P strategy, which was correlated with accumulation of polyphosphate. Additionally, our results also showed the filament length of A. flos-aquae decreased in response to high turbulence, which could favor enhancement of the nutrient uptake. These findings suggested that both M. flos-aquae and A. flos-aquae adjust their growth rates in response to turbulence levels in the ways of asynchronous cellular stoichiometry of C, N, and P, especially the phosphorus strategy, to improve the nutrient application efficiency. The fact that adaptation strategies of cyanobacteria diversely to turbulence depending on their physiological conditions presents a good example to understand the direct cause—effect relationship between hydrodynamic forces and algae."
https://openalex.org/W2570352644,"Background Drugs that prolong the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) by blocking the hERG potassium channel and also block inward currents (late sodium or L-type calcium) are not associated with torsade de pointes (e.g. ranolazine and verapamil). Thus, identifying ECG signs of late sodium current block could aid in the determination of proarrhythmic risk for new drugs. A new cardiac safety paradigm for drug development (the “CiPA” initiative) will involve the preclinical assessment of multiple human cardiac ion channels and ECG biomarkers are needed to determine if there are unexpected ion channel effects in humans. Methods and Results In this study we assess the ability of eight ECG morphology biomarkers to detect late sodium current block in the presence of QTc prolongation by analyzing a clinical trial where a selective hERG potassium channel blocker (dofetilide) was administered alone and then in combination with two late sodium current blockers (lidocaine and mexiletine). We demonstrate that late sodium current block has the greatest effect on the heart-rate corrected J-Tpeak interval (J-Tpeakc), followed by QTc and then T-wave flatness. Furthermore, J-Tpeakc is the only biomarker that improves detection of the presence of late sodium current block compared to using QTc alone (AUC: 0.83 vs. 0.72 respectively, p<0.001). Conclusions Analysis of the J-Tpeakc interval can differentiate drug-induced multichannel block involving the late sodium current from selective hERG potassium channel block. Future methodologies assessing drug effects on cardiac ion channel currents on the ECG should use J-Tpeakc to detect the presence of late sodium current block.

https://openalex.org/W2565494516,"The human MutT homolog 1 (hMTH1, human NUDT1) hydrolyzes oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates and is the main enzyme responsible for nucleotide sanitization. hMTH1 recently has received attention as an anticancer target because hMTH1 blockade leads to accumulation of oxidized nucleotides in the cell, resulting in mutations and death of cancer cells. Unlike Escherichia coli MutT, which shows high substrate specificity for 8-oxoguanine nucleotides, hMTH1 has broad substrate specificity for oxidized nucleotides, including 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP. However, the reason for this broad substrate specificity remains unclear. Here, we determined crystal structures of hMTH1 in complex with 8-oxo-dGTP or 2-oxo-dATP at neutral pH. These structures based on high quality data showed that the base moieties of two substrates are located on the similar but not the same position in the substrate binding pocket and adopt a different hydrogen-bonding pattern, and both triphosphate moieties bind to the hMTH1 Nudix motif (i.e. the hydrolase motif) similarly and align for the hydrolysis reaction. We also performed kinetic assays on the substrate-binding Asp-120 mutants (D120N and D120A), and determined their crystal structures in complex with the substrates. Analyses of bond lengths with high-resolution X-ray data and the relationship between the structure and enzymatic activity revealed that hMTH1 recognizes the different oxidized nucleotides via an exchange of the protonation state at two neighboring aspartate residues (Asp-119 and Asp-120) in its substrate binding pocket. To our knowledge, this mechanism of broad substrate recognition by enzymes has not been reported previously and may have relevance for anticancer drug development strategies targeting hMTH1.

DNA is exposed to oxidative stress either directly or via oxidation of its precursor dNTP in the nucleotide pool. Among the various types of oxidized dNTPs, 8-oxo-dGTP is the major oxidized mutagenic nucleotide because it is efficiently inserted opposite adenine as well as cytosine on the template by DNA polymerases (1Maki H. Sekiguchi M. MutT protein specifically hydrolyses a potent mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis.Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar).

Nevertheless, the role of hMTH1 in cancer cells and usefulness of hMTH1 inhibition remain unclear (22Kettle J.G. Alwan H. Bista M. Breed J. Davies N.L. Eckersley K. Fillery S. Foote K.M. Goodwin L.

Chem. 2016; 59: 2346-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). hMTH1 is characterized by broad substrate specificity as compared with Escherichia coli MutT; that is, hMTH1 hydrolyzes different oxidized nucleotides such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 2-oxo-dATP, and 8-oxo-dATP with almost the same efficiency (23Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. The oxidized forms of dATP are substrates for the human MutT homologue, the hMTH1 protein.J. Biol.

Human MTH1 protein hydrolyzes the oxidized ribonucleotide, 2-hydroxy-ATP.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), whereas MutT shows high substrate specificity for 8-oxoguanine nucleotides. 2-Oxo-dATP is also known to be a mutagenic substrate just as 8-oxo-dGTP because the misincorporation of 2-oxo-dATP into DNA induces G:C to T:A transversion mutations (25Inoue M. Kamiya H. Fujikawa K. Ootsuyama Y. Murata-Kamiya N. Osaki T. Yasumoto K. Kasai H.

Accordingly, hMTH1 prevents mutations and cell dysfunction by its hydrolytic activity toward both 2-oxo-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP. This is the reason why MutT cannot completely reverse the cytotoxicity of either TH287 or TH588, the new hMTH1 inhibitors designed as anticancer drugs (16Gad H. Koolmeister T. Jemth A.-S. Eshtad S.

Thus, the mechanisms of substrate recognition by and binding of inhibitors to hMTH1 are of biological interest and important for effective drug development. There remain some questions regarding how hMTH1 can discriminate oxidized bases from normal bases, and moreover, can recognize different types of oxidized nucleotides in the same substrate binding pocket. Although the previous structural and mutational studies on hMTH1 have revealed its scheme of recognition of 8-oxo-dGTP and the significant contribution of the neighboring aspartate residues (Asp-119 and Asp-120) (26Sakai Y.

Here, we report the crystal structures of hMTH1 at neutral pH in complex with the major substrates, 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP, at 1.21- and 1.20-Å resolution, respectively, using our hMTH1(G2K) mutant (it contains a homogeneous N terminus), which produces a new crystal form while retaining the hydrolytic activity (32Koga Y. Inazato M. Nakamura T. Hashikawa C. Chirifu M. Michi A. Yamashita T. Toma S. Kuniyasu A. Ikemizu S. Nakabeppu Y. Yamagata Y.

These crystal structures showed clear electron densities of the ligands, including the triphosphate moiety that bind to the Nudix motif (hydrolase motif) and align for the hydrolysis reaction. Furthermore, the protonation state of the neighboring aspartate residues (Asp-119 and Asp-120) in the substrate binding pocket was found to be different for the recognition of 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP, according to the bond length analysis of the aspartate residues using high-resolution X-ray data, and also the kinetic and structural analysis of the Asp-120 mutants. Finally, we illustrated how this unique mechanism results in the broad substrate specificity of hMTH1. To understand the catalytic mechanism of hMTH1 including the protonation state of the Asp residues (Asp-119 and Asp-120) in the substrate recognition mode and the binding mode of the triphosphate moiety in the Nudix motif with the Glu cluster, we determined the crystal structures of binary complexes of hMTH1(G2K) with 8-oxo-dGTP or 2-oxo-dATP at neutral pH. We previously reported that hMTH1(G2K) (it has a homogeneous N terminus) shows a new crystal form with high diffraction quality (1.2 Å) at neutral pH. In addition, the catalytic activity of hMTH1(G2K) toward 8-oxo-dGTP is almost identical to that of the wild type (32Koga Y. Inazato M. Nakamura T. Hashikawa C. Chirifu M. Michi A. Yamashita T. Toma S. Kuniyasu A. Ikemizu S. Nakabeppu Y. Yamagata Y. Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of human MTH1 with a homogeneous N-terminus.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2013; 69: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Hereafter, hMTH1(G2K) is referred to as hMTH1 or the wild type for simplicity. In the crystals of the hMTH1 complexes, there are two molecules per asymmetric unit. The overall structures of the two molecules in each complex are similar except for some residues of L-A and L-E in the 8-oxo-dGTP complex (root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) 5The abbreviations used are: r.m.s. deviationroot mean square deviationhMTH1human MutT homolog 18-oxoG8-oxoguanine2-oxoA2-oxoadenineNudixnucleoside diphosphate linked to some other moiety, X. is 0.62 Å for the corresponding 146 Cα atoms in the 8-oxo-dGTP complex, and 0.61 Å for the corresponding 146 Cα atoms in the 2-oxo-dATP complex). In the following text, we focus on one molecule in the asymmetric unit that has clearer electron densities of the ligands. hMTH1 adopts an α-β-α sandwich structure composed of two α-helices (α-1 and α-2) and eight β-strands (β-1 to β-8). The Nudix motif (23 residues from Gly-37 to Leu-59) is located at the center of the molecule and adopts a strand-loop-helix-loop structure that is formed by β-3′, L-B, α-1, and L-C. 8-Oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP bind to the same substrate binding pocket adjacent to the catalytic Nudix motif, which consists of β-1, β-3, β-3′, β-4, β-5, and α-2, and is surrounded by L-A (Fig. 1A). The overall structures of the 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP complexes are similar except for the conformational difference of L-A and L-E with r.m.s. deviation of 0.34 Å for the corresponding 146 Cα atoms (Fig. 1B). In the 2-oxo-dATP complex, the electron densities of L-A are weak as compared with those in the 8-oxo-dGTP complex. root mean square deviation human MutT homolog 1 8-oxoguanine 2-oxoadenine nucleoside diphosphate linked to some other moiety, X. hMTH1 recognizes 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP with the anti-conformation about the glycosidic bond in the substrate binding pocket. Despite the difference in pH, the recognition of the 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) base of 8-oxo-dGTP is quite similar to that observed in the previously reported structures of complexes with 8-oxo-dGMP or 8-oxo-dGTP (Fig. 2A) (29Svensson L.M. Jemth A.-S. Desroses M. Loseva O. Helleday T. Högbom M. Stenmark P.

MTH1 substrate recognition: an example of specific promiscuity.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 (e0151154): e0151154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar): Asp-120 and Asn-33 form two hydrogen bonds (all distances 2.9 Å), and Asp-119 forms a single hydrogen bond (distance 2.5 Å) with 8-oxoG, respectively. In the three crystals, all distances of the corresponding hydrogen bonds are identical (differ by less than 0.1 Å). In the 2-oxo-dATP complex, on the other hand, 2-oxoadenine (2-oxoA) is recognized with a different hydrogen bonding pattern from that around 8-oxoG: the 2-oxoA base is recognized via two hydrogen bonds with Asp-119 and a single hydrogen bond with Asn-33 and Asp-120, respectively (Fig. 2B). The O2 atom of 2-oxoA, which is the characteristic feature of 2-oxoA, is recognized via a single hydrogen bond with Asp-120 (distance 2.6 Å). In addition, Asp-119 forms two hydrogen bonds with N1 and N6 (both distances 2.8 Å) of 2-oxoA. The side chain of Asn-33 shows two conformations, but the major conformation forms a single hydrogen bond (distance 3.0 Å) with N3 of the base. Accordingly, the position of 2-oxoA is shifted toward Asp-119 by the two hydrogen bonds with Asp-119 as compared with the position of 8-oxoG in the 8-oxo-dGTP complex where Asp-119 forms a single hydrogen bond with 8-oxoG (Fig. 2C). The geometries of key hydrogen bonds are summarized in supplemental Table S1. These different recognition modes of hMTH1 for 8-oxoG and 2-oxoA seem to be consistent with the previously published mutational results showing that the substitution of alanine or asparagine for Asp-119 abrogates the 2-oxo-dATPase activity but preserves the 8-oxo-dGTPase activity (26Sakai Y. Furuichi M. Takahashi M. Mishima M. Iwai S. Shirakawa M. Nakabeppu Y. A molecular basis for the selective recognition of 2-hydroxy-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP by human MTH1.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8579-8587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Trp-117 is also involved in the recognition of 2-oxoA with a π-π stacking interaction as in 8-oxoG. These results are consistent with the absence of 8-oxo-dGTPase and 2-oxo-dATPase activities in the W117A mutant, but it is not easy to explain why the W117Y mutant retains only 2-oxo-dATPase activity (26Sakai Y. Furuichi M. Takahashi M. Mishima M. Iwai S. Shirakawa M. Nakabeppu Y. A molecular basis for the selective recognition of 2-hydroxy-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP by human MTH1.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8579-8587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is a slight difference between the positions of 8-oxoG and 2-oxoA (Fig. 2C), which may indicate that some short contacts occur only during the recognition of 8-oxo-dGTP by the W117Y mutant. In the 8-oxo-dGTP complex, Phe-27 contributes to the affinity for 8-oxoG via the interaction with the O8 atom of 8-oxoG (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, Phe-27 in the 2-oxo-dATP complex is far away from the 2-oxoA base, and the electron densities of L-A including Phe-27 are less obvious than those in the 8-oxo-dGTP complex, i.e. L-A in the 2-oxo-dATP complex is more flexible. This result is consistent with the mutational analysis showing that the F27A mutation affects Km for 8-oxo-dGTP more than that for 2-oxo-dATP (26Sakai Y. Furuichi M. Takahashi M. Mishima M. Iwai S.

The anti-glycosidic conformation observed in the crystals is preferred by G rather than by 8-oxoG nucleotides (ΔΔG ≈ 1.4 kcal/mol) (8Nakamura T. Meshitsuka S. Kitagawa S. Abe N. Yamada J. Ishino T.

In contrast, E. coli MutT exhibits high substrate specificity for 8-oxoG nucleotides. The structural basis has been reported by Nakamura et al. (8Nakamura T. Meshitsuka S. Kitagawa S. Abe N.

MutT binds to 8-oxoG nucleotides with the large ligand-induced conformational change, and strictly recognizes the overall conformation of 8-oxoG nucleotides with the syn-glycosidic conformation through a number of hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds between the pyrimidine moiety and the main chain atoms of Phe-35 discriminate the guanine base from the other normal and 2-oxoA bases and the hydrogen bonds between O6 and N7 of 8-oxoG and the amide group of Asn-119 do the 8-oxoG base from the guanine base. During the binding of the triphosphate moiety of 8-oxo-dGTP, Pα-O is recognized via a single hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys-23. The β- and γ-phosphates of 8-oxo-dGTP bind to the Nudix motif through Na+ ions with unambiguous electron densities in our crystals at neutral pH (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3, A and B), whereas the 8-oxo-dGTP complex at pH 4.0 shows weak electron densities of the triphosphate moiety (unpublished structure) (31Nakamura T.

Compared with leaf blast resistance, our understanding of panicle blast resistance is limited. The japonica landrace Jiangnanwan from Taihu Lake region in China shows highly resistance to panicle and leaf blast. In this study, three generations (F2:5, F2:6, F2:7) consisting of 221 RILs (recombination inbreeding lines), developed from the cross of Jiangnanwan and Suyunuo, a susceptible-blast japonica variety, were evaluated for panicle blast resistance in the fields and leaf blast resistance in greenhouse in Nanjing in 2013, 2014 and 2015. A blast resistance gene Pi-jnw1 referring to panicle blast resistance and leaf blast resistance was identified in the three generations and located in the region of RM27273 and RM27381 in chromosome 11. The RIL18 line harboring Pi-jnw1 was selected to be backcrossed with Suyunuo to develop BC2F2 populations. According to the genotyping of 1,150 BC2F2 individuals and panicle blast and leaf blast resistance evaluation of 47 recombinants between RM27150 and RM27381, Pi-jnw1 was finally mapped to the 282 kb region between markers W28 and BS39.

However, the molecular mechanisms that enable STAT5 to access the promoters of these genes are not well understood. Here, we show that PRL signaling induces chromatin decompaction at promoter DNA, corresponding with STAT5 binding.

Knockdown of H1 rescues the decrease in PRL-induced transcription following HMGN2 knockdown, and it does so by allowing increased STAT5 recruitment. Moreover, H1 and STAT5 are shown to function antagonistically in regulating PRL-induced transcription as well as breast cancer cell biology. While reduced STAT5 activation results in decreased PRL-induced transcription and cell proliferation, knockdown of H1 rescues both of these effects.

Single intramuscular dose of G-003M injected 60 min prior to 9 Gy exposure rescued 89% of whole body lethally irradiated C57BL/6J mice.

Restricted nuclear translocation of redox-sensitive Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and subsequent downregulation of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; EC 1.14.13.39) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) levels demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect that G-003M exerts. Support to early hematopoietic recovery was exhibited through G-003M mediated induction of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin (IL-6) levels in lethally irradiated mice. Considerable attenuation in radiation induced morphological damage to the intestinal villi, crypts and mucosal layers was observed in G-003M pre-treated mice. Additionally, our formulation did not reduce the sensitivity of tumor tissue to radiation. Altogether, these results suggest that G-003M ameliorates the deleterious effects of radiation exposure by minimising ROS and NO generation and effectively regulating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Mechanism of protection elucidated in the current study demonstrates that G-003M can be used as a safe and effective radio protective agent in radiotherapy for human application."
https://openalex.org/W2569744102,"Background The recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals call for the end of poverty and the equitable provision of healthcare. These goals are often at odds, however: health seeking can lead to catastrophic spending, an outcome for which cancer patients and the poor in resource-limited settings are at particularly high risk. How various health policies affect the additional aims of financial wellbeing and equity is poorly understood. This paper evaluates the health, financial, and equity impacts of governmental and charitable policies for surgical oncology in a resource-limited setting. Methods Three charitable platforms for surgical oncology delivery in Uganda were compared to six governmental policies aimed at improving healthcare access. An extended cost-effectiveness analysis using an agent-based simulation model examined the numbers of lives saved, catastrophic expenditure averted, impoverishment averted, costs, and the distribution of benefits across the wealth spectrum. Findings Of the nine policies and platforms evaluated, two were able to provide simultaneous health and financial benefits efficiently and equitably: mobile surgical units and governmental policies that simultaneously address surgical scaleup, the cost of surgery, and the cost of transportation. Policies that only remove user fees are dominated, as is the commonly employed short-term “surgical mission trip”. These results are robust to scenario and sensitivity analyses. Interpretation The most common platforms for increasing access to surgical care appear unable to provide health and financial risk protection equitably. On the other hand, mobile surgical units, to date an underutilized delivery platform, are able to deliver surgical oncology in a manner that meets sustainable development goals by improving health, financial solvency, and equity. These platforms compare favorably with policies that holistically address surgical delivery and should be considered as countries strengthen health systems."

The overall incidence (per 1,000 live births) of invasive GBS disease was 2.59 (95% CI: 2.42-2.77), including 1.41 (95% CI: 1.28-1.55) for EOD and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.06-1.30) in infants 7-89 days age (late-onset disease). Year-on-year, from 2005 to 2014, we observed a 9.4% increase in incidence of serotype Ia invasive disease (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04-1.15; p<0.001), and a 7.4% decline in serotype III invasive disease (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.90-0.96; p<0.001). Overall, serotypes Ia (28.2%), III (55.4%) and V (7.9%) were the commonest disease causing serotypes.The incidence of invasive GBS disease has remained persistently high in our setting, with some changes in serotype distribution, albeit mainly involving the same group of dominant serotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2569112049,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed for many biomedical applications as in vivo imaging and drug delivery in cancer treatment, but their toxicity is an ongoing concern. When NPs are intravenously administered, the endothelium represents the first barrier to tissue diffusion/penetration. However, there is little information about the biological effects of NPs on endothelial cells. In this work we showed that cobalt-ferrite (CoFe2O4) NPs affect endothelial cell integrity by increasing permeability, oxidative stress, inflammatory profile and by inducing cytoskeletal modifications. To overcome these problems, NPs have be loaded into biocompatible gels to form nanocomposite hybrid material (polysaccharide hydrogels containing magnetic NPs) that can be further conjugated with anticancer drugs to allow their release close to the target. The organic part of hybrid biomaterials is a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) polymer, while the inorganic part consists of CoFe2O4 NPs coated with (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane. The biological activity of these hybrid hydrogels was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Our findings showed that hybrid hydrogels, instead of NPs alone, were not toxic on endothelial, stromal and epithelial cells, safe and biodegradable in vivo. In conclusion, biohydrogels with paramagnetic NPs as cross-linkers can be further exploited for antitumor drug loading and delivery systems."
https://openalex.org/W2570947466,"Background Since Spartina alterniflora (simplified as Spartina) has strong ecological competitiveness and rapid growth, it has been introduced and living in the coastal wetland regions of China for more than 30 years. Taking coastal wetland in the Beibu Gulf of south China as an example, the effects of Spartina invasion on soil quality were investigated to provide scientific basis for soil management. Methodology The soil quality of six different coastal wetlands, i.e. mangrove (vegetation coverage is above 95%), mangrove- Spartina ecotones (vegetation coverage is above 95%), sparse mangrove (vegetation coverage is 10%-20%), sparse mangrove- Spartina ecotones (vegetation coverage is about 80%), Spartina (vegetation coverage is about 80%) and bare beach (no plants), were analyzed using the following indicators: pH, cation exchange capacity, contents of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, microbial carbon / organic carbon, and activities of urease, acid phosphatase, invertase, polyphenol oxidase and catalase. Principal Findings The results showed that compared to mangrove wetland, most indicators in the mangrove-Spartina wetland showed a decline tendency except pH value, and the contents of total phosphorus and organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and soil microbial biomass nitrogen, and the activities of acid phosphatase and invertase were significantly reduced (P<0.05). Compared to sparse mangrove wetland and bare beach, the Spartina invasion wetland (sparse mangrove-Spartina wetland and Spartina wetland) had higher contents of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, cation exchange capacity and the activities of urease and acid phosphatase, so soil quality in the sparse mangrove wetland and bare beach was significantly improved. Factor Analysis and PCA also showed that: the quality of mangrove wetland soil is better than that of mangrove-Spartina ecotones wetland soil; the quality of sparse mangrove-Spartina ecotones wetland soil is better than that of sparse mangrove wetland soil; the quality of Spartina wetland soil is better than that of bare beach wetland soil. Conclusions/Significance Therefore, in the invaded Beibu Gulf wetland ecosystems of south China, for the mangrove wetlands where the productivity of native plant was higher than that of Spartina, the Spartina invasion can cause soil degradation significantly and it must be strictly controlled, while for sparse mangrove wetland and bare beach where the productivity of native plant was lower than that of Spartina, Spartina invasion can improve the soil quality. Thus our study may help to better understand the effect of plant invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2569979776,"Nowadays, Wolfiporia extensa as a popular raw material in food and medicine industry has received increasing interests. Due to supply shortage, this species of edible and medicinal mushroom has been cultivated in some provinces of China. In the present study, cultivated W. extensa collected from six regions in Yunnan Province of China were analyzed by an integrated method based on Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and ultra-fast liquid chromatography (UFLC) coupled with multivariate analysis including partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) in order to investigate the differences and similarities in different origins and parts. In the tested mushroom samples, characteristic FT-IR spectra were obtained for acquiring comprehensive fuzz chemical information and pachymic acid was determinated as a biomarker in the meantime. From the results, the comparison of samples was achieved successfully according to their geographical regions and different parts. All the samples displayed regional dependence and the inner parts showed better quality consistency. In addition, the chemical constituents of cultivated W. extensa could be also affected by the cultivation methods. Meanwhile, there was an interesting finding that the soil properties of cultivation regions may have a relationship with the chemical constituents of the epidermis of soil-cultured W. extensa, rather than the inner parts. Collectively, it demonstrated that the present study could provide comprehensive chemical evidence for the critical complement of quality evaluation on the cultivated W. extensa. Moreover, it may be available for the further researches of complicated mushrooms in practice."
https://openalex.org/W2570118167,"Bearing failure is one of the dominant causes of failure and breakdowns in rotating machinery, leading to huge economic loss. Aiming at the nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics of bearing vibration signals as well as the complexity of condition-indicating information distribution in the signals, a novel rolling element bearing fault diagnosis method based on multifractal theory and gray relation theory was proposed in the paper. Firstly, a generalized multifractal dimension algorithm was developed to extract the characteristic vectors of fault features from the bearing vibration signals, which can offer more meaningful and distinguishing information reflecting different bearing health status in comparison with conventional single fractal dimension. After feature extraction by multifractal dimensions, an adaptive gray relation algorithm was applied to implement an automated bearing fault pattern recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed method can identify various bearing fault types as well as severities effectively and accurately."
https://openalex.org/W2570978573,"The establishment of good experimental models for Theileria sp. infection is important for theileriosis research. Routinely, infection of ticks is accomplished by feeding on parasite-infected animals (sheep, cows and horses), which raises practical and ethical problems, driving the search for alternative methods of tick infection. Artificial tick feeding systems are based mainly on rearing ticks on host-derived or hand-made artificial membranes. We developed a modified feeding assay for infecting nymphal stages of Hyalomma anatolicum ticks with Theileria lestoquardi, a highly pathogenic parasite of sheep. We compared two different membranes: an artificial silicone membrane and a natural alternative using mouse skin. We observed high attachment rates with mouse skin, whereas in vitro feeding of H. anatolicum nymphs on silicone membranes was unsuccessful. We could infect H. anatolicum nymphs with T. lestoquardi and the emerging adult ticks transmitted infective parasites to sheep. In contrast, similar infections with Rhipicephalus bursa, a representative tick with short mouth-parts that was proposed as a vector for T. lestoquardi, appeared not to be a competent vector tick species. This is the first report of an experimentally controlled infection of H. anatolicum with T. lestoquardi and opens avenues to explore tick-parasite dynamics in detail."

Despite development of improved treatments, these conditions are associated with high economic costs and drug resistance. Bevacizumab (Avastin®), a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is used clinically to treat certain types of metastatic cancers. Unfortunately, many patients do not respond or inevitably become resistant to bevacizumab, highlighting the need for more effective antiangiogenic drugs with novel mechanisms of action.

Q8 inhibits developmental angiogenesis in Tg(fli1:EGFP) zebrafish and inhibits human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC-1) proliferation, tubule formation, and migration. Q8 elicits antiangiogenic effects in a VEGF-independent in vitro model of angiogenesis and exerts an additive antiangiogenic response with the anti-VEGF biologic bevacizumab. Cell-based receptor binding assays confirm that Q8 is a CysLT1 antagonist and is sufficient to reduce cellular levels of NF-κB and calpain-2 and secreted levels of the proangiogenic proteins intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion protein-1, and VEGF. Distinct reductions of VEGF by bevacizumab explain the additive antiangiogenic effects observed in combination with Q8. In summary, Q8 is a more effective antiangiogenic drug compared with quininib.

Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance of pro- and antiangiogenic factors and arises from a stepwise process wherein endothelial cells dissociate from pericyte cells and their basement membrane, moving toward the target tissue requiring vascularization (6.Carmeliet P.

The clinical efficacy of bevacizumab is only apparent in combination with chemotherapy as it can stabilize leaky tumor vessels, enhancing delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor. There is an unmet clinical need for the development of more effective treatments that have the ability to inhibit alternative regulators of angiogenesis, overcoming treatment resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. New drug discovery is impeded by the small number of novel and validated disease targets (21.Kotz, J., (2012) Phenotypic screening, take two. Science-Business eXchange 10.1038/scibx.2012.380Google Scholar). Target-based drug discovery focuses on specific known protein targets and overlooks the possible importance of less well functionally understood proteins that may be involved in disease mechanism. Hence, phenotype-based drug screening is re-emerging as an effective means of moving beyond well understood targets to discover novel drug targets and understand the physiology and pathophysiology of disease (21.Kotz, J., (2012) Phenotypic screening, take two.

CysLT receptors are aberrantly expressed in tumors; enhanced expression of CysLT1 in colorectal cancer negatively correlates with patient survival (27.Magnusson C. Mezhybovska M. Lörinc E.

Collectively, this reveals an important biological role for CysLT signaling during neovascular disease and an alternative therapeutic target. Here, 24 structurally distinct analogues of quininib were ranked. Analogues Q22 (IUPAC name 2-quinolin-2-yl-ylethynylphenol), Q18 (IUPAC name (Z)-2-(2-(quinolin-2-yl)vinyl)phenol HCl), and Q8 (IUPAC name (E)-2-(2-quinolin-2-yl-vinyl)-benzene-1,4-diol HCl) were significantly more effective than quininib at inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo with Q8 being the most potent analogue. Q8 inhibits human endothelial cell tubule formation and migration. Ligand binding assays confirm that Q8 is also a CysLT1 antagonist. Further to what we previously reported regarding the mechanism of action of quininib (22.Reynolds A.L. Alvarez Y. Sasore T. Waghorne N. Butler C.T. Kilty C. Smith A.J. McVicar C. Wong V.H. Galvin O.

Release. 2016; 233: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to identify novel chemical entities with more potent antiangiogenic effects in vivo using the zebrafish intersegmental vessel assay. Preliminary analyses of 37 structural quininib analogues identified drugs that robustly inhibited developmental angiogenesis in larval zebrafish eyes (29.Kennedy, B. N., Reynolds, A., Kilty, C., O'Sullivan, J., and Baxter, A. D., (January 23, 2014) Anti-angiogenic Compounds. Patent WO 2014012889 A1Google Scholar). In these analogues, the position of the phenyl ring hydroxy group and/or the linkage between the quinoline and phenyl ring was modified (Fig. 1A). Initially, we ranked the bioactivity of 24 salt or amine analogue formulations by comparing the ability of a 10 μm concentration of the drugs to inhibit developmental angiogenesis in the intersegmental vessel (ISV) assay using Tg(fli1:EGFP) zebrafish (Fig. 1, B and C). Twelve analogue formulations produced a statistically significant inhibition of developmental angiogenesis compared with control (Fig. 1C). Of these, one analogue, Q22, produced antiangiogenic activity equivalent to quininib, and two analogues, Q8 and Q18, produced a greater antiangiogenic activity compared with quininib at 10 μm (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). Q22 includes an alkyne linkage between the quinoline and phenyl ring, whereas Q18 is the Z-enantiomer of quininib. Notably, Q7 (IUPAC name (E)-2-(2-quinolin-2-yl-vinyl)-benzene-1,4-diol) in amine and hydrochloride salt forms (Q8) was toxic to larvae at 10 μm. Q7 and Q8 include two hydroxy groups in the phenyl ring at positions R1 and R4. Quininib, Q18, Q22, and Q8 were rescreened in the ISV assay at concentrations increasing from 0.1 to 10 μm (Fig. 1, D and E). All novel analogues tested resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of ISV development. Interestingly, only Q8 and Q18 were significantly bioactive at 1 μm, reducing ISV development compared with control by 75 and 30%, respectively (Fig. 1E). Q8 reduced ISV development more potently than any other analogue tested and was the only analogue significantly active at 0.5 μm, inhibiting developmental angiogenesis by 12.4%. All analogues produced varying degrees of pericardial edema at 2 days postfertilization (dpf). No other adverse morphological defects were detected following treatment with the analogues at 2 dpf (Fig. 1D). In summary, using an analogue ranking system based on maximum inhibition of ISV development and potency, Q8 was identified as the most effective quininib analogue (Table 1).TABLE 1Analogue ISV dose response and ranking based on efficacy, potency, and toxicityCompoundIUPAC nameEfficacy scorePotency scoreToxicity scoreTotal scoreRankQ8(E)-2-(2-Quinolin-2-yl-vinyl)-benzene-1,4-diol HCl salt454131aHighest ranking compound in ISV assay based on efficacy and potency scoring system.Q18(Z)-2-(2-(Quinolin-2-yl)vinyl)phenol HCl salt444122Q222-Quinolin-2-yl-ylethynylphenol HCl salt434113Q12-[(E)-2-(Quinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenol334104a Highest ranking compound in ISV assay based on efficacy and potency scoring system. Open table in a new tab Quininib and the highest ranking analogues were tested for effects on cell number in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) following 24-, 72-, and 96-h treatment (Fig. 2A). 10 μm quininib and analogues had no effect on HMEC-1 cell number compared with control at 24 h. However, at 72 h, 5-fluorouracil, Q8, and Q18 significantly reduced endothelial cell number compared with vehicle control (p > 0.001). After 96 h of treatment, all compounds reduced cell number significantly compared with 0.1% DMSO control. Using a CIM plate 16 xCELLigence® RTCA platform (Roche Applied Science), the migratory behavior of drug-treated HMEC-1 endothelial cells was quantified over 8 h (Fig. 2A). All analogues except Q1 significantly inhibited HMEC-1 endothelial cell migration with Q8 producing the most significant effect, inhibiting endothelial migration by ∼79% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). We also investigated whether a combination of either 1 or 3 μm Q8 with bevacizumab had additive effects on HMEC-1 endothelial cell migration (Fig. 2C). Compared with control, treatments with 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab, 1 or 3 μm Q8, or 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab in combination with 1 μm Q8 did not significantly reduce HMEC-1 migration. However, 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab in combination with 3 μm Q8 significantly reduced migration compared with control (p < 0.046) and with 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab (p < 0.039) but not with 3 μm Q8 alone (p < 0.2615). As observed with previous migration analyses, 10 μm Q8 induced the most statistically significant reduction of HMEC-1 cell migration compared with control (p < 0.002). In summary, Q8 and Q18 significantly reduced HMEC-1 endothelial cell number at 72 and 96 h, whereas Q1 and Q22 showed significant reductions in cell number at 96 h only. Analogues of quininib, particularly Q8, impede endothelial cell migration, a surrogate measure of angiogenesis. Previous studies demonstrated that 10 μm Q1 had modest effects on endothelial tubule formation in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (23.Murphy A.G. Casey R. Maguire A. Tosetto M. Butler C.T. Conroy E. Reynolds A.L. Sheahan K. O'Donoghue D. Gallagher W.M. Fennelly D. Kennedy B.N. O'Sullivan J. Preclinical validation of the small molecule drug quininib as a novel therapeutic for colorectal cancer.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 34523Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we tested the dose-dependent effects of Q1 and its analogues (Q8, Q18, and Q22) on HMEC-1 tubule formation using μ-Slide angiogenesis plates (ibidi GmbH). Q1 significantly inhibited tubule formation at 3 and 10 μm but not at 1 μm (Fig. 3A). Following 16-h treatment, Q8 and Q18 were significantly more effective than quininib at inhibiting HMEC-1 tubule formation at all concentrations tested (1–10 μm) (p < 0.01). Q8 and Q18 were the most effective compounds, inhibiting tubule formation at 10 μm by ∼98 and 78%, respectively (p < 0.05). Potential cytotoxic effects of analogue Q8 were ruled out by co-staining HMEC-1 endothelial cell tubules with calcein and propidium iodide (PI) following 16-h exposure (Fig. 3C). No concentrations of Q8 tested (0.1–20 μm) induced any significant endothelial cell death as shown by a lack of PI staining (red) compared with cells treated with 10 μm sunitinib, which stained positively for PI (Fig. 3C). In addition, calcein (green) was taken up by the cells treated with all concentrations of Q8, indicating that HMEC-1 cells are viable following 16-h treatment with the Q8 analogue. We investigated the effects of the clinically used VEGF-neutralizing antibody bevacizumab on tubule formation by incubating HMEC-1 cells with varying concentrations of bevacizumab ranging from 2.5 to 10 μg/μl, all of which had no effect on tubule formation compared with control or IgG isotype control (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, higher concentrations of bevacizumab (5 and 10 μg/μl) did not significantly affect HMEC-1 tubule formation (data not shown). The addition of 10 ng/ml recombinant VEGF increased endothelial cell tubule formation by ∼20% compared with control (p = 0.0082). Following addition of both 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab and 10 ng/ml VEGF, tubule formation was significantly decreased by ∼45% compared with 10 ng/ml VEGF alone (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4, A and B). We conclude that our HMEC-1 in vitro tubule formation assays are not dependent on basal VEGF, but exogenous VEGF is sufficient to induce enhanced tubule formation. We examined the effects on tubule formation when treating cells with quininib or Q8 in the presence of exogenous VEGF. Interestingly, ectopic VEGF could suppress the antiangiogenic effects of quininib drugs but not the anti-VEGF biologic, supporting distinct mechanisms of action of these antiangiogenic drugs. In the presence of exogenous VEGF, quininib or Q8 produced a more modest inhibition of tubule formation compared with treatment with either drug alone (Fig. 4, C and D). In summary, the quininib small molecule drugs are efficacious at inhibiting a VEGF-independent model of in vitro angiogenesis. The VEGF-independent antiangiogenic action of these drugs is further supported by a lowered antiangiogenic activity in the presence of recombinant VEGF. The distinct mechanisms of action inferred above led us to investigate the in vitro antiangiogenic effects of our lead small molecule drug Q8 in combination with bevacizumab. HMEC-1 endothelial cells were treated with a combination of either 3 μm Q1 and 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab or 1 μm Q8 and 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab (Fig. 5, A and B). Concentrations of Q1 (3 μm) and Q8 (1 μm) producing equivalent (p = 0.1163) (∼45–65%) intermediate responses were selected for the combination study (Fig. 3A). As bevacizumab requires the presence of exogenous VEGF to bring about an antiangiogenic effect (Fig. 4A), combination treatment groups were supplemented with 10 ng/ml recombinant VEGF. Compared with either Q8 or bevacizumab treatment alone, treatment of HMEC-1 cells with the combination of Q8 and bevacizumab induced an additive significant reduction in tubule formation (p = 0.0174) (Fig. 5, A and B). This additive effect was observed with Q8 and not with Q1 (Fig. 5, A and B). There was no statistically significant difference in tubule formation observed between Q8-alone and bevacizumab-alone treatment groups. In addition, an isotype control that consisted of a combination of 1 μm Q8 and 2.5 μg/μl IgG did not alter tubule formation compared with Q8 or bevacizumab alone. However, compared with the isotype control combination treatment, 1 μm Q8 and 2.5 μg/μl bevacizumab combination treatment significantly reduced tubule formation, signifying the specificity of bevacizumab in the antiangiogenic combination effect. In conclusion, specific, enhanced antiangiogenic effects are demonstrated following treatment of human endothelial cells with a combination of both Q8 and an anti-VEGF biologic, bevacizumab. The CysLT1 receptor was previously identified as a quininib target (22.Reynolds A.L. Alvarez Y. Sasore T. Waghorne N. Butler C.T. Kilty C. Smith A.J. McVicar C. Wong V.H. Galvin O. Merrigan S. Osman J. Grebnev G. Sjölander A. Stitt A.W. et al.Phenotype-based discovery of 2-[(E)-2-(quinolin-2-yl)vinyl]phenol as a novel regulator of ocular angiogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 7242-7255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we determined the IC50 of Q8 for CysLT1 receptor to be 4.9 μm in a CHO cell-based receptor antagonism assay. The highest concentration of Q8 tested (50 μm) inhibited CysLT1 activation by 113% (Fig. 6A). In contrast, Q8 produced only a 22.9% antagonism of CysLT2 receptor activation in HEK-293 cells. Thus, Q8 was excluded as a CysLT2 antagonist as inhibition lower than 50% is considered insignificant. In relation to VEGF receptors, above"
https://openalex.org/W2569474152,"The compound fuling granule (CFG) is a traditional Chinese drug which has been used to treat ovarian cancer in China for over twenty years. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer effect remains unclear. In this study, microarray data analysis was performed to search differentially expressed genes in CFG-treated ovarian cancer cells. Several cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related genes were identified. The microarray analyses also revealed that CFG potentially regulates EMT in ovarian cancer. We also found that, functionally, CFG significantly suppresses ovarian cancer cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence and the AKT/GSK-3β pathway is possibly involved. Additionally, the invasion and migration ability of ovarian cancer induced by TGFβ is significantly suppressed by CFG. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that CFG suppresses ovarian cancer cell proliferation as well as TGFβ1-induced EMT in vitro. Finally, we discovered that CFG suppresses tumor growth and distant metastasis in vivo. Overall, these findings provide helpful clues to design novel clinical treatments against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2568346330,"Analyzing variations in silicon (Si) isotopes can help elucidate the biogeochemical Si cycle and Si accumulation processes of higher plants. Importantly, the composition of Si isotopes in higher plants has yet to be studied comprehensively and our knowledge of the distribution of Si isotopes in higher plants lags behind that of Si isotopes in marine organisms, such as diatoms. In the present study, we investigated the isotope fractionation that occurs during the uptake and transport of Si in rice, using a series of hydroponic experiments with different external concentrations of Si. We found that an active mechanism was responsible for the majority of Si uptake and transport at lower Si levels and that the uptake of Si by rice roots was significantly suppressed by both low temperature and metabolic inhibitors. In addition, light Si isotopes (28Si) entered roots more readily than heavy Si isotopes (30Si) when the active mechanism was inhibited. Therefore, we conclude that biologically mediated isotope fractionation occurs during the uptake of Si by rice roots. In addition, both active and passive Si uptake components co-exist in rice, and the fractionation effect is enhanced when more Si is absorbed by plants."

Noninvasive estimation of interstitial fibrosis and vascular lesions is currently not available. The aim of the study was to determine whether phosphocalcic markers are associated with, and can predict, renal chronic histological changes. We included 129 kidney allograft recipients with an available transplant biopsy in a retrospective study. We analyzed the associations and predictive values of phosphocalcic markers and serum calcification propensity (T50) for chronic histological changes (interstitial fibrosis and vascular lesions). PTH, T50 and vitamin D levels were independently associated to interstitial fibrosis. PTH elevation was associated with increasing interstitial fibrosis severity (r = 0.29, p = 0.001), while T50 and vitamin D were protective (r = -0.20, p = 0.025 and r = -0.23, p = 0.009 respectively). On the contrary, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and Klotho correlated only modestly with interstitial fibrosis (p = 0.045) whereas calcium and phosphate did not. PTH, vitamin D and T50 were predictors of extensive fibrosis (AUC: 0.73, 0.72 and 0.68 respectively), but did not add to renal function prediction. PTH, FGF23 and T50 were modestly predictive of low fibrosis (AUC: 0.63, 0.63 and 0.61) but did not add to renal function prediction. T50 decreased with increasing arterial lesions (r = -0.21, p = 0.038). The discriminative performance of T50 in predicting significant vascular lesions was modest (AUC 0.61). In summary, we demonstrated that PTH, vitamin D and T50 are associated to interstitial fibrosis and vascular lesions in kidney allograft recipients independently of renal function. Despite these associations, mineral metabolism indices do not show superiority or additive value to fibrosis prediction by eGFR and proteinuria in kidney allograft recipients, except for vascular lesions where T50 could be of relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2569374942,"The single–strand–specific S1 nuclease from Aspergillus oryzae is an archetypal enzyme of the S1–P1 family of nucleases with a widespread use for biochemical analyses of nucleic acids. We present the first X–ray structure of this nuclease along with a thorough analysis of the reaction and inhibition mechanisms and of its properties responsible for identification and binding of ligands. Seven structures of S1 nuclease, six of which are complexes with products and inhibitors, and characterization of catalytic properties of a wild type and mutants reveal unknown attributes of the S1–P1 family. The active site can bind phosphate, nucleosides, and nucleotides in several distinguished ways. The nucleoside binding site accepts bases in two binding modes–shallow and deep. It can also undergo remodeling and so adapt to different ligands. The amino acid residue Asp65 is critical for activity while Asn154 secures interaction with the sugar moiety, and Lys68 is involved in interactions with the phosphate and sugar moieties of ligands. An additional nucleobase binding site was identified on the surface, which explains the absence of the Tyr site known from P1 nuclease. For the first time ternary complexes with ligands enable modeling of ssDNA binding in the active site cleft. Interpretation of the results in the context of the whole S1–P1 nuclease family significantly broadens our knowledge regarding ligand interaction modes and the strategies of adjustment of the enzyme surface and binding sites to achieve particular specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2570648142,"One of the main issues in kidney transplantation is the optimal functional preservation of the organ until its transplantation into the appropriate recipient. Despite intensive efforts, the functional preservation period remains limited to hours. During this time, as a result of cellular injury, various proteins, peptides, and other molecules are released by the organ into the preservation medium. In this study, we used proteomic techniques to analyze the protein profiles of preservation solutions in which organs had been preserved prior to their transplantation. Samples were obtained from the preservation solutions of 25 deceased donor kidneys scheduled for transplantation. The protein profiles of the solutions were analyzed using 2D gel electrophoresis/MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS. We identified and quantified 206 proteins and peptides belonging to 139 different groups. Of these, 111 proteins groups were belonging to kidney tissues. This study used proteomic techniques to analyze the protein profiles of organ preservation solutions. These findings will contribute to the development of improved preservation solutions to effectively protect organs for transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2568528223,"For the critical engine parts such as the crankshaft, the fatigue limit load is one of the most important parameters involved the design and manufacture stage. In previous engineering applications, this parameter has always been obtained by experiment, which is expensive and time-consuming. This paper, based on the theory of critical distance (TCD), first analyzes the stress distribution of a crankshaft under its limit load. In this way, the length of the critical distance can be obtained. Then a certain load is applied to a new crankshaft made of the same material and the effective stress is calculated based on the critical distance above. Finally, the fatigue limit load of the new crankshaft can be obtained by comparing the effective stress and the fatigue limit of the material. Comparison between the prediction and the corresponding experimental data shows that the traditional TCD may result in bigger errors on some occasions, while the modified TCD proposed in this paper can provide a more satisfactory result in terms of the fatigue limit for a quick engineering prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2570669099,"The median age of cervical cancer (CC) presentation coincides with the mean age of menopause presentation (49 years) in Mexico. Here, we investigated the association between different HPV16 variants and early (≤ 49 years) or delayed (≥ 50 years) CC presentation. We conducted a case-case study that included 462 CCs, 386 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 63 adenocarcinomas (ACC), and 13 additional cell types. Variants were identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. The risk conferred by each variant for developing CC earlier than 50 years was analyzed using a univariate logistic regression model considering old-aged patients (≥ 50 years) and non-HPV16 cases as the reference variables. Overall, the frequency of HPV16 was 50.9%, and the only identified variants were the European A1/2 (31.2%) and the Asian-American D2 (10.8%), and D3 (8.9%). D2 was mainly associated with ≤ 49-year-old patients (15.9%); A1/2 was uniformly distributed between the two age groups (~31%), whereas D3 increased with age to a frequency of 11.8% in the older group. Only the D2 variant conferred a 3.3-fold increase in the risk of developing CC before 50 years of age (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.7-6.6, p < 0.001) in relation with non-HPV16 cases. Remarkably, this risk was higher for ACC (OR = 6.0, 95% CI = 1.1-33, p < 0.05) than for SCC (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.3-5.9, p < 0.01). Interestingly, when analyzing only the HPV16-positive CC, D2 increases (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.2-5, p < 0.05) and D3 decreases (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.2-0.9, p < 0.05) the risk to develop CC before 50 years old in relation with A1/2 variant. These results indicated that D2 variant is associated with early and D3 with delayed CC presentation, whereas A1/2 variant was uniformly distributed between the two age groups."
https://openalex.org/W2570371570,"Dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are richly innervated by GABAergic neurons. The postsynaptic effects of GABA on SNc DA neurons are mediated by a mixture of GABAA and GABAB receptors. Although activation of GABAA receptors inhibits spike generation, the consequences of GABAB receptor activation are less well characterized. To help fill this gap, perforated patch recordings were made from young adult mouse SNc DA neurons. Sustained stimulation of GABAB receptors hyperpolarized SNc DA neurons, as previously described. However, transient stimulation of GABAB receptors by optical uncaging of GABA did not; rather, it reduced the opening of small-conductance, calcium-activated K+ (SK) channels and increased the irregularity of spiking. This modulation was attributable to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A. Thus, because suppression of SK channel activity increases the probability of burst spiking, transient co-activation of GABAA and GABAB receptors could promote a pause-burst pattern of spiking."
https://openalex.org/W2531731622,"In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), abnormal sub retinal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major cause of blindness. FR-sema3C is a point mutated form of semaphorin-3C that is resistant to cleavage by furin like pro-protein convertases (FPPC). We have found in previous work that FR-sema3C functions as an anti-angiogenic factor. In this study we investigated the possible use of FR-sema3C as an inhibitor of CNV. FR-sema3C inhibits VEGF as well as PDGF-BB signal transduction in endothelial cells and to less extent bFGF induced signal transduction using a mechanism that does not depend upon the binding of VEGF like the drugs that are currently the mainstay treatment for AMD. CNV was induced in eyes of C57 black mice by laser photocoagulation. Intravitreal injection of FR-Sema3C or aflibercept (VEGF-trap) was then used to inhibit CNV formation. Invading choroidal vessels were visualized a week later by injection of FITC-dextran into the circulation, followed by the measurement of the area of the invading blood vessels. Injection of 0.1 μg FR-Sema3C inhibited CNV by 55% (P<0.01) and was as effective as 5 μg aflibercept. FR-sema3C did not display any adverse effects on retinal function following its injection into eyes of healthy mice as assessed by optokinetic reflex (OKR) and Electro-retinogram (ERG) criteria. Furthermore, FR-sema3C did not induce apoptosis in the retina as determined by TUNEL nor was there any discernable structural damage to the retina as assessed by several immuno-histochemical criteria. Our results suggest that FR-sema3C could perhaps be used for the treatment of AMD, and that it may perhaps be of benefit to patients that do not respond well to current treatments relying on VEGF sequestering agents."
https://openalex.org/W2564575117,"The parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, causative agent of human intestinal schistosomiasis in South America, relies importantly on the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata as intermediate host to achieve development of cercariae that infect humans. The recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) to integrate snail control in efforts to counter schistosomiasis transmission provides impetus for in depth study of B. glabrata biology. Our analysis indicates that two distinct hemocyanin-like genes (hcl-1 and hcl-2) are present in B. glabrata, a snail that uses hemoglobin for oxygen transport. Characterization of BAC clones yielded the full length hcl-1 gene, which is comprised of three functional unit (FU) domains at the amino acid level. Database searches and in silico analyses identified the second hcl gene (hcl-2), composed of six FU domains. Both genes are unusual for lacking canonical residues and having fewer FU domains than typical molluscan hemocyanins that contain 7–8 FUs. Reverse transcription PCR demonstrated that Hcl-1 is expressed in a manner that correlates with reproductive maturity in the albumen gland (AG), an immune- and reproduction-relevant organ. Immune cross-reactivity with anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (α-KLH) antiserum and tandem-mass spectrometry validated the presence of Hcl-1 protein in the AG and egg mass fluid (EMF). The evolutionary conservation of hemocyanin-like sequences in B. glabrata in the presence of the oxygen carrier hemoglobin, combined with our results, suggest that the Hcl-1protein has a functional role in general and/or reproductive biology. Further investigations are needed to explore Hcl-1 as a potential target for snail control."
https://openalex.org/W2568092684,"Objectives Adequate community knowledge about malaria is crucial in order to improve prevention by reducing exposure to the disease. Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children of less than five years of age in Equatorial Guinea. However, information concerning the accuracy of community knowledge is insufficient. This study aimed at assessing the depth of caregivers’ knowledge of malaria, their beliefs and attitudes about this disease, and their socioeconomic determinants in the Bata district of Equatorial Guinea. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted in the district of Bata, involving 440 houses selected from 18 rural villages and 26 urban neighbourhoods. A combined ""Malaria Knowledge Score"" was generated based on caregivers’ knowledge about transmission, symptoms, prevention, the treatment of children, and best place to seek treatment. Multivariate logistic regressions analyses were performed to assess those factors that are associated with knowledge about malaria. Results A total of 428 caregivers were interviewed; 255 (59.6%) and 173 (40.4%) lived in urban and rural areas respectively. Significant differences between rural and urban households were observed in caregivers’ malaria knowledges and beliefs. Almost 42% of urban and 65% of rural caregivers were unaware as to how malaria is transmitted (OR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.78–4.05). Together with rurality, the factors most significantly associated with the Malaria Knowledge were the level of education of the caregiver and the socioeconomic status of the household. Conclusions Improvements in educational programs are needed to empower the most vulnerable households such that they can pro-actively implement malaria control measures. This could be achieved by a comprehensive communication strategy aimed at changing individual and community behaviours, and delivered by suitably trained community health workers and indoor residual spraying personnel."
https://openalex.org/W2568337878,"Aim Heart failure (HF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events (TE). Study in a Caucasian population has shown that the CHA2DS2-VASc score predicts TE among HF patients without atrial fibrillation. We sought to assess the usefulness of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting TE in an Asian population and refine the scoring system to improve its predictability of TE among HF patients in sinus rhythm. Methods A total of 1,202 consecutive patients who were admitted to our institution for new-onset HF from 2005 to 2012 and without atrial fibrillation or anticoagulation were retrospectively reviewed. Results The mean age was 77.6 ± 12.2 years and 51.7% were female. After 36.2 ± 30.1 months, 113 (9.4%) developed TE. The annual incidence was 0.54%, 1.54%, 2.98% and 5.04% per year in those who had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1, 2–3, 4–5 and ≥6, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age ≥75 years [Hazard ratio (HR) 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–5.46, p = 0.012), chronic ischemic heart disease (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02–2.31, p = 0.040) and chronic kidney disease (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.09–2.53, p = 0.018) independently predicted TE. Incorporation of chronic ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease into the CHA2DS2-VASc score significantly increased the area under the Receiver Operating Curve from 0.57 (95% CI 0.54–0.59) to 0.61 (95% CI 0.55–0.66; p = 0.022). Conclusion The CHA2DS2-VASc score is useful for stratification of the risk of TE among HF patients in sinus rhythm. Incorporation of chronic ischemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease into the score modestly improves its predictive value."
https://openalex.org/W2569516398,"Influenza is active during the winter and spring in the city of Beijing, which has a typical temperate climate with four clear distinct seasons. The clinical and laboratory surveillance data for influenza have been used to construct critical indicators for influenza activities in the community, and previous studies have reported varying degrees of association between laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens and outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in subtropical cities. However, few studies have reported on this issue for cities in temperate regions, especially in developing countries. Furthermore, the mechanism behind age-specific seasonal epidemics remains unresolved, although it has been widely discussed. We utilized a wavelet analysis method to monitor the coherence of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens with the weekly outpatient consultation rates of influenza-like illness in Beijing, China. We first examined the seasonal pattern of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (subtyped into seasonal A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and pandemic virus A(H1N1) pdm09) and influenza B separately within the period from 2008-2015; then, we detected the coherence of clinical and laboratory surveillance data in this district, specially examining weekly time series of age-specific epidemics of influenza-like illnesses in the whole study period for three age categories (age 0-5, 5-15 and 25-60). We found that influenza A and B were both active in winter but were not always seasonally synchronous in Beijing. Synchronization between age ranges was found in most epidemic peaks from 2008-2015. Our findings suggested that peaks of influenza-like illness in individuals aged 0-5 and 5-15 years consistently appeared ahead of those of adults, implying the possibility that schoolchildren may lead epidemic fluctuations."

The isolated native DNA synthesome can be of use in studying the mechanism by which mammalian DNA replication is carried-out and how anti-cancer drugs disrupt the DNA replication or repair process. Partially purified extracts from HeLa cells were fractionated in a native, liquid based separation by FFE. Dot blot analysis showed co-elution of many proteins identified as part of the DNA synthesome, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), DNA topoisomerase I (topo I), DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ), DNA polymerase ɛ (Pol ɛ), replication protein A (RPA) and replication factor C (RFC). Previously identified DNA synthesome proteins co-eluted with T-antigen dependent and SV40 origin-specific DNA polymerase activity at the same FFE fractions. Native gels show a multiprotein PCNA containing complex migrating with an apparent relative mobility in the megadalton range. When PCNA containing bands were excised from the native gel, mass spectrometric sequencing analysis identified 23 known DNA synthesome associated proteins or protein subunits."

A Miz-1 DNA sequence consensus has recently been identified and has also unveiled Miz-1 functions in other cellular processes, underscoring its importance in the cell. Miz-1 contains 13 ZFs, but it is unknown why Miz-1 has so many ZFs and whether they recognize and bind DNA sequences in a typical fashion. Here, we used NMR to deduce the role of Miz-1 ZFs 1–4 in detecting the Miz-1 consensus sequence and preventing nonspecific DNA binding. In the construct containing the first 4 ZFs, we observed that ZFs 3 and 4 form an unusual compact and stable structure that restricts their motions. Disruption of this compact structure by an electrostatically mismatched A86K mutation profoundly affected the DNA binding properties of the WT construct. On the one hand, Miz1–4WT was found to bind the Miz-1 DNA consensus sequence weakly and through ZFs 1–3 only. On the other hand, the four ZFs in the structurally destabilized Miz1–4A86K mutant bound to the DNA consensus with a 30-fold increase in affinity (100 nm). The formation of such a thermodynamically stable but nonspecific complex is expected to slow down the rate of DNA scanning by Miz-1 during the search for its consensus sequence. Interestingly, we found that the motif stabilizing the compact structure between ZFs 3 and 4 is conserved and enriched in other long poly-ZF proteins.

Miz-1 is an activator of cell cycle regulator genes, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15INK4 (p15), p21CIP1 (p21), and p57KIP2 (p57) (2Seoane J. Le H.V. Massagué J.

Moreover, it was shown that in response to TGF-β, Miz-1 forms a complex with the Smad 2/3/4 proteins to activate the expression of p15. This interaction was shown to involve a region located within the first four ZFs of Miz-1 and the MH1 domain of Smad 3 (7Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massagué J.

On the one hand, numerous studies carried out in different cancer cell lines have shown that the transcriptional repression of Miz-1 by c-Myc is relevant in many different stages of the carcinogenesis process (13Wiese K.E. Walz S. von Eyss B. Wolf E. Athineos D. Sansom O. Eilers M. The role of MIZ-1 in MYC-dependent tumorigenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2013; 3a014290Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, on the other hand, another recent study showed that high levels of Miz-1 cause the repression of c-Myc transcriptional transactivation (14Peter S. Bultinck J. Myant K. Jaenicke L.A. Walz S. Müller J. Gmachl M. Treu M. Boehmelt G. Ade C.P. Schmitz W. Wiegering A. Otto C. Popov N. Sansom O. et al.Tumor cell-specific inhibition of MYC function using small molecule inhibitors of the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase.EMBO Mol. Med. 2014; 6: 1525-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results have led to the interesting hypothesis that the c-Myc/Miz-1 balance can dictate cell fate by controlling the transcription of gene networks (15Schaub F.X. Cleveland J.L. Tipping the MYC-MIZ1 balance: targeting the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase selectively blocks MYC-activated genes.EMBO Mol. Med. 2014; 6: 1509-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The specific DNA binding of Miz-1 is mediated by its ZF motifs (16Barrilleaux B.L. Burow D. Lockwood S.H. Yu A. Segal D.J. Knoepfler P.S. Miz-1 activates gene expression via a novel consensus DNA binding motif.PLoS One. 2014; 9e101151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). ZFs are small domains of ∼30 amino acids that share the following consensus sequence: (F/Y)XCX2–5CX3(F/Y)X5LX2HX3–4H. These motifs are among the most abundant DNA-binding domains in eukaryotes and possess a ββα fold that is stabilized by the coordination of a Zn(II) atom by two conserved Cys and two conserved His side chains (17Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. DNA recognition by Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Classically, the recognition between ZFs and DNA is mediated by specific hydrogen bonds between side chains of residues −1, 2, 3, and 6 (position relative to the beginning of the α-helix) and DNA bases in the Hoogsteen edge (17Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. DNA recognition by Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Typically, series of ZFs are connected by highly conserved TGEKP sequence linkers and bind in sets of two or more in the major groove of the DNA with each ZF contacting three DNA bases. These linkers are important to allow for consecutive motifs to optimally fit in the major groove of DNA (18Choo Y. Klug A. A role in DNA binding for the linker sequences of the first three zinc fingers of TFIIIA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3341-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Ryan R.F. Darby M.K. The role of zinc finger linkers in p43 and TFIIIA binding to 5S rRNA and DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Variations in the consensus sequence can significantly reduce binding affinity (18Choo Y. Klug A. A role in DNA binding for the linker sequences of the first three zinc fingers of TFIIIA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3341-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Ryan R.F. Darby M.K. The role of zinc finger linkers in p43 and TFIIIA binding to 5S rRNA and DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although not infallible, recognition codes and statistical potentials have been derived to predict the DNA sequences bound by ZF tandems from the nature of the residues at positions −1, 2, 3, and 6 of their recognition helix (17Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. DNA recognition by Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 20Kaplan T. Friedman N.

De novo prediction of DNA-binding specificities for Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Miz-1-specific DNA binding has been mainly associated with regions of the proximal and core promoters of p15 and p21 (2Seoane J. Le H.V. Massagué J. Myc suppression of the p21(Cip1) Cdk inhibitor influences the outcome of the p53 response to DNA damage.Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Although one of the regions of the p15 promoter bound by Miz-1 contains an initiator element (INR), no other specific or consensus sequences have emerged until recently. Indeed, two groups recently and independently unveiled similar Miz-1 consensus DNA sequences by genome-wide ChIP-sequencing and Bind-n-Seq methods, respectively (8Wolf E. Gebhardt A. Kawauchi D. Walz S. von Eyss B. Wagner N. Renninger C. Krohne G. Asan E. Roussel M.F. Eilers M. Miz1 is required to maintain autophagic flux.Nat. Commun. 2013; 42535Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Barrilleaux B.L. Burow D. Lockwood S.H. Yu A. Segal D.J. Knoepfler P.S. Miz-1 activates gene expression via a novel consensus DNA binding motif.PLoS One. 2014; 9e101151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, like many other transcription factors, Miz-1 is found to bind elsewhere on the genome, especially when it is stabilized or overexpressed. In fact, in cancer cells, Miz-1 is found to co-localize with c-Myc at many transcription start sites where INR sequences are present. Most interestingly, Miz-1 can inhibit c-Myc transactivation of genes involved in tumorigenic programs (14Peter S. Bultinck J. Myant K. Jaenicke L.A. Walz S. Müller J. Gmachl M. Treu M. Boehmelt G. Ade C.P. Schmitz W. Wiegering A. Otto C. Popov N. Sansom O. et al.Tumor cell-specific inhibition of MYC function using small molecule inhibitors of the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase.EMBO Mol.

Fischer M. Teichmann M. Zender L. et al.Activation and repression by oncogenic MYC shape tumour-specific gene expression profiles.Nature. 2014; 511: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Despite such a critical role in the normal and oncogenic biology of the cell, it is not known whether all of the ZFs or only subsets bind and recognize the Miz-1 consensus sequence, the INR element, or other nonspecific DNA sequences. In this context, we have initiated the determination of the solution structure and DNA binding specificity of different constructs of Miz-1 ZF tandems. To date, the structures of Miz-1 ZFs 5–10 have been reported (23Bédard M. Maltais L. Beaulieu M.E. Bilodeau J. Bernard D. Lavigne P. NMR structure note: solution structure of human Miz-1 zinc fingers 8 to 10.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 54: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 24Bernard D. Bédard M. Bilodeau J. Lavigne P. Structural and dynamical characterization of the Miz-1 zinc fingers 5–8 by solution-state NMR.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 57: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whereas the ZFs 7–10 possess stable Cys2His2 folds and the usual interdomain dynamics, ZF 6 has been shown to be undergoing conformational exchange on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Moreover, we showed that the non-canonical DTDKE linker that connects ZFs 5 and 6 is rather unlikely for classical DNA binding because it will cause electrostatic repulsions with the DNA backbone according to the classical ZF recognition mode (24Bernard D. Bédard M. Bilodeau J. Lavigne P. Structural and dynamical characterization of the Miz-1 zinc fingers 5–8 by solution-state NMR.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 57: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, we continue with the structural and dynamic characterization as well as the DNA binding properties of Miz-1 with a construct consisting of Miz-1 ZFs 1–4 (Miz1–4). Although the 3D structure of ZFs 2–4 of Miz1–4 present the typical ββα fold, we were not able to determine the structure of the ZF 1 because this motif also undergoes conformational exchange on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Also, unexpectedly, we discovered that ZFs 3 and 4 make many interdomain contacts, allowing them to form a compact structure that maintains them in a stable orientation unlikely to provide them with typical DNA binding properties. As can be rationalized from the dynamic and structural characterization of Miz1–4, the construct fails to bind specifically different Miz-1 DNA targets. The motif involved in the stable interdomain interactions between ZFs 3 and 4 was mutated and led to the disruption of the compact structure. This impacted drastically the binding of the Miz1–4 construct to the DNA consensus sequence. Whereas the DNA binding of the WT Miz1–4 construct is mediated by only ZFs 1–3, reintroducing conformational freedom to ZF 4 led to the formation of a complex with all four ZFs bound. Whereas this could suggest a role in the recognition of the consensus by Miz1–4, we show that the actual Miz-1 consensus sequence can be predicted using the identity of the residues in the recognition helices of ZFs 7–12, hence suggesting that recognition of the consensus is accomplished by the C-terminal ZFs. Thus, we instead propose that Miz-1 ZFs 1–3 are involved in scanning DNA and that the compact structure prevents the formation of stable but nonspecific and off-target complexes. In accordance with this view, we find that the motif leading to the formation of the compact structure between ZFs 3 and 4 is conserved and enriched in long poly-ZF (containing 14 ± 6 ZFs). Circular dichroism was used to characterize and monitor the folding of the Miz1–4 construct. Folding of ZFs is pH- and zinc-dependent because conserved Cys side chains need to be in their deprotonated form to coordinate the Zn(II) atom. At pH 6.5, the addition of Zn(II) led to a transition from a CD spectrum typical of a random coil to an α-helix-like spectrum with a plateau reached at 4 molar eq of Zn(II), suggesting that under these conditions, the four ZFs of Miz1–4 are well folded (Fig. 1B). Moreover, at 5 eq of Zn(II), increasing the pH from 6.5 to 7.5 did not lead to any change of the Miz1–4 CD spectrum, suggesting that the protein is already optimally folded at pH 6.5. Based on this CD characterization, all NMR experiments were carried out at pH 6.5 and with 5 eq of Zn(II). As anticipated from the CD study, the cross-peaks on the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Miz1–4 are well dispersed, indicating the presence of stable tertiary structures (Fig. 1C). The data set recorded for Miz1–4 allowed for the assignment of 96 of 107 (90%) of the 1HN, 96 of 112 (86%) of the 15N, 91 of 112 (81%) of the 13C′, 102 of 112 (91%) of the 13Cα, and 94 of 103 (91%) of the 13Cβ. Interestingly, many cross-peaks of ZF 1 are very broad (weak) or broadened beyond detection, preventing us from assigning 9 of its 23 residues. This observation for ZF 1 suggests that this motif could experience some microsecond to millisecond motions (discussed below). Therefore, excluding the ZF 1, 84 of 85 (99%) of 1HN, 84 of 89 (94%) of 15N, 79 of 89 (89%) of 13C′, 88 of 89 (99%) of 13Cα, and 81 of 82 (99%) of 13Cβ were assigned for backbone atom resonances of residues 24–112. Secondary chemical shift (Δδ(Cα − Cβ)) and DANGLE secondary structure prediction obtained for Miz1–4 are shown in Fig. 1D. The four expected α-helices of Miz1–4 ZFs are predicted by DANGLE (based on φ and ψ angles) and present positive Δδ(Cα − Cβ) values. On the other hand, even if β-strands are not all predicted by DANGLE, mostly negative Δδ(Cα − Cβ) values are observed for these secondary structures. Altogether, CD and NMR data show that the four ZFs of Miz1–4 are folded in the selected conditions. Conformational exchange has previously been detected by our group for the ZF 6 of Miz-1 (24Bernard D. Bédard M. Bilodeau J. Lavigne P. Structural and dynamical characterization of the Miz-1 zinc fingers 5–8 by solution-state NMR.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 57: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that both ZF 1 and 6 contain a His at position 1 of the motif instead of a conserved Phe or Tyr (Fig. 1A). To verify whether the weak signal of Miz-1 ZF 1 in the 1H-15N HSQC is caused by conformational exchange, we recorded a set of CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments. One can notice that R2,eff values of many ZF 1 amides decrease as the applied refocusing pulse frequency (νCPMG) is increased (Fig. 2A). This observation clearly indicates that ZF 1 undergoes some conformational exchange on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. The program NESSY was used to fit the dispersion curves according to the protocol described by Bieri and Gooley (25Bieri M. Gooley P.R. Automated NMR relaxation dispersion data analysis using NESSY.BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12: 421Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All of the residues presenting a relaxation dispersion were best fit by the Carver-Richard equation, which is valid for all time scales (slow to fast conformational exchange limits) and considering a two-state model (26Carver J.P. Richards R.E. General 2-site solution for chemical exchange produced dependence of t2 upon Carr–Purcell pulse separation.J. Magn. Reson. 1972; 6: 89-105Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows all of the residues manifesting relaxation dispersion curves. Interestingly, conformational exchange at the C terminus of the α-helix of ZFs 1, 2, and 4 is also observed. Although such motions at the end of ZF α-helices have been suggested to be frequent for C2H2 ZFs (24Bernard D. Bédard M. Bilodeau J. Lavigne P. Structural and dynamical characterization of the Miz-1 zinc fingers 5–8 by solution-state NMR.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 57: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), cases of conformational exchange affecting the core of the α-helix and the first β-strand are rather unusual. It is worth mentioning that resonances of nine consecutive amides invisible on the 1H-15N HSQC, located in the second β-strand and in the beginning of the α-helix, do not reappear even at the highest νCPMG used. This suggests the presence of conformational exchange, but on a faster time scale (i.e. toward the microsecond limit not covered by CPMG but in the range of the rotating frame relaxation dispersion experiments (T1ρ)) (27Kleckner I.R. Foster M.P. An introduction to NMR-based approaches for measuring protein dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 942-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Such a widespread exchange broadening for ZF 1 supports the notion that a His at position 1 promotes motions that affect the local environment of almost all of the amides of the motif. Because of the ZF 1 extensive conformational exchange, we were not able to solve its 3D structure. However, we were able to solve the structures of ZFs 2, 3, and 4 and to characterize their linkers. Tandems of ZFs connected by classical TGEKP linkers are relatively independent from one another but are quasi-ordered in the absence of DNA (28Brüschweiler R. Liao X. Wright P.E. Long-range motional restrictions in a multidomain zinc-finger protein from anisotropic tumbling.Science. 1995; 268: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 29Potter B.M. Feng L.S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 28529-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, these linkers are moderately flexible, with 15N-{1H} NOE values significantly lower than for the ZF core motif (usually ∼0.5 for the linkers and 0.65 for the motifs). In accordance, no long range NOE involving the TGEKP linkers and consecutive ZFs is usually detected in the absence of DNA (23Bédard M. Maltais L. Beaulieu M.E. Bilodeau J. Bernard D. Lavigne P. NMR structure note: solution structure of human Miz-1 zinc fingers 8 to 10.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 54: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, extensive medium and long range NOEs involving residues from the non-canonical SGEAR linker and ZF 3–4 are observed (Fig. 3). This clearly indicates that they are not independent from one another. On the other hand, no long range NOE was observed for the non-canonical linker between ZFs 2 and 3. For these reasons, we decided to calculate the structure of the ZF 2 alone and ZFs 3 and 4 together. The NOE restraints, dihedral angles, and hydrogen bonds used for structure calculations of each ZF are summarized in Table 1. The superposition of the 20 lowest energy conformers onto their geometric averages demonstrates that all three ZFs are well defined, with backbone RMSDs of 0.42 ± 0.07, 0.27 ± 0.07, and 0.19 ± 0.05 Å for ZFs 2, 3, and 4, respectively (Fig. 4A). Moreover, their structures reveal that they all present the classical ββα topology. The highest backbone RMSD observed for ZF 2 is most probably due to the presence of a Cys at position 4 of the α-helix (Cys47; Fig. 4B) instead of a conserved Leu in the motif hydrophobic core. Indeed, relatively few long range NOEs were detected for this motif. This can be caused by a less stable tertiary structure and/or by the fact that a Cys side chain has a lesser density of 1H and hence generated less NOE. The 15N-{1H} NOEs recorded for Miz1–4 argue in favor of this last hypothesis and suggest that the amides of ZF 2 are as rigid as those of ZF 3–4 on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale (see below).TABLE 1Structural statistics for Miz1–4 ZF2 and ZF 3–4ZF 2ZF 3–4Restraints for final structure calculationsNOE distance restraints Intraresidue (|i − j| = 0)246801 Sequential (|i − j| = 1)115345 Medium range (1 < |i − j| < 5)70290 Long range (|i − j| ≥ 5)55291 Ambiguous NOE740Total NOE distance restraints4931767Hydrogen bonds10 × 221 × 2Zinc ligands4 × 28 × 2Dihedral angle restraintsaΦ and ψ angles were derived from the program DANGLE.

However, its effectiveness on the accumulation of fat in the body has never been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Oral administration of brown algae polyphenol to mice fed with a high fat diet, suppressed the increase in fat volume to a level observed in mice fed with a normal diet. We speculate that Pin1 might be required for the differentiation of stem cell to adipocytes. We established wild type (WT) and Pin1-/- (Pin1-KO) adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ASC) lines and found that WT ASCs differentiate to adipocytes but Pin1-KO ASCs do not. Conclusion and Significance Oral administration of brown algae polyphenol, a Pin1 inhibitor, reduced fat buildup in mice. We showed that Pin1 is required for the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes. We propose that oral intake of brown algae polyphenol is useful for the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2570608242,"The onion (Allium cepa L.) is widely planted worldwide as a valuable vegetable crop. The scales of an onion bulb are a modified type of leaf. The one-layer-cell epidermis of onion scales is commonly used as a model experimental material in botany and molecular biology. The lower epidermis (LE) and upper epidermis (UE) of onion scales display obvious differences in microscopic structure, cell differentiation and pigment synthesis; however, associated proteomic differences are unclear. LE and UE can be easily sampled as single-layer-cell tissues for comparative proteomic analysis. In this study, a proteomic approach based on 2-DE and mass spectrometry (MS) was applied to compare LE and UE of fleshy scales from yellow and red onions. We identified 47 differential abundant protein spots (representing 31 unique proteins) between LE and UE in red and yellow onions. These proteins are mainly involved in pigment synthesis, stress response, and cell division. Particularly, the differentially accumulated chalcone-flavanone isomerase and flavone O-methyltransferase 1-like in LE may result in the differences in the onion scale color between red and yellow onions. Moreover, stress-related proteins abundantly accumulated in both LE and UE. In addition, the differential accumulation of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase 1-like protein and β-1,3-glucanase in the LE may be related to the different cell sizes between LE and UE of the two types of onion. The data derived from this study provides new insight into the differences in differentiation and developmental processes between onion epidermises. This study may also make a contribution to onion breeding, such as improving resistances and changing colors."
https://openalex.org/W2565993020,"Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of any tissue-specific cancer in both men and women. Research continues to investigate novel drugs and therapies to mitigate poor treatment efficacy, but the lack of a good descriptive lung cancer animal model for preclinical drug evaluation remains an obstacle. Here we describe the development of an orthotopic lung cancer animal model which utilizes the human sodium iodide symporter gene (hNIS; SLC5A5) as an imaging reporter gene for the purpose of non-invasive, longitudinal tumor quantification. hNIS is a glycoprotein that naturally transports iodide (I-) into thyroid cells and has the ability to symport the radiotracer 99mTc-pertechnetate (99mTcO4-). A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were genetically modified with plasmid or lentiviral vectors to express hNIS. Modified cells were implanted into athymic nude mice to develop two tumor models: a subcutaneous and an orthotopic xenograft tumor model. Tumor progression was longitudinally imaged using SPECT/CT and quantified by SPECT voxel analysis. hNIS expression in lung tumors was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, hematoxylin and eosin staining and visual inspection of pulmonary tumors was performed. We observed that lentiviral transduction provided enhanced and stable hNIS expression in A549 cells. Furthermore, 99mTcO4- uptake and accumulation was observed within lung tumors allowing for imaging and quantification of tumor mass at two-time points. This study illustrates the development of an orthotopic lung cancer model that can be longitudinally imaged throughout the experimental timeline thus avoiding inter-animal variability and leading to a reduction in total animal numbers. Furthermore, our orthotopic lung cancer animal model is clinically relevant and the genetic modification of cells for SPECT/CT imaging can be translated to other tissue-specific tumor animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2568600361,"Lifestyle has been regarded as a key pathway through which adverse psychosocial working characteristics can give rise to long-term health problems. The purpose of this study was to estimate the indirect/mediated effect of health behaviors in the longitudinal work characteristics-depression relationship. The analyses were based on the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health, including 3706 working participants with repeat survey measures on four occasions (2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014). Psychosocial work characteristics including demands and social support were analyzed in relation to depressive symptoms. Autoregressive longitudinal mediation models using structural equation modeling were used to estimate the intermediate effects of unhealthy behaviors including current smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. Both workplace demands and social support were related to later depressive symptoms. In bivariate models we found no significant paths from workplace demands to health behaviors, but two out of three significant time-specific paths from workplace support to excessive drinking and from excessive drinking to depressive symptoms. Social support was also associated with subsequent unhealthy diet, and one path from unhealthy diet to depressive symptoms was found. However, despite indications of certain longitudinal relationships between psychosocial working conditions and health behaviors as well as between health behaviors and depressive symptoms, no significant intermediate effects were found (p>0.05). We conclude that changes in unhealthy behaviors over a period of two years are unlikely to act as strong intermediaries in the longitudinal relationship between job demands and depressive symptoms and between social support and depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2569520365,"The fusion and enhancement of multiband nighttime imagery for surveillance and navigation has been the subject of extensive research for over two decades. Despite the ongoing efforts in this area there is still only a small number of static multiband test images available for the development and evaluation of new image fusion and enhancement methods. Moreover, dynamic multiband imagery is also currently lacking. To fill this gap we present the TRICLOBS dynamic multi-band image data set containing sixteen registered visual (0.4–0.7μm), near-infrared (NIR, 0.7–1.0μm) and long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8–14μm) motion sequences. They represent different military and civilian surveillance scenarios registered in three different scenes. Scenes include (military and civilian) people that are stationary, walking or running, or carrying various objects. Vehicles, foliage, and buildings or other man-made structures are also included in the scenes. This data set is primarily intended for the development and evaluation of image fusion, enhancement and color mapping algorithms for short-range surveillance applications. The imagery was collected during several field trials with our newly developed TRICLOBS (TRI-band Color Low-light OBServation) all-day all-weather surveillance system. This system registers a scene in the Visual, NIR and LWIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum using three optically aligned sensors (two digital image intensifiers and an uncooled long-wave infrared microbolometer). The three sensor signals are mapped to three individual RGB color channels, digitized, and stored as uncompressed RGB (false) color frames. The TRICLOBS data set enables the development and evaluation of (both static and dynamic) image fusion, enhancement and color mapping algorithms. To allow the development of realistic color remapping procedures, the data set also contains color photographs of each of the three scenes. The color statistics derived from these photographs can be used to define color mappings that give the multi-band imagery a realistic color appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2568113021,"Developmental disorders (DD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), are a common group of clinical manifestations caused by a variety of genetic abnormalities. Genetic testing, including chromosomal microarray (CMA), plays an important role in diagnosing these conditions, but CMA can be limited by incomplete coverage of genetic abnormalities and lack of guidance for conditions rarely seen by treating physicians.We conducted a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of a higher resolution 2.8 million (MM) probe-CMA test on the quality of care delivered by practicing general pediatricians and specialists. To overcome the twin problems of finding an adequate sample size of multiple rare conditions and under/incorrect diagnoses, we used standardized simulated patients known as CPVs. Physicians, randomized into control and intervention groups, cared for the CPV pediatric patients with DD/ASD/ID. Care responses were scored against evidence-based criteria. In round one, participants could order diagnostic tests including existing CMA tests. In round two, intervention physicians could order the 2.8MM probe-CMA test. Outcome measures included overall quality of care and quality of the diagnosis and treatment plan.Physicians ordering CMA testing had 5.43% (p<0.001) higher overall quality scores than those who did not. Intervention physicians ordering the 2.8MM probe-CMA test had 7.20% (p<0.001) higher overall quality scores. Use of the 2.8MM probe-CMA test led to a 10.9% (p<0.001) improvement in the diagnosis and treatment score. Introduction of the 2.8MM probe-CMA test led to significant improvements in condition-specific interventions including an 8.3% (p = 0.04) improvement in evaluation and therapy for gross motor delays caused by Hunter syndrome, a 27.5% (p = 0.03) increase in early cognitive intervention for FOXG1-related disorder, and an 18.2% (p<0.001) improvement in referrals to child neurology for Dravet syndrome.Physician use of the 2.8MM probe-CMA test significantly improves overall quality as well as diagnosis and treatment quality for simulated cases of pediatric DD/ASD/ID patients, and delivers additional clinical utility over existing CMA tests."
https://openalex.org/W2569623562,"As the HIV-infected population ages, the role of cellular senescence and inflammation on co-morbid conditions and pharmacotherapy is increasingly of interest. p16INK4a expression, a marker for aging and senescence in T-cells, is associated with lower intracellular concentrations of endogenous nucleotides (EN) and nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). This study expands on these findings by determining whether inflammation is contributing to the association of p16INK4a expression with intracellular metabolite (IM) exposure and endogenous nucleotide concentrations.Samples from 73 HIV-infected adults receiving daily tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC) with either efavirenz (EFV) or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) were tested for p16INK4a expression, and plasma cytokine and intracellular drug concentrations. Associations between p16INK4a expression and cytokine concentrations were assessed using maximum likelihood methods, and elastic net regression was applied to assess whether cytokines were predictive of intracellular metabolite/endogenous nucleotide exposures.Enrolled participants had a median age of 48 years (range 23-73). There were no significant associations between p16INK4a expression and cytokines. Results of the elastic net regression showed weak relationships between IL-1Ra and FTC-triphosphate and deoxyadenosine triphosphate exposures, and MIP-1β, age and TFV-diphosphate exposures.In this clinical evaluation, we found no relationships between p16INK4a expression and cytokines, or cytokines and intracellular nucleotide concentrations. While inflammation is known to play a role in this population, it is not a major contributor to the p16INK4a association with decreased IM/EN exposures in these HIV-infected participants."
https://openalex.org/W2570075186,"Previous studies on Barrett's esophagus (BE) risk factors have had differing case definitions and control groups. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in risk factors between newly diagnosed vs. prevalent BE, long- vs. short-segment BE, and endoscopy-only BE without specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM).We conducted a cross-sectional study among eligible patients scheduled for elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and patients eligible for screening colonoscopy, recruited from primary care clinics at a Veterans Affairs center. All participants completed a survey on demographics, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms and medication use prior to undergoing study EGD. We compared BE cases separately to two control groups: 503 primary care controls and 1353 endoscopy controls. Associations between risk factors and differing BE case definitions were evaluated with multivariate logistic regression models.For comparisons with primary care controls, early onset frequent GERD symptoms were more strongly associated with risk of long-segment BE (OR 19.9; 95% CI 7.96-49.7) than short-segment BE (OR 8.54; 95% CI 3.85-18.9). Likewise, the inverse association with H. pylori infection was stronger for long-segment BE (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26-0.79) than short-segment BE (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.48-1.05). GERD symptoms and H. pylori infection was also more strongly associated with prevalent BE than newly diagnosed BE. Few differences were observed between BE cases and endoscopy controls. Endoscopy-only BE was associated with GERD symptoms (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.32-3.85) and PPI/H2RA use (OR 4.44; 95% CI 2.61-7.54) but to a smaller degree than BE with SIM.We found differences in the strength and profiles of risk factors for BE. The findings support that epidemiological studies of BE should make a distinction between long and short, new and prevalent, endoscopy-only and BE with SIM as well as type of controls."
https://openalex.org/W2569752442,"The halophilic methanoarchaeon Methanohalophilus portucalensis FDF1T possesses the ability to synthesize the osmolyte betaine from its precursor, glycine, in response to extracellular salt stress through a three-step transmethylation process. Analysis of recombinant glycine sarcosine N-methyltransferase (rGSMT) and recombinant sarcosine dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase (rSDMT) from Escherichia coli indicated that betaine synthesis is rate-limited by rGSMT and is constitutively activated by rSDMT. Therefore, it is of interest to purify native GSMT from Methanohalophilus portucalensis to further compare its enzymatic characteristics and kinetics with rGSMT. In this study, native GSMT was purified through DEAE ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography with 95% purity. The enzymatic characteristics of GSMT and rGSMT showed similar trends of activities that were activated by high concentrations of monovalent cations. Both were feedback-inhibited by the end product, betaine, and competitively inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Native GSMT was 2-fold more sensitive to SAH than rGSMT. Notably, comparison of the kinetic parameters illustrated that the turnover rate of glycine methylation of GSMT was promoted by potassium ions, whereas rGSMT was activated by increasing protein-glycine binding affinity. These results suggest that GSMT and rGSMT may have different levels of post-translational modifications. Our preliminary mass spectrometry evidence indicated that there was no detectable phosphosite on GSMT after the complicated purification processes, whereas purified rGSMT still possessed 23.1% of its initial phosphorylation level. We believe that a phosphorylation-mediated modification may be involved in the regulation of this energy consuming betaine synthesis pathway during the stress response in halophilic methanoarchaea."
