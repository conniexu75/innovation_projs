https://openalex.org/W1588733323,"Abstract Two high molecular weight derivatives of fibrinogen (Fragments X and Y) produced by plasmin digestion have been identified by comparative analyses of the digests in agar, agarose, and acrylamide electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, and analytical ultracentrifugation. These fragments were purified by salt precipitation and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration and their physicochemical and immunological properties were defined. Fragment X has a molecular weight of 240,000, as compared with 300,000 for fibrinogen, and is slowly but almost completely (85%) clotted by thrombin. Fragment Y has a molecular weight of 155,000 and cannot be clotted by thrombin. Fragments X and Y can be further digested by plasmin to form the known end stage products, Fragments D and E. The molecular weight of Fragment D was found to be 83,000, in agreement with previous reports, while the molecular weight of Fragment E was 50,000, somewhat higher than reported values. These various findings clarify the sequence and stoichiometry of reactions involved in the fragmentation of fibrinogen by plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1599651308,"A simplified method has been developed for the separation of plasma membrane material from isotonic homogenates of rat kidney. When examined by electron microscopy, the preparation consists of membrane vesicles free of nuclei and essentially free of intact mitochondria. Membranes have been solubilized by sonic oscillation or with Lubrol W-X detergent. Gel filtrate chromatography of solubilized membranes on 6% agarose gel yields two major protein peaks. The first protein peak elutes in the void volume and contains macromolecules with a molecular weight exceeding 1,000,000. The second protein peak has an elution profile similar to proteins of approximately 45,000 molecular weight. Sodium-potassium-dependent, ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity is associated with fractions of the first peak. Protein material associated with the second peak is mostly insoluble when membranes are extracted with 1-butanol. The bulk of the protein material associated with the second peak is solubilized when membranes are extracted with NaI. When proteins eluted from agarose gel columns are subjected to polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, a portion of the high molecular weight protein in the first column peak moves, separating into five protein bands. The sodium-potassium-dependent ATPase activity appears to be associated with the nonmobile portion. All proteins in the low molecular weight second peak move, separating into more than eight bands. Incorporation in vivo of radioactive leucine into membrane protein was measured. After column fractionation a considerable variation in radioactivity of membrane fractions was observed. The findings in this study indicate heterogeneity of membrane protein constituents."
https://openalex.org/W1556910033,"N,N′-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) was found to be a potent inhibitor of the membrane-bound ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis but did not inhibit the solubilized form of the enzyme. Inhibited membrane-bound ATPase was reactivated by releasing the enzyme from the membrane. Conversely, sensitivity to DCCD was restored by reconstituting the ATPase-membrane complex from solubilized ATPase and depleted membranes. The results indicate that DCCD reacts covalently with a membrane component and inhibits the enzyme indirectly, perhaps by means of a transmitted effect on its conformation. When added to intact cells, DCCD reduced the rate of glycolysis yet the ATP content of the cells was as high in the presence of the inhibitor as in its absence. DCCD strongly inhibited the degradation of ATP which ensued when glycolysis was stopped, either by removal of glucose or by addition of iodoacetate. The results suggest that DCCD inhibits ATPase in vivo, just as it does in isolated membrane preparations. The inhibition of over-all glycolysis may be secondary to the inhibition of ATP degradation. DCCD also inhibited a number of energy-dependent transport processes, including the accumulation of K+ by exchange for H+ and Na+ and the uptake of phosphate and alanine. Inhibition was observed whether glucose or arginine served as energy source. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the membrane-bound ATPase of S. faecalis mediates energy transductions involved in membrane transport; inhibition of transport by DCCD would be a consequence of inhibition of the ATPase. Alternatively, DCCD may bind to sites on the membrane to inhibit indirectly both transport and ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1507842415,"Abstract The low molecular weight protein associated with rabbit skeletal myosin has been estimated by gel filtration studies in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride and was found to constitute 9 ± 2% of the myosin mass. We have found that 40 to 50% of the low molecular weight protein can be removed from myosin without any apparent changes in the adenosine-triphosphatase activity. Attempts to remove a larger fraction of low molecular weight protein resulted in a concomitant loss of enzymatic activity. The molecular weight of the major myosin subunit freed of low molecular weight protein has been redetermined in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride and was found to be 194,000 g per mole. The significance of its presence in assessing the molecular weight of the major subunit at low speed and high speed sedimentation equilibrium has been investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1590045255,"Abstract Physiological ligands of (sodium-potassium)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase influenced the sensitivity of the enzyme to the inhibitor, ouabain. Phosphorylation of the native enzyme is accelerated by sodium ions, while potassium ions accelerate dephosphorylation. Exposure of the phosphoenzyme to ouabain slowed its turnover and rendered it insensitive to potassium ion. This action of ouabain did not require free magnesium ion and was accelerated by high concentrations of sodium ion. The ouabain-treated phosphoenzyme gradually yielded a dephosphoenzyme which could not be rephosphorylated from adenosine triphosphate but could incorporate inorganic phosphate. The native dephosphoenzyme on incubation with ouabain lost its ability to be phosphorylated by adenosine triphosphate. This effect was accelerated by magnesium ion or magnesium ion plus inorganic phosphate and could be prevented but not reversed by sodium ion at 0°. At 23° or above it was reversible with or without sodium ion. The inhibited dephosphoenzyme incorporated inorganic phosphate in the presence of magnesium ion. All phosphorylated forms of the enzyme yielded identical patterns on electrophoresis and radioautography of proteolytic digests. A cyclic reaction sequence for inhibition of the enzyme by ouabain is proposed and related to physiological transport of sodium and potassium ions."
https://openalex.org/W1557801051,"Human phosphofructokinase was partially purified from skeletal muscle and erythrocytes. Erythrocyte phosphofructokinase migrated faster on electrophoresis, showed greater affinity for DEAE-cellulose in Tris-phosphate buffer at pH 8, was more inhibited by ATP, and was less inhibited by citrate than muscle phosphofructokinase. Antibody to muscle phosphofructokinase inhibited the activity of erythrocyte phosphofructokinase less than that of the muscle enzyme, but the enzymes could not be distinguished by immunodiffusion methods. By sucrose density gradient centrifugation, the molecular weight of muscle phosphofructokinase was estimated to be between 3.8 × 105 and 4.3 × 105 for the smallest active form. When larger amounts of enzyme were centrifuged, a broad peak resulted, suggesting polymerization of the enzyme. The sedimentation coefficient of erythrocyte phosphofructokinase was also concentration-dependent, but a heterogeneous peak was obtained when even small amounts of enzyme were centrifuged so that the molecular weight could not be estimated accurately. In kinetic studies of both enzymes, Lineweaver-Burk plots yielded parallel lines when activity was measured at different fixed concentrations of the second substrate. Both Km and Vmax for either substrate were increased by raising the concentration of the other substrate. The pH maximum for both enzymes was about 8.5 and inhibition at low pH was greater with high ATP. NH4+ and Pi increased Vmax and decreased Km for both substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1517933273,"Abstract Correlation of the anticoagulant potency of plasmin digests of fibrinogen with the concentration of the recognized degradation products in the digests indicated that the high molecular weight fibrinogen Fragments X and Y, described in the accompanying article, were more potent anticoagulants than the end stage Fragments D and E. Findings in crude digests were corroborated by studies of the relative activity of individual purified degradation products as anticoagulants in a thrombin time system. Evidence was obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation that complexes formed chiefly between fibrin monomer and the degradation products, but also between Fragment X and other degradation products both before and after the addition of thrombin. Some of the complexes were not clottable by thrombin; others were clotted slowly. The nonclottable complexes composed of fibrin monomer and degradation products appeared to be primarily responsible for the hemorrhagic tendency of patients with fibrinolytic syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W1510831493,"Abstract The hydrolysis of AT32P by calf brain microsomes appears to be catalyzed by two different enzymatic sites that are inactivated by ouabain. The first, Site I, is a Na+- and K+-activated ATPase (Km = 10-4 m ATP; Vmax = 1.5 µmoles of Pi released per mg of protein per min) resembling those known to be in other microsomal preparations. The second, Site II (Km = 2 x 10-7 m ATP; Vmax = 0.07 µmoles of Pi released per mg of protein per min) is a Na+-activated ATPase inhibited by K+. At concentrations of K+ sufficient to activate Site I, but too low to completely inhibit Site II, these enzymatic sites operate independently and simultaneously; this is most apparent at low concentrations of ATP when their rates are comparable. The Na+-K+-ATPase has been implicated in the mechanism for Na+ and K+ transport across biological membranes. The Na+-ATPase may be related to certain ouabain-sensitive transport systems that require Na+ but not K+."
https://openalex.org/W1537813084,"Abstract High speed sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate a molecular weight of 468,000 (±10,000) for rabbit skeletal myosin in 0.4 m KCl-0.05 m phosphate, pH 6.5. Weight average molecular weight values of 520,000 or above, which are presumably due to aggregation, are obtained in ultracentrifugal experiments on the same preparations of myosin. At pH 11, in 2 m guanidine, and on heat treatment, myosin is dissociated into a core of molecular weight 420,000 weight and light subunits of average molecular weight 20,200. The core may be dissociated by 5 m guanidine into two heavy subunits, of molecular weight 212,000 (±5,000), having no evident COOH-terminal group on digestion with carboxypeptidase A. The light alkali component comprises 11.7% (± 1%) of the protein, or 2.7 (±0.3) light subunits per myosin molecule, for unchromatographed myosin and myosin chromatographed once on diethylaminoethyl cellulose or cellulose phosphate; the molar ratio is reduced to 2.0 (±0.3) in a small fraction of the original myosin that is recovered after three chromatographic cycles on cellulose phosphate. Myosin may be reconstituted after subunit dissociation at alkaline pH or in guanidine solution; however, the reassociation of light subunits is diminished after prolonged denaturation. The removal of light subunits is accompanied by aggregation of the heavy chain core to low n-mers. In general, those denaturing conditions which lead to light subunit dissociation also result in the irreversible inactivation of adenosine triphosphatase and, on heat denaturation, values of ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ are comparable for both processes. The ATPase activity of myosin may be partially protected on alkaline treatment in 2 m KCl-0.01 m ATP; enzymic activity is lost in identically treated but fractionated heavy chain core and in augmented in the presence of excess light subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1501634091,"Human trypsin was strongly inhibited by three apparently unrelated inhibitors: lima bean trypsin inhibitor, bovine colostrum inhibitor, and bovine Kunitz pancreatic inhibitor. It was inhibited to varying degrees by Kunitz soybean inhibitor, soybean inhibitor AA, kidney bean inhibitor, black-eyed pea inhibitor, navy bean inhibitor, and quail ovomucoid. It was essentially uninhibited by bovine Kazal pancreatic inhibitor, porcine Kazal pancreatic inhibitor, potato inhibitor, chicken ovoinhibitor, and 10 avian ovomucoids including that of chicken. Many of these proteins strongly inhibit bovine trypsin. Thus, inhibition of bovine trypsin by naturally occurring inhibitors is no index of their activities against human trypsin. The activities of these inhibitors against human plasmin were generally similar to those against human trypsin, except that the activities of lima bean inhibitor and quail ovomucoid were comparatively weaker and the activity of the Kunitz soybean inhibitor was much stronger. The esterolytic activity of human thrombin was not affected by any of the inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2003546925,"The insecticide DDT selectively inhibits the action of a Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+)-adenosine triphosphatase found in the nerve ending fraction of the rat brain. As judged by the concentrations of inhibitors that give 50 percent of enzyme inhibition, DDT was approximately 1000 times more toxic than its non-insecticidal analog, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene. The degrees of inhibition of this enzyme system by various toxic and nontoxic DDT analogs were closely related to a general toxicity in vivo of these compounds. Moreover, the extents of inhibition of this enzyme system by DDT were much higher at low temperatures, an indication of a causal relation between poisoning in vivo by DDT and the inhibition in vitro of the Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+)-adenosine triphosphatase system."
https://openalex.org/W1569001116,"Abstract Yeast cells grown under conditions of glucose repression (5.4% glucose) exhibit a lower ATPase activity than cells grown on 0.8% glucose. The ATPase activity of the mitochondria increases during derepression, and this increase can be shown to be accompanied by an increase in the F1 (ATPase) content of the mitochondrial membranes. The increase of ATPase in the mitochondrial fraction during derepression is prevented by chloramphenicol. Under these conditions, however, there is an accumulation of soluble ATPase in the postribosomal supernatant. The soluble ATPase has been partially purified, and its properties indicate it to be identical to F1. Cycloheximide also prevents the increase of ATPase activity in the mitochondrial fraction during derepression. There is no accumulation of ATPase in the postribosomal fraction of cells incubated in a derepression medium containing cycloheximide. These results are interpreted to indicate that F1 is synthesized by the cytoplasmic-ribosomal protein-synthesizing system of the yeast cell."
https://openalex.org/W1991293462,The livers and spleens from three patients with cerebral G(M1)-gangliosidosis contained greatly increased concentrations of a mucopolysaccharide tentatively identified as keratan sulfate. The concentration of a very soluble sialomucopolysaccharide was also increased. Concentrations of these compounds were not increased in the viscera of patients with Tay-Sachs disease (G(M2)-gangliosidosis). G(M1)-gangliosidosis appears to be a combined cerebral gangliosidosis and visceral mucopolysaccharidosis.
https://openalex.org/W1508939788,"Abstract Microsomes prepared from electric organ of Electrophorus electricus or cat brain and exposed to ouabain will react with orthophosphate to form a phosphorylated protein. The electrophoretic mobilities of the phosphopeptides cleaved by peptic and Pronase digestion of the microsomes after interaction with phosphate are indistinguishable from those previously known to be formed from microsomes and ATP. The chemical stability of the bound phosphate is also similar to that of the phosphate formed from ATP. N-Ethylmaleimide treatment does not prevent ouabain binding, but does prevent the subsequent incorporation of orthophosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1502896457,"Abstract The effects of two hypolipidemic agents, 2-methyl-2-[p-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl)-phenoxy]propionate and ethyl 2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-methylpropionate, on the activity of a highly purified preparation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, obtained from chicken livers, were studied. Both compounds are inhibitors of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, but they have no inhibitory effect on a number of other enzymes tested, including fatty acid synthetase. The inhibition cannot be prevented by addition of exogenous biotin. Kinetic analysis indicates that the inhibition is competitive for acetyl-CoA and isocitrate and noncompetitive for ATP and bicarbonate for both drugs. Mixed inhibition studies indicate that both drugs act on the same site of the enzyme and that this site is different from the site of inhibition by palmityl-CoA. Some insight into the mechanism of the inhibition is provided by the kinetic analysis, heat inactivation studies, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and Arrhenius plots. The results suggest that the effect of these compounds as lipid-lowering agents may be accounted for by inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1575552232,"Abstract Evidence for a phosphorylated intermediate of Na+-activated ATPase of the erythrocyte membrane has been presented previously in studies of a Na+-stimulated component of membrane phosphorylation at low ATP concentrations. In this investigation, the effects of ouabain and oligomycin on Na+-activated membrane phosphorylation and (14C)ADP-ATP exchange were studied in relation to effects on Na+-activated ATP hydrolysis. In agreement with findings with other particulate preparations, ouabain interaction with membranes resulted in inhibition of (a) Na+-activated ATP hydrolysis, (b) Na+-stimulated increase and K+-stimulated decrease in the steady state level of phosphorylated intermediate, and (c) Na+-activated (14C)ADP-ATP exchange. Ouabain inhibition of hydrolysis was diminished by addition of potassium ions. The ratio of Na+-stimulated (14C)ADP-ATP exchange activity to ATPase activity was low at 37° compared to 0°. The exchange reaction was stimulated by oligomycin, but the degree of stimulation relative to the degree of inhibition of ATP hydrolysis was also low at 37° compared to 0°. Oligomycin inhibited Na+-activated ATP hydrolysis without affecting the level of 32P bound in the presence of sodium ions alone. K+-stimulated dephosphorylation was decreased by oligomycin. With increasing concentrations of ATP, the catalytic center activity of Na+, K+-activated ATPase increases, to 1980 per minute determined at 0.05 mm ATP and to approximately 6000 per min estimated at 2 mm ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1547693568,"Abstract In synaptosomes isolated from rat brain cortex, sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase is present in high concentration (70 µmoles of Pi per mg of protein per 30 min). The maximal sodium-potassium-ATPase activity occurred with sodium and potassium concentrations similar to those necessary to achieve maximal protein synthesis, oxygen uptake, and potassium accumulation (50 mm sodium and 10 mm potassium). Furthermore, varying the concentrations of sodium or potassium yielded parallel alterations in sodium-potassium-ATPase activity, protein synthesis, and potassium transport. Ouabain (10-4 m) inhibited sodium-potassium-ATPase activity by 98%; protein synthesis, 40%; and active transport of potassium, 33%. Diphenylhydantoin, which may stimulate or inhibit ATPase activity depending upon the sodium to potassium ratio present, exerted parallel effects on protein synthesis. On the other hand, the ionic stimulation of amino acid uptake did not parallel the ionic stimulation of protein synthesis and potassium transport. Amino acid uptake was stimulated by sodium and inhibited by potassium. The apparent Km for 14C-leucine uptake was 3.0 mm in the absence of sodium and 0.7 mm in 50 mm sodium. Although potassium was inhibitory, both sodium and potassium were necessary for the optimal inhibitory action of ouabain. The results suggest a tight coupling of membrane ATPase activity, potassium transport, and the synthesis of synaptosome proteins. They further suggest that changes in ionic pump activity may modulate the synaptic metabolism of macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W1590640075,"The differences between slow and fast muscle myosin adenosine triphosphatase activity of the cat are described with reference to relative specific activities, p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate activation, and alkaline and acid stability. The treatment of fast muscle myosin with 8 moles of p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate per 105 g of myosin results in the release of two electrophoretically distinct proteins and loss of myosin ATPase activity. There appears to be an inverse relationship between the degree of ATPase activity lost and the amount of closely associated proteins released from fast muscle myosin. Similar treatment of slow muscle myosin releases no proteins and causes no loss of ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1489262601,"Abstract The catalytic activity of yeast phosphofructokinase is dependent on the concentrations of both uncomplexed Mg2+ and MgITP2-, and not on the concentration of uncomplexed ITP. The allosteric inhibition of catalysis by ATP is dependent on the concentration of MgATP2- and not on the concentration of uncomplexed ATP. It is proposed that the nucleoside triphosphate substrates are bound as Mg2+ complexes, that catalysis requires uncomplexed Mg2+, and that MgATP2- is the negative effector. Addition of NH4Cl increases the catalytic activity of yeast phosphofructokinase up to 20-fold depending on the allosteric state of the enzyme. This activation can be resolved into the formation of two NH4+-enzyme complexes. Formation of the stronger complex, which has an apparent dissociation constant of 3 mm, produces about a 100% increase in the rate of catalysis irrespective of the allosteric state of the enzyme. Formation of the weaker complex is only detected catalytically in the presence of low concentrations of the positive effector, fructose-6-P, or in the presence of the negative effector, MgATP2-. The apparent dissociation constant of the weaker NH4+-enzyme complex increases as the concentration of the positive effector decreases or the concentration of negative effector increases, or both. The presence of 50 mm NH4Cl increases the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate fructose-6-P and decreases the Hill coefficient of fructose-6-P. It was concluded that NH4+ functions as an activator when binding to the stronger site and as a positive allosteric effector when binding to the weaker site. Addition of KCl also increases the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This activation can be resolved into the formation of two K+-enzyme complexes. Formation of the stronger complex, which has an apparent dissociation constant of about 10 mm, produces a 50% increase in catalytic activity and does not appear to alter the allosteric state of the enzyme. Although the apparent dissociation constant of the weaker K+-enzyme complex increases as the initial concentration of positive effector decreases or negative effector increases (or both), the presence of 200 mm KCl does not change the affinity of the enzyme for fructose-6-P or the Hill coefficient of this substrate. It was concluded therefore that K+ is not a significant allosteric effector. Competition experiments indicate that the stronger NH4+ and K+ sites are distinct from each other and that the catalytic response to the binding of NH4+ and K+ to these sites is not additive."
https://openalex.org/W37905566,"Abstract The binding properties of purified sheep heart phosphofructokinase were studied with a gel filtration technique and were compared with those of enzyme desensitized to allosteric control by photooxidation. The enzyme, after treatment with charcoal, had a tendency to aggregate and to be retained on Sephadex columns. Binding studies, therefore, had to be carried out in the presence of different substrates, sulfate or phosphate salts, to obtain maximum enzyme recovery. The native enzyme binds, at saturation, 3.6 moles of ATP and 2.0 moles of citrate per 100,000 g. ATP inhibits binding of the enzyme to citrate. The binding of fructose-6-P is dependent on protein concentration. The enzyme binds as much as 11.8 moles of fructose-6-P per 100,000 g. Much of this binding is on sites which are nonspecific. In the presence of inorganic phosphate the nonspecific binding was reduced to a minimum, and the enzyme binds only 1.75 moles of fructose-6-P per 100,000 g. The photooxidized enzyme binds at saturation 2 moles of ATP, 2 moles of fructose-6-P per 100,000 g, and no citrate. The results indicate that there are two catalytic sites and two allosteric sites per 100,000 g. ATP, therefore, besides being a substrate, is also a modifier which inhibits the enzyme by binding at a site different from the catalytic site, namely the allosteric site. Citrate, like ATP, inhibits phosphofructokinase by binding at the same allosteric site. The effect of different enzyme effectors was tested on the binding of the above mentioned substrates. Fructose-1,6-di-P decreases the affinity of both native and photooxidized enzyme for ATP binding. The hexose diphosphate does not affect the affinity of the native enzyme to citrate binding but reduces the number of its binding sites for citrate. β-Glycerophosphate, as well as inorganic phosphate, reduces the binding of ATP to the enzyme. The adenylic nucleotides, inorganic phosphate, and β-glycero-P inhibit citrate binding. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP is the most potent of these agents. The results are discussed in connection with the allosteric kinetics and other physicochemical properties of phosphofructokinase."

This same preparation has now been shown to catalyze the new formation of chondroitin-14C sulfate. This formation requires the addition of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate as well as uridine diphosphate N-acetylgalactosamine and uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid-14C to the reaction mixture. The final products, which appear to be a mixture of approximately 25% chondroitin sulfate and 75% chondroitin, remain bound to the microsomal preparation.

The effect of chemical modification—viz. blocking of —SH groups and photooxidation—on biological properties, including ATP exchange, has been studied. These specific modifications permit the study of G-actin under conditions usually leading to polymerization. Calcium exchange has been compared with ATP exchange.

https://openalex.org/W1523255346,"Abstract Isolated rat liver mitochondria incubated with ethylene-diaminetetraacetate in the absence of added Mg++ show a loss of respiratory control toward ADP in a medium which contains Na+, while in a medium which contains K+, this function is preserved; respiratory control in these conditions is restored by including Mg++ into the mixture. On the other hand, mitochondria incubated in the sodium medium with ADP have adequate respiratory responses to added inorganic phosphate. Mitochondria incubated in the sodium medium in the absence of Mg++ also have a high rate of respiration in the absence of agents which stimulate oxygen uptake. This is accompanied by a loss in the sensitivity to 2,4-dinitrophenol. Rotenone stimulates a latent ATPase activity in mitochondria incubated with Na+ at concentrations which inhibit the oxidation of NADH. The data obtained seem to indicate that the rotenone site is the energy-coupling site and that K+, Mg++, and ADP may protect against the detrimental action of Na+ on this system. Evidence is also presented which suggests that ADP may regulate oligomycin-insensitive respiratory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1588303515,"Prolonged incubation with aldosterone causes an increase in the rate of sodium transport and in the rate of glycolysis in the urinary bladder of the toad (Bufo marinus) in vitro. When sodium transport was inhibited by ouabain after the effect of aldosterone was manifest, the rate of sodium transport as well as the rate of glycolysis fell to the same low value in aldosterone-treated tissue and in paired control tissue that had been incubated without hormone. When bladders were made anaerobic after the aldosterone effect was manifest, short circuit current fell in both preparations, but remained significantly higher in aldosterone-treated tissue than in paired control tissue. During anaerobiosis, the rate of lactate production was higher in aldosterone-treated tissue than in paired anaerobic control tissue. Thus the effect of aldosterone on glycolysis appears to be related to its effect on sodium transport and does not depend entirely upon oxidative metabolism. Measurement of the concentration of glycolytic intermediates and cofactors in tissue incubated with aldosterone indicated activation of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. There was no change in the concentration of adenosine mono-, di-, or triphosphate, or inorganic phosphate, but there was a fall in creatine phosphate and a rise in the concentration of creatine in aldosterone-treated tissue. This pattern is interpreted as indicating that the stimulation of sodium transport by aldosterone (or an aldosterone-induced protein) is a direct effect on sodium transport and not secondary to an effect of the hormone on energy production."

Among the amides studied, amides of nicotinic acid are hydrolyzed fastest; and among the esters studied, those of nicotinic acid are hydrolyzed fastest. A kinetic investigation of the hydrolysis of nicotinamide by the deamidase has revealed a number of unusual features including substrate activation, dependence of the pH optimum on substrate concentration, and apparent irreversibility of the reaction.

Restoration of ATPase activity and Ca++ transport with synthetic lecithin is accompanied by a decline of the phosphorylated intermediate concentration. Hydroxylamine inhibits the ATPase activity, Ca++ transport, and formation of phosphorylated intermediate in similar concentration. On the basis of its pH stability and sensitivity to hydroxylamine the phosphorylated intermediate is probably an acyl phosphate. A 32P-labeled peptide was separated by high voltage electrophoresis from a pepsin digest of 32P-labeled microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1607170702,"Abstract d-Fructose 1-phosphate kinase from Aerobacter aerogenes was purified 315-fold, and its properties, regulation, and reaction kinetics were compared with those of d-fructose 6-phosphate kinase from the same organism. d-Fructose-6-P kinase exhibited a sigmoidal dependence of rate on d-fructose-6-P concentration, whereas d-fructose-1-P kinase exhibited hyperbolic dependence of rate on d-fructose-1-P concentration. The apparent Km of d-fructose-1-P kinase for either substrate (d-fructose-1-P or ATP) did not vary with the concentration of the other substrate, which indicates a sequential mechanism of substrate binding. ATP inhibited both enzymes when the ratios of Mg++ to ATP concentrations were below 2:1; ATP inhibition of d-fructose-6-P kinase was relieved by Mg++, d-fructose-6-P, ADP, and various other nucleoside diphosphates, whereas ATP inhibition of d-fructose-1-P kinase was relieved by Mg++ only. Both enzymes showed a sigmoidal dependence of rate on Mg++ concentration; increased levels of d-fructose-6-P shifted the d-fructose-6-P kinase curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic, whereas d-fructose-1-P had no effect on a similar plot for d-fructose-1-P kinase. Other nucleoside triphosphates were used as phosphoryl donors by both enzymes and, unlike the situation with other described phosphofructokinases, inhibited activity when the ratios of Mg++ to nucleotide concentrations were below 2:1. In contrast with the result obtained with ATP, the inhibition of d-fructose-6-P kinase by other nucleoside triphosphates could not be relieved by d-fructose-6-P. The data indicate that, whereas d-fructose-6-P kinase exhibits allosteric properties and a regulatory pattern similar to those of d-fructose-6-P kinases from various other organisms, d-fructose-1-P kinase behaves more like a nonallosteric kinase. However, citrate (Ki 0.85 mm), d-fructose-1,6-di-P (Ki 4.4 mm), and d-fructose-6-P (Ki 1.0 mm) inhibited d-fructose-1-P kinase competitively with d-fructose-1-P, which suggests possible control of activity in vivo. The molecular weights of d-fructose-6-P kinase and d-fructose-1-P kinase were estimated to be 90,000 and 75,000, respectively. Other properties of the two phosphofructokinases, such as substrate specificity, Km values, pH optima, and stability, are also reported."
https://openalex.org/W1576139431,"Abstract In the absence of added Mg++, the inner membrane matrix fraction of rat liver mitochondria catalyzed an oligomycin-sensitive ADP-ATP exchange reaction but failed to catalyze significant transphosphorylations between the following substrate pairs: UDP-UTP, CDP-CTP, GDP-GTP, ADP-UTP, ADP-GTP, and ADP-ADP. The inner membrane matrix ADP-ATP exchange was inhibited by low concentrations of not only oligomycin, but also aurovertin, 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium oleate, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, atractyloside, p-chloromercuribenzoate, Ag+, Ca++, Sr++, and a salicylanilide-uncoupling agent. Phosphate in excess of 4.0 mm inhibited the ADP-ATP exchange, whereas lower concentrations of this anion were without effect. Large decreases of oligomycin-sensitive ADP-ATP exchange activity accompanied loss of acceptor control of respiration in the inner membrane matrix brought about by the following mild procedures: incubation at 37°, freezing and thawing, and titration with Mg++. Lubrol WX completely inhibited the oligomycin-sensitive exchange. In the absence of added Mg++, the inner membrane matrix also catalyzed an inorganic orthophosphate-ATP exchange reaction and oxidative phosphorylation at significantly high rates. Concentrations of atractyloside, oligomycin, and 2,4-dinitrophenol which maximally inhibited the ADP-ATP exchange also provided maximal inhibition of these activities. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that the oligomycin-sensitive ADP-ATP exchange is catalyzed by an enzyme system normally participating in oxidative phosphorylation. It is suggested that this enzyme system is most likely a highly ordered membrane complex containing, at the minimum, the mitochondrial ATPase, an oligomycin sensitivity-conferring factor, and a divalent cation."

https://openalex.org/W1510444079,"Abstract Two previously unreported metabolites of nicotinamide have been discovered as urinary excretion products of rats following intraperitoneal injection of nicotinamide-7-14C or nicotinic acid-7-14C. These compounds have been identified as 6-hydroxynicotinamide and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid by comparison of ultraviolet, infrared, and mass spectra and behavior on chromatography and electrophoresis with that of the authentic compounds. These compounds are also formed from nicotinamide and nicotinic acid by germ-free rats, indicating that they are produced in the tissues rather than by the intestinal flora. From 0.6 to 1.2% of the injected dose of either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide is excreted as 6-hydroxynicotinic acid and 6-hydroxynicotinamide."
https://openalex.org/W1589165636,"Abstract The distribution and properties of malate-Vitamin K reductase from Mycobacterium phlei have been investigated. This enzyme was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions, although the bulk of the malate-Vitamin K reductase was found in the soluble form. The reductases from the particulate and supernatant fraction appeared to be similar since they exhibited similar requirements for activity. In addition, the particulate-bound reductase was completely removed from the particles by washing with sucrose. However, divalent cations such as Mg++ or Mn++ appeared to bind the reductase to the particles. The phosphorylation associated with malate oxidation by the soluble malate-Vitamin K reductase has been resolved into a reductase fraction free of phosphorylation and a phosphorylating factor (or factors) free of the reductase. Both fractions were necessary for the phosphorylation associated with malate oxidation. The resolved system exhibited similar requirements for cofactors as those described for the crude enzyme. The resolved soluble fractions were tested with the complex particulate fraction. Addition of the purified reductase and FAD to the electron transport particles resulted in a stimulation of only oxidation with malate as the electron donor, and the further addition of the purified coupling factor (factors) was necessary for restoration of phosphorylation. The malate-Vitamin K reductase was inhibited by the presence of adenine nucleotides. The inhibition of oxidation was greater with AMP and ATP than with ADP. The inhibition of activity by the adenine nucleotides was reversed by the addition of FAD. Other components necessary for malate oxidation by this enzyme, such as Vitamin K1, phospholipid, magnesium ions and dye, failed to reverse the inhibition caused by the adenine nucleotides. The inhibition by the nucleotides and reversal by FAD were observed with both the particulate and soluble forms of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1501982680,"Abstract The activating effect of free ATP and the inhibitory effect of MgATP2- on the incorporation of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene into myosin were compared in skeletal and cardiac muscle of the rabbit, skeletal and smooth muscle of the chicken, and skeletal muscle of the cat and sloth. In all cases, the myosin with low ATPase activity (from rabbit cardiac, chicken smooth, and sloth skeletal muscle) showed less change in the ATP-mediated dinitrophenylation than the myosin with high ATPase activity (from rabbit, chicken, and cat skeletal muscle). Furthermore, no inhibitory effect of MgATP2- on the dinitrophenylation of chicken gizzard myosin was observed. These differences were found over a wide concentration range of free ATP, MgATP2-, ATP derivatives, and nucleoside triphosphates. It was concluded that the ATP-induced conformational change varies from one myosin to another. The relationship between ATP-induced changes in the dinitrophenylation of rabbit skeletal myosin and ATPase activity of this myosin was studied. The activating effect of free ATP on the incorporation of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene into myosin was less affected by various treatments than the ATPase activities of myosin. The inhibitory effect of MgATP2- on the dinitrophenylation of myosin was related to the inhibition of the actin- and Mg2+-activated ATPase activity of myosin produced by different agents and modification with iodoacetate. However, the MgATP2--regulated dinitrophenylation of myosin was more readily abolished by iodoacetamide or trinitrobenzenesulfonate than the actinand Mg2+-activated ATPase activity of myosin. These results indicate that the ATP-induced changes in the dinitrophenylation of myosin do not occur at the ATPase site. The incorporation of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene into several ATP-utilizing enzymes other than myosin was not increased by free ATP or decreased by MgATP2-."
https://openalex.org/W1534241925,"Abstract The binding of organic mercurial compounds to the proteins of kidney plasma membrane preparations has been examined following the administration in vivo of organic mercurial compounds labeled with 203Hg. When the kidney cells are fractionated, plasma membrane radioactivity is lower than radioactivity in the cytoplasm. The radioactivity appears to be bound to membrane protein and experiments with 14C-labeled p-chloromercuribenzoate and 3H-labeled chlormerodrin indicate that the binding 2 hours after administration is mostly that of free mercury. When plasma membranes are solubilized and chromatographed on 6% agarose gel, two major protein peaks are eluted. p-Chloromercuribenzoate label is localized primarily in the high molecular weight proteins of the initial void volume peak. Chlormerodrin, a compound with diuretic activity in the kidney, is distributed fairly evenly in the protein fractions of both column peaks. Electrophoretic data, however, suggest heterogeneity of the protein labeling by chlormerodrin. Sodium-potassium-dependent ATPase activity is found in several fractions of the first peak eluted from the agarose gel column. When ouabain, a known inhibitor of the ATPase system, is administered in vivo, it depresses the chlormerodrin radioactivity of the first peak."
