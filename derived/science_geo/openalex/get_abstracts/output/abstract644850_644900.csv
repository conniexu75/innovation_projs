https://openalex.org/W2997490540,"The metabolic pathways encoded by the human gut microbiome constantly interact with host gene products through numerous bioactive molecules1. Primary bile acids (BAs) are synthesized within hepatocytes and released into the duodenum to facilitate absorption of lipids or fat-soluble vitamins2. Some BAs (approximately 5%) escape into the colon, where gut commensal bacteria convert them into various intestinal BAs2 that are important hormones that regulate host cholesterol metabolism and energy balance via several nuclear receptors and/or G-protein-coupled receptors3,4. These receptors have pivotal roles in shaping host innate immune responses1,5. However, the effect of this host-microorganism biliary network on the adaptive immune system remains poorly characterized. Here we report that both dietary and microbial factors influence the composition of the gut BA pool and modulate an important population of colonic FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor RORγ. Genetic abolition of BA metabolic pathways in individual gut symbionts significantly decreases this Treg cell population. Restoration of the intestinal BA pool increases colonic RORγ+ Treg cell counts and ameliorates host susceptibility to inflammatory colitis via BA nuclear receptors. Thus, a pan-genomic biliary network interaction between hosts and their bacterial symbionts can control host immunological homeostasis via the resulting metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2997621205,"Metformin, the world’s most prescribed anti-diabetic drug, is also effective in preventing type 2 diabetes in people at high risk1,2. More than 60% of this effect is attributable to the ability of metformin to lower body weight in a sustained manner3. The molecular mechanisms by which metformin lowers body weight are unknown. Here we show—in two independent randomized controlled clinical trials—that metformin increases circulating levels of the peptide hormone growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which has been shown to reduce food intake and lower body weight through a brain-stem-restricted receptor. In wild-type mice, oral metformin increased circulating GDF15, with GDF15 expression increasing predominantly in the distal intestine and the kidney. Metformin prevented weight gain in response to a high-fat diet in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking GDF15 or its receptor GDNF family receptor α-like (GFRAL). In obese mice on a high-fat diet, the effects of metformin to reduce body weight were reversed by a GFRAL-antagonist antibody. Metformin had effects on both energy intake and energy expenditure that were dependent on GDF15, but retained its ability to lower circulating glucose levels in the absence of GDF15 activity. In summary, metformin elevates circulating levels of GDF15, which is necessary to obtain its beneficial effects on energy balance and body weight, major contributors to its action as a chemopreventive agent. In mouse studies, metformin treatment results in increased secretion of growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which prevents weight gain in response to high-fat diet, and GDF15-independent lowering of circulating blood glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2995345254,"Immune checkpoint therapy with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 has revolutionized the treatment of many solid tumors. However, the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy is limited to a subset of patients with specific tumor types1,2. Multiple clinical trials with combinatorial immune checkpoint strategies are ongoing; however, the mechanistic rationale for tumor-specific targeting of immune checkpoints is elusive. To garner an insight into tumor-specific immunomodulatory targets, we analyzed 94 patients representing five different cancer types, including those that respond relatively well to immune checkpoint therapy and those that do not, such as glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. Through mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a unique population of CD73hi macrophages in glioblastoma multiforme that persists after anti-PD-1 treatment. To test if targeting CD73 would be important for a successful combination strategy in glioblastoma multiforme, we performed reverse translational studies using CD73-/- mice. We found that the absence of CD73 improved survival in a murine model of glioblastoma multiforme treated with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1. Our data identified CD73 as a specific immunotherapeutic target to improve antitumor immune responses to immune checkpoint therapy in glioblastoma multiforme and demonstrate that comprehensive human and reverse translational studies can be used for rational design of combinatorial immune checkpoint strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2997409530,"The motor cortex controls skilled arm movement by sending temporal patterns of activity to lower motor centres1. Local cortical dynamics are thought to shape these patterns throughout movement execution2-4. External inputs have been implicated in setting the initial state of the motor cortex5,6, but they may also have a pattern-generating role. Here we dissect the contribution of local dynamics and inputs to cortical pattern generation during a prehension task in mice. Perturbing cortex to an aberrant state prevented movement initiation, but after the perturbation was released, cortex either bypassed the normal initial state and immediately generated the pattern that controls reaching or failed to generate this pattern. The difference in these two outcomes was probably a result of external inputs. We directly investigated the role of inputs by inactivating the thalamus; this perturbed cortical activity and disrupted limb kinematics at any stage of the movement. Activation of thalamocortical axon terminals at different frequencies disrupted cortical activity and arm movement in a graded manner. Simultaneous recordings revealed that both thalamic activity and the current state of cortex predicted changes in cortical activity. Thus, the pattern generator for dexterous arm movement is distributed across multiple, strongly interacting brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W3102083867,"Entangling gates for electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are generally based on exchange, a short-ranged interaction that requires wavefunction overlap. Coherent spin-photon coupling raises the prospect of using photons as long-distance interconnects for spin qubits. Realizing a key milestone for spin-based quantum information processing, we demonstrate microwave-mediated spin-spin interactions between two electrons that are physically separated by more than 4 mm. Coherent spin-photon coupling is demonstrated for each individual spin using microwave transmission spectroscopy. An enhanced vacuum Rabi splitting is observed when both spins are tuned into resonance with the cavity, indicative of a coherent spin-spin interaction. Our results demonstrate that microwave-frequency photons can be used as a resource to generate long-range two-qubit gates between spatially separated spins."
https://openalex.org/W2997624703,"Pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets have driven considerable reductions in malaria-associated morbidity and mortality in Africa since the beginning of the century1. The intense selection pressure exerted by bed nets has precipitated widespread and escalating resistance to pyrethroids in African Anopheles populations, threatening to reverse the gains that been made by malaria control2. Here we show that expression of a sensory appendage protein (SAP2), which is enriched in the legs, confers pyrethroid resistance to Anopheles gambiae. Expression of SAP2 is increased in insecticide-resistant populations and is further induced after the mosquito comes into contact with pyrethroids. SAP2 silencing fully restores mortality of the mosquitoes, whereas SAP2 overexpression results in increased resistance, probably owing to high-affinity binding of SAP2 to pyrethroid insecticides. Mining of genome sequence data reveals a selective sweep near the SAP2 locus in the mosquito populations of three West African countries (Cameroon, Guinea and Burkina Faso) with the observed increase in haplotype-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms mirroring the increasing resistance of mosquitoes to pyrethroids reported in Burkina Faso. Our study identifies a previously undescribed mechanism of insecticide resistance that is likely to be highly relevant to malaria control efforts."

https://openalex.org/W2995825260,"Bayesian models of behavior suggest that organisms represent uncertainty associated with sensory variables. However, the neural code of uncertainty remains elusive. A central hypothesis is that uncertainty is encoded in the population activity of cortical neurons in the form of likelihood functions. We tested this hypothesis by simultaneously recording population activity from primate visual cortex during a visual categorization task in which trial-to-trial uncertainty about stimulus orientation was relevant for the decision. We decoded the likelihood function from the trial-to-trial population activity and found that it predicted decisions better than a point estimate of orientation. This remained true when we conditioned on the true orientation, suggesting that internal fluctuations in neural activity drive behaviorally meaningful variations in the likelihood function. Our results establish the role of population-encoded likelihood functions in mediating behavior and provide a neural underpinning for Bayesian models of perception."

https://openalex.org/W2996077740,"De novo mutations arising on the paternal chromosome make the largest known contribution to autism risk, and correlate with paternal age at the time of conception. The recurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders is substantial, leading many families to decline future pregnancies, but the potential impact of assessing parental gonadal mosaicism has not been considered. We measured sperm mosaicism using deep-whole-genome sequencing, for variants both present in an offspring and evident only in father’s sperm, and identified single-nucleotide, structural and short tandem-repeat variants. We found that mosaicism quantification can stratify autism spectrum disorders recurrence risk due to de novo mutations into a vast majority with near 0% recurrence and a small fraction with a substantially higher and quantifiable risk, and we identify novel mosaic variants at risk for transmission to a future offspring. This suggests, therefore, that genetic counseling would benefit from the addition of sperm mosaicism assessment. Genetic analysis of paternal sperm from families with a child affected by autism reveals that the recurrent risk for transmitting disease-associated de novo mutations to future offspring is near 0% for most couples but is substantially higher for a small fraction of couples."

This study was conducted at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital located in a provincial area in Korea. The research design was based on Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt's Advancing Research & Clinical Practice through Close Collaboration model as the first step.A descriptive and cross-sectional design was conducted and a convenience sample of 521 full-time registered nurses from an 849-bed tertiary hospital were included. Structured questionnaires were used to assess EBP knowledge, EBP beliefs, organizational culture & readiness and EBP implementation. Data were analyzed using SPSS V 25.0 by using descriptive and inferential statistics and hierarchical multiple regression was performed to determine the factors affecting the implementation of EBP.Our findings showed that the clinical nurses had a positive level of EBP beliefs, but the level of EBP knowledge, organizational readiness and EBP implementation were insufficient. EBP knowledge, beliefs, and organizational readiness were significantly positively correlated with EBP implementation. In the final model, EBP knowledge and organizational readiness were significant predictors of EBP implementation; the model predicted 22.2% of the variance in implementation.Based on these results, the main focus of the study was the importance of individual nurses' efforts in carrying out EBP, but above all efforts to create an organizational culture to prepare and support EBP at the nursing organization level. In the initial process of introducing and establishing EBP, nurse administrators will need to minimize expected barriers, enhance facilitators, and strive to build an infrastructure based on vision, policy-making, budgeting, excellent personnel and facilities within the organization."

https://openalex.org/W2996627302,"Genetic risk factors frequently affect multiple common human diseases, providing insight into shared pathophysiological pathways and opportunities for therapeutic development. However, systematic identification of genetic profiles of disease risk is limited by the availability of both comprehensive clinical data on population-scale cohorts and the lack of suitable statistical methodology that can handle the scale of and differential power inherent in multi-phenotype data. Here, we develop a disease-agnostic approach to cluster the genetic risk profiles for 3,025 genome-wide independent loci across 19,155 disease classification codes from 320,644 participants in the UK Biobank, representing a large and heterogeneous population. We identify 339 distinct disease association profiles and use multiple approaches to link clusters to the underlying biological pathways. We show how clusters can decompose the variance and covariance in risk for disease, thereby identifying underlying biological processes and their impact. We demonstrate the use of clusters in defining disease relationships and their potential in informing therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2997551078,"To date, little is known about differences in the knowledge, diagnosis making and treatment strategies of health care providers regarding polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) across different disciplines in countries with similar health care systems. To inform guideline translation, we aimed to study physician reported awareness, diagnosis and management of PCOS and to explore differences between medical disciplines in the Nordic countries and Estonia.This cross-sectional survey was conducted among 382 endocrinologists and obstetrician-gynaecologists in the Nordic countries and Estonia in 2015-2016. Of the participating physicians, 43% resided in Finland, 18% in Denmark, 16% in Norway, 13% in Estonia, and 10% in Sweden or Iceland, and 75% were obstetrician-gynaecologists. Multivariable logistic regression models were run to identify health care provider characteristics for awareness, diagnosis and treatment of PCOS.Clinical features, lifestyle management and comorbidity were commonly recognized in women with PCOS, while impairment in psychosocial wellbeing was not well acknowledged. Over two-thirds of the physicians used the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Medical endocrinologists more often recommended lifestyle management (OR = 3.6, CI 1.6-8.1) or metformin (OR = 5.0, CI 2.5-10.2), but less frequently OCP (OR = 0.5, CI 0.2-0.9) for non-fertility concerns than general obstetrician-gynaecologists. The physicians aged <35 years were 2.2 times (95% CI 1.1-4.3) more likely than older physicians to recommend lifestyle management for patients with PCOS for fertility concerns. Physicians aged 46-55 years were less likely to recommend oral contraceptive pills (OCP) for patients with PCOS than physicians aged >56 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8).Despite well-organized healthcare, awareness, diagnosis and management of PCOS is suboptimal, especially in relation to psychosocial comorbidities, among physicians in the Nordic countries and Estonia. Physicians need more education on PCOS and evidence-based information on Rotterdam diagnostic criteria, psychosocial features and treatment of PCOS, with the recently published international PCOS guideline well needed and welcomed."
https://openalex.org/W2998217741,"Phage therapy offers a potential alternate strategy for the treatment of peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI), particularly where limited effective antibiotics are available. We undertook preclinical trials to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of a phage cocktail, alone and in combination with vancomycin, to reduce bacterial numbers within the infected joint using a clinically-relevant model of Staphylococcus aureus-induced PJI. Infected animals were randomised to 4 treatment groups, with treatment commencing 21-days post-surgery: bacteriophage alone, vancomycin alone, bacteriophage and vancomycin, and sham. At day 28 post-surgery, animals were euthanised for microbiological and immunological assessment of implanted joints. Treatment with phage alone or vancomycin alone, led to 5-fold and 6.2-fold reductions, respectively in bacterial load within peri-implant tissue compared to sham-treated animals. Compared to sham-treated animals, a 22.5-fold reduction in S. aureus burden was observed within joint tissue of animals that were administered phage in combination with vancomycin, corresponding with decreased swelling in the implanted knee. Microbiological data were supported by evidence of decreased inflammation within the joints of animals administered phage in combination with vancomycin, compared to sham-treated animals. Our findings provide further support for phage therapy as a tolerable and effective adjunct treatment for PJI."
https://openalex.org/W2993417849,"Objectives The mainstay treatment for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM) is surgical decompression. Not all cases, however, are suitable for surgery. Recent international guidelines advise surgery for moderate to severe disease as well as progressive mild disease. The goal of this study was to examine the factors in current practice that drive the decision to operate in DCM. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods 1 year of cervical spine MRI scans (N = 1123) were reviewed to identify patients with DCM with sufficient clinical documentation (N = 39). Variables at surgical assessment were recorded: age, sex, clinical signs and symptoms of DCM, disease severity, and quantitative MRI measures of cord compression. Bivariate correlations were used to compare each variable with the decision to offer the patient an operation. Subsequent multivariable analysis incorporated all significant bivariate correlations. Results Of the 39 patients identified, 25 (64%) were offered an operation. The decision to operate was significantly associated with narrower non-pathological canal and cord diameters as well as cord compression ratio, explaining 50% of the variance. In a multivariable model, only cord compression ratio was significant (p = 0.017). Examination findings, symptoms, functional disability, disease severity, disease progression, and demographic factors were all non-significant. Conclusions Cord compression emerged as the main factor in surgical decision-making prior to the publication of recent guidelines. Newly identified predictors of post-operative outcome were not significantly associated with decision to operate."
https://openalex.org/W2995730046,"With large-scale population sequencing projects gathering pace, there is a need for strategies that advance disease gene prioritization1,2. Metrics that provide information about a gene and its ability to tolerate protein-altering variation can aid in clinical interpretation of human genomes and can advance disease gene discovery1–4. Previous reported methods analyzed the total variant load in a gene1–4, but did not analyze the distribution pattern of variants within a gene. Using data from 138,632 exome and genome sequences2, we developed gene variation intolerance rank (GeVIR), a continuous gene-level metric for 19,361 genes that is able to prioritize both dominant and recessive Mendelian disease genes5, that outperforms missense constraint metrics3 and that is comparable—but complementary—to loss-of-function (LOF) constraint metrics2. GeVIR is also able to prioritize short genes, for which LOF constraint cannot be estimated with confidence2. The majority of the most intolerant genes identified here have no defined phenotype and are candidates for severe dominant disorders. GeVIR is a continuous gene-level metric that uses variant distribution patterns to prioritize both dominant and recessive Mendelian disease genes. GeVIR outperforms missense constraint metrics and complements loss-of-function constraint metrics."

https://openalex.org/W2996357283,"DNA-damage repair is implemented by proteins that are coordinated by specialized molecular signals. One such signal in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks is the site-specific monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. The signal is mediated by a multiprotein FA core complex (FA-CC) however, the mechanics for precise ubiquitination remain elusive. We show that FANCL, the RING-bearing module in FA-CC, allosterically activates its cognate ubiqutin-conjugating enzyme E2 UBE2T to drive site-specific FANCD2 ubiquitination. Unlike typical RING E3 ligases, FANCL catalyzes ubiquitination by rewiring the intraresidue network of UBE2T to influence the active site. Consequently, a basic triad unique to UBE2T engages a structured acidic patch near the target lysine on FANCD2. This three-dimensional complementarity, between the E2 active site and substrate surface, induced by FANCL is central to site-specific monoubiquitination in the FA pathway. Furthermore, the allosteric network of UBE2T can be engineered to enhance FANCL-catalyzed FANCD2-FANCI di-monoubiquitination without compromising site specificity."

This study assessed pastoralists' knowledge and practices regarding AMU in lactating cows; and risk pathways for AMR dissemination from cow milk to humans.Interview questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Fulani pastoral communities. Frequencies and proportions were used for descriptive statistics. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regressions were used for analytic statistics at 95% confidence level.All recruited 384 pastoral households participated. About 11% of participants indicated antimicrobials misuse as when given at under-dose, while 58.9% had no knowledge of what antimicrobial misuse entailed. Most participants (51.6%) were unaware about effects of improper AMU. Most respondents (61.7%) reported self-prescription of antimicrobials used on cows. Also, 67.4% of respondents reported arbitrary applications of antimicrobials used in cows, while 15% used antimicrobials to increase milk yield. Frequently used antimicrobials were: tetracycline (98.7%), penicillin (96.6%), streptomycin (95.8%) and sulfonamides (95.3%). Consumption of raw milk and milk products (p = 0.010); contacts with contaminated udder (p = 0.002); and aerosols of discarded contaminated milk P = 0.001) were perceived risk pathways for spread of antimicrobial resistance from cow milk. Improper AMU (p<0.001), non-enforcement of regulating laws (p<0.001), weak financial status (p<0.001), and low education and expertise (p<0.001) influenced antimicrobials misuse in lactating cows.This study highlighted low levels of knowledge, risk perceptions and practices regarding AMU and AMR among survey pastoralists. This calls for education of the vulnerable populations on promotion of prudent AMU in lactating cows through 'One Health' approach, to assure food safety, food security, and public and environmental health."
https://openalex.org/W2998305543,"Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a sensory phenomenon commonly characterized by pleasant tingling sensations arising from the back of the head and accompanied by feelings of relaxation and calmness. Although research has found ASMR to have a distinct physiological pattern with increased skin conductance levels and reduced heart rate, the specific tingles felt in ASMR have not received much investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the physiology and characteristics of ASMR further by examining whether experiencing ASMR is visible from the pupil of the eye. A total of 91 participants were recruited and assigned to three different groups based on their experience of ASMR (ASMR vs. non-ASMR vs. unsure). Participants were instructed to watch a control video and an ASMR video and to report any tingling sensations by pressing down a button on the keyboard. Pupil diameter was measured over the duration of both videos using a tower-mounted eye tracker. Data was analyzed on a general level, averaging pupil diameter over each video, as well as on a more specific level, comparing pupil diameter during reported episodes of tingling sensations to pupil diameter outside of those episodes. On the general level, results revealed no significant differences between the groups. On the specific level, however, the tingling sensations experienced in ASMR were found to cause statistically significant increases in pupil diameter, demonstrating that they have a physiological basis. The results of the study further reinforce the credibility of ASMR and suggest that the tingles felt in ASMR are at the very core of the experience itself."

Life skills- based interventions using peer enforcement have been introduced as effective program to improve adolescents’ emotional and behavioral health. Therefore, the current randomized control study aimed to determine, if a life skills-based intervention could improve the emotional health and self-esteem among Malaysian adolescents in orphanages. Overall, 271 male and female adolescents (13–18 years old) from 8 orphanages in Klang valley, Malaysia participated in the study. Comparing the intervention to control group within 3 points of time, the finding of the study showed that immediately after finishing the interventional sessions (post-test), the mean scores of depression (F = 33.80, P<0.001, η2 = 0.11), anxiety (F = 6.28, P = 0.01, η2 = 0.02), stress (F = 32.05, P<0.001, η2 = 0.11) and self-esteem (F = 54.68, P<0.001, η2 = 0.17) were significantly decreased compared to the pre-test values. However, there was no significant difference between two groups in the depression mean scores (F = 2.33, P = 0.13). Regarding to the interaction between group and test a significant change was seen in the mean score of all 4 variables including depression (F = 31.04, P<0.001, η2 = 0.10), anxiety (F = 14.21, P<0.001, η2 = 0.05), stress (F = 15.67, P<0.001, η2 = 0.06) and self-esteem (F = 13.29, P<0.001, η2 = 0.05).

We performed precise ACE phenotyping in tissues from subjects with lung cancer.ACE phenotyping included: 1) ACE immunohistochemistry with specific and well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to ACE; 2) ACE activity measurement with two ACE substrates (HHL, ZPHL); 3) calculation of ACE substrates hydrolysis ratio (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 4) the pattern of mAbs binding to 17 different ACE epitopes to detect changes in ACE conformation induced by tumor growth (conformational ACE fingerprint).ACE immunostaining was dramatically decreased in lung cancer tissues confirmed by a 3-fold decrease in ACE activity. The conformational fingerprint of ACE from tumor lung tissues differed from normal lung (6/17 mAbs) and reflected primarily higher ACE sialylation. The increase in ZPHL/HHL ratio in lung cancer tissues was consistent with greater conformational changes of ACE. Limited analysis of the conformational ACE fingerprint in normal lung tissue and lung cancer tissue form the same patient suggested a remote effect of tumor tissue on ACE conformation and/or on ""field cancerization"" in a morphologically-normal lung tissues.Local conformation of ACE is significantly altered in tumor lung tissues and may be detected by conformational fingerprinting of human ACE."
https://openalex.org/W2997966006,"Kuwait is a semi-arid region with soils that are relatively nitrogen-poor. Thus, biological nitrogen fixation is an important natural process in which N2-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) convert atmospheric nitrogen into plant-usable forms such as ammonium and nitrate. Currently, there is limited information on free-living and root-associated nitrogen-fixing bacteria and their potential to fix nitrogen and aid natural plant communities in the Kuwait desert. In this study, free living N2-fixing diazotrophs were enriched and isolated from the rhizosphere soil associated with three native keystone plant species; Rhanterium epapposum, Farsetia aegyptia, and Haloxylon salicornicum. Root-associated bacteria were isolated from the root nodules of Vachellia pachyceras. The result showed that the strains were clustered in five groups represented by class: γ-proteobacteria, and α-proteobacteria; phyla: Actinobacteria being the most dominant, followed by phyla: Firmicutes, and class: β-proteobacteria. This study initially identified 50 nitrogen-fixers by16S rRNA gene sequencing, of which 78% were confirmed to be nitrogen-fixers using the acetylene reduction assay. Among the nitrogen fixers identified, the genus Rhizobium was predominant in the rhizosphere soil of R. epapposum and H. salicornicum, whereas Pseudomonas was predominant in the rhizosphere soil of F. aegyptia, The species Agrobacterium tumefaciens was mainly found to be dominant among the root nodules of V. pachyceras and followed by Cellulomonas, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas genera as root-associated bacteria. The variety of diazotrophs revealed in this study, signifying the enormous importance of free-living and root-associated bacteria in extreme conditions and suggesting potential ecological importance of diazotrophs in arid ecosystem.

https://openalex.org/W2998671467,"In quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), data are normalized using reference genes, which helps to control for internal differences and reduce error among samples. In this study, the expression profiles of eight candidate housekeeping genes, 18S ribosomal (18S rRNA), elongation factor (EF1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10), ribosomal protein L17 (RPL17), histone 3 (H3), arginine kinase (AK), amd β-Actin (ACTB), were evaluated in the parasitic wasp Cotesia chilonis in response to different temperatures. Specifically, the performance and stabilities of these genes were compared in adult wasps maintained in a growth condition at 27°C (normal storage conditions) and in adults obtained from pupae refrigerated at 4°C for five days (cold storage conditions). Data were analyzed using the ΔCt method, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and geNorm. The optimal numbers and stabilities of reference genes varied between the two temperature treatments (27°C and 4°C). In samples stored at normal developmental temperature (27°C), the requirement for normalization in response to low temperature exposures was three genes (18S, H3, AK), whereas normalization in response to high temperature exposures required only two reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB). In samples stored at cold temperature (4°C), for low temperature exposures two reference genes (RPL17, RPL10) were required for standardization, while following high temperature exposures three reference genes (18S, H3, ACTB) were needed. This study strengthens understanding of the selection of reference genes before qRT-PCR analysis in C. chilonis. The reference genes identified here will facilitate further investigations of the biological characteristics of this important parasitoid."
https://openalex.org/W2996863301,"Background Paraquat is one of the most effective herbicides used to control weeds in agricultural management, while the pernicious weed goosegrass (Eleusine indica) has evolved resistance to herbicides, including paraquat. Polyamines provide high-level paraquat resistance in many plants. In the present study, we selected three polyamines, namely, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, as putative genes to investigate their correlation with paraquat resistance by using paraquat-resistant (R) and paraquat-susceptible (S) goosegrass populations. Results There was no significant difference in the putrescine nor spermine content between the R and S biotypes. However, 30 and 90 min after paraquat treatment, the spermidine concentration was 346.14-fold and 421.04-fold (P < 0.001) higher in the R biotype than in the S biotype, but the spermidine concentration was drastically reduced to a marginal level after 90 min. Since the transcript level of PqE was low while the spermidine concentration showed a transient increase, the PqE gene was likely involved in the synthesis of the paraquat resistance mechanism, regulation of polyamine content, and synthesis of spermidine and spermine. PqTS1, PqTS2, and PqTS3 encode transporter proteins involved in the regulation of paraquat concentration but showed different transcription patterns with synchronous changes in polyamine content. Conclusion Endogenous polyamines (especially spermidine) play a vital role in paraquat resistance in goosegrass. PqE, PqTS1, PqTS2, and PqTS3 were speculated on the relationship between polyamine metabolism and paraquat resistance. To validate the roles of PqE, PqTS1, PqTS2, and PqTS3 in polyamine transport systems, further research is needed."

Among the TBE cases, 89.92% were reported in forest areas (41.94% in DaXingAnLing, 8.70% in XiaoXingAnLing, and 39.21% in ChangBaiShan) in northeast China. The TBE cases were primarily male with a proportion of 67.15% (2,259/3,364 cases) and in 40–49-year age group with a proportion of 31.89% (1,073/3,364 cases). The epidemiology of TBE differed slightly among the three forest regions. Domestic workers and forestry workers accounted for the most of the TBE cases in DaXingAnLing, and domestic workers and farmers in XiaoXingAnLing and ChangBaiShan, respectively. The TBE cases mainly occurred from April to August with a peak in June. The TBE laboratory confirmed rate in DaXingAnLing (84.14%, 1,189/1,413 cases) was highest, compared with XiaoXingAnLing and ChangBaiShan (13.99% and 11.37%, respectively). Moreover, the hospital with the highest laboratory confirmed rate (88.01%, 1,336/1,518 cases) was Inner Mongolia Forestry General Hospital of DaXingAnling region. Systematic enhanced TBE surveillance and a vaccination program are needed to improve the laboratory confirmed rate and reduce the incidence of TBE in northeast China."
https://openalex.org/W2997249193,"Background To investigate the association of systemic, serum lipids and genetic variants in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolic pathway with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in China. Methods The case-control study was included 150 controls and 66 cases with PCV. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), HDL, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein B (APOB) together with systemic risk factors including gender, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and asthma were identified. All subjects were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from three genes in the HDL metabolic pathway: rs10468017 of hepatic lipase (LIPC), rs12678919 of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), rs3764261 and rs173539 of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Student’s t-tests, chi-square tests, anova and logistic regression were used to evaluate associations. Results Hyperlipidemia was a risk factor (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, P = 0.001) for PCV. HDL, LDL and APOB levels were associated with PCV (OR = 0.001, P = 0.004; OR = 0.099, P = 0.010; OR = 0.839, P = 0.018). Higher level of TC was potently associated with increased risk of PCV (OR = 109.8, P = 0.000). LIPC rs10468017 was a risk factor for PCV (OR = 11.68, P = 0.000). CETP rs3764261 conferred a decreased risk for PCV (OR = 0.08, P = 0.000). No associations of LPL rs12678919 or CETP rs173539 with PCV were found. Mean level of HDL increased with T allele of the CETP gene (p = 0.026): 1.24 mmol/L (±0.31) for the GG genotype and 1.66 mmol/L (±0.54) for the TT genotype. Additionally, T allele was associated with the following increase in APOA1: 136.78 mg/dl (±20.53) for the CC genotype and 149.57 mg/dl (±22.67) for the TT genotype of LIPC and 137.91 mg/dl (±20.36) for the GG genotype and 162.67 mg/dl (±22.50) for the TT genotype of CETP gene. Conclusion Our study suggested that the significant association was found between hyperlipidemia, the serum levels of TC, HDL, LDL and APOB and PCV. The result of present study also showed that the association of LIPC rs10468017 and CETP rs3764261 with PCV."
https://openalex.org/W2997442018,"The ecological requirements of brown bears are poorly known in the Himalaya region, which complicates conservation efforts. We documented the diet of the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) by combining classical scat analysis and a newly developed molecular genetic technique (the trnL approach), in Deosai National Park, Pakistan. Brown bears consumed over 50 plant species, invertebrates, ungulates, and several rodents. Eight plant families; Poaceae, Polygonaceae, Cyperaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Lamiaceae, and Rubiaceae were commonly eaten with graminoids comprising the bulk of the diet. Golden marmots comprised the major mammalian biomass in the park, and were also the main meat source for bears. Animal matter, making 36% of dietary content, contributed half of the digestible energy, due to its higher nutritious value. We did not find a significant temporal pattern in diet, perhaps because the availability of the major diet (graminoids) did not change over the foraging period. Male brown bears were more carnivorous than females, probably because of their larger size, which requires higher energy and also makes them more efficient in capturing marmots. Frequencies of three plant species were also significantly higher in male brown bears; Bistorta affinis, Carex diluta, and Carex sp. Diet of the brown bear differed significantly between the park and surrounding valleys. In valleys, diet consisted predominantly of graminoids and crops, whereas the park provided more nutritious and diverse foodThe estimated digestible energy available to brown bears in Deosai was the lowest documented among brown bear populations, due to the lack of fruits and a relatively lower meat content. The low nutritious diet and high cost of metabolism in a high-altitude environment, probably explains the very low reproductive potential of this population."
https://openalex.org/W2998215338,"To comprehensively characterize the metabolic roles of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), metabolites in two CHH target tissues of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, whose levels were significantly different between CHH knockdown and control (saline-treated) animals, were analyzed using bioinformatics tools provided by an on-line analysis suite (MetaboAnalyst). Analysis with Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) indicated that in the muscle Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, Pyruvate metabolism, and Nitrogen metabolism were significantly affected by silencing of CHH gene expression at 24 hours post injection (hpi), while only Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism remained significantly affected at 48 hpi. In the hepatopancreas, silencing of CHH gene expression significantly impacted, at 24 hpi, Pyruvate metabolism and Glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, and at 48 hpi, Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. Moreover, analysis using Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) showed that many metabolite sets were significantly affected in the muscle at 24hpi, including Ammonia recycling, Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, Pyruvate metabolism, Purine metabolism, Warburg effect, Citric acid cycle, and metabolism of several amino acids, and at 48 hpi only Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, Glycine and serine metabolism, and Ammonia recycling remained significantly affected. In the hepatopancreas, MSEA analysis showed that Fatty acid biosynthesis was significantly impacted at 24 hpi. Finally, in the muscle, levels of several amino acids decreased significantly, while those of 5 other amino acids or related compounds significantly increased in response to CHH gene silencing. Levels of metabolites related to nucleotide metabolism significantly decreased across the board at both time points. In the hepatopancreas, the effects were comparatively minor with only levels of thymine and urea being significantly decreased at 24 hpi. The combined results showed that the metabolic effects of silencing CHH gene expression were far more diverse than suggested by previous studies that emphasized on carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Based on the results, metabolic roles of CHH on the muscle and hepatopancreas are suggested: CHH promotes carbohydrate utilization in the hepatopancreas via stimulating glycolysis and lipolysis, while its stimulatory effect on nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism plays a central role in coordinating metabolic activity in the muscle with diverse and wide-ranging consequences, including enhancing the fluxes of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway, leading to increased ATP supply and elevated protein and nucleic acid turnovers."
https://openalex.org/W2997035534,"During mitosis, the structure of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) displays a dramatic reorganization and remodeling, however, the mechanism driving these changes is poorly understood. Hairpin-containing ER transmembrane proteins that stabilize ER tubules have been identified as possible factors to promote these drastic changes in ER morphology. Recently, the Reticulon and REEP family of ER shaping proteins have been shown to heavily influence ER morphology by driving the formation of ER tubules, which are known for their close proximity with microtubules. Here, we examine the role of microtubules and other cytoskeletal factors in the dynamics of a Drosophila Reticulon, Reticulon-like 1 (Rtnl1), localization to spindle poles during mitosis in the early embryo. At prometaphase, Rtnl1 is enriched to spindle poles just prior to the ER retention motif KDEL, suggesting a possible recruitment role for Rtnl1 in the bulk localization of ER to spindle poles. Using image analysis-based methods and precise temporal injections of cytoskeletal inhibitors in the early syncytial Drosophila embryo, we show that microtubules are necessary for proper Rtnl1 localization to spindles during mitosis. Lastly, we show that astral microtubules, not microfilaments, are necessary for proper Rtnl1 localization to spindle poles, and is largely independent of the minus-end directed motor protein dynein. This work highlights the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in Rtnl1 localization to spindles during mitosis and sheds light on a pathway towards inheritance of this major organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2997579059,"The objective of this study was to understand how pain patients and health care providers (HCPs) are engaging on Twitter and what insights this engagement might provide. By identifying how information is spread by and between these audiences, organizations such as patient advocacy groups may be better poised to develop and share materials that facilitate online communication between HCPs and pain patients, with an end goal of improving a shared decision-making process around pain management. We analyzed the Twitter audiences most engaged on pain topics by conducting a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of a large network of connected users on Twitter. The analysis segmented users based on the sources they cited and measured their influence based on who follows them. As a point of comparison, we also conducted an SNA of Twitter audiences most engaged on oncology topics. Oncology was chosen as a comparison due to what was perceived to be a highly developed online network of both patients and physicians. The populations included in this research included 12,086 accounts that were highly engaged on pain-related topics, and 12,617 accounts that were highly engaged on oncology-related topics. Network statistics were generated for variables including: word use, sources cited, retweets, and mentions. We also statistically analyzed the Twitter follow relationships among select HCPs and patient groups within each SNA. The creation of separate pain and oncology SNAs allowed the team to compare relationships and engagement related to these topics. We found that on Twitter, pain patients and providers appear to interact less than oncology patients and providers. Pain patients do not appear to follow medical professionals or share medical or health-related information on Twitter to the same extent as oncology patients. In addition, we found that pain patients do not communicate on Twitter in the same language as HCPs. Our results are important because they underscore that challenges in communication are not just problematic in face-to-face interactions, but also in digital social network (Twitter) interactions, serving as an additional roadblock to what can be shared decision-making opportunities around pain management. Contributing to this roadblock is access to quality information and a potential need for an online, evidence-based resource hub that could benefit the pain patient community in the same way that cancer.gov serves as a source of aggregated materials for oncology patients and HCPs. This study is an illustration of how social media networks like Twitter can be used to better understand the relationships, language gaps, and shared resources between pain patients and providers and offers a template for using digital social network (Twitter) interactions to research other difficult-to-treat or rare disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2996859301,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) represent neuronal activity in the brain elicited by external visual or auditory stimulation and are widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The ERP responses are elicited a few milliseconds after attending to an oddball stimulus; target and non-target stimuli are repeatedly flashed, and the ERP trials are averaged over time in order to improve their decoding accuracy. To reduce this time-consuming process, previous studies have attempted to evoke stronger ERP responses by changing certain experimental parameters like color, size, or the use of a face image as a target symbol. Since these exogenous potentials can be naturally evoked by merely looking at a target symbol, the BCI system could generate unintended commands while subjects are gazing at one of the symbols in a non-intentional mental state. We approached this problem of unintended command generation by assuming that a greater effort by the user in a short-term imagery task would evoke a discriminative ERP response. Three tasks were defined: passive attention, counting, and pitch-imagery. Users were instructed to passively attend to a target symbol, or to perform a mental tally of the number of target presentations, or to perform the novel task of imagining a high-pitch tone when the target symbol was highlighted. The decoding accuracy were 71.4%, 83.5%, and 89.2% for passive attention, counting, and pitch-imagery, respectively, after the fourth averaging procedure. We found stronger deflections in the N500 component corresponding to the levels of mental effort (passive attention: -1.094 ±0.88 μV, counting: -2.226 ±0.97 μV, and pitch-imagery: -2.883 ±0.74 μV), which highly influenced the decoding accuracy. In addition, the rate of binary classification between passive attention and pitch-imagery tasks was 73.5%, which is an adequate classification rate that motivated us to propose a two-stage classification strategy wherein the target symbols are estimated in the first stage and the passive or active mental state is decoded in the second stage. In this study, we found that the ERP response and the decoding accuracy are highly influenced by the user’s voluntary mental tasks. This could lead to a useful approach in practical ERP systems in two respects. Firstly, the user-voluntary tasks can be easily utilized in many different types of BCI systems, and performance enhancement is less dependent on the manipulation of the system’s external, visual stimulus parameters. Secondly, we propose an ERP system that classifies the brain state as intended or unintended by considering the measurable differences between passively gazing and actively performing the pitch-imagery tasks in the EEG signal thus minimizing unintended commands to the BCI system."
https://openalex.org/W2997039570,"A link between adversity, including low socio-economic status, and behaviours which carry health risks, such as alcohol consumption, has often been observed. The causes of this link are, however, poorly understood, making it difficult to explain why the association is often not linear and why there is so much variability between groups and individuals facing similar adversity. We investigate the use of the concept of emergent properties in explaining the link and its non-linear nature. `Emergent properties’ arise from the interaction of factors or items in a high-level system which, as a result, has qualities possessed by none of the individual factors. We apply a mixed methods approach to examine the association of an example emergent property, hope, and alcohol consumption among adolescents in a rural South African site. We found that among adolescents living in similar contexts, there was enough variance in reported levels of hope, that an association with alcohol use could be identified. This result is cause for optimism regarding the potential use of emergent properties in explaining variations in risk behaviour. Improving our measurement of emergent properties is perhaps the biggest challenge facing this approach. More work is needed to take further the task of identifying emergent properties capable of distilling the influence of lower level variables into single measures useful for analysis and policy purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2997173967,"Alterations of the PALB2 tumor suppressor gene have been identified in familial breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer cases. PALB2 cooperates with BRCA1/2 proteins through physical interaction in initiation of homologous recombination, in maintenance of genome integrity following DNA double-strand breaks. To determine if the role of PALB2 as a linker between BRCA1 and BRCA2 is critical for BRCA1/2-mediated tumor suppression, we generated Palb2 mouse pancreatic cancer models and compared tumor latencies, phenotypes and drug responses with previously generated Brca1/2 pancreatic cancer models. For development of Palb2 pancreatic cancer, we crossed conditional Palb2 null mouse with mice carrying the KrasG12D; p53R270H; Pdx1-Cre (KPC) constructs, and these animals were observed for pancreatic tumor development. Individual deletion of Palb2, Brca1 or Brca2 genes in pancreas per se using Pdx1-Cre was insufficient to cause tumors, but it reduced pancreata size. Concurrent expression of mutant KrasG12D and p53R270H, with tumor suppressor inactivated strains in Palb2-KPC, Brca1-KPC or Brca2-KPC, accelerated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. Moreover, most Brca1-KPC and some Palb2-KPC animals developed mucinous cystic neoplasms with PDAC, while Brca2-KPC and KPC animals did not. 26% of Palb2-KPC mice developed MCNs in pancreata, which resemble closely the Brca1 deficient tumors. However, the remaining 74% of Palb2-KPC animals developed PDACs without any cysts like Brca2 deficient tumors. In addition, the number of ADM lesions and immune cells infiltrations (CD3+ and F/480+) were significantly increased in Brca1-KPC tumors, but not in Brca2-KPC tumors. Interestingly, the level of ADM lesions and infiltration of CD3+ or F/480+ cells in Palb2-KPC tumors were intermediate between Brca1-KPC and Brca2-KPC tumors. As expected, disruption of Palb2 and Brca1/2 sensitized tumor cells to DNA damaging agents in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, Palb2-KPC PDAC exhibited features observed in both Brca1-KPC and Brca2-KPC tumors, which could be due to its role, as a linker between Brca1 and Brca2."

The present study presents a method to generate models by combining existing models and to propose the von Bertalanffy-Gompertz two-compartment model based on this method. The proposed model was compared with the logistic two-compartment one to indicate which best describes the kinetic curve of gas production through the semi-automated in vitro technique from different pinto peanut cultivars. The data came from an experiment grown and harvested at the Far South Animal Sciences station (Essul) in Itabela, BA, Brazil and gas production was read at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 24, 28, 32, 48, 72, and 96 h after the start of the in vitro fermentation process. The parameters were estimated by the least squares method using the iterative Gauss-Newton process in the software R version 3.4.1. The best model to describe gas accumulation was based on the adjusted coefficient of determination, residual mean squares, mean absolute deviation, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion. The von Bertalanffy-Gompertz two-compartment model had the best fit to describe the cumulative gas production over time according to the methodology and conditions of the present study."
https://openalex.org/W2997318217,"One of the most important susceptibility loci for cancer is the 8q24 human chromosomal region. The non-protein coding gene locus plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is located at 8q24 and is dysregulated in prostate cancer. PVT1 gives rise to multiple transcripts which may have different functions. Here, we describe a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assay for copy number-based quantitation of PVT1 exons 4A, 4B, and 9 to enable accurate, reproducible, and quantifiable detection.PVT1 exons 4A, 4B, and 9 were cloned into a plasmid vector to create standards for subsequent creation of linear standard curves representing a broad range of concentrations. PCR was carried out using SYBR-Green signal detection to quantify PVT1 exons 4A, 4B, and 9. The efficacy of this assay was evaluated by using it to detect these transcripts in prostate epithelial and prostate cancer cell lines, normal and cancerous human prostate tissues, human serum, mouse plasma, and urine samples.The results indicate that the assay can be used to quantify both low and high copy numbers of PVT1-derived transcripts. This is the first report of a copy number-based quantification assay for non-invasive detection of PVT1 derived transcripts.This novel assay holds promise for routine non-invasive testing in diseases where PVT1 is dysregulated."

https://openalex.org/W2997844078,"Recent advances in computer-aided text analysis (CATA) have allowed organizational scientists to construct reliable and convenient measures from open texts. As yet, there is a lack of research into using CATA to analyze responses to open survey questions and constructing text-based measures of psychological constructs. In our study, we demonstrated the potential of CATA methods for the construction of text-based job satisfaction measures based on responses to a completely open and semi-open question. To do this, we employed three sentiment analysis techniques: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015, SentimentR and SentiStrength, and quantified the forms of measurement error they introduced: specific factor error, algorithm error and transient error. We conducted an initial test of the text-based measures’ validity, assessing their convergence with closed-question job satisfaction measures. We adopted a time-lagged survey design (Nwave 1 = 996; Nwave 2 = 116) to test our hypotheses. In line with our hypotheses, we found that specific factor error is higher in the open question text-based measure than in the semi-open question text-based measure. As expected, algorithm error was substantial for both the open and semi-open question text-based measures. Transient error in the text-based measures was higher than expected, as it generally exceeded the transient error in the human-coded and the closed job satisfaction question measures. Our initial test of convergent and discriminant validity indicated that the semi-open question text-based measure is especially suitable for measuring job satisfaction. Our article ends with a discussion of limitations and an agenda for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2998219381,"The characterization of regenerated articular cartilage (AC) can be based on various methods, as there is an unambiguous accepted criterion neither for the natural cartilage tissue nor for regenerates. Biomechanical aspects should be considered as well, leading to the need for more equivalent samples. The aim of the study was to describe a large animal model where 8 specimens of regenerated AC can be created in one animal plus the impact of two surgeries on the welfare of the animals. The usefulness of the inclusion of a group of untreated animals (NAT) was to analyzed. Based on the histological results the conditions of the regenerates were to be described and the impact on knee joints were to be explored in terms of degenerative changes of the cartilage. The usefulness of the statistical term ""effect size"" (ES) will be explained with histological results. We analyzed an animal model where 8 AC regenerates were obtained from one Göttingen Minipig, on both sides of the trochleae. 60 animals were divided into 6 groups of 10 each, where the partial thickness defects in the trochlea were filled with matrices made of Collagen I with or without autologous chondrocytes or left empty over the healing periods of 24 and 48 weeks. One additional control group consisting of 10 untreated animals was used to provide untouched ""external"" cartilage. We harvested 560 samples of regenerated tissue and ""external"" controls, besides that, twice the number of further samples from other parts of the joints referred to as ""internal"" controls were also harvested. The animals recovered faster after the 1st operation when the defects were set compared to the 2nd operation when the defects were treated. 9% of all animals were lost. Other complications were for example superficial infections, seroma, diarrhea, febrile state and an injury of a claw. The histological results of the treatments proved the robustness of the study design where we included an ""external"" control group (NAT) in which the animals were not operated. Comparable significant differences between treated groups and the NAT group were detected both after ½ year and after 1 year. Spontaneous regenerated AC as control revealed differences after an observation time of nearly 1 year. The impact of the treatment on cartilage adjacent to the defect as well as the remaining knee joint was low. The ES was helpful for planning the study as it is shown that the power of a statistical comparison seems to be more influenced by the ES than by the sample size. The ranking of the ES was done exemplarily, listing the results according to their magnitude, thus making the results comparable. We were able to follow the 3 R requirements also in terms of a numerical reduction of animals due to the introduction of a group of untreated animals. This makes the model cost effective. The presented study may contribute as an improvement of the standardization of large animal models for research and regulatory requirements for regenerative therapies of AC."

This study aimed to examine the micronutrient dynamics and their correlation with serum proteins and thyroid hormones in patients with PCM. In 14 patients with PCM and 10 healthy subjects, we evaluated the body mass index (BMI) along with serum levels of hemoglobin, iron, ferritin, zinc, copper, magnesium, albumin, globulin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (free T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). Evaluations were conducted at the first appointment, before treatment, and at the end of the first, second, fourth, and sixth month of PCM treatment. The control group was only evaluated once. We observed that before treatment, patients with PCM, had higher levels of copper and lower level of iron than those of the control group. After one month of treatment, the iron levels increased, whereas the levels of copper after six months of treatment. Reduction in inflammatory activity, indicated by the normalization of C-reactive protein, ferritin, albumin, and globulin levels, was observed during treatment. However, no correlation was observed between the serum levels of minerals and inflammatory activity or thyroid function in this study. In conclusion, our results showed higher serum copper levels in control group compared to those in pretreatment patients; the clinical importance of this observation should be investigated in further studies. After treatment, serum copper levels showed a tendency to decrease. In addition, serum iron levels were decreased at the stage of active disease, and were increased after treatment. Thus, serum iron levels can be used as a better biomarker for treatment control."
https://openalex.org/W2997913375,"The aim of our study was to evaluate the flock sensitivity and specificity of fecal qPCR and serum ELISA using pooled samples for screening paratuberculosis in French sheep. Using individual feces with low or high qPCR Ct values from ewes sampled in 14 infected flocks, a total of 555 pools of size 5, 10 and 20 were created by diluting individual materials in negative feces and analysed using a commercial IS900 qPCR kit. The relative performances of pooled serum ELISA analysis were evaluated based on the analysis of 181 different pools of size 5 and 10, composed of individual serum samples of various individual S/P values. Results showed that for pools of size 5, 10 or 20, individual fecal samples with low Ct values were invariably detected. Conversely fecal samples with high Ct values were associated with a lower detection rate in both pools of size 5 (87.0% to 90.0%), 10 (63.0% to 70.7%) and 20 (46.7% to 60.0%). After lowering the decision threshold to 25% and 15% for serum pools of size 5 and 10 respectively, the pooled serum ELISA relative sensitivity ranged between 62.2% and 100.0% depending on the composition of the pools. Finally, a simulation study was carried out to evaluate the performances of 16 screening strategies at flock level, with varying pool size (5 to 20) and number (5 to 60). The use of pooled serum ELISA led to very false positive detection rate ranging between 37.6% and 91.8% in paratuberculosis free flocks and prevents its further use in that context. For infection prevalence ≤ 5%, the flock sensitivity based on pooled fecal qPCR ranged between 39.0% (5 pools of size 10) and 99.9% (300 sampled individuals, with pools of size 5,10 or20), and was always above 93% when the infection prevalence was greater or equal to 15%. We conclude that pooled-fecal qPCR but not pooled-serum ELISA could be a useful tool to detect sheep flocks infected with paratuberculosis."

The present study developed a label-free optical methodology for analysis of O. viverrini eggs using Raman spectroscopy. Raman features of O. viverrini eggs were reported that can be used as marker bands for the efficient analysis of O. viverrini eggs in fecal specimens. The methodology presented here allows for the rapid detection of O. viverrini egg infection and can be readily and practicably applied in any clinical setting, even those in which a trained parasitologist is not available."

However, the mechanism providing the formation of these curved planes is poorly understood. To explore this further, we use a simplified finite element model, consisting of maxillary and mandibular ""blocks"", developed to simulate tooth eruption, and forces opposing eruption, during simplified masticatory function. We test our hypothesis that curved occlusal planes develop from interplay between tooth eruption, occlusal load, and mandibular movement. Our results indicate that our simulation of rhythmic chewing movement, tooth eruption, and tooth eruption inhibition, applied concurrently, results in a transformation of the contacting maxillary and mandibular block surfaces from flat to curved. The depth of the curvature appears to be dependent on the radius length of the rotating (chewing) movement of the mandibular block. Our results suggest mandibular function and maxillo-mandibular spatial relationship may contribute to the development of human occlusal curvature."
https://openalex.org/W2997721466,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the presence of a preexisting mitral prosthesis is challenging and its influence on the morphology of mitral prosthesis and the positioning of transcatheter heart valve (THV) is unknown. We assessed the feasibility of TAVI for patients with preexisting mitral prostheses, its influence on mitral prosthesis morphology, and the positional interaction between a newly implanted THV and mitral prosthesis using serial multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). Thirty-one patients with preexisting mitral prosthesis undergoing TAVI were included. MDCT was performed before and after TAVI. Thirty patients successfully underwent TAVI without interference from preexisting mitral prosthesis. Although opening disturbance of the mechanical mitral prosthesis by the THV edge was observed in 1 patient, the patient was managed conservatively. No THV embolization occurred. THV shift during deployment occurred in 9 patients and was predicted by a larger aortic annulus area (odds ratio: 1.24 per 10 mm2, 1.03-1.49, p = 0.02), possibly because of large THVs. The mitral mean pressure gradient was slightly higher after TAVI (3.7 vs. 4.3 mmHg, p = 0.002), whereas the mitral regurgitation grade was similar. MDCT showed that the size of the mitral prosthesis housing was unchanged after TAVI. The median distance between the mitral prosthesis and THV was 2.6 mm. The postprocedural angle between the mitral prosthesis and THV was larger than the preprocedural angle between the mitral prosthesis and the left ventricular outflow tract (64° vs. 61°, p = 0.03). Thus, TAVI is feasible in the case of preexisting mitral prosthesis. Serial MDCT demonstrated favorable THV positioning and unchanged mitral prosthesis morphology after TAVI."
