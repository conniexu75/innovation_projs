https://openalex.org/W2171627550,"Humans normally experience the conscious self as localized within their bodily borders. This spatial unity may break down in certain neurological conditions such as out-of-body experiences, leading to a striking disturbance of bodily self-consciousness. On the basis of these clinical data, we designed an experiment that uses conflicting visual-somatosensory input in virtual reality to disrupt the spatial unity between the self and the body. We found that during multisensory conflict, participants felt as if a virtual body seen in front of them was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. Our results indicate that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and are based on multisensory and cognitive processing of bodily information."

We investigated spatial imminence of threat by developing an active avoidance paradigm in which volunteers were pursued through a maze by a virtual predator endowed with an ability to chase, capture, and inflict pain. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that as the virtual predator grew closer, brain activity shifted from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to the periaqueductal gray. This shift showed maximal expression when a high degree of pain was anticipated. Moreover, imminence-driven periaqueductal gray activity correlated with increased subjective degree of dread and decreased confidence of escape. Our findings cast light on the neural dynamics of threat anticipation and have implications for the neurobiology of human anxiety-related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2044032680,I report an illusion in which individuals experience that they are located outside their physical bodies and looking at their bodies from this perspective. This demonstrates that the experience of being localized within the physical body can be determined by the visual perspective in conjunction with correlated multisensory information from the body.
https://openalex.org/W2048105028,"Astrocytes play active roles in brain physiology. They respond to neurotransmitters and modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic function. However, the influence of astrocytes on synaptic transmission and plasticity at the single synapse level is unknown. Ca 2+ elevation in astrocytes transiently increased the probability of transmitter release at hippocampal area CA3-CA1 synapses, without affecting the amplitude of synaptic events. This form of short-term plasticity was due to the release of glutamate from astrocytes, a process that depended on Ca 2+ and soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein and that activated metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The transient potentiation of transmitter release became persistent when the astrocytic signal was temporally coincident with postsynaptic depolarization. This persistent plasticity was mGluR-mediated but N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor–independent. These results indicate that astrocytes are actively involved in the transfer and storage of synaptic information."
https://openalex.org/W2085253569,"Changes in the concentration of oxidants in cells can regulate biochemical signaling mechanisms that control cell function. We have found that guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP)–dependent protein kinase (PKG) functions directly as a redox sensor. The Iα isoform, PKGIα, formed an interprotein disulfide linking its two subunits in cells exposed to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. This oxidation directly activated the kinase in vitro, and in rat cells and tissues. The affinity of the kinase for substrates it phosphorylates was enhanced by disulfide formation. This oxidation-induced activation represents an alternate mechanism for regulation along with the classical activation involving nitric oxide and cGMP. This mechanism underlies cGMP-independent vasorelaxation in response to oxidants in the cardiovascular system and provides a molecular explantion for how hydrogen peroxide can operate as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor."
https://openalex.org/W1993461567,"Most plasmalemmal proteins organize in submicrometer-sized clusters whose architecture and dynamics are still enigmatic. With syntaxin 1 as an example, we applied a combination of far-field optical nanoscopy, biochemistry, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, and simulations to show that clustering can be explained by self-organization based on simple physical principles. On average, the syntaxin clusters exhibit a diameter of 50 to 60 nanometers and contain 75 densely crowded syntaxins that dynamically exchange with freely diffusing molecules. Self-association depends on weak homophilic protein-protein interactions. Simulations suggest that clustering immobilizes and conformationally constrains the molecules. Moreover, a balance between self-association and crowding-induced steric repulsions is sufficient to explain both the size and dynamics of syntaxin clusters and likely of many oligomerizing membrane proteins that form supramolecular structures."

We report that human SIRT4 is localized to the mitochondria. SIRT4 is a matrix protein and becomes cleaved at amino acid 28 after import into mitochondria. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with SIRT4 identified insulindegrading enzyme and the ADP/ATP carrier proteins, ANT2 and ANT3. SIRT4 exhibits no histone deacetylase activity but functions as an efficient ADP-ribosyltransferase on histones and bovine serum albumin. SIRT4 is expressed in islets of Langerhans and colocalizes with insulin-expressing β cells. Depletion of SIRT4 from insulin-producing INS-1E cells results in increased insulin secretion in response to glucose.

These observations define a new role for mitochondrial SIRT4 in the regulation of insulin secretion. Histone deacetylases are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues and are separated into three classes. Sirtuins, the class III histone deacetylases, are homologous to the yeast transcriptional repressor, Sir2p, and are NAD+-dependent enzymes (1North B.J. Verdin E.

They share a conserved Sir2 catalytic core domain and exhibit variable amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions that contribute to their unique subcellular localization and may also regulate their catalytic activity. The subcellular distribution, substrate specificity, and cellular functions of sirtuins are quite diverse (reviewed in Refs. 1North B.J. Verdin E.

SIRT1 can also regulate transcription by modifying the acetylation levels of transcription factors, such as MyoD, FOXO, p53, and NF-κB (6Fulco M. Schiltz R.L. Iezzi S. King M.T. Zhao P. Kashiwaya Y.

The SIRT2 protein is found in the cytoplasm, where it associates with microtubules and deacetylates lysine 40 of α-tubulin (13North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). The SIRT3 protein is localized in the mitochondrial matrix (14Schwer B. North B.J. Frye R.A. Ott M.

North B.J. Frye R.A. Ott M. Verdin E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the targets of sirtuins are not restricted to histone proteins but extend to acetylated proteins in other subcellular compartments. Sirtuins also differ in their substrate specificities. For instance, SIRT1, -2, and -3 have robust activity on chemically acetylated histone H4 peptides, whereas SIRT5 has weak but detectable activity, and SIRT4, -6, and -7 have no detectable activity on the same substrate (13North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a sirtuin from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Sir2-Af1, which has close homology with SIRT5, also has weak activity on a histone peptide but significantly stronger activity on an acetylated bovine serum albumin substrate (16Min J. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Xu R.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Avalos J.L. Celic I. Muhammad S. Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Similarly, both SIRT1 and SIRT2 can deacetylate p53; however, only SIRT2 deacetylates lysine 40 of α-tubulin (13North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol.

Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21313-21320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), whereas a T. brucei SIR2 homologue exhibited both histone NAD-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase and deacetylase activities (19Garcia-Salcedo J.A. Gijon P. Nolan D.P. Tebabi P. Pays E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5851-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that sirtuins can function either as NAD-dependent protein deacetylases or as ribosyltransferases. The substrate specificities of SIRT3 to -7 are unknown. Determining the localization patterns of these proteins is the first step in elucidating the physiologically relevant targets for deacetylation by each of these enzymes. Here, we report that SIRT4 is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with insulin-degrading enzyme and the ADP/ATP carrier protein. Depletion of SIRT4 from insulin producing INS-1E cells results in increase in secretion of insulin from these cells in response to glucose, suggesting that SIRT4 negatively regulates insulin secretion in these cells. Tissue Culture—HEK293, HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-products, Woodland, CA) in the presence of penicillin, streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The clonal β cell line INS-1E (20Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), derived from parental INS-1 cells (21Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), was grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Adherent cultures of INS-1E cells were transfected with control siRNA 3The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HM, heavy membrane; LM, light membrane; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. or siRNA against SIRT4 (synthesized by Dharmacon Inc., Chicago, IL) and further cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 3 days before experiments. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The human SIRT4 gene was cloned in a derivative of pcDNA3.1(+) (FLAG vector) to generate the construct encoding SIRT4-FLAG, as described (13North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of SIRT4 were constructed by using oligo-directed, PCR-based mutagenesis. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Antibodies—The following antibodies were obtained commercially: anti-Hsp60 (clone 4B9/89; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), anti-Hsp70 (clone JG1; Affinity Bioreagents), anti-Hsp90 (SPS-771; Stressgen Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA), anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (clone 20E8-C12; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-insulin-degrading enzyme (clone BC-2; Covance, Berkeley, CA), Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma). SIRT4 antiserum was raised in rabbits (Sigma-Genosys) against a COOH-terminal peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of SIRT4 (NH2-LNSRCGELLPLIDPC-COOH). ANT2-specific antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Douglas C. Wallace (University of California, Irvine) and immune affinity-purified as described (22Graham B.H. Waymire K.G. Cottrell B. Trounce I.A. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium containing 40 nm MitoTracker Red (CMXRos; Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS, and incubated with Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium for 1 h. The cells were then washed, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Immunostaining was then done with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:500) for 1 h followed by incubation with a Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500) for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and once briefly with water. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides and analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a Radiance 2000 confocal setup (Bio-Rad). Differential Centrifugation—HEK293T cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Cells were homogenized using Dounce homogenization (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). After removal of nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation at 770 × g for 10 min, the heavy membrane (HM) fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 5,500 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the light membrane (LM) fraction (pellet) from the cytosolic proteins (S100). The HM and the LM fractions were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl), and the protein content was determined with Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Transient Transfections and Immunoprecipitations—HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method and harvested 48 h after transfection. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described above and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture. SIRT4-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C from total cell lysate. Immunoprecipitated material was washed three times for 15 min each with lysis buffer and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protease Accessibility Assays—Mitochondria from HEK293T cells were resuspended in SM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) and aliquoted in three tubes. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in SM buffer, hypotonic buffer (10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2), or SM buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The mitochondria were incubated on ice for 5 min and digested with Proteinase K (150 μg/ml) on ice for 15 min. Proteolysis was stopped with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteins were precipitated in 15% trichloroacetic acid, collected by centrifugation, washed with acetone, recentrifuged, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Alkaline Extraction Experiments—Mitochondria were isolated from HEK293T cells expressing SIRT4-FLAG and resuspended in freshly prepared ice-cold 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) for 30 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C followed by solubilization in SDS sample buffer. Supernatant proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetate precipitation, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Mitochondrial Sonication—Mitochondria were isolated from cells expressing SIRT4-FLAG, resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl), and sonicated with a microtip sonicator (Cole-Parmer Instruments, model CP130, three times for 6 s, 40% duty cycle, microtip output setting 6). The sonicated sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the membranes (pellet) from the soluble proteins. In Vitro ADP-ribosylation—HEK293 cells overexpressing SIRT4-FLAG were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture, and SIRT4-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C from total cell lysate. Immunoprecipitated material was washed three times for 15 min each with lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and followed by SIRT4-FLAG elution with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The ADP-ribosylation reaction contained 10 μg of BSA (Sigma) or total histone proteins (Roche Applied Science) and the following buffer: 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction was initiated by adding 2.5 μCi of [32P]NAD and SIRT4 (0.5 μg/reaction), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. Free radioactivity was removed from the samples using spin column (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels after boiling for 5 min. The gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed. Generation of Stable Cell Line Overexpressing SIRT4-FLAG and SIRT5-FLAG—SIRT4 (or SIRT5)-FLAG-pcDNA3.1+ vector or empty-pcDNA3.1+ control vector was linearized with the enzyme SspI, gel-purified, and transfected into HEK293 cells. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were selected in medium containing 700 μg/ml G418. SIRT4 Immunoprecipitation and Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—Cells expressing SIRT4-FLAG were harvested and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture, and SIRT4-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C from total cell lysate. Immunoprecipitated material was washed three times for 15 min each with lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Bands corresponding to proteins specifically interacting with SIRT4 were excised and prepared for mass spectrometry. Gel slices were destained in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile. Gel pieces were treated with 100% acetonitrile until shrinking of the gel pieces was noted. Acetonitrile was removed, and the gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Samples were reduced by treatment with 10 mm dithiothreitol solution for 45 min at 56 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the samples were alkylated in 55 mm iodoacetamide solution for 30 min in darkness at room temperature. After washing in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min, the gel pieces were treated with 100% acetonitrile for 5 min and completely dried in a vacuum centrifuge. 25 μl of trypsin (12.5 ng/ml) were added to the dried gel pieces, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel pieces. After in-gel digestion for 16 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and peptides were extracted twice by vortexing the gel pieces for 20 min in 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Aqueous and organic peptide extracts were combined and concentrated under vacuum. Peptide mass fingerprints were obtained by mixing 0.5 μl of each in-gel digest peptide extract with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) directly on a stainless steel target. After co-crystallization of the peptide mixture with the matrix, peptide mass maps were obtained using a Voyager DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). In the MALDI-TOF process, peptides were ionized following a matrix-analyte crystal irradiation with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) that struck the sample at a frequency of 20 Hz. A voltage of 25 kV accelerated the peptide ions out of the ion source into the flight tube after a 125-ns delay. Monoprotonated peptide ions were temporally separated according to their mass/charge ratios as they drifted down the flight tube through the reflector mass analyzer, eventually striking the detector. Individual peptide masses were determined by measuring the time it took each ion to travel the distance from its origin to the detector. Delayed extraction of peptide ions from the ion source in combination with the kinetic energy-focusing properties of the reflector (also called the ion mirror) provided mass resolution sufficient for determining the monoisotopic mass of each peptide. Close proximity external calibration enabled peptide masses to be measured within +50–100 ppm of their theoretical values. Protein identification was accomplished by comparing the experimentally generated set of peptide masses with theoretically predicted sets of tryptic peptides derived from each protein in the Swiss-Prot data base (available on the World Wide Web) by a process of “in silico digestion.” Data base searches were performed using the Aldente Peptide Mass Fingerprinting Tool available to the public on the World Wide Web. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—HEK293 cells stably expressing SIRT4-FLAG, SIRT5-FLAG, or a FLAG-control vector were plated in 100-mm dishes. Confluent cells were rinsed off with ice-cold PBS, washed twice in PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science EDTA-free mixture) for 1 h on ice. Lysates were cleared (16,100 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry—Detection of SIRT4 protein in human tissues was performed on normal human tissue samples using the immunoperoxidase technique and the ABC Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). An anti-human SIRT4 antibody raised against a synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 240–254 (DKVDFVHKRVKEADS) of human SIRT4 was used (Orbigen, San Diego, CA). Five-μm-thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols. After blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min, the sections were incubated with 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 60 min. Rabbit anti-SIRT4 antibody (1:150 dilution) was incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Washes were performed three times with PBS after each incubation step. Peroxidase activity was developed by a solution of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vel, Leuven, Belgium) dissolved in PBS and 0.03% H2O2. The 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution was filtered and applied to the sections for 3 min. Carazziŉs hematoxylin was used to counterstain the slides followed by dehydration and mounting. Control experiments were performed with omission of the first antibody in the immunoperoxidase assay. Detection of insulin expression by the β cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans was performed on serial sections of normal human pancreas using the ABC Vectastain Elite kit and a mouse monoclonal anti-insulin antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (clone 2D11-H5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Other controls included normal rabbit IgGs (purchased from Serotec, purified polyclonal rabbit IgG from normal rabbit serum) and rabbit anti-bone sialoprotein antibody (LF-83, provided by L. W. Fisher, National Institutes of Health) on normal human pancreas or on a case of poorly differentiated human prostate cancer. Photomicrographs of the slides were taken with a Zeiss microscope equipped with a Leica camera. siRNA Preparation—siRNAs corresponding to the SIRT4 gene were designed as recommended and were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Dharmacon Inc., Chicago, IL). Transfections—Transfection of control siRNA, siRNA against SIRT4 for down-regulation, pFLAG-control, and pFLAG-SIRT4 cDNA for up-regulation were all performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 24-well plates according to the manufacturerŉs specifications. Briefly, 2 × 105 INS-1E cells were seeded per well into 24-well plates, reaching 50–60% confluence the day of transfection. siRNAs mixtures were incubated for 30 min with Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in serum-free RPMI 1640 before transfer to cells. Next, cells were treated with the respective mixtures for 6 h in the incubator before medium replacement. Transfected cells were kept in culture for 3 days before proceeding to experiments. Different siRNA-SIRT4 concentrations (250, 500, and 1000 nm) were tested in INS-1E cells, and efficiency was assessed by quantitative real time PCR. Overexpression was carried out using 0.14 μg of SIRT4 plasmid DNA/well. Quantitative Real Time PCR—INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with siRNA-SIRT4. Three days after transfection, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and 2 μg was converted into cDNA. Primers for rat SIRT4 and rat cyclophilin were designed using the Primer Express Software (Applera Europe). Real time PCR was performed using an ABI 7000 sequence detection system (Applera Europe), and PCR products were quantified fluorometrically using the SYBR Green core reagent kit. The values obtained were normalized to the values of rat cyclophilin mRNA. Rat SIRT4 primers were as follows: 5′-CCA TCC AGC ACA TTG ATT TCA-3′;5′-GGC CAG CCC ACA AAG TTT C-3′. Rat cyclophilin primers were as follows: 5′-TCA CCA TCT CCG ACT GTG GA-3′;5′-AAA TGC CCG CAA GTC AAA GA-3′. Immunoblotting—Ten μg of protein of INS-1E cells was analyzed per lane on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of goat anti-SIRT4 polyclonal antibody (1:500) raised against human SIRT4 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The membrane was then incubated for 2 h with donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (1:5000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the SIRT4 protein was revealed by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Insulin Secretion Assay—INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with 250 nm control siRNA or siRNA-SIRT4 and assayed 3 days after for insulin secretion as previously described (20Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Prior to the experiments, cells were maintained for 2 h in glucose- and glutamine-free culture medium. The cells were then washed and preincubated further in glucose-free KRBH, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin as carrier, before the incubation period (30 min at 37 °C) at basal (2.5 mm) and stimulatory (7.5 and 15 mm) glucose concentrations, with the mitochondrial substrate methyl-succinate (5 mm) as well as in the presence 30 mm KCl used as a calcium-raising agent. At the end of the incubation period, supernatants were collected and quantified for absolute insulin secretion, and insulin was extracted from cells using acid-EtOH in order to measure total insulin content. Insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard, and secretion was expressed according to cellular protein concentrations. Cellular ATP Monitoring—ATP levels were monitored in INS-1E cells expressing the ATP-sensitive bioluminescent probe luciferase following infection with the specific viral construct. Briefly, cells were transduced with AdCA-cLuc (driving the expression of cytosolic luciferase) and used 20 h later for experiments. Cells were washed with 1 ml of KRBH and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C at 2.5 mm glucose. Then KRBH containing 100 μm luciferin was added, and the luminescence was monitored in the plate reader luminometer (Fluostar Optima) (20Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Where applicable, the results were expressed as means ± S.D. Differences between groups were analyzed by Studentŉs t test for unpaired data, and significance was assessed by a p value of less than 0.05. SIRT4 Is a Mitochondrial Protein—To study the subcellular localization of human SIRT4, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding SIRT4-FLAG. Immunofluorescence analysis of the transfected cells by confocal microscopy showed that SIRT4-FLAG was exclusively localized in discrete rod-shaped structures in the cytosol that were reminiscent of mitochondria (Fig. 1A). The colocalization of this fluorescence with MitoTracker Red, a dye that preferentially accumulates in mitochondria, confirmed the mitochondrial localization of SIRT4 in the HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). To further verify the subcellular localization of SIRT4, HEK293T cells expressing the SIRT4-FLAG protein were fractionated by differential centrifugation in a mitochondria-enriched fraction (HM), a fraction containing microsomes (LM), and into a cytosolic protein fraction (S100). Immunoblot analysis revealed that SIRT4 was exclusively localized in the HM fraction (Fig. 1B). The purity of these fractions was confirmed by probing for the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c and the cytosolic marker Hsp90. To determine if endogenous SIRT4 is also localized to the mitochondria, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated against a peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of human SIRT4. The antiserum reacted strongly with a 29-kDa protein in the mitochondria-enriched fraction of HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C). SIRT4 Is Proteolytically Processed at Its NH2 Terminus—The human SIRT4 cDNA encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 35 kDa. However, both endogenous and FLAG-tagged SIRT4 detected in the mitochondria migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa. This observation is consistent with the possibility that SIRT4 is proteolytically processed, as observed for many mitochondrial proteins. The polyclonal antiserum used to detect endogenous SIRT4 was raised against its COOH terminus and recognized the shorter for"

Mammalian homologs of YiiP play critical roles in zinc homeostasis and cell signaling. Here, we report the x-ray structure of YiiP in complex with zinc at 3.8 angstrom resolution. YiiP is a homodimer held together in a parallel orientation through four Zn 2+ ions at the interface of the cytoplasmic domains, whereas the two transmembrane domains swing out to yield a Y-shaped structure. In each protomer, the cytoplasmic domain adopts a metallochaperone-like protein fold; the transmembrane domain features a bundle of six transmembrane helices and a tetrahedral Zn 2+ binding site located in a cavity that is open to both the membrane outer leaflet and the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2142621773,"We have previously reported that COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) is prominent in cartilage but is also present in tendon and binds to collagens I and II with high affinity. Here we show that COMP influences the fibril formation of these collagens. Fibril formation in the presence of pentameric COMP was much faster, and the amount of collagen in fibrillar form was markedly increased. Monomeric COMP, lacking the N-terminal coiled-coil linker domain, decelerated fibrillogenesis. The data show that stimulation of collagen fibrillogenesis depends on the pentameric nature of COMP and not only on collagen binding. COMP interacts primarily with free collagen I and II molecules, bringing several molecules to close proximity, apparently promoting further assembly. These assemblies further join in discrete steps to a narrow distribution of completed fibril diameters of 149 ± 16 nm with a banding pattern of 67 nm. COMP is not found associated with the mature fibril and dissociates from the collagen molecules or their early assemblies. However, a few COMP molecules are found bound to more loosely associated molecules at the tip/end of the growing fibril. Thus, COMP appears to catalyze the fibril formation by promoting early association of collagen molecules leading to increased rate of fibrillogenesis and more distinct organization of the fibrils.

Thus, COMP appears to catalyze the fibril formation by promoting early association of collagen molecules leading to increased rate of fibrillogenesis and more distinct organization of the fibrils. Connective tissues have specific characteristics and functional properties that depend on the extracellular matrix proteins present and their intermolecular interactions. Collagens I and II are the most abundant proteins in tendon and cartilage, respectively, having central roles in providing the tissues tensile strength. The properties of these fibril-forming collagens are attributable to the rodlike triple helical structure formed by the three α-chains constituting the collagen monomer. The dimensions of the mature collagen monomers are 300 × 1.5 nm (1Bornstein P. Kim W. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. 1979: 411-462, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The molecules are produced as procollagens with propeptides at their N and C termini. Upon secretion into the extracellular matrix, these propeptides are removed by N- and C-proteinases, producing the native triple helical molecule with retained short telopeptides of only a few amino acids. Numerous such collagen molecules assemble laterally in a specific quarter stagger arrangement, initially organizing into microfibrils and subsequently forming fibrils (2Cooper A. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with gap and overlap regions giving a D-periodic banding pattern of 67 nm (3Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. 1984: 1-39, Elsevier, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The fibril also becomes stabilized by intra- and intermolecular covalent bonds (4Miller E.J. Piez A.K. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. 1984: 67-81, Elsevier, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 5Kühn K. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. 1987: 1-42, Academic Press, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Fibril formation is divided into two steps, nucleation and fiber growth, which are sensitive to environmental factors such as pH and general ionic strength as well as specific ions (6Gelman R.A. Kim D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11741-11745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, nucleation appears to be accelerated by the collagen telopeptides (6Gelman R.A. Kim D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11741-11745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although these are not essential for obtaining the quarter-staggered organization (7Kuznetsova N. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36083-36088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Calculations for the most favorable constellation of collagen molecules deduce a circular arrangement of five molecules, producing a 4–5-nm-wide assembly, a microfibril (8Smith J.W. Nature. 1968; 219: 157-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with in vivo studies, where intermediates are identified as being 8 nm in diameter when dehydrated (9Parry D.A. Kim A.S. Nature. 1979; 282: 213-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or 11 nm when hydrated (10Chapman J.A. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1367-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), assuming continued assembly from two 4-nm microfibrils. There is a broad range of fibril diameters in tissues, organized such that thickness increases as one moves further from the cell surface (11Hedlund H. Kim S. Reinholt F.P. Svensson O. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunology Scan. 1993; 101: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fibril thickness also varies with age, such that they are thinner in young tissue and thicker in old (12Birk D.E. Kim E.I. Winkelmann D.A. Trelstad R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 176-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Several fibrils can organize into fibril bundles that further assemble into macroaggregates (13Birk D.E. Kim R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Proteins present in the extracellular matrix, e.g. proteoglycans and other collagens, influence fibril growth and regulate fibril thickness. Collagen III (14Keene D.R. Kim L.Y. Bächinger H.P.

Kim P.K. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) regulate collagen I fibril formation, reducing fibril thickness. Recent data indicate that fibromodulin may have a catalytic effect on collagen I lateral growth, increasing the fibril thickness (21Ezura Y. Kim S. Oldberg Å. Chervoneva I. Birk D.E. J.

More recently, it has been shown that the chondroitin sulfate side chains of perlecan, but not its heparan sulfate chains, will promote collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro. These chondroitin sulfate chains differ from those found on aggrecan, which are inert with regard to fibrillogenesis and essentially lack the incorporation of chondroitin sulfate E type oversulfated disaccharides (25Kvist A. Kim A. Mörgelin M. Gustafsson E. Bengtsson E. Lindblom K. Aszodi A. Fässler R. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Aspberg A. J. Biol.

We now show that a third type of protein, COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) that is prominent in cartilage (26Hedbom E. Kim P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in pressure loaded parts of tendon (27DiCesare P. Kim N.

Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), has a novel catalytic stimulatory effect on fibril formation of collagen I and II. Structurally, COMP, also referred to as thrombospondin (TSP) 3The abbreviations used are: TSP, thrombospondin; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline. 5, belongs to the TSP family (29Oldberg Å. Kim P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native protein incorporates five identical subunits (26Hedbom E. Kim P. Hjerpe A.

Barry F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14120-14126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The complex is assembled by formation of a coiled-coil domain close to the N terminus (32Efimov V.P. Kim A. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and is further stabilized by disulfide bridges within this region. This domain is followed by a flexible region of four epidermal growth factor domains, a TSP type 3 (calcium-binding) domain, and a C-terminal globular domain (29Oldberg Å. Kim P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) homologous to the one structurally characterized in thrombospondin 1 (33Kvansakul M. Kim J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Functionally, COMP binds via each C-terminal globule equally to one of four sites on collagens I and II with a KD of 1.5 nm for the single interaction. The binding depends on the presence of zinc ions (34Rosenberg K. Kim H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). COMP also interacts with collagen IX with high affinity (35Thur J. Kim K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Holden P. Kim R.S. Chapman K.L. Grant M.E. Kadler K.E. Briggs M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6046-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similarly, other members of the TSP family show zinc ion-dependent interaction with fibrillar collagens. TSP 4, present in tendon, is found to interact via its C-terminal globules with collagens I, II, and III, with a KD of 4–40 nm (37Narouz-Ott L. Kim P. Nitsche D.P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37110-37117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TSP 1, present in cartilage, binds to collagen I in a similar manner as COMP. 4K. Halász and D. Heinegård, unpublished observation. In young cartilage, COMP is primarily identified close to chondrocytes, whereas in adult cartilage the protein is found in the interterritorial region (38Shen Z. Kim D. Sommarin Y. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). COMP-deficient mice show no abnormalities and no change in skeletal development (39Svensson L. Kim A.

Therefore, the function of COMP may be connected to pathological events in cartilage because protein expression and turnover is markedly altered early in human osteoarthritis (40Lorenzo P. Kim M.T. Heinegård D. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here we present data that demonstrate a novel role for COMP in catalyzing the assembly of collagen, promoting formation of well defined fibrils. COMP may have a role in collagen assembly in vivo, consistent with the localization of COMP to the pericellular/territorial matrix in growing individuals. Proteins—Native bovine adult COMP was purified and characterized as described previously (34Rosenberg K. Kim H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Recombinant monomeric bovine COMP lacking the N-terminal domain, expressed in EBNA cells as previously described (35Thur J. Kim K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Patrik Maurer (Institute for Biochemistry, the Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, Germany). Collagen I (Vitrogen100), isolated after pepsin digestion from bovine skin, was from Collagen Biomaterials (Palo Alto, CA). Collagen II was isolated after pepsin digestion from nasal cartilage according to a previously described procedure (24Vogel K.G. Kim M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Acid-extracted collagen I was purified according to standard procedures previously described (24Vogel K.G. Kim M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assay—The fibrillogenesis of pepsin-extracted collagen I was monitored by change in turbidity at 400 nm at 3-min intervals for up to 500 min. Four times concentrated buffer (80 mm HEPES, 0.6 m NaCl, pH 7.4), COMP and 0.012 m NaOH (in a volume equal to neutralize the collagen solution) were mixed, and water was added to a final volume of 200 μl. Collagen I in 0.012 m HCl was added, to a concentration of 100 μg/ml, within 30 s before initiation of absorbance readings. Bovine pentameric COMP was added at molar ratios to collagen of 1:2 and monomeric COMP to collagen of 5:2, representing equivalent proportions of collagen-binding domains of COMP to collagen. The cuvettes were placed in a Beckman DU640 scanning spectrophotometer with a temperature controlled six-place cuvette chamber equilibrated to 37 °C. Identical samples were incubated in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C for 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 min. These samples were centrifuged at the times indicated following incubations at 13,000 × g for 5 min to separate supernatant (molecules and fine networks) from the precipitate (fibrils), and both were used for further analyses. The fibrillogenesis of pepsin-extracted collagen II was monitored by a change in turbidity at 313 nm with 5.5-min intervals for 1200 min. Four times concentrated buffer (80 mm HEPES, 0.6 m NaCl, pH 7.4), COMP, and 0.1 m NaOH (in a volume sufficient to neutralize the collagen solution) were mixed, and water was added to a final volume of 200 μl. Collagen II in 0.1 m acetic acid was added to give a final concentration of 350 μg/ml, ∼30 s before initiation of absorbance readings. Bovine pentameric COMP was added at molar ratios to collagen of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:8. The cuvettes were placed in the Beckman DU640 scanning spectrophotometer with a temperature controlled six-place cuvette chamber equilibrated to 35 °C. The fibrillogenesis of acid-extracted collagen I was monitored by the change in turbidity at 400 nm over 90 min at 30 °C. Collagen I stock in 0.1 m acetic acid was dialyzed against 12 mm HCl immediately prior to assay. Four times concentrated fibrillogenesis buffer (the same as used for pepsin-extracted collagen I) was mixed with COMP, water, and 0.012 m NaOH (at an equal volume of the collagen I solution) to give a final volume of 0.5 ml. Collagen I was added last to give a final concentration of 73 μg/ml, and the mixture was transferred into prechilled quartz cuvettes. All of the solutions were degassed, and samples were handled on ice to avoid the formation of fibrils prior to assaying for fibrillogenesis. All other settings were identical to the conditions described above. Hydroxyproline Quantification—Hydroxyproline quantification of pepsin-extracted collagen I in the supernatants and pellets from the fibrillogenesis experiments was done by measuring the hydroxyproline content after hydrolysis in 6 m HCl at 100 °C for 24 h (41Stegemann H. Kim K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 18: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The quantity of bovine pentameric COMP in the supernatants and pellets at different time points during fibrillogenesis of pepsin-extracted collagen I was analyzed by inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 96-well plates (Maxisorp™; Nunc) were coated overnight with 0.05 μg/ml pentameric COMP in 4 m GuHCl, 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 10, in a humidified chamber and then coated with 2 mg/ml ovalbumin for 1 h. The proteins in the supernatant of the fibrillogenesis assay were precipitated with ethanol and pelleted by centrifugation. The material thus recovered from the supernatant as well as obtained from the pellet after centrifugation of the sample was each dissolved in 200 μl of 0.8% SDS, 0.14 m NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 3.1 mm NaN3, pH 7.4. Aliquots of pellets (10 μl), supernatants (1 μl), and standards were diluted in the incubation buffer to a final volume of 500 μl and a final concentration of 0.8% SDS. The samples (110 μl) and corresponding standards (0.0–0.2 μg/ml pentameric COMP) were mixed with an equal volume of polyclonal rabbit anti-bovine COMP (26Hedbom E. Kim P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D.

The mixtures were incubated in triplicates in a 96-well plate (Sterilin™; Labsystem) overnight in a humidified chamber. The preincubated sample-antibody mixtures (200 μl/well) were added to the coated plate, incubated for 1 h, and washed. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated porcine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO), diluted 1:2000 in 0.05% Tween, 0.14 m NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 3.1 mm NaN3, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added and incubated for 1 h, and the plates were washed. Bound conjugate was determined by measuring enzyme activity with substrate (1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate) in 1 m diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl, 3.1 mm NaN3, pH 9.8. An immediate zero reading at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Multisoft™; Labsystem) was followed by a final reading after 1 h of incubation. The concentrations of bovine pentameric COMP in the supernatants and pellets were calculated from the standard curve. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—To estimate the amounts of pepsin-extracted collagen I and bovine pentameric COMP in the supernatant and pellet at different times of fibrillogenesis, we used SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8%) electrophoresis (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The gels were subjected to silver staining (43Wray W. Kim T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar) or Western blotting (44Towbin H. Kim T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). COMP in blots was detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-bovine COMP (26Hedbom E. Kim P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), diluted 1:1000 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2% Tween, pH 7.4, supplemented with 3% w/v milk powder. After incubation for 1 h, the membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated porcine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO), diluted 1:1000 in the same buffer as the first antibody. Bound enzyme was detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the film exposed for 2 as well as 20 min. Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay—The BIAcore™ 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to characterize the interaction between COMP and collagen I monomers and collagen I fibrils, respectively. A C1 Pioneer sensor chip (BIAcore AB) presenting a carboxymethylated surface without dextran was activated with 40 μl of a mixture of 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 200 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Pentameric COMP (25 μg/ml in 40 μlin 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0) was immobilized at 25 °C at a flow of 5 μl/min. As a control, one surface underwent the coupling procedure without any protein coupled to it. Blocking of remaining activate groups was achieved subsequently by 40 μl of 1 m ethanolamine in 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3. Approximately 300 resonance units of pentameric COMP were immobilized, where 1000 resonance units correspond to around 1 ng/mm2 of protein (45Stenberg M. Kim H. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 41: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Collagen I molecules at 40 μg/ml or collagen I fibrils at 68 μg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS) containing 0.05 mm ZnCl2 were injected at a continuous flow of 80 μl/min. The surface was regenerated with 5 mm EDTA in HBS. Collagen I fibrils were prepared as described under “Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assay” and obtained when turbidity reached the final plateau. The fibril containing sample was equilibrated to room temperature and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min to separate supernatant (molecules and fine networks) from the pellet (fibrils). The fibrils were suspended in HBS and sonicated for 30s using a Branson sonicator. They were immediately analyzed by negative staining and electron microscopy. After 1 h of equilibration, the fibrils were taken to binding studies in the BIAcore or centrifuged again to measure the collagen I molecule and fibril content by hydroxyproline analysis as described above. Gold Labeling of COMP—Colloidal gold was prepared as described previously (46Baschong W. Kim N.G. J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1990; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). AuCl4 was reduced by KSCN to give a particle diameter of 3.4 nm ± 15%. The gold particle solutions were added at a molar ratio of 1 gold to 2 COMP. Electron Microscopy—Fibril-containing samples of pepsin-extracted collagen I from several time points (0, 10, 20, 160, and 320 min), as well as collagen II samples from three different time points (0, 5, and 320 min), obtained from fibril formation assays in the presence and absence of bovine pentameric COMP, were visualized by negative staining and analyzed using electron microscopy. Samples containing 100 μg/ml collagen in HBS were adsorbed for 1 min onto carbon-coated grids, which were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air beforehand, briefly washed with water, and stained with 0.75% (w/w) uranyl formate in water. The samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Evaluations of the data from electron micrographs were done as described previously (47Engel J. Kim H. Cunningham L.W. Structural and Contractile Proteins: Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1987: 3-78Google Scholar). In each sample, 200–300 fibrils were measured. Statistics—The results in Fig. 5 are expressed as the mean values ± S.D. Differences between distributions of collagen fibril diameters in the absence (–COMP) or presence of COMP (+COMP) were analyzed by the two-tailed test for differences between means. The following a priori null hypothesis was tested; COMP does not influence collagen fibril diameter. The null hypothesis was rejected, and statistical significance was assumed when p < 0.05. Spectrophotometric Measurements—Bovine pentameric COMP accelerated and enhanced the fibril formation of pepsin-extracted collagens I (Fig. 1A) and II (Fig. 1B). This was visualized as a reduction in the lag phase from 100 min for the pepsin-extracted collagen I (Fig. 1A, curve a) to 10 min in the presence of bovine pentameric COMP (Fig. 1A, curve b). Also, fibril formation appeared considerably more efficient in the presence of the pentameric COMP complex with a 2.5 times higher final turbidity. In contrast, fibril formation in the presence of monomeric COMP showed a prolonged lag phase of as much as 200 min. Furthermore, the addition of monomeric COMP in equimolar amounts to the concentration of monomers found in the pentameric complex (Fig. 1A, curve a) led to considerably lower levels of stimulation (Fig. 1A, curve c). Fibrillogenesis of pepsinized collagen II was accelerated by pentameric COMP. The lag phase was almost eliminated, and the final turbidity increased by a factor of two, indicating that a larger proportion of collagen formed fibrils (Fig. 1B, curve d). Collagen II alone had a lag phase of 150 min (Fig. 1B, curve a). The addition of a 1:8 relative molar concentration of COMP to collagen II reduced the duration of the lag phase to 75 min. Indeed, the addition of higher relative concentrations of COMP led to further decrease in duration of the lag phase (10 min and complete abolishment, respectively). In a complementary set of experiments, the effects of addition of COMP to collagen I with retained telopeptides purified from tendon was investigated (Fig. 2). As previously observed (6Gelman R.A. Kim D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11741-11745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vogel K.G. Kim M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), fibrillogenesis was more efficient with this collagen and could be performed at the lower temperature of 30 °C and was considerably faster. Interestingly, in this case the lag phase was somewhat prolonged, whereas the final turbidity was doubled in the presence of COMP. The effects were dose-dependent and increased with a maximal effect at a molar ratio of collagen to COMP of 5:1 (Fig. 2A). Further increasing the relative amount of COMP lead to a decreased stimulatory effect, evident as an only moderate increase in turbidity at the final plateau (Fig. 2B). Measurements of Collagen—Collagen I present in the supernatant and in the pellet after fibril formation and centrifugation at different time points was quantified by hydroxyproline assay (Fig. 3a) and estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, b and c). The amount of collagen fibrils correlated with the increase in turbidity measured at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 min. When pentameric COMP was included in the fibril forming system, ∼30% of the total collagen I was recovered in fibrils at 320 min (Fig. 3a, solid line), compared with ∼20% in the absence of pentameric COMP (Fig. 3a, dashed line). These results corroborated with results from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, b and c). In the presence of pentameric COMP, the amount of collagen molecules was lower in the supernatant (Fig. 3b) and increased in the pellet (Fig. 3c) following incubation time. Measurements of COMP—To determine the amount of pentameric COMP in the collagen I precipitates, we analyzed the samples by Western blotting (Fig. 3, d and e) and by inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The immunoassay shows that, at most, 2.5% of the total pentameric COMP was recovered with the collagen I at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 min (Fig. 3a, dotted line). Western blotting verified that almost no COMP was recovered with the collagen fibril precipitate, in spite of the 10 times longer exposure of the film to enhance detection (Fig. 3e). The vast majority of COMP was identified in the supernatant (Fig. 3d) together with partially assembled collagen fibrils. The low levels of COMP observed in the fibril preparation may result from retention of a small volume (∼ 5 μl) of supernatant with the pellet. It may also result from a small proportion of COMP interacting with the tip of the collagen fibrils (see below). COMP Binds Collagen Monomers but Not Mature Fibrils in Surface Plasmon Resonance As"
https://openalex.org/W1972222351,"Proteins containing membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domains play important roles in vertebrate immunity, embryonic development, and neural-cell migration. In vertebrates, the ninth component of complement and perforin form oligomeric pores that lyse bacteria and kill virus-infected cells, respectively. However, the mechanism of MACPF function is unknown. We determined the crystal structure of a bacterial MACPF protein, Plu-MACPF from Photorhabdus luminescens , to 2.0 angstrom resolution. The MACPF domain reveals structural similarity with poreforming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) from Gram-positive bacteria. This suggests that lytic MACPF proteins may use a CDC-like mechanism to form pores and disrupt cell membranes. Sequence similarity between bacterial and vertebrate MACPF domains suggests that the fold of the CDCs, a family of proteins important for bacterial pathogenesis, is probably used by vertebrates for defense against infection."

Based on membrane topology, folding and secondary structure prediction, pannexins are proposed to form gap junction-like structures. We show here that Pannexin1 forms a hexameric channel and reaches the cell surface but, unlike connexins, is N-glycosylated. Using site-directed mutagenesis we analyzed three putative N-linked glycosylation sites and examined the effects of each mutation on channel expression. We show for the first time that Pannexin1 is glycosylated at Asn-254 and that this residue is important for plasma membrane targeting. The glycosylation of Pannexin1 at its extracellular surface makes it unlikely that two oligomers could dock to form an intercellular channel. Ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy confirmed that Pannexin1 junctional areas do not appear as canonical gap junctions.

We propose that N-glycosylation of Pannexin1 could be a significant mechanism for regulating the trafficking of these membrane proteins to the cell surface in different tissues. Intercellular communication takes place in two different ways: release of molecules such as neurotransmitters, hormones, or ATP; and formation of intercellular channels that connect directly the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Multicellular organisms have evolved to use different types of intercellular channels, called gap junctions. In vertebrates, a gap junction channel is formed by the apposition of two hexameric assemblies of connexins (Cx), 2The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexins; Panx, pannexins; Inx, innexins; DSP, dithio-bis(succinimidylpropionate); PNGase F, N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; CIAP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexins; Panx, pannexins; Inx, innexins; DSP, dithio-bis(succinimidylpropionate); PNGase F, N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; CIAP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. one from each adjacent cell. A new class of proteins analogous to connexins in their folding, but completely unrelated in sequence has been identified in invertebrates. These proteins were named innexins (invertebrate connexin analogs, abbreviated as Inx). Despite the conserved structure, properties, and functions of gap junctions in vertebrates and invertebrates, connexin and innexin structures evolved independently. Mammalian analogs of innexins were recently identified in the human genome sequence and the term pannexins (from the Greek word pan, “throughout” and the Latin nexus, “connection,” abbreviated as Panx) was coined to name this new class of proteins (1Panchin Y. Kim I. Matz M. Lukyanov K. Usman N. Lukyanov S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R473-R474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Pannexins have some sequence similarity to invertebrate innexin proteins, but share no homology with vertebrate connexins. It has been speculated that there is an evolutionary relationship between pannexins and innexins. Both groups of proteins are predicted to have four transmembrane regions, two extracellular loops and intracellular amino (NH2) and carboxyl (COOH) termini. The human pannexin family consists of three members: Pannexin1 (Panx1, 426 amino acids, 47.6 kDa), Pannexin2 (Panx2, 664 amino acids, 73.3 kDa), and Pannexin3 (Panx3, 392 amino acids, 44.7 kDa). Pannexins are expressed in many different systems and abundantly in the vertebrate central nervous system. Based on membrane topology, folding and secondary structure prediction, pannexins have been proposed to form gap junction-like structures (1Panchin Y. Kim I. Matz M. Lukyanov K. Usman N. Lukyanov S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R473-R474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Earlier studies by Bruzzone et al. (2Bruzzone R. Kim S.G. Barbe M.T. Herb A. Monyer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13644-13649Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) in paired Xenopus oocytes found that the expression of Panx1, alone and in combination with Panx2, induces intercellular channels. However, functional and localization studies in erythrocytes, cultured neurons, and glia have shown only plasma membrane staining with no evidence of canonical gap junctions (3Locovei S. Kim L. Dahl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7655-7659Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 4Huang Y. Kim J.B. Abrams C.K. Scherer S.S. Glia. 2007; 55: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One current hypothesis is that Panxs do not duplicate the function of Cxs in connecting directly the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, but rather connect the cytoplasm to the extracellular space. The hemichannels formed by Panx1 in the plasma membrane have been shown to be mechanosensitive ATP conduits (5Bao L. Kim S. Dahl G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) that respond to several signal transduction pathways. They are involved in the release of small molecules, and may promote the propagation of calcium waves (6Locovei S. Kim J. Dahl G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 7Pelegrin P. Kim A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 8Pelegrin P. Kim A. J. Biol.

Med. 2006; 10: 613-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the stoichiometry and membrane targeting of Panx1 oligomers. Panx1 is widely expressed in several tissues, and the expression pattern varies in different locations. For example, Panx1 revealed postsynaptic localization in rodent hippocampal and cortical principal neurons (11Zoidl G. Kim E. Ray A. Meier C. Bunse S. Habbes H.W. Dahl G. Dermietzel R. Neuroscience. 2007; 146: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Panx1-specific labeling was evident in the perinuclear region of retinal ganglion cells and horizontal cells, whereas relatively little plasma membrane staining was observed in neonatal retinal ganglion cells, gradually increasing with age (12Dvoriantchikova G. Kim D. Panchin Y. Shestopalov V.I. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2178-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To uncover the mechanism regulating the localization of pannexins, in particular subcellular compartments, might provide insights into the functional role of these novel channel proteins in different tissues. The data presented here show for the first time that Panx1 forms a multimeric channel and contains a glycosylation site at its extracellular surface that is important for the trafficking of the protein to the cell surface. The presence of a glycosylation site argues that the single hexamer is the primary channel state in contrast to connexin-based structures that are formed by two docked hexamers where each hexamer can act as an independent unit (13Verselis V.K. Kim E.B. Bukauskas F.F. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Antibodies—We used the following primary antibodies: chicken anti-Panx1 (4515, characterized in Ref. 3Locovei S. Kim L. Dahl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7655-7659Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (Sigma); mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma); and rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada). Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The cDNAs encoding rat Panx1 wild-type, myc-tagged were kindly provided by Dr. Roberto Bruzzone. Site-directed mutagenesis was done with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. Complementary pairs of synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation were used to amplify the full-length plasmid with the rPanx1 cDNA insert. The PCR product was treated with DpnI endonuclease to digest the methylated wild-type DNA template, and transformed into MAX Efficiency DH5α Competent Cells (Invitrogen). Successful incorporation of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequence analyses, using forward and reverse primers to check the entire rPanx1 sequence, and confirm the absence of random mutations. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK-293T cells were maintained at 37 °C, and 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Plasmids (0.5 μg for transfection of 35-mm dish) were transfected into HEK-293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were processed 1-2 days post-transfection. Triton X-100 Solubilization of Tissue Culture Cells—Adherent HEK-293T cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold incubation buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.35 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2.7 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, and filtered on a 0.22-μm filter), scraped, and centrifuged at 11,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cellular pellet was resuspended in incubation buffer (1 ml/confluent 60-mm dish), sonicated (3 pulses, 30 s each, on ice), and supplemented with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. The sample was incubated on ice for 30 min, vortexing 3-4 times during the incubation. The extract was centrifuged at 301,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a SW55 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was recovered and stored on ice for the cross-linking procedure. Chemical Cross-linking—We used the homobifunctional, amine-reactive reagent DSP (dithio-bis(succinimidylpropionate)) to covalently link Panx1 monomers within the oligomer. The DSP solution was prepared just before use (12.5 mg/ml in Me2SO), and added to a final concentration of 50 or 300 μg/ml, vortex mixed, and incubated 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl/ml of 1 m glycine, pH 9.2, vortex mixed, and incubated on ice for 30 min. A solution of 10 μl/ml of 1 m glycine, pH 7.2, was added to restore the pH. The samples were analyzed by 4-20% SDS-PAGE, 4-12% Tris glycine, or 3-8% Tris acetate gradient gels and Western blot with anti-Myc antibody. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Western blot were performed as described by Towbin et al. (14Towbin H. Kim T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from cells in SDS buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), separated on a 4-20% Tris glycine gel (Invitrogen), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody: chicken anti-Panx1 (1:1000), mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:7000), or mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (1:5000). Blots were developed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of signals was quantified using the ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Analysis of Glycosylation and Phosphorylation—Cell lysates from HEK-293T cells expressing Panx1 wild-type or mutant proteins were incubated with 1,500 units of endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or 1,500 units of N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 3 h at 37 °C at pH 5.5 and 7.5, respectively; or with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) for 3 h at 37 °C. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, washed, and labeled for immunofluorescence. The primary antibodies (mouse anti-Myc 1:200, and rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin 1:200) were mixed and diluted with blocking buffer diluted 5-fold in phosphate-buffered saline. The secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit) were diluted 1:100 in the same buffer. Image processing employed an Olympus FluoView1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Image analysis of z-scan was done using the Imaris Software (Bitplane AG). Cell Surface Biotinylation—HEK-293T cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.05% sodium azide. Cells were incubated at 4 °C with 0.25 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min. To confirm that the biotinylation reagent did not label intracellular proteins, the experiment was conducted in 2 blots in parallel, one was hybridized with the chicken anti-Panx1 antibody and the other with the mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody. In Vivo Labeling with ReAsH-EDT2 and FlAsH-EDT2—MDCK cells stably expressing a tetracysteine domain (FLNCCPGCCME)-tagged rPanx1 (rPanx1-4C) (15Martin B.R. Kim B.N. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), or rCx43-GFP-4C were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.5 μm ReAsH-EDT2 or 0.9 μm FlAsH-EDT2, 12.5 μm EDT in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Free and nonspecifically bound ReAsH or FlAsH was removed by washing with EDT (600 μm, 20 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution). Cells were then incubated for several hours (chase time) in the presence of complete medium. The newly synthesized recombinant proteins were stained at the end of the chase time with the second label, which was FlAsH-EDT2 for the cells initially labeled with ReAsH-EDT2 or vice versa. After washing, cells were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (for light microscopy imaging) or 2% glutar-aldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) for EM processing. Photoconversion of Diaminobenzidine and Electron Microscopy—After 20 min fixation, cells were rinsed in cacodylate buffer and blocked for 30 min on ice with 5 mm KCN, 20 mm aminotrizole, 50 mm glycine to reduce nonspecific background. Photoconversion and EM preparation were performed as previously described (16Gaietta G. Kim T.J. Adams S.R. Bouwer J. Tour O. Laird D.W. Sosinsky G.E. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Science. 2002; 296: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Scrape Dye Loading/Transfer Assay—MDCK parental and stably expressing rPanx1-wt, rPanx1-4C, or rCx43-4C were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. The procedure for these assays follows el-Fouly and colleagues (17el-Fouly M.H. Kim J.E. Chang C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar); however, after 4% paraformaldehyde fixation, samples were processed for immunofluorescence. Electrophysiology—The oocyte cell-cell channel assay was performed as described earlier (18Dahl G. Stevenson B.G.W. Paul D. Cell-Cell Interactions, A Pratical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 143-165Google Scholar). The follicle layer was removed from oocytes by collagenase treatment. The oocytes were injected with in vitro transcribed Panx1 or Cx46 cRNA and incubated for 2-3 days. The vitelline membrane was removed with forceps and the oocytes paired. Junctional conductance was determined with the dual voltage clamp technique (19Spray D.C. Kim A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) at various time points after pairing. Pannexin1 Forms a Multimeric Channel—The oligomeric state of a protein can be analyzed using chemical cross-linkers, as it had been shown for connexins (20VanSlyke J.K. Kim L.S. Methods. 2000; 20: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test whether Panx1 forms a multimeric channel, we treated Triton X-100-solubilized extracts of HEK-293T cells expressing rPanx1-Myc (49 kDa) with DSP, which is an amino-reactive reagent. At a high concentration of DSP (300 μg/ml) two bands were clearly observed (Fig. 1B). Based on size, they are likely to correspond to the rPanx1-Myc dimeric (98 kDa) and hexameric forms (∼290 kDa). At a lower concentration of DSP (50 μg/ml) a ladder of partially cross-linked products was observed including the monomer (49 kDa), dimer (98 kDa), trimer (147 kDa), and hexamer (∼290 kDa) (data not shown). Breaking the cross-links by boiling in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol resulted in the disappearance of the intermediate forms (Fig. 1B), reducing all products to the monomer (49 kDa). On the contrary, boiling in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol did not reverse the cross-links and the intermediate products were observed (data not shown). Bands higher than the corresponding hexamer were not observed even at 300 μg/ml of DSP indicating that the cross-linker DSP allowed the formation of an oligomeric complex and not an aggregate. To further confirm this result, the cross-linked sample was run on a 3-8% Tris acetate gel that allows better resolving of very large proteins, using HiMark Pre-stained HMV Protein Standard (Invitrogen) as reference. As shown in Fig. 1C, the higher band mapped just above the 268-kDa marker band indicating it corresponds to the Panx1 hexameric form (∼290 kDa). Under these conditions, besides the hexamer and dimer bands, we also observed the monomer as a single band. Pannexin1 Is N-Glycosylated and Expressed at the Cell Surface—Analysis of Panx1 protein by Western blot revealed the presence of multiple bands, as shown in Fig. 2A. Here, cell lysates from parental or rPanx1-Myc transiently expressing HEK-293T cells were probed using an anti-Panx1 antibody or an anti-Myc antibody. Three specific Panx1 bands were observed to which we will refer to as upper, intermediate, and lower bands. A similar multiple banding pattern was also observed for the native protein from whole heart and brain lysate of adult mouse, where the upper and lower bands were clearly distinguished, whereas in rat astrocytes, and in a mouse endothelial cell line only the lower band was evident (Fig. 2B). This indicated that the different Panx1 species were not due to differences in trafficking/processing of recombinant tagged constructs. The presence of multiple bands is often due to post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, as it has been shown with connexins (21Musil L.S. Kim E.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), or glycosylation as determined for potassium channels (22Watanabe I. Kim J. Recio-Pinto E. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8879-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To test whether the multiple band pattern of Panx1 could represent different phosphorylated species, we used an alkaline phosphatase-based dephosphorylation protocol (CIAP in Fig. 2C, lane 2): no change was observed in the pattern of the bands as compared with untreated membrane lysates (Fig. 2C, lane 1) suggesting that phosphorylation is not responsible for the multiple bands of Panx1. To test whether the multiple band pattern could represent different glycosylated species, a glycosidase treatment of rPanx1-WT or rPanx1-Myc protein was performed using Endo H and another enzyme, PNGase F, which does not distinguish between the differentially processed N-linked glycosylated sugars. As shown in Fig. 2C, after Endo H treatment only the intermediate band shifted suggesting this band corresponds to high mannose-type glycoproteins residing in the ER (Fig. 2C, lane 3). The upper and lower bands were Endo H insensitive. PNGase F treatment down shifted both upper and intermediate bands suggesting that the higher band represented the fully processed protein (mature-type glycoprotein, trans-Golgi glycosylated) expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 2C, lane 4). The lower band was not affected by PNGase F treatment, suggesting it corresponded to the non-glycosylated core protein. Similar results were obtained in another stably expressing cell line (MDCK rPanx1-4C) where the higher band was sensitive to PNGase treatment and the lower one was not (data not shown). In summary, rPanx1 is N-glycosylated and forms three species: GLY0 (the non-glycosylated core protein), GLY1 (the high mannose-type glycoprotein), and GLY2 (the fully processed glycoprotein). Preventing Glycosylation of Pannexin1 by Site-directed Mutagenesis Results in Intracellular Localization—We analyzed the amino acid sequence of rPanx1 for putative glycosylation sites (CBS prediction server, NetNGlyc, Ref. 23Gupta R. Kim S. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2002; 7: 310-322Google Scholar). We found four predicted N-glycosylation sites at asparagine 204, 254, 337, and 423. Asn-204, Asn-337, and Asn-423 are located in the predicted cytoplasmic domains, whereas Asn-254 is in the second extracellular loop of rPanx1. To determine which of the predicted sites is important as a glycosylation site, we used site-directed mutagenesis to inhibit N-glycosylation. Two intracellular and one extracellular asparagine (Asn-204, Asn-337, and Asn-254, respectively) were mutated to glutamine (Fig. 3A). The Asn-423 had a lower prediction score than Asn-337 and because this residue is at the distal end of the C terminus it seemed unlikely that it would be a glycosylation site. The Asn to Gln mutants were transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells and examined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3B, the N204Q mutant was similar to the WT protein as it showed all different species of protein (GLY0, GLY1, and GLY2); conversely, the N254Q mutant was fully glycosylation-deficient as it lacked both the intermediate (GLY1) and upper (GLY2) bands (Fig. 3C) and was resistant to PNGase F treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, the N337Q mutant was only partially glycosylated as it showed the intermediate band (GLY1), but lacked the upper (GLY2) band (Fig. 3C). The immunocytochemical localization of wild-type, Myc-tagged and mutant proteins was compared with that of the ER residing protein calnexin. Both Myc-tagged wild-type and N204Q mutant proteins were localized at the cell surface (Fig. 4, A and B). However, it appeared that N254Q and N337Q mutants were retained in the ER and showed clear co-localization with calnexin (Fig. 4, C and D). To further investigate whether Panx1 was localized at the cell surface, we biotinylated intact rPanx1-WT or rPanx1-Myc expressing HEK293T cells and analyzed the protein lysates by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The biotinylated proteins were recovered by passage through an avidin resin column (bound fraction) and compared with the total protein lysate (unbound fraction, nonbiotinylated). As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 1 and 2, the upper band (GLY2) was biotinylated, demonstrating that it corresponds to the protein on the cell surface. Because the upper band was insensitive to Endo H treatment, we concluded it corresponds to mature-type glycoproteins (trans-Golgi glycosylated proteins). Although the intermediate band is found in the bound fraction, this is most likely due to some residual intracellular proteins labeled by the biotinylation reagent, as shown in the lower part of the blot hybridized with an antibody against α-tubulin. However, there is relatively little labeling of α-tubulin in the bound fraction when compared with the unbound one. Cell surface biotinylation of the N mutants (Fig. 5B, lanes 3-8) further confirmed the cell surface expression of the N204Q mutant only. To summarize, we showed that: (i) rPanx1 is glycosylated at residue Asn-254; (ii) this process is an important step in the trafficking of the protein; and (iii) preventing N-glycosylation at the Asn-254 residue induces high ER retention and inhibits cell surface expression.FIGURE 5Cell-surface biotinylation of rPanx1-wt, rPanx1-Myc, and N mutant proteins. Biotinylated (bound, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) and non-biotinylated (unbound, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) proteins were probed with a chicken polyclonal antibody against Panx1. To confirm that the biotinylation reagent did not label intracellular proteins, a second gel was run in parallel and hybridized with an antibody against α-tubulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further tested whether the N254Q mutant rPanx1 formed a multimeric channel. Chemical cross-linking with 300 μg/ml DSP caused the appearance of cross-linked products corresponding to the monomer (49 kDa), dimer (98 kDa), trimer (147 kDa), and hexamer (∼290 kDa) of N254Q rPanx1 (data not shown). The hexamer and monomer bands were the predominant species in this gel. The single band corresponding to the monomers was always highly distinguishable after cross-linking suggesting that the mutation could interfere with the ability of the protein to completely assemble in an oligomeric channel. Breaking the cross-links by boiling in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol resulted in the disappearance of the cross-linked species, reducing all products to the single-band monomers. Deglycosylation by Pharmacological Treatment Prevents the Expression of Pannexin1 on the Cell Surface—In addition to site-directed mutagenesis, we tested pharmacologically the effect of protein glycosylation in targeting Panx1 to the plasma membrane. We used tunicamycin, which inhibits transfer of the initial high mannose unit to the nascent peptide and thus prevents all N-linked glycosylation. MDCK cells stably expressing a tetracysteine domain-tagged rPanx1 (rPanx1-4C) were treated with tunicamycin (2 μg/ml) for different incubation times (Fig. 6). Over the periods of time tested, Western blot analysis revealed a significant decline in the fully processed Panx1 glycoproteins (GLY2), and an increase in the non-glycosylated core proteins (GLY0). To spatially segregate nascent versus older Panx1 proteins we used the pulse-chase labeling protocol with green fluorescent FlAsH-EDT2, and red fluorescent ReAsH-EDT2 (16Gaietta G. Kim T.J. Adams S.R. Bouwer J. Tour O. Laird D.W. Sosinsky G.E. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Science. 2002; 296: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). This allowed us to label two temporally distinct pools of rPanx1-4C. MDCK cells stably expressing rPanx1-4C were stained with FlAsH-EDT2, incubated for different periods of time (chase time) in regular medium or in the presence of tunicamycin, then labeled with ReAsH-EDT2, fixed, and imaged (Fig. 7). Immunolabeling of the same cells with a polyclonal antibody for Panx1 confirmed the specificity of FlAsH/ReAsH staining (data not shown). The newer rPanx1-4C proteins were distributed throughout the plasma membrane mixing with the older ones. No punctate staining resembling the typical gap junction plaque was observed. As a control, the temporal order of FlAsH-EDT2, and ReAsH-EDT2 labeling was reversed, which produced a similar protein distribution. After 15-18 h the presence of rPanx1-4C initially labeled with the green fluorescent FlAsH-EDT2 was increased in cytoplasmic vesicles, which did not contain both colors suggesting the older proteins were targeted to this compartment for degradation. Following tunicamycin treatment the nascent Panx1-4C proteins accumulated within the cytoplasm and no labeling on the plasma membrane was observed. Furthermore, following treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, there was neither labeling in the intracellular nor the plasma membrane compartment (data not shown). These data confirmed the importance of glycosylation in targeting the newly synthesized Panx1 proteins to the cell surface. To further investigate the nature of the cytoplasmic vesicles containing the older proteins, rPanx1-4C were stained with ReAsH-EDT2, incubated for 15 h in regular medium, labeled with Lysotracker Blue, and then live imaged (Fig. 8). The merged view demonstrated the co-localization of Panx1 with lysosomes highlighting an important role of lysosomes in Panx1 degradation in this cell type. EM Imaging of Pannexin1 Proteins—To test whether Panx1 proteins would form gap junction-like structures we imaged these proteins at high resolution EM using 4C technology and photoconversion (16Gaietta G.

H3.3 is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant and a key substrate for replication-independent chromatin assembly. Elimination of chromatin remodeling factor CHD1 in Drosophila embryos abolishes incorporation of H3.3 into the male pronucleus, renders the paternal genome unable to participate in zygotic mitoses, and leads to the development of haploid embryos. Furthermore, CHD1, but not ISWI, interacts with HIRA in cytoplasmic extracts. Our findings establish CHD1 as a major factor in replacement histone metabolism in the nucleus and reveal a critical role for CHD1 in the earliest developmental instances of genome-scale, replication-independent nucleosome assembly. Furthermore, our results point to the general requirement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–utilizing motor proteins for histone deposition in vivo."

We compare these rates with model estimates of dissolved iron that is added to surface waters by aerosols. This comparison shows that net community production, which is comparable to export production, is proportional to modeled input of soluble iron in aerosols. Our results strengthen the evidence that the addition of aerosol iron fertilizes export production in the Southern Ocean.

Patel Y.M. P-Enolpyruvate Carboxykinase: the Gene and the Enzyme. 1994; (pp. , John Wiley and Sons, New York): 203-281Google Scholar for a review). However, this enzyme is also present in a broad variety of mammalian tissues (2Zimmer D.B. Magnuson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), including the small intestine, colon, mammary gland, adrenal gland, lung, and muscle; its metabolic role in these tissues remains obscure. To study the physiological function of PEPCK-C, the gene has been overexpressed or ablated in specific tissues of the mouse. When PEPCK-C was overexpressed in white adipose tissue, the mice had increased rates of glyceroneogenesis in their adipose tissue and became obese (3Franckhauser S. Munoz S. Pujol A. Casellas A. Riu E. Otaegui P. Su B. Bosch F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast, ablating the expression of PEPCK-C in adipose tissue resulted in mice with lipodystrophy (4Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, a systematic study involving other mammalian tissues where the enzyme has been detected has not been undertaken.We have overexpressed the gene for PEPCK-C in the skeletal muscle of transgenic mice to test the metabolic and physiological consequences. Skeletal muscle was selected as a target organ because there is no clear indication of the metabolic outcome of having a high activity of PEPCK-C in this tissue. Skeletal muscle does not synthesize and release glucose, although there have been reports over the years that the tissue can make glycogen de novo since both PEPCK-C and fructose-1-6-bisphosphatase activities have been found in skeletal muscle (5Opie L.H. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 6Crabtree B. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We have evidence from research ongoing in our laboratory 3C. K. Nye, R. W. Hanson, and S. C. Kalhan, unpublished results. 3C. K. Nye, R. W. Hanson, and S. C. Kalhan, unpublished results. that glyceroneogenesis occurs in skeletal muscle. This pathway is an abbreviated version of gluconeogenesis, which involves the synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate (used for triglyceride synthesis) from precursors other than glucose and glycerol. However, glyceroneogenesis has not previously been reported to occur in skeletal muscle, so the extent of the metabolic effect of overexpressing PEPCK-C in this tissue was not immediately apparent.PEPCK-C is a major cataplerotic enzyme (7Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). However, it is also capable of synthesizing oxalacetate, thus replenishing the citric acid cycle, so it has the potential of being an anaplerotic enzyme. In either case, it would be predicted that increasing the activity of PEPCK-C in skeletal muscle would increase citric acid cycle flux in the animal; ablation of hepatic PEPCK-C greatly reduces citric acid cycle flux (8Burgess S.C. Hausler N. Merritt M. Jeffrey F.M. Storey C. Milde A. Koshy S. Lindner J. Magnuson M.A. Malloy C.R. Sherry A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48941-48949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This is especially important in tissues such as skeletal muscle, in which the levels of citric acid cycle intermediates vary widely during strenuous exercise to accommodate the major increase in total cycle flux that is required to generate the energy to support muscle contraction. An increase in citric acid cycle anions occurs largely due to anaplerosis. However, any four or five carbon intermediate that enters the citric acid cycle must be removed since it cannot be completely oxidized to carbon dioxide in the cycle. It is thus likely that PEPCK-C contributes to both the generation and the subsequent removal of citric acid cycle anions (7Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). If this is the case, the enzyme is an important component of citric acid cycle function in muscle. Until this study, the concept of a critical role of PEPCK-C in energy metabolism in mammalian skeletal muscle has not been tested.Our results indicate that transgenic mice that overexpress the gene for PEPCK-C (about 9 units/g of muscle) have a greatly enhanced level of physical activity, which extends well into old age (24 months or older). This is due, in part, to an increased number of mitochondria and a high concentration of triglyceride in their skeletal muscles. The mice overexpressing the gene for PEPCK-C also have very little body fat, despite eating 60% more than controls. The biochemical basis for this effect was investigated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration and Analysis of Transgenic Mice—A chimeric gene was constructed that included 2 kb of the α-skeletal actin gene promoter (9Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that was linked to a 1976-bp segment of the cDNA for PEPCK-C from the mouse followed by a 710-bp fragment of the 3′-untranslanted region of the bovine growth hormone (bGH) mRNA (see Fig. 1A). The α-skeletal actin gene promoter was a kind gift from Dr. Laurence H. Kedes (University of Southern California). This gene promoter was selected since it has been shown to limit the transcription of linked structural genes to skeletal muscle, with a low level of expression in brown adipose tissue (10Clapham J.C.

The mice were produced at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine Transgenic Mouse Core Facility by a procedure described in detail previously (11McGrane M.M. deVente J. Yun J.

Of the 34 mice that were produced, six positive founders, designated as lines A, B, C, D, E, and F, were identified by Southern blotting. DNA was isolated from the tails of the mice by lysis overnight at 55 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, and 24 mg/ml proteinase K. The DNA was digested with PstI, and the resulting fragments were separated by electrophoresis using 1% agarose gel and transferred to Gene Screen Plus® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 690-bp fragment of the human α-skeletal actin gene promoter (Fig. 1A), which showed no significant homology to sequences in the mouse genome, as judged by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST prediction, was used as a hybridization probe. To increase the activity of PEPCK-C in the skeletal muscle, founder lines C and D were bred together to create a new line, designated as line CD (see Fig. 1C). Homozygous mice in the line CD (C+/+, D+/+) were used for most of the experiments.Animal Care—The mice were maintained in the Case Western Reserve University Animal Resource facility, under the supervision of full-time veterinarians. The research described in this study was approved by the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using the QuickPrep total RNA kit (Amersham Biosciences) (13Yoo-Warren H.

Briefly, 20 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel, transferred to Gene Screen Plus membrane, and hybridized with a 1.0-kb SmaI fragment of the PEPCK-C cDNA. The DNA probe was labeled using [α-32P]dATP.Determination of PEPCK-C—Various mouse tissues were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, containing 5 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. A cytosol fraction, prepared by centrifuging the homogenate at 30, 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, was used to determine the activity of PEPCK-C by the method of Ballard and Hanson (14Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The levels of PEPCK-C from liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle were determined using Western blotting. The antibody to PEPCK-C was kindly provided by Dr. F. J. Ballard (Adelaide, Australia).Assay of Metabolites in the Blood and Tissues—Mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of avertin (0.5 ml of 20 mg/ml solution/25 g of body weight). The concentration of glucose in the blood was determined using an Encore® glucometer (Bayer Corp). Plasma was generated from whole blood using MICROTAINER® plasma separator tubes (BD Biosciences). The concentration of triglyceride, fractionated bilirubin, β-hydroxybutyrate, albumin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol, creatinine, creatine kinase, triglyceride, and free fatty acid was determined by Veterinary Diagnostic Services (Marshfield Laboratories).Muscle triglycerides were extracted using a modification of the method of Folch et al. (15Folch J. Lees M. Stanley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh muscle samples were freed from any visible non-muscle material and weighed out in duplicate. Each sample was homogenized via IKA-ULTRA-TURRAX T 25 basic tissue blender, and total lipids were extracted by incubating the tissue homogenate in a 2:1 chloroform:methanol solution for 48 h at 4 °C. The two phases were further defined by the addition of MgCl2 and centrifugation. The supernatant was extracted and discarded, and the remaining layer was taken to dryness under air. The triglycerides were saponified using methanolic KOH (0.5 n) at 70 °C for 75 min, acidified with 6 n HCl. The resulting fatty acids were extracted three times with hexane. The aqueous phase containing glycerol was dried using a Labconco CentriVap concentrator at 25 °C. The concentration of glycerol was determined using a fluorometric assay essentially as described by Wieland (16Wieland O. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. 1965; (pp. , Academic Press, New York): 211-213Crossref Google Scholar); that value was used for the calculation of the concentration of triglyceride in the tissue.Home Cage Activity Testing—All mice were individually caged 6 weeks prior to the onset of behavioral testing. Prior to home cage activity measurements, the mice were observed in their cages for 15 min, three times a day, to rule out unusual behaviors that could confound the home cage activity measurements, such as locomotor or grooming stereotypy, tremors, unusual nest building, and overall locomotor function (unusual gait events). Two observations were carried out during the light phase, and one was carried out during the dark phase. Five mice were observed at each 15-min time point, with each animal being observed for 30-s intervals.All of the mice were brought into the testing room 24 h prior to the onset of testing for acclimatization to the room and testing conditions, which included the replacement of the standard water/food holding top with a clear top and placing feed and fluid source (Hydrogel®) inside the cage. All mice were tested during the same trial. Animal cages were placed on a table directly below a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (Panasonic), and observations were carried out for 22 h, consecutively, starting at 3 p.m. and concluding at 1 p.m., using a tracking system (Noldus, Ethovision 3.1 Pro, Leesburg, VA). Distance traveled, velocity, and number of rearings as well as turn angle and angular velocity (to further rule out stereotypy-related running) were automatically calculated by the tracking system. Data were nested in 1-h intervals to simplify statistical analysis. Upon termination of testing, wire tops with standard food and water were placed back on the cages, and the mice were returned to their housing room.Maximal Exercise Capacity—Exercise performance and exercise capacity were determined in fed, gender-matched, and age-matched PEPCK-Cmus mice and controls. The mice were subjected to strenuous exercise on a rodent treadmill (Columbus Instruments Oxymax System, Columbus, OH) using standard exercise running tests to evaluate aerobic capacity (VO2max), maximal running endurance, and maximal running speed. To encourage the mice to run, the treadmill was equipped with an electrical shock grid at the rear of the treadmill. The shock grid was set to deliver 0.2 mA, which caused an uncomfortable shock but did not physically harm or injure the animals. When the mice reached exhaustion, as defined by their inability to run for 10 s, the electric shock was discontinued.Types of Treadmill Testing—We included three types of strenuous exercise measurements (treadmill testing) in this study. First, we assessed the ability of untrained PEPCK-Cmus and control mice to run for distance. The animals were initially acclimated to the treadmill environment for 30 min. For warm-up and for further familiarization with treadmill running, the mice were required to run at a relatively easy pace of 10 m/min for 30 min. Then the speed of the treadmill was increased to 20 m/min, and we recorded the exercise duration and distance the mice could run until exhaustion. Exhaustion was defined operationally as the time at which the mouse was unable, or refused, to maintain its running speed despite encouragement by mild electrical stimulation.Second, we determined the VO2max of both types of mice. Prior to running, the mice were acclimated to the enclosed treadmill and its surroundings for 60 min. During this period, measurements of whole body oxygen consumption VO2, carbon dioxide production VCO2, and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were obtained while the animals rested quietly. The mice then began walking on the treadmill at a speed of 5 m/min and a grade of 0° for a 10 min warm-up. The grade of the treadmill was then set to 25°, and the speed was increased 2 m/min every 2 min until the mouse reached exhaustion. Both VO2 and VCO2 were monitored continuously throughout the exercise test. Substrate utilization during exercise was assessed from the RER data. A blood sample was taken before and after exercise for the determination of lactate.Third, PEPCK-Cmus and control mice of various ages were acclimated to the treadmill for 30 min followed by a 30-min warm-up period at a treadmill speed of 10 m/min (set at a grade of 0°). We then increased the speed of the treadmill by 1 m/min every min and determined the maximum speed that the mice could run until exhaustion.Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis of Total Body Fat—A fed PEPCK-Cmus mouse and two control animals were imaged using a 7T/30-cm Bruker BioSpin small animal magnetic resonance scanner. A multislice, multiecho spin echo acquisition was used to obtain high resolution coronal images of a whole mouse using a 120-mm rat volume coil to transmit and receive, with T1-weighting and respiratory gating (time to repetition/echo time = 900/9 ms, 512 × 256 matrix, 110 × 41 mm field of view, 33 slices). To separate visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue compartments, the internal cavity within the abdominal wall was manually segmented using a common software package (Analyze 6.0, Mayo Clinic, Minneapolis, MN). Fat was hyper-intense in these images, allowing us to segment adipose tissue by interactively setting a threshold value. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes were computed from the number of voxels times the volume of a single voxel. Similar single-slice images were acquired for publication (rapid acquisition with retocussed echoes, TR/TE = 1000/12 ms, 512 × 512 matrix, 100 × 60 mm FOV). Image acquisitions were repeated over 3 weeks to examine measurement repeatability.Histological and Electron Microscopy Analysis of Tissues—Skeletal muscle was isolated from overnight fasted PEPCK-Cmus and control mice and fixed immediately in formalin solution (Sigma), in liquid N2, or in Tissue-Tek® OTC compound (Sakura Finetek Inc) for staining by hematoxylin and eosin, for succinate dehydrogenase and NADH dehydrogenase, or for electron microscopy, respectively. The histochemical and electron microscopy analysis was performed at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine by the Cytology Laboratory and the Electron Microscopy Facility.Effect of Aging on the Capacity of PEPCK-Cmus Mice to Run—PEPCK-Cmus mice and controls were maintained in single cages until they reached 24-27 months of age, at which time they were tested for their maximal running speed.RESULTSThe Generation of PEPCK-Cmus Mice—Six founder lines of transgenic mice were generated using standard DNA microinjection techniques. The chimeric gene introduced into the mice contained a 2-kb segment of the α-skeletal actin gene promoter (9Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), linked to the 1976-bp cDNA for PEPCK-C from the mouse followed by the 3′ end of the bGH gene (Fig. 1A). The pattern of incorporation of the chimeric gene DNA into the genome of the four founder lines is shown in Fig. 1B. Each of these founder mice expressed the chimeric gene at varying levels, as determined by the level of PEPCK-C enzyme activity and specific mRNA (Fig. 1, C and D). To enhance the effect of PEPCK-C activity on the metabolism of the muscle, we created a new line of mice by breeding founder lines C and D together (Fig. 1C). This breeding produced mice that had varying levels of PEPCK-C activity in their muscles (Fig. 1C); the animals were subsequently used to determine the consequences of overexpressing PEPCK-C on the metabolism of skeletal muscle. After nine generations of crossbreeding of founder lines C and D, we created a homozygous line of mice, which we termed PEPCK-Cmus mice.Expression of PEPCK-C in Muscle—The expression of the transgene was assessed by both Northern and Western blotting of several tissues isolated from PEPCK-Cmus mice and controls (Fig. 1, D and E). PEPCK-C mRNA transcribed from the transgene was detected in skeletal muscle of PEPCK-Cmus mice; no PEPCK-C mRNA from the transgene was noted in muscle from the control animals. The same pattern was observed by Western blotting, using an antibody specific for PEPCK-C. The level of mRNA for PEPCK-C noted in the skeletal muscle of mice differed in our lines of PEPCK-Cmus mice during the process of breeding founder lines C and D together (Fig. 1D). This was reflected in a variation in the activity of PEPCK-C in the muscle of these mice (Fig. 1C). Homozygous PEPCK-Cmus mice had ∼9 units/g of PEPCK-C activity in gastrocnemius, soleus, and diaphragm; in contrast, the same muscles from control mice have about 0.08 units/g of PEPCK-C activity (Table 1). Since the gene for PEPCK-C was expressed from the α-skeletal actin gene promoter, all the skeletal muscle types determined had the same activity. In addition, the heart from the PEPCK-Cmus mice had 0.74 units/g of enzyme activity; the activity of PEPCK-C is normally undetectable in the hearts of mice. We routinely noted that the activity of PEPCK-C was higher in the livers of the PEPCK-Cmus mice than controls (Table 1). This increased activity was not due to transcription from the transgene since a specific cDNA probe, composed of the 805-bp SmaI-EcoR1 fragment of the bGH gene located at the 3′ end of the transgene, did not hybridize to hepatic mRNA (data not shown). The elevated hepatic PEPCK-C activity was most likely due to induced transcription of the endogenous PEPCK-C gene in the liver of the transgenic mice caused by the high level of energy utilization noted in these mice. Subsequent studies of the physiological effect of overexpression of the gene for PEPCK-C in the muscle concentrated on the use of PEPCK-Cmus mice with about 9 units/g of activity of the enzyme in their skeletal muscles.TABLE 1The activity of PEPCK-C in selected tissues Selected tissues were collected and the activity of PEPCK-C determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phrase “Skeletal muscle” refers to mixed thigh muscle.

A systematic analysis of the PEPCK-Cmus mice was thus undertaken. Our preliminary observations did not detect any obvious signs of stereotypy-like locomotion, excessive grooming, or abnormal gait, all of which are potential confounders during home cages activity measurements of the PEPCK-Cmus mice or controls. Turn angle and angular velocities were similar in both groups, thus ruling out spinning (a common example of stereotypy-like locomotion) in the experimental group. Home cage activity measurements indicated that PEPCK-Cmus mice were markedly more active in their home cages as compared with control animals (Fig. 2). This was indicated by a greatly increased distance traveled and an increased rearing frequency. Likewise, PEPCK-Cmus mice had significantly faster movement in the cage as compared with controls (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2The home cage activity of PEPCK-Cmus mice. The activity of PEPCK-Cmus mice and controls (WT), maintained with a 12-h light/dark cycle, was determined as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The measurements made over 22 h included the distance covered, the velocity of the movement, the rearing frequency, and the percentage of time the mice were strongly mobile.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mobility parameter tracks the location of the pixels, which are identified as belonging to the tracked animal in the current sample frame, and compares them with the pixels in the previous frame. A large difference (more than a user defined threshold) is identified as strongly mobile, a small difference (less than the threshold) is immobile, and values in between are mobile. This allows for a refined and quantifiable categorization of movement, or lack thereof, in experimental subjects. In this regard, our data indicate that although control and PEPCK-Cmus mice spent a similar percentage of time in the mobile range, PEPCK-Cmus mice spent significantly less time immobile and significantly more time as strongly mobile as compared with control mice (Fig. 2). The fact that PEPCK-Cmus mice were faster than controls is in accordance with our strong mobility findings. However, the fact that these animals spent similar portions of time in the mobile range and showed significantly more rearings rules out the possibility that the increased levels of activity (distance traveled) were simply due to a constant higher velocity of the mice.Treadmill Testing—We next tested the ability of PEPCK-Cmus mice to run for distance on a treadmill (Fig. 3). Untrained PEPCK-Cmus mice ran for up to 6 km at a speed of 20 m/min, whereas controls ran for only 0.2 km at the same speed, before exhaustion. The PEPCK-Cmus mice also retained an extraordinary ability to perform strenuous exercise at an age greater than 24 months (see Fig. 9). A sound video of these mice running is included as supplemental data.FIGURE 3PEPCK-Cmus mice run for a long distance on a treadmill. Untrained 3-month-old PEPCK-Cmus mice and controls (WT) were tested for their ability to run long distances. The mice were placed on a treadmill (at a grade of 0°) and run at 20 m/min until exhaustion, as described in the first protocol under “Experimental Procedures.” In the supplemental data, please note that a video is available that documents the remarkable ability of the PEPCK-Cmus mice to run for long distances.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 9Running ability of PEPCK-Cmus mice with age.

https://openalex.org/W2170175460,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein regulates many genes that can determine different cellular outcomes such as growth arrest or cell death. Promoter-selective transactivation by p53, although critical for the different cellular outcomes, is not well understood. We report here that the human cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (hCAS/CSE1L) associates with a subset of p53 target promoters, including PIG3, in a p53-autonomous manner. Downregulation of hCAS/CSE1L decreases transcription from those p53 target promoters to which it preferentially binds and reduces apoptosis. In addition, hCAS/CSE1L silencing leads to increased methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 within the PIG3 gene. hCAS/CSE1L was previously shown to function as a nucleo-cytoplasmic transport factor, as does its closely related yeast homologue Cse1, which can also associate with chromatin and serve as a barrier protein that prevents spreading of heterochromatin. Thus, human CAS/CSE1L can bind select genes with significant functional consequences for p53-mediated transcription and determine cellular outcome."

https://openalex.org/W2129932730,"Neurofibrillary lesions are characteristic for a group of human diseases, named tauopathies, which are characterized by prominent intracellular accumulations of abnormal filaments formed by the microtubule-associated protein Tau. The tauopathies are accompanied by abnormal changes in Tau protein, including pathological conformation, somatodendritic mislocalization, hyperphosphorylation, and aggregation, whose interdependence is not well understood. To address these issues we have created transgenic mouse lines in which different variants of full-length Tau are expressed in a regulatable fashion, allowing one to switch the expression on and off at defined time points. The Tau variants differ by small mutations in the hexapeptide motifs that control the ability of Tau to adopt a β-structure conformation and hence to aggregate. The “pro-aggregation” mutant ΔK280, derived from one of the mutations observed in frontotemporal dementias, aggregates avidly in vitro, whereas the “anti-aggregation” mutant ΔK280/PP cannot aggregate because of two β-breaking prolines. In the transgenic mice, the pro-aggregation Tau induces a pathological conformation and pre-tangle aggregation, even at low expression levels, the anti-aggregation mutant does not. This illustrates that abnormal aggregation is primarily controlled by the molecular structure of Tau in vitro and in the organism. Both variants of Tau become mislocalized and hyperphosphorylated independently of aggregation, suggesting that localization and phosphorylation are mainly a consequence of increased concentration. These pathological changes are reversible when the expression of Tau is switched off. The pro-aggregation Tau causes a strong reduction in spine synapses.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that was initially identified by its ability to drive microtubule (MT) 2The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; AD, Alzheimer disease; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; PHF, paired helical filament; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; tTA, tetracycline transactivator; Ca/CMKIIα, calcium/calmodulin kinase IIα.2The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; AD, Alzheimer disease; FTDP-17, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17; PHF, paired helical filament; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; tTA, tetracycline transactivator; Ca/CMKIIα, calcium/calmodulin kinase IIα. assembly in vitro (1Weingarten M.D. Kim A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). It binds to tubulin via its repeat domain and adjacent sequences (Fig. 1) and thereby promotes MT nucleation and stabilization in neurons, particularly in axons. Thus Tau plays a crucial role in modulating MT dynamics and supporting axonal transport (2Garcia M.L. Kim D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 3Binder L.I. Kim A.L. Garcia-Sierra F. Berry R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 4Mandelkow E. Kim M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Brain Pathol. 2007; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The protein is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 17, alternative splicing leads to 6 isoforms ranging from 352 to 441 amino acids. They differ by the presence or absence of two N-terminal inserts (exons 2 and 3) and by the second of four pseudo-repeats of 31 amino acids in the C-terminal half (exon 10). The efficacy of Tau in binding to MTs is influenced by the degree of phosphorylation and the exclusion/inclusion of exon 10. The majority of phosphorylation sites are serine or threonine residues followed by prolines (SP/TP motifs) that lie in the domains flanking the repeats and can be phosphorylated by several proline-directed kinases. There are other non-SP/TP sites whose phosphorylation causes the detachment of Tau from microtubules. This includes Ser-214 and the KXGS motifs within the repeats (Ser-262, Ser-293, Ser-324, and Ser-356) (5Biernat J. Kim N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Most of these sites are “hyperphosphorylated” in Alzheimer disease (6Morishima-Kawashima M. Kim M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Tau belongs to the class of natively unfolded proteins, it contains very little secondary structure, has a hydrophilic and basic character, and is highly soluble (7Schweers O. Kim E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8von Bergen M. Kim P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Despite this, Tau aggregates into abnormal “paired helical filaments” in Alzheimer disease that can coalesce into “neurofibrillary tangles.” The aggregation is based on short hexapeptide motifs in repeats R2 and R3 that are prone to form β-structure (8von Bergen M. Kim P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Tau is normally confined to axons, but in diseased neurons it becomes missorted to cell bodies and dendrites. Thus, the three most visible changes in Alzheimer Tau are its hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and mislocalization. The progressive spreading of neurofibrillary tangles correlates well with cognitive deficits and neuronal loss in AD (9Braak H. Kim E. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11172) Google Scholar). Whereas AD is characterized by the coexistence of two types of protein aggregates (amyloid fibers composed of Aβ, and PHFs composed of Tau), there are several neurodegenerative disorders dominated by Tau aggregates and hence termed “Tauopathies” (10Spillantini M.G. Kim T.D. Ghetti B. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11Lee V.M. Kim M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev.

Espinoza M. de Silva R. Tucker K.L. Barde Y.A. Duff K. Davies P. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). With these tools, part of the Tauopathies and AD-like pathology can be approximated in mice, such as missorting, hyperphosphorylation, aggregation (ranging from pretangle accumulations of Tau to full neurofibrillary tangles), and age-dependent spreading of the pathology in the appropriate brain areas. These studies revealed that high concentrations of (mutant) Tau can generate Tauopathy, that Aβ exacerbates the degeneration, and that Tauopathy leads to synaptic dysfunction and behavioral deficits. Nevertheless, several issues remain poorly understood. This includes the mode of Tau toxicity and the relationship between Tau levels, Tau conformation, phosphorylation, and aggregation. We set out to test these questions with new transgenic mouse models designed on the basis of our previous experience with Tau properties in vitro (1Weingarten M.D. Kim A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). We use a regulatable expression system (Tet-Off) that allows one to switch the Tau expression on and off at defined time points and avoids artifacts of expression at an early age (2Garcia M.L. Kim D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We use in parallel two variants of Tau that are similar with regard to microtubule interactions but opposite with regard to aggregation. The first variant is full-length Tau (hTau40, 2N4R) carrying the FTDP-17 mutation ΔK280 in the hexapeptide motif of the second repeat. The deletion of Lys-280 facilitates the formation of β-structure and strongly promotes Tau aggregation (“pro-aggregation mutant”) (8von Bergen M. Kim P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 30Barghorn S. Kim Q. Ackmann M. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The second variant contains the same ΔK280 mutation and two additional proline mutations, one in each of the two hexapeptide motifs (I277P and I308P). They disrupt β-structure and thus abrogate aggregation (“anti-aggregation” mutant). For both types of mutants we used a Tet-Off inducible system that combines the tetracycline-responsive transactivator and the calcium/calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) promoter (31Mayford M. Kim M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) for the temporal and regional expression of Tau. The temporal control of the Tet-Off system allows us to study age-dependent effects and reversibility of Tau pathology. The CaMKIIα promoter enables us to achieve a preferential expression of the transgene in the entorhinal region and hippocampus so that the spatial distribution of the human Tau mutants in our model is similar to that in AD. With these mouse models we show that pathological conformation, aggregation, and loss of synapses depend mainly on the β-propensity of the protein. By contrast, hyperphosphorylation and somatodendritic missorting are observed with both Tau mutants, indicating that this depends mainly on Tau concentration but not on aggregation. All changes can be reversed by switching off the Tau expression. Thus, strategies to prevent Tau aggregation should also protect neuronal integrity. Transgenic Constructs—The bidirectional transcription unit encoding the human longest Tau central nervous system isoform with deletion of lysine 280 (hTau40/ΔK280) was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and PCR amplification. This cDNA was inserted at the ClaI and SalI restriction sites into the pBI-5 bidirectional expression vector carrying the reporter luciferase gene (32Baron U. Kim S. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3605-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid DNA was digested with XmnI and AseI enzymes and the 5.75-kb fragment containing the Tet-operon responsive element (tetO), bidirectional cytomegalovirus promoter (Ptet-bi), hTau40/ΔK280, and luciferase sequences, was used for the introduction by microinjection into fertilized DBA eggs. Animals—The activator mouse line (CaMKIIα-tTA mice) in which the tTA transgene is under control of the CaMKIIα promoter was a gift from Dr. E. Kandel, Columbia University, New York (31Mayford M. Kim M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). For the generation of responder mice we used the bidirectional plasmid carrying the bidirectional tetO responsive cytomegalovirus promoter (Ptet-bi), followed by both a TAU mutant in one direction and luciferase reporter sequences in the other. The double transgenic mice were generated by crossing the activator and responder mice, resulting in double transgenic progeny constitutively expressing both transgenes, the mutant TAU and luciferase. The expression can be switched on by withdrawal of doxycycline, and switched off by addition of doxycycline (200 μg/ml in the drinking water) (Tet-Off system). All animals were handled according to standards and guidelines based on the German Animal Welfare Act. The offspring of mice were screened by PCR using the primer pair 5′-AATGAGGTCGGAATCGAAGG-3′/5′-TAGCTTGTCGTAATAATGGCGG-3′ for activator genes and the two primers pairs 5′-GACCTTCCGCGAGAACGCCAAA-3′/5′-AAGAACAATCAAGGGTCCCCA-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCTGGAAGACGAAGCT-3′/5′-GCGGAAGACGGCGACTTGGG-3′ for responder transgenes. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Luciferase activity was used to filter out positive founder animals to ensure that the integration site is not within a silencer region. To make sure that the effects in switched off animals are not due to the silenced integration site but due to the switched off TAU gene, fibroblasts from mouse ear tissue were cultivated, transfected with 400 ng of plasmid encoding the reverse transactivator protein, and induced with 1 mg/ml doxycycline. 18 h later cells were harvested, lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with the Promega kit according to the manufacturers protocol. Non-induced fibroblasts served as a reference. Tissue Preparation—To quantify the species of Tau and the extent of Tau aggregation, two methods were used for the preparation of the tissue, the Sarkosyl extraction method (33Greenberg S.G. Kim P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and the sequential extraction with “reassembly buffer” (RAB), “radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer” (RIPA) and 70% formic acid (14Ishihara T. Kim M. Zhang B. Nakagawa Y. Lee M.K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). For both protocols, the brain was dissected into the cortex, hippocampus, and the rest of the brain. RAB-RIPA-Formic Acid Extraction—The tissue was homogenized in 2 volumes of RAB (0.1 m MES, pH 7, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.75 m NaCl, 0.02 m NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) using a DIAX 900 homogenizer (Heidolph) and centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g and 4 °C. The RAB supernatants were collected. The pellets were suspended in 2 volumes of RIPA (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and centrifuged as above. The RIPA supernatants were also collected. The pellets were resuspended in 0.6 volumes of 70% formic acid and again centrifuged as above. The supernatants were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and used for immunoblot analysis together with the RAB and RIPA supernatants. Sarkosyl Extraction—The tissue was homogenized (DIAX 900, Heidolph) in 3 (for cortex) and 10 volumes (for hippocampus) of buffer H (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.8 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors). The homogenate was kept on ice for 20 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 27,200 × g and 4 °C. The pellets were homogenized a second time in the same volumes of buffer H and centrifuged as above. The supernatants from both centrifugation steps were combined (S1 + S2). The pellets (P2) were resuspended in 3 volumes of buffer III (0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Na-PIPES, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm Na2H2PO7, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). The combined supernatants S1 + S2 were mixed with 1% N-lauroylsarcosinate (Sarcosyl) and 1% mercaptoethanol, incubated for at least 1 h at 37 °C, and centrifuged for 35 min at 150,000 × g at room temperature. The supernatants S3 were collected. The pellets (P3) were resuspended in 0.5 volumes of Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 154 mm NaCl). All fractions (S1 + S2, P2, S3, and P3) were used for immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Fractionated tissue extracts were dissolved in sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and 2.5% SDS and boiled. Equal volumes of the samples were separated on 8-10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using blotting buffer (38.4 mm Tris, 31.2 mm glycine, 0.024% SDS, 20% methanol) in a semi-dry chamber. After blocking with Tris-buffered saline + 5% nonfat milk + 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with various primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, 1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of immunolabeling was quantitatively analyzed with the imaging system LAS 3000 (Fuji). In some cases polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were stripped (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 60 °C) and used several times with different primary antibodies. Immunohistochemistry—Brains from hTau40ΔK280 transgenic mice and control animals were either immersion fixed in 3.5% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde (29 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 45.8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0), or they were from animals that had been perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Biochrom AG). Histological staining and immunohistochemistry were performed on 5-μm paraffin sections. Paraffin was removed from the sections by immersing them in xylole substitute (Fluka), followed by sequential incubation in a descending series of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 0.6% H2O2 in 100% ethanol as an intermediate step. Epitope retrieval was done dependent on the primary antibodies and performed in citrate buffer (1.8 mm citric acid, 8.2 mm sodium citrate, pH 6) for 5 min at 95 °C. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline/Triton (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 145 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. All following steps were done using the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit Universal (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine plus solution (DAKO) served as substrate for the peroxidase. In some experiments the sections were counterstained with Mayer Hemealaun (MERCK). Sections were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol and xylol substitute and mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific). Gallyas silver staining was done on 5-μm paraffin sections as described (9Braak H. Kim E. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11172) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies used were K9JA (pan-Tau antibody from DAKO, A0024, recognizes human and mouse Tau), MC-1 (pathological Tau conformation) and PHF-1 (phospho-Ser-396 + Ser-404) (both gifts from P. Davies, Albert Einstein College), and 12E8 (phosphorylated KXGS motifs, Ser(P)-262, Ser(P)-356, gift from P. Seubert, Elan Pharma). Ser(P)-199, Thr(P)-231, Ser(P)-214, and Ser(P)-46 recognize phosphorylation at single SP or TP sites (custom-made, Eurogentec), HT-7 (PerBio), and T14 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) are human Tau specific. AT180 (Thr(P)-231 + Ser(P)-235) and AT8 (Ser(P)-202 + Thr(P)-205) recognize dual phosphorylation sites (PerBio). Synapse Count—Animals were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), and analysis of synapses was performed as described (34Kretz O. Kim L. Wehrenberg U. Zhou L. Brauckmann S. Zhao S. Prange-Kiel J. Naumann T. Jarry H. Frotscher M. Rune G.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5913-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400-μm hippocampal slices after fixation in 1% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer were postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon 820. Blocks were trimmed to contain only the stratum pyramidale and radiatum of the CA1 region. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert-Jung OmU3 ultramicrotome. The sections were stained with uranyl acetate, followed by lead citrate. The spine synapse density was calculated using stereological methods as described (35Prange-Kiel J. Kim G.M. Leranth C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Inducible Transgenic Mice—We generated two inducible transgenic mouse models with animals expressing hTau40 (the longest isoform in human CNS, 2N4R) carrying the deletion mutation ΔK280 (Fig. 1A). This mutation is known from a case of FTDP-17 (36Rizzu P. Kim J.C. Joosse M. Hasegawa M. Stevens M. Tibben A. Niermeijer M.F. Hillebrand M. Ravid R. Oostra B.A. Goedert M. van Duijn C.M. Heutink P.

Genet. 1999; 64: 414-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and strongly increases the tendency of Tau to aggregate into PHFs in vitro because it enforces the β-structure around the hexapeptide motif in repeat 2 (pro-aggregation mutant). By contrast the additional point mutations I277P (in R2) and I308P (in R3) abrogate the ability of Tau to form PHFs (anti-aggregation mutant) because the prolines act as β-breakers (8von Bergen M. Kim P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 30Barghorn S. Kim Q. Ackmann M.

We used a transgenic mouse where the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) gene (37Gossen M. Kim H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) was placed downstream of the CaMKIIα promoter to restrict the expression of tTA protein to the forebrain (31Mayford M. Kim M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The choice of the CaMKIIα promoter, rather than the Thy-1 promoter used in earlier studies (12Götz J. Kim A. Spillantini M.G. Schafer T. Jakes R. Burki K. Goedert M.

Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 99: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was dictated by the need to avoid the expression of Tau in the spinal cord where it would impair axonal traffic and cause motor neuron defects (15Spittaels K. Kim C. Van Dorpe J. Bruynseels K. Vandezande K. Laenen I. Geerts H. Mercken M. Sciot R. Van Lommel A. Loos R. Van Leuven F. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2059725455,"The reaction of F with H2 and its isotopomers is the paradigm for an exothermic triatomic abstraction reaction. In a crossed-beam scattering experiment, we determined relative integral and differential cross sections for reaction of the ground F(2P(3/2)) and excited F*(2P(1/2)) spin-orbit states with D2 for collision energies of 0.25 to 1.2 kilocalorie/mole. At the lowest collision energy, F* is approximately 1.6 times more reactive than F, although reaction of F* is forbidden within the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. As the collision energy increases, the BO-allowed reaction rapidly dominates. We found excellent agreement between multistate, quantum reactive scattering calculations and both the measured energy dependence of the F*/F reactivity ratio and the differential cross sections. This agreement confirms the fundamental understanding of the factors controlling electronic nonadiabaticity in abstraction reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2055599523,"The gut epithelium self-renews every several days, providing an important innate defense system that limits bacterial colonization. Nevertheless, many bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, efficiently colonize the intestinal epithelium. Here, we show that the Shigella effector IpaB, when delivered into epithelial cells, causes cell-cycle arrest by targeting Mad2L2, an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) inhibitor. Cyclin B1 ubiquitination assays revealed that APC undergoes unscheduled activation due to IpaB interaction with the APC inhibitor Mad2L2. Synchronized HeLa cells infected with Shigella failed to accumulate Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in an IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent manner. IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent cell-cycle arrest by Shigella infection was also demonstrated in rabbit intestinal crypt progenitors, and the IpaB-mediated arrest contributed to efficient colonization of the host cells. These results strongly indicate that Shigella employ special tactics to influence epithelial renewal in order to promote bacterial colonization of intestinal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2067813540,"Chemokine receptors are presently used as targets for candidate drugs in the frame of inflammatory diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infection. They were shown to dimerize, but the functional relevance of dimerization in terms of drug action remains poorly understood. We reported previously the existence of negative binding cooperativity between the subunits of CCR2/CCR5 heterodimers. In the present study, we extend these observations to heterodimers formed by CCR2 and CXCR4, which are more distantly related. We also show that specific antagonists of one receptor inhibit the binding of chemokines to the other receptor as a consequence of their heterodimerization, both in recombinant cell lines and primary leukocytes. This resulted in a significant functional cross-inhibition in terms of calcium mobilization and chemotaxis.

Chemokine receptors constitute an attractive family of drug targets in the frame of inflammatory diseases, human immunodeficiency virus, and cancer (1Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Shaw J.P.

Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S212-S221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the complexity and the functional redundancy of the chemokine system have represented significant hurdles in this development. There is therefore a need for a better comprehension of the chemokine signaling network and how molecules (agonists and antagonists) acting on specific receptors will affect the global function of the chemokine system. One of the challenges in this area is the recent demonstration that G protein-coupled receptors, including chemokine receptors, are able to form dimers, and the functional consequences of this new concept have not been fully appreciated so far. CCR2 is a member of the CC chemokine receptor family that plays an important role in the recruitment of monocytes to atherosclerotic lesions and in the formation of intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury (3Charo I.F. Taubman M.B. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of CCR2 have been described that are generated by alternative splicing and differ in their C-terminal tail, but only the longer variant (CCR2b) is expressed at high level in leukocytes. CCR2 interacts with MCP-1 (CCL2) and other CC chemokines such as MCP-2 (CCL7), MCP-3 (CCL8), and MCP-4 (CCL13) (4Jiang Y. Beller D.I. Frendl G. Graves D.T. J.

CCR2 was shown to form homodimers, as well as heterodimers with CCR5, its closest structural relative within the chemokine receptor family, resulting in a negative binding cooperativity of allosteric nature (5Mellado M.

However, no pharmacological characterization of this heterodimer was performed so far. CXCR4 binds specifically SDF-1α, an evolutionary conserved chemokine known to play a role in a number of physiological processes, such as the homing of T cell populations to sites of inflammation and the maintenance of the cellular microenvironment in bone marrow (10Buckley C.D.

In addition, CXCR4 is the main coreceptor for the T cell line tropic human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 strains (16Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). CXCR4 and CCR2 share only 34% of amino acid identity over their entire length. The ligand binding specificity of CCR2 and CXCR4 has been mapped to the extracellular domains of the receptors, particularly the second extracellular loop (17Choi W.T. Tian S. Dong C.Z. Kumar S. Liu D. Madani N. An J. Sodroski J.G. Huang Z. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15398-15404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both CXCR4 and CCR2 are expressed by memory T lymphocytes and the monocyte-macrophage lineage (18Frade J.M. Mellado M. del Real G. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Lind P. Martinez A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5576-5584PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rabin R.L. Park M.K. Liao F. Swofford R. Stephany D. Farber J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3840-3850PubMed Google Scholar). As other chemokine receptors, they are coupled to the Gαi class of heterotrimeric G proteins, inhibit adenylyl cyclase, promote intracellular calcium mobilization, stimulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, and promote chemotaxis. With the aim of understanding better the functional consequences of chemokine receptor oligomerization, we have generated cells coexpressing CCR2 and CXCR4 and characterized them in terms of binding and signaling properties. We confirmed that CCR2 and CXCR4 form constitutive heterodimers, which appear unaffected by chemokine stimulation. As previously described for the CCR2/CCR5 heterodimer, negative binding cooperativity was observed between CCR2 and CXCR4 when coexpressed, a receptor heterodimer binding only a single chemokine with high affinity. In addition, it was shown that specific antagonists of one receptor can inhibit the binding of chemokines to receptors on which these antagonists do not bind, resulting in a cross-inhibition of the functional response, and these observations were attributed as well to an allosteric interaction between the two binding sites of a dimer. Finally, similar observations were made on primary T cells ex vivo, demonstrating the functional relevance of CCR2/CXCR4 heterodimers in native cells. Antibodies—Phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CXCR4 (MAB173), anti-CCR2 (FAB151P) monoclonal antibodies, and recombinant chemokines were obtained from R & D Systems. The DOC-1 anti-CCR2 antibody was kindly provided by Matthias Mack (University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany). TAK-779 was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID and AMD3100 from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Lines and Leukocyte Populations—CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The CCR2 coding sequence was cloned between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the bicistronic expression vector pEFIB3, as described (20Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and the construct was transfected by FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) into a CHO-K1 cell line expressing apoaequorin, Gα16 and wild-type CXCR4. Cells expressing CCR2 were selected by 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were prepared from buffy coats of healthy blood donors as described previously (8Springael J.Y. Le Minh P.N. Urizar E. Costagliola S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1652-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CD4+ blasts were generated by incubating the lymphocytes with anti-CD3 (1:100) and anti-CD28 (1:1000) antibodies for 3 days. The cells were maintained in a medium supplemented with human interleukin 2 (2 ng/ml; R & D Systems) for an additional 7 days. Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Assays—The cDNAs encoding EYFP 3The abbreviations used are: EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor. and a humanized form of Renilla luciferase were fused in frame to the 3′ end of CXCR4 and CCR2 cDNAs in the pcDNA3.1 vector. A BRET protocol adapted to cell monolayers was used (21Urizar E. Montanelli L. Loy T. Bonomi M. Swillens S. Gales C. Bouvier M. Smits G. Vassart G. Costagliola S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1954-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, using a constant amount of plasmid DNA but various ratios of plasmids encoding the fusion protein partners (22Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). A control corresponding to mock transfected cells was included to subtract raw basal luminescence and fluorescence from the data. Expression of EYFP fusion proteins was estimated by measuring fluorescence at 535 nm following excitation at 485 nm, using a Mithras LB940 multilabel reader (Berthold). Expression of Rluc fusion proteins was estimated by measuring the luminescence of the cells after incubation with 2.5 μm coelenterazine H (Promega). In parallel, BRET was measured as the fluorescence of the cells at 535 nm at the same time points. The BRET ratio is defined as [(emission at 510–590)/(emission at 440–500)] - Cf where Cf corresponds to (emission at 510–590)/(emission at 440–500) for the -hRluc construct expressed alone in the same experiment. Binding Assays—Competition binding experiments were performed as previously described (7El Asmar L. Springael J.Y. Ballet S. Andrieu E.U. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane preparations were incubated in the assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% BSA) with 0.2 nm 125I-SDF-1α or 0.1 nm 125I-MCP-1 as tracers and variable concentrations of unlabeled competitors. The samples were incubated for 1 h, and bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 1% BSA. The filters were counted in a γ-scintillation counter. Binding parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Softwares) using nonlinear regression applied to single-site or two-site binding models. The software compared the sum-of-square and the degree of freedom of each regression by using the F test and selected the most appropriate equation. Dissociation Kinetics Experiments—Ligand dissociation experiments were performed as previously described (8Springael J.Y. Le Minh P.N. Urizar E. Costagliola S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1652-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The membrane preparations were first incubated in assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% BSA) with 0.1 nm 125I-MCP-1 or 125I-SDF-1α in a final volume of 500 μl. After 1 h, the membranes were centrifuged, and the unbound radioligand was removed by aspiration. The membrane pellet was washed once with assay buffer and resuspended in 2.5 ml of assay buffer, with or without unlabeled ligands. At different time points, the aliquots were collected, the bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked for 1 h in 1% BSA, and the filters were counted for 1 min in a γ-scintillation counter. In all experiments, total binding and total tracer remaining at the initiation of the dissociation phase represented less than 10% of the amount of tracer engaged initially. The data are presented as the ratio between bound cpm at the various dissociation time points and total bound cpm at time 0 of dissociation. The curves were fitted with PRISM software (Graphpad Softwares) using nonlinear regression and a single phase decay model. Intracellular Calcium Mobilization Assay—The functional responses were analyzed with an aequorin-based assay as described (23Blanpain C. Migeotte I. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 4 h in the dark in the presence of 5 μm coelenterazine H (Promega Corporation) and then diluted 5-fold before use. Variable concentrations of chemokines were added to cell suspension (25,000 cells/well), and luminescence was measured for 30 s in an EG & G Berthold luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Softwares) using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model. Chemotaxis Assay—The migration of CD4+ T cells was performed in 96-well transwell chambers (5-μm pore size; Costar, Corning NY). The lower compartment of the chambers was loaded with serial dilutions of SDF-1α or MCP-1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA. The upper compartment was loaded with 5 × 105 cells preincubated or not with specific antagonists, and migration was allowed for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested in the lower chamber and counted by the ATPlite luminescence assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The results are expressed as the chemotaxis index, i.e. the ratio of cells migrating in response to the chemoattractant over cells migrating toward medium. Heterodimerization of CCR2 and CXCR4 in Recombinant Cell Lines—In previous studies, we showed that CCR2 forms constitutive homodimers, as well as heterodimers with its close structural relative CCR5 (6Issafras H. Angers S. Bulenger S. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. Labbe-Jullie C. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The functional consequence of this heterodimerization was a negative binding cooperativity between the CCR5 and CCR2 ligands, as a result of an allosteric interaction between the two binding sites of the heterodimer (8Springael J.Y. Le Minh P.N. Urizar E. Costagliola S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1652-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated further the ability of CCR2 to interact with more distant members of the chemokine receptor family and whether a negative binding cooperativity could apply as well for other such heterodimers. In a first step, we investigated by a BRET technique the extent of heterodimerization between CCR2 and CXCR4 in living cells. As described previously, a constitutive energy transfer was measured between CXCR4-hRluc and CXCR4-EYFP and between CCR2-hRluc and CCR2-EYFP expressed in HEK293T cells (7El Asmar L. Springael J.Y.

A constitutive energy transfer was also observed between CXCR4-hRluc and CCR2-EYFP, as well as between CCR2-hRluc and CXCR4-EYFP. The BRET50 and BRETmax parameters of energy transfer for CCR2/CXCR4 heterodimers were similar to those reported for homodimers (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Stimulation by chemokines specific to CCR2 or CXCR4 did not change the BRET50 values but modified to some extent the BRETmax. Indeed, MCP-1 increased the maximal energy transfer between CCR2-hRluc and CXCR4-EYFP but not between CXCR4-hRluc and CCR2-EYFP. These data are similar to those reported previously (9Percherancier Y. Berchiche Y.A. Slight I. Volkmer-Engert R. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Bouvier M. Heveker N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9895-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and support the conclusions following which the stimulation by chemokines modifies the conformation of preformed CCR2/CXCR4 dimers rather than the amount of dimers.FIGURE 2Competition binding assays using CCR2 and CXCR4 antagonists. A and C, competition binding assays performed on cells expressing CXCR4 (A) or CCR2/CXCR4 (C) and incubated with 125I-SDF-1α as tracer and unlabeled SDF-1α (○), AMD3100 (□), and TAK779 (▪, purple) as competitors. B and D, competition binding assays performed on cells expressing CCR2 (B) or CCR2/CXCR4 (D) and incubated with 125I-MCP-1 as tracer and unlabeled MCP-1 (•), AMD3100 (□, red), and TAK779 (▪) as competitors. The data were normalized for specific binding in the absence of competitor (100%) and nonspecific binding (0%) in the presence of 30 nm SDF-1α (A and C) or MCP-1 (B and D).

The parental CHO-K1 cell line expressing CXCR4 (Bmax = 3.1 ± 0.1 pmol/mg membrane proteins) was used as the recipient for CCR2 coexpression, and the C2X4–40 clone expressing both receptors was selected for further analysis. The estimated KD values for CXCR4 and CCR2 measured on this clone (respectively 0.22 ± 0.03 nm and 0.16 ± 0.03 nm) are consistent with values described previously for cells expressing single receptors (0.20 ± 0.03 nm for CXCR4 and 0.15 ± 0.01 nm for CCR2) (7El Asmar L. Springael J.Y. Ballet S. Andrieu E.U. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In saturation binding assays, the Bmax was estimated to 3.2 ± 0.07 pmol/mg proteins for CXCR4 and to 2.5 ± 0.04 pmol/mg proteins for CCR2. FACS analysis demonstrated that the selected clones were homogeneous in terms of receptor expression and regular testing confirmed the stability of this expression over time. Binding Properties of Cells Expressing CXCR4 and CCR2—We next examined the ability of the ligands of each receptor to compete for 125I-SDF-1α and 125I-MCP-1 binding to membranes of cells expressing CXCR4 and/or CCR2. As expected, SDF-1α inhibited with high affinity the binding of 125I-SDF-1α on membranes containing CXCR4 only, whereas MCP-1 had no effect (Fig. 1A). Similarly, MCP-1 but not SDF-1α competed efficiently the binding of 125I-MCP-1 on membranes containing exclusively CCR2 (Fig. 1B). A drastic modification of the competition patterns was observed when CXCR4 and CCR2 were coexpressed. In the 125I-SDF-1α binding assay, SDF-1α behaved similarly, but MCP-1 now competed partially (IC50 = 0.02 ± 0.01 nm) (Fig. 1C). Conversely, in the 125I-MCP-1 binding assay, competition by MCP-1 was unaffected, whereas a significant competition by SDF-1α was observed (IC50 = 0.78 ± 0.09 nm) (Fig. 1D). The IC50 values calculated for heterologous competition were similar to those obtained for homologous competition in cells expressing single receptors (Table 2). Heterologous competitions were, however, incomplete, representing ∼35% of the specific binding. These results suggest that about one-third of each receptor takes part with heterodimers and that within these heterodimers, ligands specific for one receptor are able to compete for the binding of the tracer on the other. We next tested the ability of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and the CCR2 inverse agonist TAK-779 to promote similar heterologous competition. As expected, AMD3100 and TAK-779 did not compete for respectively 125I-MCP-1 and 125I-SDF-1α binding when the receptors were expressed alone (Fig. 2, A and B). However, AMD3100 was able to compete for 125I-MCP-1 binding as efficiently as SDF-1α on membranes prepared from cells coexpressing CXCR4 and CCR2 (Fig. 2D). Similarly, TAK-779 efficiently competed the binding of 125I-SDF-1α in the same conditions (Fig. 2C). Yet again, the IC50 values were similar to those obtained for cells expressing single receptors (Table 2), and the extent of the competition reached about 35% of the specific binding. The fact that small molecule antagonists can behave similarly to chemokines in these cross-competition experiments indicates that receptors do not need to reach their active state to inhibit the binding capacity of their heterodimerization partner. These results also suggest that the observed phenomenon is not linked to the steric occupancy of both receptors by a single ligand. We investigated further the potential contribution of steric hindrance at the outer surface of the receptor heterodimers by testing anti-CXCR4 and anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibodies in binding assays. The anti-CXCR4 MAB173 prevented 125I-SDF-1 binding on membranes containing CXCR4 or the two receptors but did not affect 125I-MCP-1 binding. Similarly, the anti-CCR2 DOC-1 prevented 125I-MCP-1 binding but not 125I-SDF-1 binding ( supplemental Fig. S2).TABLE 2Binding parameters of CHO-K1 cells expressing CCR2 and/or CXCR4 The binding parameters were measured on CHO-K1 cells expressing CCR2 and/or CXCR4.

Le Minh P.N. Urizar E. Costagliola S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1652-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We showed that, on membranes prepared from cells expressing CCR2 only, dissociation of prebound 125I-MCP-1 was slow in the absence of unlabeled ligands (t½ > 200 min; Fig. 3 E and Table 3), but complete dissociation was observed after 24 h (not shown). The dissociation rate of 125I-MCP-1 was increased when CCR2 and CXCR4 were coexpressed (t½ = 27.6 min; Fig. 3F). Conversely, the presence of CCR2 increased significantly the dissociation rate of prebound 125I-SDF-1α from CXCR4 (t½ = 35.6 min versus t½ > 200 min; Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, we showed that the specific CXCR4 ligands SDF-1α and AM3100 had no effect on the dissociation of bound 125I-MCP-1 from membranes containing CCR2 only. However, both molecules accelerated the dissociation of 125I-SDF-1α from CXCR4, but also of 125I-MCP-1 when CXCR4 and CCR2 were coexpressed (t½ = 14.7 and 23.0 min, respectively; Fig. 3, F and H). Similarly, MCP-1 and TAK779 promoted a rapid dissociation of 125I-MCP-1 from CCR2 and of 125I-SDF1α when CXCR4 and CCR2 were coexpressed (t½ = 15.4 and 13.8 min, respectively; Fig. 3, B and D). These data suggest that the stability of the interaction of CXCR4 and CCR2 with their respective chemokine ligands is lower in heterodimers than in homodimers. In addition, the binding of a chemokine agonist or a small molecule antagonist to one of the partners in a heterodimer modifies further the conformation in the other partner, resulting in a faster dissociation rate of the tracers.TABLE 3Dissociation rates from CHO-K1 cells expressing CCR2 and/or CXCR4 The binding parameters were measured on CHO-K1 cells expressing CCR2 and/or CXCR4.

This study shows that the mammalian KCC2 gene (alias Slc12a5) generates two neuron-specific isoforms by using alternative promoters and first exons. The novel KCC2a isoform differs from the only previously known KCC2 isoform (now termed KCC2b) by 40 unique N-terminal amino acid residues, including a putative Ste20-related proline alanine-rich kinase-binding site. Ribonuclease protection and quantitative PCR assays indicated that KCC2a contributes 20–50% of total KCC2 mRNA expression in the neonatal mouse brain stem and spinal cord. In contrast to the marked increase in KCC2b mRNA levels in the cortex during postnatal development, the overall expression of KCC2a remains relatively constant and makes up only 5–10% of total KCC2 mRNA in the mature cortex. A rubidium uptake assay in human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed that the KCC2a isoform mediates furosemide-sensitive ion transport activity comparable with that of KCC2b. Mice that lack both KCC2 isoforms die at birth due to severe motor defects, including disrupted respiratory rhythm, whereas mice with a targeted disruption of the first exon of KCC2b survive for up to 2 weeks but eventually die due to spontaneous seizures. We show that these mice lack KCC2b but retain KCC2a mRNA. Thus, distinct populations of neurons show a differential dependence on the expression of the two isoforms: KCC2a expression in the absence of KCC2b is presumably sufficient to support vital neuronal functions in the brain stem and spinal cord but not in the cortex.

During embryonic development, KCC2 mRNA expression follows neuronal maturation, first becoming detectable in the postmitotic neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord and then gradually increasing in higher brain structures (5Lu J.

The use of alternative promoters, and consequently alternative first exons, is thought to play a pivotal role in generating the complexity required for highly elaborated molecular systems in brain development. More than 50% of human genes may be regulated by alternative promoters, resulting in a wide variety of transcripts (8Kimura K. Wakamatsu A. Suzuki Y. Ota T. Nishikawa T. Yamashita R. Yamamoto J. Sekine M. Tsuritani K. Wakaguri H. Ishii S. Sugiyama T. Saito K. Isono Y. Irie R. Kushida N. Yoneyama T. Otsuka R. Kanda K. Yokoi T. Kondo H. Wagatsuma M. Murakawa K. Ishida S. Ishibashi T.

Alternative transcripts may have different expression patterns and can be translated into proteins with different structures, phosphorylation patterns, or subcellular localizations, thus providing a molecular mechanism for the fine-tuning of gene functions (9Landry J.R. Mager D.L. Wilhelm B.T. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, alternative splice forms of K-Cl cotransporters KCC1 and KCC3 with different expression patterns (10Adragna N.C. Fulvio M.D. Lauf P.K. J. Membr.

Nitric Oxide. 2003; 9: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have been described, although their physiological role remains mostly unclear. Here we describe a novel KCC2 isoform (hereby named KCC2a) that differs from the previously characterized KCC2 isoform (now termed KCC2b) by 40 amino acids in the N terminus encoded by an alternatively spliced exon (named exon-1a). Like KCC2b, the expression of KCC2a mRNA is restricted to CNS neurons. KCC2a contributes 20–50% of the total KCC2 mRNA expression in the neonatal mouse brain stem and spinal cord but only 5–10% in the mature cortex. We also show that mice with a targeted disruption of KCC2 exon-1b (14Woo N.S. Lu J. England R. McClellan R. Dufour S. Mount D.B. Deutch A.Y. Lovinger D.M. Delpire E. Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) lack KCC2b but retain KCC2a mRNA. Because these mice survive for 2 weeks (14Woo N.S. Lu J. England R. McClellan R. Dufour S. Mount D.B. Deutch A.Y. Lovinger D.M. Delpire E. Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whereas mice that lack both KCC2 isoforms die at birth due to severe motor defects (3Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), KCC2a is presumably important for the basic neuronal network functions in the brain stem and spinal cord required for survival. Sequence Analysis—CpG islands inside the KCC2 gene were analyzed using the CpG Plot tool. The expressed sequence tag data base (dbEST) was BLAST-searched using the upstream CpG island I sequence (∼400 bp) as a query, and the hits obtained were analyzed against the genome data base. Phosphorylation patterns were predicted with Scansite (15Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Sequences of primers used in this study appear in supplemental Table S1. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—5′-RACE was performed using the mouse 15-day embryo Marathon-ready cDNA kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The first round of amplification was performed with adapter primer AP1 from the kit and KCC2 exon-1a-specific reverse R1a primer (supplemental Table S1). An aliquot from the first reaction was used for nested PCR with adapter primer AP2 from the kit and KCC2 exon-1a-specific reverse R1a-2 primer. The PCR conditions were: 2 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles (first round) or 30 cycles (second round) at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. Products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel, purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced. The results were confirmed with another RACE kit (GeneRacer; Invitrogen) using RNA prepared from adult mouse brain (data not shown). Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)—RPA was performed as described previously (16Timmusk T. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) using the RPA kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). RNA was isolated using RNAwiz (Ambion). A 195-bp PCR fragment, comprising 27 bp of exon-1a, 95 bp of exon-2, and 73 bp of exon-3 of the mouse KCC2 gene was amplified with primers F1a and R3 (supplemental Table S1), ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector, and sequenced. To generate a 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe, the vector was linearized at a unique AvaI restriction site in KCC2 exon-1a. Thus, the length of the protected fragment corresponding to KCC2a mRNA was 186 bp versus 168 bp for the KCC2b isoform. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Micro (Qiagen) or NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) kits. Typically, ∼1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and either random or KCC2 exon-2-specific primers (at 37 or 55 °C, respectively) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA samples were amplified using the DyNAmo Flash SYBR Green quantitative PCR kit (Finnzymes) and detected via the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Primers for KCC2a, KCC2b, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) quantification were designed with Express v2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) or manually and contained an intronic sequence in between (supplemental Table S1). Expression Constructs—To obtain KCC2a and KCC2b expression constructs with an identical backbone, we prepared the full-length KCC2a cDNA by substituting the nucleotides corresponding to exon-1b with exon-1a in the full-length KCC2b cDNA. For this, a 5′-fragment of rat KCC2a cDNA was first amplified by PCR using primers specific for exon-1a (F1a-3) and exon-7 (R7) (supplemental Table S1) and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. This was then digested with SpeI (in the polylinker) and MunI (in exon-5 of KCC2) and ligated into a vector carrying the full-length rat KCC2b cDNA (clone 5ERB14, provided by Dr. John A. Payne) (17Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) that was predigested with SpeI and MunI. Finally, the full-length KCC2a and KCC2b cDNAs were ligated into the XbaI and HindIII sites of the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). Functional 86Rb Flux Assay—Flux experiments were performed at 24 °C on day-old postconfluent human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (18Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two days before the measurements, the cells were transfected with KCC2a and KCC2b expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. On the day of the flux measurement, the cells were washed three times in control medium (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm RbCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm Na2SO4, 3 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm ouabain) and preincubated in control medium for 30 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 2 mm furosemide. The cells were then incubated for 3 min in the medium containing 2 μCi/ml 86RbCl (Amersham Biosciences). 86Rb influx was terminated by five washes in ice-cold control medium containing 2 mm furosemide. Cells were solubilized in 2% SDS and assayed for 86Rb by scintillation counting (Wallac 1450 Microbeta; PerkinElmer). Identification of a New Upstream Exon in the KCC2 Gene–We have recently characterized the promoter responsible for the transcription of the previously known neuron-specific and developmentally up-regulated KCC2 isoform (17Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 19Uvarov P. Pruunsild P. Timmusk T. Airaksinen M.S. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13463-13473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transcription start sites are often associated with CpG islands (21Larsen F. Gundersen G. Lopez R. Prydz H. Genomics. 1992; 13: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). To identify possible new alternative promoters for KCC2, we analyzed a ∼40-kb human genomic fragment bearing the KCC2 gene using a CpG island-finding tool. This predicted several CpG islands within the previously characterized KCC2 promoter region but also one CpG island ∼7 kb upstream of the known KCC2 promoter (Fig. 1A) that was a candidate for an alternative KCC2 promoter. A BLAST search using the upstream CpG island sequence as a query revealed two human expressed sequence tag clones (DA102113 and DA328785) matching a putative novel KCC2 exon (named exon-1a) spliced directly to exon-2 and subsequent KCC2 exons (up to exon-5). This suggested the existence of an alternative KCC2 transcript starting from the novel exon-1a. The genomic sequence corresponding to the KCC2 exon-1a is highly conserved between human, mouse, and rat genomes. A few expressed sequence tags homologous to the human KCC2 exon-1a sequence were found in the mouse but they were not spliced directly to KCC2 exon-2 (data not shown). To address whether a corresponding alternative KCC2 transcript starting from exon-1a is expressed in mice, we assayed adult mouse brain samples by RT-PCR using different combinations of KCC2 forward and reverse primers (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). A PCR product of the predicted size (∼100 bp) was amplified with exon-1a forward (F1a) and exon-2 reverse (R2) primers, suggesting that these two exons were spliced directly. This result was confirmed using the F1a forward and exon-3, exon-5, or exon-7 reverse primers (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Sequencing of these PCR fragments revealed no insertions between exon-1a and exon-2. To demonstrate that a full-length KCC2 isoform containing exon-1a (KCC2a) is expressed in vivo, we carried out nested RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from an embryonic day E18 rat hippocampus. This resulted in a PCR product of expected size ∼3.4 kb (Fig. 1C), and its sequencing confirmed that KCC2a mRNA differs from KCC2b transcript only by the presence of exon-1a instead of exon-1b, so that all the other KCC2 exons (from exon-2 to exon-26) are identical in both isoforms. Exon-1a Encodes a Novel N Terminus That Includes a Putative SPAK/OSR1 Binding Motif—To identify the transcription start site(s) and the initiation methionine for the KCC2a isoform, we performed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE). Analysis of the longest PCR product obtained indicates that the novel KCC2 exon-1a comprises a 5′-UTR of at least 59 bp followed by the initiation methionine and 121 bp encoding 40 amino acids that are specific for KCC2a (Fig. 2A). Residues 3–12 in the KCC2 exon-1a are highly conserved among mammals and comprise a sequence similar to the Ste20-related proline alanine-rich kinase/oxidative stress response-1 (SPAK/OSR1) binding motif (22Delpire E. Gagnon K.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). In addition, several putative Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites were predicted within the 40 residues encoded by exon-1a (Fig. 2B and data not shown). One of these sites, Ser-27, had the highest score among all predicted Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites within the 1139-residuelong mouse KCC2a isoform. Protein kinase A was predicted to be the most probable kinase for phosphorylation of Ser-27. KCC2a and KCC2b mRNA Levels Are Not Significantly Different in Newborn Mouse Brain, but KCC2b Expression Is Steeply Up-regulated during Postnatal Development—To study the expression pattern of KCC2a and to evaluate the relative expression of KCC2a and KCC2b mRNAs, we carried out an RPA using total RNA isolated from multiple mouse tissues with a probe that simultaneously detects the KCC2a and KCC2b isoforms. RPA showed expression of both KCC2 isoforms in the brain, whereas no specific signal was observed in the liver (Fig. 3A). The level of KCC2a mRNA was lower in the adult brain than that of KCC2b and consisted of only 4–8% of total KCC2 (KCC2a + KCC2b) mRNA (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the relative expression of KCC2a mRNA was clearly higher (∼19–23% of total KCC2 mRNA expression) in the embryonic and neonatal brain (Fig. 3A). To further compare the relative expression of KCC2a versus KCC2b mRNAs in different CNS regions and at different developmental stages, we used quantitative (real-time) RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). Because exon-1b mRNA tends to form strong hairpin structures that prevent effective cDNA synthesis (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown), first-strand cDNA synthesis was accomplished with KCC2 exon-2-specific primer R2, which allowed cDNA synthesis at high temperature. Under these conditions, the relative expression of KCC2a and KCC2 mRNAs were similar at embryonic day E17 in all the brain regions examined (Fig. 3B). The situation was clearly different at postnatal day P14: KCC2a expression was three to six times lower than that of KCC2b, ranging from ∼32% of total KCC2 expression in the brain stem to ∼13% in the cerebellum (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Taken together, the RPA and quantitative RT-PCR results indicate that the two KCC2 isoforms are expressed at nearly comparable levels in the prenatal and early postnatal brain but KCC2b mRNA expression level was clearly higher than that of KCC2a during late postnatal development. KCC2a mRNA Expression Is Restricted to the Central Nervous System and Is Not Significantly Up-regulated during Postnatal Development—Previous studies of KCC2 expression have used PCR primers, in situ probes, or antibodies that detect both KCC2 isoforms (1Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar, 5Lu J. Karadsheh M. Delpire E. J.

Neurol. 2004; 468: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 23Kanaka C. Ohno K. Okabe A. Kuriyama K. Itoh T. Fukuda A. Sato K. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We compared the temporal and regional expression of KCC2a and KCC2b mRNA in a mouse brain by in situ hybridization using probes specific for each isoform. Hybridization of adult mouse brain sections with an exon-1b-specific probe revealed an expression pattern similar to that obtained with long probes detecting both KCC2 isoforms (supplemental Fig. S2; compare with Refs. 17Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar and 23Kanaka C. Ohno K. Okabe A. Kuriyama K. Itoh T. Fukuda A. Sato K. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, the probe, being GC-rich (>70%) and relatively short (∼100 bp), produced a high background and failed to detect KCC2b mRNA in embryonic and early postnatal brains. The same problem (>75% GC-rich and short length of the exon-1a probe) coupled with the lower expression of KCC2a in the adult brain (Fig. 3A) hindered the detection of KCC2a mRNA by in situ hybridization (data not shown). Thus, to compare KCC2a mRNA expression between different CNS regions and at different time points, we performed RT-PCR using random primers in first-strand cDNA synthesis to allow GAPDH normalization. First, to confirm the absence of KCC2a mRNA in non-neuronal tissues, and to obtain a qualitative estimate of KCC2a and KCC2b expression in different CNS areas, the cDNA was subjected to 40 cycles of amplification in a conventional PCR with KCC2a-, KCC2b-, and GAPDH-specific primers. In E17 mouse embryos, KCC2a expression was clearly detected in the brain stem, spinal cord, and olfactory bulb, while PCR signals were very low in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 4A). PCR with KCC2b primers showed a similar expression pattern. Neither KCC2a nor KCC2b was detected in any non-neuronal tissues examined. Likewise, both KCC2 isoforms were present in all brain regions analyzed, but not in non-neuronal tissues at P14 (Fig. 4B). Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that KCC2a mRNA levels (relative to GAPDH levels) in E17 mouse brain stem were ∼5-fold higher than in the cortex (Fig. 4C), which is consistent with the results of the qualitative PCR (Fig. 4A). In contrast, different CNS areas expressed comparable levels of KCC2a mRNA at P14 (Fig. 4C). KCC2b expression at E17 was 10–15 times lower in the hippocampus and cortex than in the brain stem. In contrast to KCC2a, the expression of KCC2b increased strongly in the hippocampus (∼10-fold) and neocortex (∼35-fold) (Fig. 4D). KCC2a Promoter Is Active in Neurons—To establish that the genomic region upstream of exon-1a possesses transcription activity in cultured neurons, we cloned ∼1 kb of mouse genomic sequence upstream of the predicted KCC2a transcription start site (Fig. 2A) into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector. The luciferase activity of this reporter (named KCC2-1a) was compared with that of the previously characterized 1.4-kb KCC2b promoter (KCC2-1b) (19Uvarov P. Pruunsild P. Timmusk T. Airaksinen M.S. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both constructs produced robust luciferase activity in DIV5 and DIV10 cultured rat cortical neurons, although the activity of KCC2-1b was ∼2-fold higher (Fig. 5). This result indicated that the KCC2a proximal promoter is active in primary neurons. KCC2a Can Mediate 86Rb Transport in HEK293 Cells—To address whether the KCC2a isoform is able to mediate K-Cl cotransporter activity in mammalian cells, we performed functional 86Rb uptake assays in HEK293 cells (18Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis demonstrated that both isoforms were strongly expressed in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the KCC2a (KCC2a-HEK293) and KCC2b (KCC2b-HEK293) constructs (supplemental Fig. S3). Upon transfection, 86Rb uptake increased 2.5-fold in KCC2a-HEK293 and 2.4-fold in KCC2b-HEK293 compared with non-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 6). After pretreatment with furosemide (2 mm), a known inhibitor of K-Cl cotransporters, the remaining 86Rb influx in the KCC2a- and KCC2b-transfected cells was similar to that in non-transfected cells (Fig. 6). These results indicate that KCC2a is active in HEK293 cells without exogenous stimulation, similar to KCC2b isoform reported previously (18Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The application of NEM (1 mm), a sulfydryl alkylating agent widely used to activate K-Cl cotransporters (24Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), increased 86Rb uptake 2.2-fold in the KCC2a- and 1.6-fold in the KCC2b-transfected cells but not in the non-transfected ones (Fig. 6). The NEM-induced activation of 86Rb uptake in the KCC2a- and KCC2b-transfected cells was completely blocked by furosemide (Fig. 6). Thus, NEM increased the furosemide-sensitive 86Rb uptake 2.6-fold in the KCC2a-HEK293 and 1.7-fold in the KCC2b-HEK293 cells (Fig. 6). Together, the results indicate that KCC2a can mediate isotonic 86Rb uptake comparable with that of KCC2b in mammalian cells. KCC2b-deficient Mice Retain KCC2a mRNA Expression–KCC2 null mutant mice, produced by the deletion of exon-5 (3Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) or disruption of exon-4 (25Tornberg J. Voikar V. Savilahti H. Rauvala H. Airaksinen M.S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), both of which result in a complete lack of KCC2 protein, die at birth due to severe motor deficits, including respiration failure. In contrast, the targeted disruption of KCC2 exon-1b produced mice that can survive for 2 weeks after birth (14Woo N.S. Lu J. England R. McClellan R. Dufour S. Mount D.B. Deutch A.Y. Lovinger D.M. Delpire E. Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because these mice retain 5–8% of normal KCC2 protein levels (at postnatal day P10–12), and exon-1a remains intact in these mice, we assumed that the remaining KCC2 would be attributed to the KCC2a isoform. To confirm this, we used RT-PCR to compare the expression of KCC2a and KCC2b mRNAs in the brains of littermate mice that were wild-type, heterozygous (KCC2b+/–), or homozygous (KCC2b–/–) for the KCC2 exon-1b disruption. As expected, KCC2b mRNA expression was absent in brains from homozygous KCC2b–/– mice, while KCC2a mRNA was present (Fig. 7A). Consistent with the presence of only one functional KCC2b allele in the heterozygous KCC2b+/– mice, the proportion of KCC2b to KCC2a mRNA in the KCC2b+/– mouse brain was ∼50% lower than in their wild-type littermates (Fig. 7B). In contrast, KCC2a expression (relative to GAPDH) remained unchanged between the genotypes (Fig. 7C). Here we have characterized a novel neuron-specific KCC2a isoform produced by an alternative promoter and first exon usage. The KCC2a isoform differs from the previously known major KCC2b isoform by 40 unique N-terminal amino acid residues that comprise a putative SPAK/OSR1 binding motif. Although the postnatal increase in the major KCC2b isoform prevails over that of KCC2a in the cortex during late postnatal development, the KCC2a and KCC2b isoforms show nearly comparable mRNA levels in the brain stem and spinal cord during prenatal and early postnatal stages. This suggests that KCC2a may play an important role in the developing brain stem and spinal cord. Consistent with this idea, mice that lack KCC2b but retain an apparently normal level of KCC2a expression survive for up to 2 weeks (14Woo N.S. Lu J. England R. McClellan R. Dufour S. Mount D.B. Deutch A.Y. Lovinger D.M. Delpire E. Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking both KCC2 isoforms die immediately after birth due to severe motor defects, including respiration failure (3Hubner C.A.

The amount of KCC2 protein remaining in the KCC2b-deficient mouse brain correlates with the KCC2a mRNA levels. However, a detailed comparison of KCC2a mRNA and protein levels in different brain areas and at developmental time points remains a subject of future studies. Nevertheless, we suggest that KCC2a expression is sufficient to reduce intracellular chloride to a level necessary to maintain basic inhibitory functions such as the motor control of respiration, required for survival. Because the KCC2b-deficient mice eventually die of spontaneous seizures by the end of the second postnatal week, KCC2a levels in the cortex are presumably too low to support the higher chloride extrusion efficiency required for hyperpolarizing inhibition in mature cortical neuronal networks. In agreement with the previous data showing that KCC2 is exclusively expressed in CNS neurons, both KCC2a and KCC2b mRNAs were undetectable by RT-PCR in all peripheral tissues examined. The lack of KCC2 in CNS glial cells in previous studies using C-terminal antibodies and 3′ in situ hybridization probes that detect both KCC2 isoforms suggests that both KCC2 isoforms are restricted to CNS neurons. Consistent with this, the distribution pattern of the weak KCC2 immunoreactivity that remains in the brain stem of mice lacking KCC2b (26Blaesse P. Guillemin I. Schindler J. Schweizer M. Delpire E. Khiroug L. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10407-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) resembles the pattern of KCC2 immunoreactivity in wild-type mice. Additional studies using KCC2b-deficient mice should confirm this and address whether the subcellular distribution of the two KCC2 isoforms is similar. Together the results indicate that both KCC2a and KCC2b isoforms are restricted to CNS neurons, although the regulation of their expression clearly differs during cortical development. Regulatory elements within the KCC2b promoter region, including binding sites for neuron-enriched transcription factors such as Egr4, seem largely sufficient to drive the neuron-specific expression of KCC2b mRNA, whereas the neuronal restrictive silencing element located in the intron-1b of the KCC2 gene (27Karadsheh M.F. Delpire E. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 995-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) is dispensable (19Uvarov P. Pruunsild P. Timmusk T. Airaksinen M.S. J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13463-13473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The predicted ∼430-bp proximal KCC2a promoter contains a putative TATA box and conserved binding sites for ubiquitous transcription factors (such as E2F and HNF4) but no obvious conserved sites for neuron-enriched transcription factors (data not shown). Thus, the mechanisms that restrict the expression of KCC2a to CNS neurons remain to be studied. The neuronal restrictive silencing element in intron-1b and/or another neuronal restrictive silencing element located in intron-7 of the KCC2 gene (28Bruce A.W. Donaldson I.J. Wood I.C. Yerbury S.A.

Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R85Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) may contribute to this restriction. Of the four K-Cl cotransporters (KCC1-KCC4), KCC2 is unique in mediating constitutive K-Cl cotransport under isotonic conditions because of a distinct C-terminal domain (30Mercado A. Broumand V. Zandi-Nejad K. Enck A.H. Mount D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1016-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, functional 86Rb uptake assays in HEK293 cells indicated that both KCC2 isoforms can mediate robust ion transport activity without exogenous stimulation. The furosemide-sensitive 86Rb uptake in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with KCC2a or KCC2b was similar in magnitude to that reported in stably transfected KCC2b-HEK293 cells (18Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, induction of the furosemide-sensitive 86Rb uptake by NEM was comparable between the two KCC2 isoforms in the transiently transfected HEK293 cells and similar in magnitude to that previously observed (23Kanaka C. Ohno K. Okabe A. Kuriyama K. Itoh T. Fukuda A. Sato K. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Several Ser/Thr residues within exon-1a were predicted to be phosphorylation sites and thus candidates to regulate the function of the KCC2a isoform. However, none of them was completely conserved among different mammals. In contrast, the most N-terminal part of the exon that comprises a putative SPAK binding sequence was highly conserved among mammals. Although the sequence in KCC2a differs slightly (R against G/V/S in position–1 and L against S/T/V/I in +7 position) from the published SPAK binding consensus motif (21Larsen F. Gundersen G. Lopez R. Prydz H. Genomics. 1992; 13: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), the critical 1st, 2nd, and 4th positions are present (31Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A recent study reported a putative Drosophila fly KCC2 homolog kazachoc (kcc) that also generates alternative splice forms with different N termini: one is enriched in adult neurons and the other, in embryos (32Hekmat-Scafe D.S. Lundy M.Y. Ranga R. Tanouye M.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8943-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the three critical residues of the proposed SPAK/OSR1 kinase binding site also appear in the N terminus of the embryonic kcc splice form (Fig. 2B). Even if KCC2b does not have a SPAK binding motif, SPAK can regulate KCC2b function in Xenopus laevis oocytes (33Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C134-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to study whether SPAK binds and regulates the activities of the KCC2 isoforms differently.

Insulin is one of the hormones that regulates activity of ENaC. In this study, we investigated the contribution of two related protein kinases, Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and the serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase (Sgk), on insulin-induced ENaC activity in Fisher rat thyroid cells expressing ENaC. Overexpression of Akt1 or Sgk1 significantly increased ENaC activity, whereas expression of a dominant-negative construct of Akt1, Akt1K179M, decreased basal activity of ENaC. Inhibition of the endogenous expression of Akt1 and Sgk1 by short interfering RNA not only inhibited ENaC but also disrupted the stimulatory effect on ENaC of insulin and of the downstream effectors of insulin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PDK1. Conversely, overexpression of Akt1 or Sgk1 increased expression of ENaC at the cell membrane and overcame the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC. Furthermore, mutation of consensus phosphorylation sites on Nedd4-2 for Akt1 and Sgk1, Ser342 and Ser428, completely abolished the inhibitory effect of Sgk1 and Akt1 on Nedd4-2 action. Together these data suggest that both Akt and Sgk are components of an insulin signaling pathway that increases Na+ absorption by up-regulating membrane expression of ENaC via a regulatory system that involves inhibition of Nedd4-2.

Transepithelial Na+ absorption across the kidney distal collecting duct, the distal colon, and the ducts of the exocrine glands occurs via the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) 4The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; siRNA, short interfering RNA; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FRT, Fischer rat thyroid; RT, reverse transcription; Sgk, serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase. 4The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; siRNA, short interfering RNA; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FRT, Fischer rat thyroid; RT, reverse transcription; Sgk, serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase. and is tightly regulated by hormones such as aldosterone, insulin, and arginine vasopressin. These hormones play an important role in Na+ and fluid homeostasis, and their activities are critical in the regulation of blood pressure. Comprehensive knowledge of the signal transduction pathways that underlie the effect of these hormones on ENaC is therefore essential for our understanding of the development of homeostatic abnormalities such as essential hypertension. Insulin is a peptide hormone that manifests a stimulatory effect on Na+ transport in a variety of epithelia (1Nizet A. Lefebvre P. Luyckx A. Crabbe J. Curr. Probl. Clin.

The immediate natriferic effect of insulin is attributed to an increase in the open probability of ENaC (5Tong Q. Gamper N. Medina J.L. Shapiro M.S. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22654-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Marunaka Y. Hagiwara N. Tohda H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F392-F400PubMed Google Scholar) or an increase in the number of active ENaC at the apical membrane (4Blazer-Yost B.L. Esterman M.A. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1645-C1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Blazer-Yost B.L. Liu X. Helman S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1373-C1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acting through insulin receptor substrate-1, insulin activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. This activation is essential for mediating several insulin responses, and PI3K has been identified as integral for mediating the effect of insulin on ENaC (8Cohen P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). For instance, insulin treatment increases colocalization of PI3K with ENaC, thereby promoting translocation of ENaC to the apical membrane (4Blazer-Yost B.L. Esterman M.A. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1645-C1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 prevents insulin-induced translocation of the channel (4Blazer-Yost B.L. Esterman M.A. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1645-C1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and attenuates the insulin-induced current attributed to ENaC (9Record R.D. Froelich L.L. Vlahos C.J. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E611-E617PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the initial phospholipid product catalyzed by PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, is known to have a direct stimulatory effect on ENaC (5Tong Q. Gamper N. Medina J.L. Shapiro M.S. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22654-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Helms M.N. Liu L. Liang Y.Y. Al-Khalili O. Vandewalle A.

Less well understood, however, is the downstream signaling pathway linking PI3K to the final activation of ENaC. The insulin signaling cascade after PI3K involves translocation of several effector proteins that harbor phospholipid-specific binding motifs. These effector proteins include Akt, a group of protein kinases composed of three isoforms, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, that belong to the “cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent, protein kinase C” family. At the cell membrane, Akt is phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase, PDK1 (11Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activated Akt is believed to be the central mediator of insulin signaling with profound effects on several physiological events (12Cong L.N.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 461-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Despite the key role of Akt in insulin signaling, a recent study suggested that Akt plays no part in insulin-induced ENaC regulation (17Arteaga M.F. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F90-F96Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the observation that overexpression of a constitutively active Akt1 mutant (Akt1T308D/S473D) failed to potentiate either the basal or the insulin-induced Na+ currents (17Arteaga M.F. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F90-F96Google Scholar). The other candidate for the effector proteins downstream of PI3K that regulate ENaC is Sgk. This kinase is known to be a key mediator of the effect of the hormone aldosterone on ENaC. Aldosterone acts through Sgk1 to increase ENaC activity by a mechanism that involves inhibition of the ubiquitin protein ligase, Nedd4-2 (18Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C.

Pfluegers Arch. 2006; 452: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase enzyme that modulates several membrane proteins via a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. Nedd4-2 binds its tryptophan-rich WW domains to the proline-rich PY motifs on its target protein causing ubiquitination of the substrate. Current studies suggest that phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 by Sgk1 prevents Nedd4-2 from interacting with and down-regulating the activity of ENaC (18Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 19Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). There are two important observations that support the notion that Sgk1 may be the key mediator of the insulin signaling pathway that links PI3K with ENaC activation. First, many physiological effects of insulin, such as translocation of GLUT1 and stimulation of NHE3, which are mediated by PI3K, are Sgk1-dependent (21Palmada M. Boehmer C. Akel A. Rajamanickam J. Jeyaraj S. Keller K. Lang F. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Fuster D.G. Bobulescu I.A. Zhang J. Wade J. Moe O.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 292: F577-F585Google Scholar). Additionally, insulin cannot further increase ENaC activity in cells that overexpress Sgk1 (17Arteaga M.F. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F90-F96Google Scholar). Surprisingly, given the significant role of Sgk1 in mediating the effect of both aldosterone and insulin on ENaC activity, Sgk1 knock-out mice did not display any alteration of Na+ homeostasis except when challenged with a low salt diet (23Wulff P. Vallon V. Huang D.Y. Volkl H. Yu F. Richter K. Jansen M. Schlunz M. Klingel K. Loffing J. Kauselmann G. Bosl M.R. Lang F. Kuhl D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The lack of influence of Sgk1 on Na+ and fluid homeostasis seen in the Sgk1 knock-out mice suggests the presence of a redundant regulatory pathway or pathways that can mediate the effect of these hormones on ENaC in the absence of Sgk1. To determine whether an alternative effector protein mediates the effect of insulin on ENaC, we reinvestigated the contribution of Akt to insulin-induced ENaC activity. Our strategy was to determine whether alteration of the level of expression of Akt could modify the stimulatory effect of insulin on ENaC. The roles of PI3K, PDK1, and Sgk1 on ENaC activity and the regulatory mechanism that underlies the impeding effect of Akt and Sgk1 on the activity of Nedd4-2 action and hence ENaC regulation were also investigated. DNA Constructs—Mouse α-, β-, and γ-ENaC in pBluescript were the gifts from Thomas R. Kleyman (University of Pittsburgh). These clones contain FLAG tags at the C-terminal end. The cDNA were subcloned into pcDNA3.1. A wild-type Akt1 (wtAkt1), a constitutively active myristoylated Akt1 (Akt1Myr), and a dominant-negative Akt1 mutant (Akt1K179M) were obtained from Philip N. Tsichlis (Tufts-New England Medical Center). The cDNA for a constitutively active PI3K (PI3Kp110*) was provided by Lawrence M. Pfeffer (University of Tennessee). A wild-type PDK1 (wtPDK1) was the gift from Morten Frödin (Glostrup Hospital, Glostrup, Denmark), and a wild-type Sgk1 was provided by Kun-Liang Guan (University of Michigan). Cell Culture and Transfection—Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells were the gift from Dr. Lucio Nitsch (University of Naples), and M1 mouse collecting duct cells, which natively express ENaC, were the gift from Dr. Christoph Korbmacher (Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg). Both cell types were cultured in Ham's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C; however, the media for FRT cells contained 5% fetal bovine serum whereas the media for M1 cells contained 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 nm dexamethasone. Cells were seeded onto permeable filter supports (Millicell PCF, 0.4-μm pore size, Millipore). One day after seeding, FRT cells were cotransfected with cDNA of α-, β-, and γ-mENaC-FLAG (0.7 μg/ml) together with cDNA of Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, Sgk1, PI3K, PDK1 or Nedd4-2 (3 μg/ml) or siRNA against Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, Sgk1, or Nedd4-2 (0.5 μg/ml). All siRNAs were obtained from Qiagen, Australia. In short, cDNA or siRNA were mixed with Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM reduced serum media (Invitrogen) and incubated for 20 min before being transferred to the apical side of the monolayer and further incubated for 6 h. The transfection medium was then replaced with Ham's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media containing fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and amiloride (10 μm). Western Blot—Two days after transfection, FRT cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing (in mm) 50 Tris-HCl, 150 NaCl, 10 EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 plus Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After the protein concentration of each lysate was determined, an equal amount of protein lysate was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated overnight with goat anti-Akt1 or goat anti-Sgk1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The blots were washed to remove unbound antibodies before incubating with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were then washed with a TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, and the proteins of interest were visualized. Electrophysiology Experiments—After the monolayer became confluent, normally within 2–3 days after transfection, the Millicell PCF insert was transferred to a modified Ussing chamber. Apical and basolateral surfaces of the monolayer were simultaneously perfused with a solution containing (in mm) 130 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, maintained at 37 °C. Experiments were carried out under open circuit conditions (24Kunzelmann K. Beesley A.H. King N.J. Karupiah G. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10282-10287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transepithelial resistance was measured by applying short (1 s) repetitive 10-μA current pulses across the epithelium. The transepithelial potential differences (Vte) were measured with reference to the luminal side of the epithelium, and equivalent short circuit current was calculated according to Ohm's law. Amiloride-sensitive equivalent short circuit current (Iami) was determined as the change in current following addition of amiloride (10 μm) to the apical bathing solution. Data were normalized by dividing the amiloride-sensitive short circuit current by that observed in control cells transfected with ENaC studied on the same day and reported as relative amiloride-sensitive equivalent short circuit current (Iami(relative)). Data for each experiment were obtained from at least three different batches of cells and are reported as mean ± S.E. with the number of experiment in parentheses. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test. Surface Expression of ENaC—FRT cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged α-, β-, and γ-mENaC. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 30 min in 5 ml of cell-impermeant Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin solution (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by quenching with Tris-buffered saline. The cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and mixed with 250 μl of NeutrAvidin™ gel slurry (Pierce) before incubating for 60 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 2 min. The precipitant containing biotinylated proteins was washed five times with lysis buffer. Finally, the biotinylated proteins were eluted by the addition of SDS sample buffer and then analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. Total RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The RT-PCR was carried out as described previously (25Kim I.S. Lee M.Y. Lee I.H. Shin S.L. Lee S.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 μgof total RNA was extracted from each sample and reverse-transcribed for 60 min at 37 °C in 1× PCR buffer containing (in mm) 5 MgCl2, 1 dNTP, 0.1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 2 ng/μl random hexamer, and 0.1 unit/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The RT product, containing (in mm) 5 MgCl2, 1 dNTPs, 0.1 unit/μl Taq DNA polymerase, and 10 pmol of Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 primers together with 10 pm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers as a control, was amplified for 30 cycles. Each PCR cycle consisted of 1 min each of denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C, and extension at 72 °C. The following primers were used: Akt1 (forward, 5′-GCT GAT GGA CTC AAA CGG CA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCC GAA GTC CGT TAT CTT GA-3′), Akt2 (forward, 5′-CCC TTC TAC AAC CAG GAC CA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGA ACT GGG GGA AGT GTG TG-3′), Akt3 (forward, 5′-CCT CAA GAT GTG GAC TTA CCT-3′; reverse, 5′-ATG ATG GGT TGT AGA TGC ATC-3′), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-TGG CCT TCC GTG TTC CTA CC-3′; reverse, 5′-TGT AGG CCA TGA GGT CCA CCA C-3′). A 10-μl aliquot of the PCR product was then separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Akt Up-regulates Activity of ENaC—We first established the basal characteristics of FRT cells transfected with ENaC in an Ussing chamber under open circuit conditions. Fig. 1A shows representative tracings of the transmembrane potential of an FRT monolayer measured under open circuit conditions. The confluent FRT monolayer exhibited a basal transepithelial potential difference (Vte) of 7.04 ± 0.92 mV (n = 25) with a transepithelial resistance (Rt) of 4.96 ± 0.46 kilo-ohms/cm2 (n = 25), corresponding to an equivalent short circuit current of 1.96 ± 0.35 μA·cm2 (n = 25). Addition of amiloride (10 μm) to the mucosal side reduced Vte to 2.49 ± 0.43 mV (n = 25) and increased Rt to 5.81 ± 0.53 kilo-ohms/cm2 (n = 25), corresponding to a calculated amiloride-sensitive equivalent short circuit current (Iami) of 1.44 ± 0.34 μA·cm2 (n = 25). Next, we investigated whether ENaC expressed in our FRT cell system can be up-regulated by Sgk1, a known activator of ENaC. Consistent with a previous report (19Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), overexpression of wtSgk1 caused a 2-fold increase in ENaC activity (Fig. 1B). To determine the role of Akt in ENaC regulation, we investigated whether overexpression of Akt would increase basal activity of ENaC by cotransfecting ENaC and wtAkt1 into FRT cells. Akt1 protein expression was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1C), and amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was measured as an assay of ENaC function (Fig. 1B). In cells overexpressing Akt1, the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was increased by 50% compared with that of the cells expressing ENaC alone. Interestingly, overexpression of a constitutively active Akt1 mutant, Akt1Myr, which was expected to have a greater stimulatory effect on ENaC than wtAkt1, not only failed to activate ENaC but also reduced basal ENaC activity. We then asked whether activity of Akt1 or of Sgk1 is essential for maintaining the basal activity of ENaC. If Akt1 or Sgk1 are indispensable, inhibition of the activity of these kinases should have an adverse effect on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. To answer this question, we cotransfected FRT cells with an siRNA against Akt1 or an siRNA against Sgk1. The effectiveness of the siRNAs in preventing expression of the corresponding kinases was then confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of Akt1 or Sgk1 expression significantly diminished activity of ENaC. Consistent with this finding, inhibition of Akt1 activity by overexpressing a dominant-negative Akt1 mutant (Akt1K179M) also significantly reduced activity of ENaC (Fig. 1B). Together, the data indicate that activity of Akt and Sgk is essential for maintaining the basal activity of ENaC. The Roles of Sgk1 and Akt1 in Insulin-induced ENaC Activity— Although it has been reported previously that Sgk1, but not Akt1, is involved in the mechanism by which insulin activates ENaC activity (17Arteaga M.F. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F90-F96Google Scholar), our finding that activity of both Akt1 and Sgk1 not only sustains the basal activity of ENaC, but also stimulates the channel, led us to reinvestigate the possible involvement of Akt1 in the insulin signaling pathway that modulates ENaC activity. We first determined whether inhibition of Akt1 and Sgk1 expression perturbed insulin-induced ENaC activity. We did this by cotransfecting FRT cells with either an siRNA against Akt1 or an siRNA against Sgk1. In a control experiment, insulin-treated cells exhibited the 2-fold increase in amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. Transfection of an siRNA against Akt1 or an siRNA against Sgk1 rendered the cells insensitive to insulin challenge and decreased basal ENaC activity to only 50% of that observed in the nontreated cells (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2A). Moreover, when FRT cells were simultaneously transfected with both Akt1 and Sgk1 siRNAs, activity of ENaC was almost completely abolished. The significance of Akt1 in mediating insulin-induced ENaC current was then confirmed in M1 mouse collecting duct cells natively expressing ENaC (Fig. 2B). In agreement with our observations in FRT cells, siRNA against Akt1 also inhibited insulin-induced ENaC activity in M1 cells. Together, these data indicate that endogenous Akt1 and Sgk1 activities are required for the stimulatory effect of insulin on the channel. It is widely accepted that, in most cell types, insulin treatment typically results in activation of PI3K and recruitment of PDK1 to the cell membrane that, in turn, activates several downstream mediators of the PI3K signaling pathway, including Akt and Sgk (26Tessier M. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 98: 1391-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that PI3K might have an important signaling role in mediating the stimulatory effect of insulin on ENaC (4Blazer-Yost B.L. Esterman M.A. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1645-C1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Record R.D. Froelich L.L. Vlahos C.J. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J.

In agreement with these findings, we found that overexpression of either a dominant-negative PI3K (PI3KΔ p85) or a dominant-negative PDK (myc-PDK1-KD) abolished the stimulatory effect of insulin on ENaC activity in FRT cells (n = 6; data not shown) confirming the involvement of PI3K and PDK in the signaling pathway by which insulin induces activity of ENaC in this cell type. To determine whether Sgk and Akt are part of the PI3K signaling cascade that regulates ENaC, we first investigated whether PI3K and PDK1 have a stimulatory effect on ENaC, and we then determined whether the effect of these kinases on ENaC would be diminished in the absence of Akt1 or Sgk1. In this experiment, we increased PI3K and PDK1 activity by transfecting FRT cells with either a constitutively active PI3K (PI3Kp110*) or a wild-type PDK1 (wtPDK1) and then silenced Sgk1 and Akt1 activity by cotransfecting the cells with either Sgk1 siRNA or Akt1 siRNA. Overexpression of PI3Kp110* or wtPDK1 significantly increased ENaC activity to the same magnitude of that observed in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 2C). In addition, the ability of PI3Kp110* and wtPDK1 to up-regulate ENaC was abolished by Sgk1 and Akt1 siRNAs. In agreement with the previous experiment (Fig. 2A), together Akt1 siRNA and Sgk1 siRNA exhibit an additional inhibitory effect on basal ENaC activity in cells overexpressing PI3Kp110* or wtPDK1. Taken together, these data confirm that endogenous activity of Akt1 and Sgk1 is essential for maintaining basal ENaC activity and that these kinases are important components of the insulin-induced PI3K/PDK signaling cascade that controls activity of ENaC in FRT cells. Sgk1 and Akt1 Inhibit Nedd4-2 Action—It has been suggested that Sgk1 increases Na+ absorption by modulating surface expression of ENaC (18Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C.

To investigate whether the stimulatory effect of Sgk1 and Akt1 observed in our study is attributable to an increase in expression of ENaC at the cell membrane, we cotransfected cDNA of FLAG-tagged α-, β-, and γ-mENaC into FRT cells with wtAkt1, wtSgk1, or Akt1 siRNA, Sgk1 siRNA, or both siRNAs simultaneously. ENaC expression was quantified by Western blot of the biotinylated membrane protein using FLAG antibody. This technique detects two sizes of FLAG-tagged ENaC (Fig. 3A), at 95 and 65 kDa, consistent with uncleaved ENaC subunits and cleaved α-ENaC, respectively (30Zhou R. Patel S.V. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20207-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, no biotinylated proteins were detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3D). We found that expression of Akt1 or Sgk1, alone, significantly increased ENaC surface expression (Fig. 3A with control biotinylation in Fig. 3C) without changing the total ENaC abundance (Fig. 3B). Expression of Akt1 siRNA or Sgk1 siRNA decreased ENaC surface expression, whereas coexpression of both Akt1 siRNA and Sgk1 siRNA displayed an additional inhibitory effect (Fig. 3A). In addition, Akt1 and Sgk1 had no effect on the relative levels of the cleaved and noncleaved ENaC subunits. For example, in control ENaC-expressed FRT cells, the density of the 95-kDa band as a percentage of the total FLAG-tagged proteins is 76.3 ± 12.4% (n = 3), which is not significantly different from that in cells cotransfected with Akt1 siRNA, 68.2 ± 7.40% (n = 3), or in cells cotransfected with Sgk1 siRNA, 72.4 ± 4.9% (n = 3). The data are consistent with both Akt1 and Sgk1 having an important role in sustaining ENaC expression in the plasma membrane. Expression of ENaC at the cell membrane is controlled by a mechanism that involves binding of the ubiquitin protein ligase Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 to the PY motifs at the C terminus of the β and γ subunits of ENaC, which subsequently lead to ubiquitin-dependent internalization of the channel (31Malik B. Price S.R. Mitch W.E. Yue Q. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1285-F1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that Sgk1 increases activity of ENaC by enhancing phosphorylation of Nedd4-2, thereby rendering Nedd4-2 unable to interact with, and regulate, ENaC (18Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 19Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To investigate further the role of Akt1 and Sgk1 on membrane expression of ENaC, we first asked whether Akt1 and Sgk1 have an inhibitory effect on Nedd4-2-induced down-regulation of ENaC activity. We did this by transfecting the FRT cells with a wild-type Nedd4-2 construct to increase Nedd4-2 activity. We then elevated Akt1 or Sgk1 activity by cotransfecting cells with either wtSgk1 or wtAkt1. Fig. 4A shows that overexpression of Nedd4-2 decreased the activity of ENaC by 50%. Conversely, overexpression of either Akt1 or Sgk1 overcame this inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC. We further confirmed that the effect Akt1 and Sgk1 on ENaC is Nedd4-2-dependent by silencing Nedd4-2 expression with an siRNA against Nedd4-2 and then overexpressed Akt1 or Sgk1 in these cells. Depletion of Nedd4-2 expression by siRNA caused a 2-fold increase in ENaC activity. Moreover, when Nedd4-2 expression was depleted, overexpression Akt1 and Sgk1 had no stimulatory effect on ENaC activity. Therefore, this finding is consistent with Akt1 and Sgk1 exerting their effect on ENaC by inhibiting Nedd4-2. To investigate whether the inhibitory effect of Akt1 and Sgk1 on Nedd4-2 seen in our study involves Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, we generated two Nedd4-2 mutants, one with Ser342 and the other with Ser428 mutated to alanine. These two mutated serines are reported to be Sgk1 phosphorylation sites on Nedd4-2 (18Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 19Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). When coexpressed with ENaC, the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2S342A on ENaC is 2-fold greater than the inhibitory effect of wtNedd4-2 (Fig. 4B). In addition, Nedd4-2S428A was almost twice as effective as Nedd4-2S342A in inhibiting ENaC. The inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2S342A on ENaC was only partially reversed by overexpression of Akt1 and Sgk1. Interestingly, neither Akt1 nor Sgk1 had any effect on the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2S428A on ENaC. Taken together, these data indicate that phosphorylation of Ser342 and Ser428 of Nedd4-2 is required for mediation of the inhibitory effects of Akt1 and Sgk1 on Nedd4-2 action and that phosphorylation of the Ser428 is an essential step in negative regulation of Nedd4-2 function. Expression of Endogenous Akt Isoforms in FRT Cells—Akt proteins are serine/threonine kinases that are broadly expressed in most organs and tissues. Although the role of Akt in insulin signaling has been extensively studied, the relative contribution of specific Akt isoforms to insulin signaling is not well understood. To investigate the role of Akt isoforms in insulin-induced ENaC activity, we first determined expression of Akt isoforms in FRT cells and then explored whether suppression of endogenous expression of each Akt isoform by isoform-specific siRNA would alter the response of ENaC to insulin treatment. The abundance of Akt mRNA expression was determined by performing RT-PCR with total RNA extracted from FRT cells using Akt1-, Akt2-, and Akt3-specific primers. Expression of mRNA for all three Akt isoforms was detected (Fig. 5A). We then demonstrated that expression of isoform-specific Akt siRNAs diminished endogenous expression of corresponding Akts (Fig. 5B) and caused a 50% reduction of basal ENaC current in FRT cells (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, cotransfection of all three siRNAs further reduced ENaC activity to 10% of that observed in control cells (Fig. 5C). In an accompanying experiment, FRT cells were transfected with an isoform-specific Akt siRNA or with all three Akt siRNAs simultaneously. Cells were then pretreated with insulin for 2 h before the experiment. Under these conditions, all three isoform-specific siRNA against Akt were equally effective in abolishing the effect of insulin on ENaC. Together, the data indicate that the activity of all three Akt isoforms are required for the maintenance of basal ENaC activity and that they are all involved in mediation of the insulin signaling pathway in FRT cells. Insulin plays an important role in the regulation of renal Na+ absorption (32DeFronzo R.A. Cooke C.R. Andres R. Faloona G.R. Davis P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1975; 55: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 33Nizet A. Lefebvre P. Crabbe J. Pfluegers Arch. 1971; 323: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by increasing ENaC activity (4Blazer-Yost B.L. Esterman M.A. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1645-C1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Blazer-Yost B.L. Liu X. Helman S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1373-C1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Record R.D. Johnson M. Lee S. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1079-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides evidence to support the role of Akt and Sgk1 in maintaining basal activity of ENaC and to support their role as intermediaries of the insulin signaling pathway at a point downstream to PI3K/PDK1. Both kinases modulate the basal activity of ENaC, most likely by supporting ENaC membrane expression at a normal level. Silencing endogenous expression of either Akt1 or Sgk1 by siRNAs reduced this supporting role of these kinases and, consequently, reduced expression of ENaC at the cell membrane (Fig. 3A), hence diminishing ENaC activity (Fig. 1B). In addition, the ability of isoform-specific Akt siRNAs to produce a comparable inhibitory effect on amiloride-sensitive current suggested that the effect of Akt on ENaC is not isoform-specific. Conversely, in the presence of an isoform-specific Akt siRNA, the other two, nontargeted, endogenous Akt isoforms were unable to sustain ENaC activity at the basal level. Together with an additive inhibitory effect of isoform-specific Akt siRNAs on ENaC, these data indicate a contribution of each Akt isoform to modulating ENaC function. The conflicting data between the effect of wild-type Akt1 and the constitutively active Akt1 mutants, Akt1Myr in this study and Akt1T308D/S473D in another study (17Arteaga M.F. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F90-F96Google Scholar), on ENaC activity is somewhat surprising and deserves careful consideration. Although both forms of the constitutively active Akt1 mutants have been used successfully in mimicking Akt1 effects (12Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), Akt1Myr not only failed to increase ENaC activity but had an adverse effect on the channel (Fig. 1B). In agreement with this finding, A6 cells stably transfected with AktT308D/S473D exhibited neither an increase in the base-line ENaC current nor a greater response to insulin, aldosterone, or AVP than seen in the control cells (17Arteaga M.F. Canessa C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F90-F96Google Scholar). An apparent increase in phosphorylation of GSK3, a known substrate of Akt, in Akt1T308D/S473D-transfected cells has ruled out the possibility that the transfected AktT308D/S473D was ineffective. Given that Akt has a profound effect on several signal transduction pathways, we speculate that hyperactivity of Akt in the constitutively active Akt1-expressing cells may activate multiple signaling pathways, one of which had a negative effect on ENaC. The cellular mechanism that underlies insulin-induced Akt and Sgk1 regulation of ENaC function involves phosphorylation of Nedd4-2. Previous studies indicated that Sgk1 inhibits ENaC by selectively phosphorylating Nedd4-2 at two specific sites comparable with Ser342 and Ser428 in hNedd4-2, thereby preventing the interaction between Nedd4-2 and ENaC (18Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Here we provide further evidence to indicate that Akt1 increases ENaC activity by inducing phosphorylation of these same serines on Nedd4-2. An increase in the inhibitory effect on ENaC of Nedd4-2S342A and Nedd4-2S428A (Fig. 4C) may be attributable to a higher affinity of unphosphorylated Nedd4-2 to the channel, hence stronger inhibition. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2S428A on ENaC was greater than that of Nedd4-2S342A, and its action could not be altered by Akt1 or Sgk1. Apparently, phosphorylation of Ser428 must be one of the most critical steps in regulating the effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC. The regulatory mechanism of insulin that involves Akt, Sgk1, and Nedd4-2 modulates activity of several membrane proteins other than ENaC. For instance, a similar mechanism mediates the effect of insulin on the Na+-coupled amino acid transporter, SN1 (36Boehmer C. Okur F. Setiawan I. Broer S. Lang F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the Na+-coupled glucose transporter, SGLT1 (13Dieter M. Palmada M. Rajamanickam J. Aydin A. Busjahn A. Boehmer C. Luft F.C. Lang F. Obes. Res. 2004; 12: 862-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is unclear why both kinases, Akt and Sgk, are required for mediating the same natriferic effect of insulin. Such a redundant system, however, could provide a safeguard against homeostatic aberration when one of the kinases becomes ineffective, which might also explain, at least in part, why Sgk1 knock-out mice exhibit normal Na+ renal handling and remain normotensive while maintained on a normal low salt diet (23Wulff P. Vallon V. Huang D.Y. Volkl H. Yu F. Richter K. Jansen M. Schlunz M. Klingel K. Loffing J. Kauselmann G. Bosl M.R. Lang F. Kuhl D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using both Akt and Sgk as its effectors, insulin may be able to amplify its effect and simultaneously modulate several membrane transporters with different kinase specificities to provide adequate homeostatic regulation. For instance, insulin increases translocation of two different glucose transporters, GLUT4 via Akt (12Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GLUT1 via Sgk (21Palmada M. Boehmer C. Akel A. Rajamanickam J. Jeyaraj S. Keller K. Lang F. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data suggest that by activating the classical PI3K and PDK1 pathway, insulin increases ENaC activity by an Akt- and Sgk-dependent mechanism. Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 by Akt or Sgk reduces the ability of Nedd4-2 to suppress surface expression of ENaC, consequently allowing Na+ absorption to increase. We thank Ben James for providing Nedd4-2 mutant constructs and Craig Campbell for help in preparation of the manuscript."

In ovarian cancer, levels of the pro-angiogenic cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), are known to be elevated in individuals experiencing chronic stress, but the mechanism(s) by which this cytokine is regulated and its role in tumor growth remain under investigation. Here we show that stress hormones such as norepinephrine lead to increased expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein levels in ovarian carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that norepinephrine stimulation activates Src tyrosine kinase and this activation is required for increased IL-6 expression.

These effects include decreased natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, weakened response of NK cells to recombinant interferon γ, and reduced T-cell response to mitogen stimulation (10Glaser R.

However, additional factors are known to play a major role in tumor growth; therefore, we asked whether stress mediators could directly alter tumor cell production of cytokines known to contribute to tumor progression.

Ovarian cancer cells have been shown to express β-adrenergic receptors, and stimulation of these cells with catecholamines results in enhanced expression of an important pro-angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (9Thaker P.H.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated as an important molecule in tumor progression and angiogenesis (15Nilsson M.B. Langley R.R. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10794-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of IL-6 are frequently detected in the serum of ovarian cancer patients and are associated with a poor prognosis and increased tumor burden (16Plante M. Rubin S.C. Wong G.Y.

The receptor for IL-6 (IL-6R) is expressed on endothelial cells, and stimulation of ovary and mesentery-derived endothelial cells with exogenous IL-6 results in enhanced cell migration in vitro (15Nilsson M.B. Langley R.R. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10794-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 is a potent angiogenic cytokine in vivo (15Nilsson M.B. Langley R.R. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10794-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Previously, IL-6 has been linked to chronic stress, in that individuals experiencing chronic stress have been shown to exhibit elevated circulating levels of IL-6 (22Kiecolt-Glaser J.K. Preacher K.J. MacCallum R.C. Atkinson C. Malarkey W.B. Glaser R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Moreover, behavioral factors have been associated with circulating and ascites IL-6 levels in ovarian cancer patients (23Costanzo E.S. Lutgendorf S.K. Sood A.K. Anderson B. Sorosky J. Lubaroff D.M. Cancer. 2005; 104: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Epinephrine has been shown to increase IL-6 gene expression in adipose tissue (24Keller P. Keller C. Robinson L.E. Pedersen B.K. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and norepinephrine infusion increases IL-6 expression in myocytes (25Briest W. Rassler B. Deten A. Leicht M. Morwinski R. Neichel D. Wallukat G. Ziegelhoffer T. Zimmer H.G. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, whether tumor cell expression of IL-6 is influenced by chronic stress is unknown. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of stress-related hormones on IL-6 production by ovarian cancer cells and found that catecholamines enhance IL-6 promoter activity and protein levels. Moreover, the effect of norepinephrine on IL-6 expression is mediated through β-adrenergic receptors and requires the subsequent activation of the Src proto-oncogene product. Cell Culture—SKOV3.ip1 is a variant derived from SKOV3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) that was established from the ascites fluid of female nude mice following intraperitoneal injection of the parental line (26Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). The human ovarian cancer cell line Hey-A8 was a kind gift from Dr. Gordon B. Mills (The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). EG cells have been described previously (14Lutgendorf S.K. Cole S. Costanzo E. Bradley S. Coffin J. Jabbari S. Rainwater K. Ritchie J.M. Yang M. Sood A.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4514-4521PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, vitamins, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). To evaluate the effect of stress hormones on IL-6 secretion, 1.0 × 105 SKOV3.ip1, Hey-A8, and EG cells were seeded into individual wells of a 24-well plate. Following a 24-h incubation, triplicate cultures (wells) were stimulated with 500 μl of media containing norepinephrine, epinephrine, or the synthetic β-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol (Sigma), at 0-, 0.1-, 1-, and 10-μm concentrations. After 1, 3, and 6 h, medium was collected, centrifuged, and tested for the presence of IL-6 by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The doses of catecholamines used for our studies were selected to reflect physiologic conditions of these hormones at the level of the tumor. While circulating plasma levels of norepinephrine range from 10 to 1000 pm in a normal individual and may reach as high as 100 nm in conditions of stress (27Schmidt C. Kraft K. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1996; 1: 528-532PubMed Google Scholar), catecholamine levels in the ovary are at least 100 times higher. Studies suggest that within the parenchyma of the ovary, and thus the tumor microenvironment, concentrations may reach as high as 10 μm (28Lara H.E. Dorfman M. Venegas M. Luza S.M. Luna S.L.

IL-6 mRNA Assay by Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated (Qiagen RNeasy) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen), both according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10% of the resulting RNA was assayed using a one-step real-time reverse transcription PCR protocol (Bio-Rad iQ SYBR enzyme mix in a Bio-Rad iCycler), with 30 min of reverse transcription at 60 °C, 15 min of reverse transcriptase inactivation at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of DNA amplification involving 60 s of annealing and extension at 60 °C followed by 15 s of melting at 95 °C (15 s). Assays used commercial primers for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC; reverse, GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC; probe, CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC) and IL-6 (forward, GTGTGAAGCAGCAAAGAAGC; reverse, CTGGAGGTACTCTAGGTATAC; probe, GGATTCAATGAGGAGACTTGC). SYBR Green fluorescence intensity data were analyzed using iCycler™ software, with gene induction measured as the change in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-normalized threshold cycle numbers (Ct):-fold change = 2Ct experimental - Ct control. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysate was prepared with modified radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer as previously reported (30Landen Jr., C.N. Lu C. Han L.Y. Coffman K.T. Bruckheimer E. Halder J. Mangala L.S. Merritt W.M. Lin Y.G. Gao C. Schmandt R. Kamat A.A. Li Y. Thaker P. Gershenson D.M. Parikh N.U. Gallick G.E. Kinch M.S. Sood A.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 1558-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). 50 μg of whole cell lysate protein was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE separation and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane via wet transfer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with IL-6-specific antibody (1:500; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody was detected utilizing anti-goat IgG (Roche Applied Science) and developed with a chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer). β-Actin antibody (1:3,000; Sigma) confirmed equal loading. IL-6 Promoter Activity—SKOV3, SKOV3.ip1, and HEY-A8 cells were transfected with 1 μg of a luciferase reporter construct driving production of firefly luciferase from a 651-bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site for the human IL6 gene. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM-reduced serum according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 h after transfection, cells were treated with pharmacologic antagonists for 30 min, followed by NE exposure for 90 min. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and assayed for firefly luciferase activity using standard substrate reagents (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Bacterial Systems BG-1 luminometer (GEM Biomedical, Sparks, NV). To determine potential regions of the IL-6 promoter responsible for mediating stress hormone-mediated transcriptional activation, we generated luciferase expression vectors driven by variants of the human IL-6 promoter bearing point mutations in the cAMP-response element (CRE) or C/EBP-β (NFIL6)-response element, as previously described (31Eickelberg O.

Receptor Inhibitors and cAMP Agonists—To inhibit activation of β-adrenergic receptors, SKOV3.ip1 and Hey-A8 cells were seeded into 24-well plates as described above. Cells were pretreated with the β2-adrenergic receptor inhibitor, DL-propranolol (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 1 μm. Following a 1-h incubation, medium was removed and cells were stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum DMEM containing 10 μm NE with or without 1 μm propranolol for 3 h. Similarly, cells were incubated with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (10 μm) (Sigma Aldrich) or 100 μm of an analogue of cAMP that specifically activates Epac (8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate [8CPT-2Me-cAMP]; (Biolog Life Science Institute, Bremen, Germany) for 3 h. Conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged, and tested for the presence of IL-6 by ELISA. Detection of Src Phosphorylation—SKOV3.ip1 cells (1 × 106) were seeded into 10-cm dishes in 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM. One day later the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of the Src inhibitor AP23846 (1 μm; Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) for 18 h. Cells were then stimulated for 5, 10, 15, or 45 min with serum-free DMEM containing 10 μm NE in the presence or absence of 1 μm AP23846. Control cells were incubated in serum-free medium. Cells were then washed in ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed by scraping in RIPA B buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), supplemented with 1% aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm, pH 7.4). Protein lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. 500 μg of sample protein in 650 μl of RIPA buffer was rotated overnight with 6 μl of antibody against total c-Src (mAb 327; Oncogene Sciences, Cambridge, MA). 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-agarose in RIPA buffer was added to each sample, and rotation was continued for an additional hour. Bound proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with RIPA buffer, and eluted by boiling in Laemmli's sample buffer. 50 μg of protein was separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted using phospho-SrcY418-specific antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total Src (1:1000; Oncogene Sciences). In Vivo Tumor Model—Female C.B-17/IcrHsd-PrkdcSCID mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). The mice were housed and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in facilities approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Animal Care in accordance with current regulations and standards of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Institutes of Health. The mice were used according to institutional guidelines when they were 8–12 weeks of age. SKOV3.ip1 tumor cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures by a brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Trypsinization was neutralized with fetal bovine serum-containing medium. The cells were then washed once in serum-free medium and suspended in serum-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. Only single-cell suspensions with greater than 95% viability, as determined by Trypan blue exclusion, were used for the injections. To produce tumors, 2 × 106 SKOV3.ip1 cells (in 0.1 ml) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each mouse (5 mice/group). Three days after tumor cell injection, mice were treated with daily injections of PBS (200 μl, intraperitoneal (IP)), isoproterenol (10 mg/kg daily IP), or isoproterenol with siRNA-DOPC (control or IL-6-specific, 3.5 μg IP twice per week) for 3 weeks. All treatments were administered in a total volume of 200 μl. Three weeks after tumor cell injection, all mice were sacrificed. Tumors were measured and harvested. Tumor volume was calculated as (length/2) × (width2). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Preparation—We purchased siRNAs targeted against IL-6 (target sequence 5′-CCCAGGAG-AAGAUUCCAAAGAUGUA-3′ from Qiagen and incorporated them into a neutral liposome (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; DOPC), as previously described (32Halder J.

Statistical Analysis—Changes in IL-6 levels were analyzed with an analysis of variance (both factors treated as repeated measures). A p value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Adrenergic Stimulation of Ovarian Cancer Cells Enhances IL-6 Expression—To examine the effect of stress hormones on IL-6 expression in ovarian tumor cell lines, SKOV3.ip1, Hey-A8, and EG cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine, or isoproterenol, and culture supernatants were assayed for IL-6 by ELISA (Fig. 1, A–C). In all three human ovarian carcinoma cell lines stimulated with isoproterenol or physiological stress levels of norepinephrine or epinephrine, a significant increase in IL-6 secretion resulted. Specifically, stimulation of SKOV3.ip1 cells with norepinephrine resulted in a peak >20-fold increase in IL-6 production at the 3-h time point (p = 0.004). The mean basal level of IL-6 secretion by SKOV3.ip1 cells at 3 h was 6.4 + 2.25 pg/ml, and after treatment with 1 and 10 μm norepinephrine IL-6 levels increased to 152.38 + 5.12 and 129.47 + 8.70, respectively. Similarly, norepinephrine led to a 4-fold increase in IL-6 secretion by EG cells (p = 0.02) and a 120-fold increase in IL-6 secretion by Hey-A8 cells (p < 0.001). Stimulation of human ovarian cancer cell lines with epinephrine also increased IL-6 production. Specifically, Hey-A8 cells treated with 10 μm epinephrine produced 656.06 + 151.02 pg/ml of IL-6, resulting in a 77-fold increase (p = 0.018) in comparison to controls. Epinephrine induced an ∼5-fold increase in IL-6 secretion in both SKOV3.ip1 (p = 0.001) and EG cells (p < 0.001). Moreover, the synthetic β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol also induced a significant increase in IL-6 secretion. Following treatment of Hey-A8 and SKOV3.ip1 cells, we observed an ∼200-fold increase in IL-6 expression (p < 0.004; Fig. 1). Western blot analysis of the SKOV3.ip1 cells treated with norepinephrine or epinephrine confirmed the increases in IL-6 protein observed with ELISA (Fig. 1D).FIGURE 1Catecholamines enhance IL-6 secretion by tumor cells. Human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3.ip1, Hey-A8, and EG) were stimulated with 0.1-, 1-, or 10-μm concentrations of norepinephrine (A), epinephrine (B), or isoproterenol (C). Medium was collected after 1 h (closed square), 3 h (open triangle), or 6 h (open oval) and tested for the presence of IL-6 by ELISA. Data are graphed as mean -fold increase in IL-6 secretion relative to basal level of IL-6 secretion with error bars representing S.D. *, p < 0.005. D, SKOV3.ip1 cells were stimulated with norepinephrine 10 μm or isoproterenol 10 μm for 3 h, and protein was obtained from cell lysate for Western blot analysis using an IL-6 antibody. The quantification of band intensity relative to β-actin intensity is shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Norepinephrine Stimulation Increases IL-6 RNA—To more clearly define the mechanisms by which catecholamines regulate IL-6 production by ovarian cancer cells, we examined transcriptional changes in IL-6. SKOV3.ip1 cells were stimulated with 10 μm norepinephrine, and IL-6 mRNA levels were quantified using real-time RT-PCR at multiple time points ranging from 3 to 24 h. The level of IL-6 mRNA was normalized against 18 S RNA levels. As shown in Fig. 2, norepinephrine increased IL-6 mRNA by 45-fold at 6 h, and IL-6 mRNA levels returned to base line within 12 h. Norepinephrine had a similar effect on other ovarian cancer cell lines (data not shown). Norepinephrine Increases IL-6 Promoter Activity—To determine whether increased transcriptional activity of the IL6 promoter was responsible for norepinephrine enhancement of IL6 gene expression, we examined the effects of norepinephrine on a luciferase reporter construct driven by 651-bp of human DNA sequence upstream of the IL6 transcription start site (34Eickelberg O. Roth M. Lorx R. Bruce V. Rudiger J. Johnson M. Block L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1005-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). When this construct was transfected into SKOV3.ip1 cells, norepinephrine enhanced luciferase production by ∼10-fold within 3 h (Fig. 3), suggesting that increased IL-6 mRNA was due to increased transcription rather than increased stability. Similar effects were observed in SKOV3 and Hey-A8 cell lines (data not shown). Pharmacologic stimulation of the cellular cAMP signaling pathway with Bt2cAMP also enhanced activity of the IL6 promoter, suggesting that the effects of norepinephrine might be mediated by the G-protein-linked receptors that activate the adenylyl-cyclase/cAMP system. The ∼10-fold induction by catecholamine was similar in magnitude to that induced by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which functioned as a positive control in these studies. To examine the effects of norepinephrine at the post-translational level, IL-6 protein levels in SKOV3.ip1 cells were evaluated in the presence of cycloheximide, 1 μg/ml. Norepinephrine had no effect on the degradation of the IL-6 protein (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that norepinephrine increases IL-6 levels by transcriptional activation rather than by affecting protein stability. Induction of IL-6 Expression by Stress Hormones Requires Activation of β-Adrenergic Receptors—Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines express β-1 and β-2 adrenergic receptors that can activate the cAMP signaling pathway through G-protein-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (14Lutgendorf S.K. Cole S. Costanzo E. Bradley S. Coffin J. Jabbari S. Rainwater K. Ritchie J.M. Yang M. Sood A.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4514-4521PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-6 expression could be regulated through β-adrenergic receptors, SKOV3.ip1 and Hey-A8 cells were treated with 1 μm propranolol, a nonspecific β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, for 1 h prior to stimulation with 10 μm norepinephrine or isoproterenol. As shown in Fig. 4A, induction of IL-6 by norepinephrine and isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol. These effects were specific to β-adrenergic receptors, as the adrenergic antagonist prazosin (5 μm) had no effect on the ability of stress hormones to induce IL-6 production (data not shown). Because β-adrenergic receptors are known to signal via cAMP, we stimulated SKOV3.ip1 and Hey-A8 cells with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and found an increase in IL-6 production similar to that induced by norepinephrine (Fig. 4B). Stimulation of SKOV3.ip1 cells with forskolin resulted in a 4-fold increase in IL-6 expression (p < 0.001), and forskolin induced an ∼8-fold increase in Hey-A8 IL-6 production (p = 0.034). Because stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptors has been shown previously to also lead to activation of Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) (35Novara M. Baldelli P. Cavallari D. Carabelli V. Giancippoli A. Carbone E. J. Physiol. 2004; 558: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Keiper M. Stope M.B. Szatkowski D. Bohm A. Tysack K. Vom Dorp F. Saur O.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46497-46508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether activation of Epac could contribute to IL-6 expression in human ovarian carcinoma cells. The SKOV3.ip1 and Hey-A8 cells were treated with 100 μm 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP, a cAMP analog that specifically targets Epac. In both cell lines, 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP did not increase secretion of IL-6 (Fig. 4B). Induction of IL-6 Expression by Norepinephrine Is Src-dependent—Recent reports indicate a role for the protein tyrosine kinase Src in β-adrenergic receptor signal transduction (37Jee S.H. Chu C.Y. Chiu H.C. Huang Y.L. Tsai W.L. Liao Y.H. Kuo M.L. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 1169-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Based on suggested IL-6 regulation by Src (38Fredriksson J.M. Lindquist J.M. Bronnikov G.E. Nedergaard J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2006; 291: C476-C482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we asked whether the catecholamine-mediated IL-6 production was Src-dependent. Following serum starvation for 18 h, the SKOV3.ip1 cells were incubated with 10 μm norepinephrine in serum-free medium for 1–45 min. Western blot analysis revealed that by 10 min after NE stimulation, Src phosphorylation increased, and the maximum increase in Src phosphorylation at Tyr-418, indicative of increased Src activity, occurred after 45 min (Fig. 5A). Additionally, the Src-selective inhibitor AP23846 (40Summy J.M. Trevino J.G. Lesslie D.P. Baker C.H. Shakespeare W.C. Wang Y. Sundaramoorthi R. Metcalf III, C.A. Keats J.A. Sawyer T.K. Gallick G.E. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) completely inhibited norepinephrine-induced Src phosphorylation. To determine whether Src phosphorylation is required for the stimulation of IL-6 production by norepinephrine, SKOV3.ip1 cells were pretreated in control medium or medium containing AP23846 for 18 h and then stimulated for 3 h with medium containing 10 μm norepinephrine in the presence or absence of AP23846. ELISA analysis of IL-6 in conditioned medium was then performed. The results demonstrated that inhibition of Src activity by AP23846 blocked the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine on IL-6 secretion (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, AP23846 inhibited forskolin-induced IL-6 expression in SKOV3.ip1 cells. Similar results were obtained using another Src-selective inhibitor, PP2 (Fig. 5C), and Src-targeted siRNA (Fig. 5D). Role of Src in NE-mediated Activation of the IL6 Promoter—To determine whether norepinephrine-mediated activation of the IL6 promoter required Src activity, SKOV3 or Hey-A8 cells were treated with AP23846 or vehicle for 30 min prior to luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 6, pharmacologic inhibition of Src completely abrogated norepinephrine-mediated induction of IL6 promoter activity. Analysis of IL6 promoter constructs bearing point mutations in transcription factor binding sites showed that NE activation did not require a functional CRE (Fig. 6B). However, mutation of the C/EBP-β (NFIL6) motif completely abrogated NE-mediated induction of the IL6 promoter. This effect was specific to NE-mediated signaling, as the C/EBP-β mutation did not impair IL6 promoter response to the positive control inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These data suggest that β-adrenergic activation of the IL6 promoter via the Src signaling pathway is not mediated by classical CREB response to cAMP/protein kinase A signaling but instead involves Src-dependent activation of C/EBP-β. Role of IL-6 in Isoproterenol-induced in Vivo Tumor Growth—To determine the role of IL-6 in mediating catecholamine-induced tumor growth, we used a neutral liposomal approach (DOPC) for in vivo siRNA delivery that we have previously optimized for in vivo applications (32Halder J.

Next, female SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with SKOV3.ip1 cells and treated according to the following groups (n = 5/group): (a) control siRNA-DOPC twice weekly + PBS intraperitoneal daily; (b) IL-6 siRNA-DOPC twice weekly + PBS intraperitoneal daily; (c) control siRNA-DOPC twice weekly + isoproterenol intraperitoneal daily; (d) IL-6 siRNA-DOPC twice weekly + isoproterenol intraperitoneal daily. Isoproterenol treatment with control siRNA increased tumor volume by >500% (p < 0.01; Fig. 7). IL-6 siRNA-DOPC reduced tumor growth by 47% in the PBS control group (p = 0.14) and blocked the isoproterenol-induced tumor growth (Fig. 7). This study provides direct evidence that chronic stress hormones affect expression of IL-6, a pro-angiogenic cytokine in ovarian carcinoma cells, and do so through a β-adrenergic receptor/Src tyrosine kinase signaling axis. For these studies, we stimulated cultured ovarian cancer cells with physiologic catecholamine concentrations and found that for all three of the cell lines tested (SKOV3.ip1, Hey-A8, and EG) norepinephrine and epinephrine significantly increased IL-6 production. Moreover, we have demonstrated that incubation of SKOV3.ip1 cells with norepinephrine results in substantial increases in IL-6 RNA and promoter activity, indicating that stress mediators regulate expression of the IL6 gene at the transcriptional level. The biological effects of catecholamines are mediated through binding to β-adrenergic receptors on the surface of target cells. This results in activation of adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the formation of the second messenger cAMP from ATP. Cyclic AMP binds to and activates protein kinase A, leading to the phosphorylation of downstream molecules (41Yan L. Herrmann V. Hofer J.K. Insel P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1665-C1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies the effect of catecholamines on IL-6 expression was blocked by the addition of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol but not by the α-adrenergic receptor inhibitor prazosin. Additionally, by utilizing forskolin as a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, Bt2cAMP as a generalized activator of cAMP effector pathways, and 8CPT-2Me-cAMP as a specific activator of the EPAC pathway, we determined that cAMP induced IL-6 expression through an EPAC-independent pathway. Recent reports have demonstrated that activation of β-adrenergic receptors results in enhanced Src activity (42Klinger M. Kudlacek O. Seidel M.G. Freissmuth M. Sexl V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32490-32497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the role of Src in norepinephrine-induced IL-6 expression and observed that norepinephrine stimulation led to an increase in Src phosphorylation. Moreover, the Src inhibitors AP23846 and PP2 blocked the induction of IL-6 expression and activation of the human IL6 promoter by norepinephrine. These data indicate that stress-related hormones activate β-adrenergic receptors on ovarian cancer cells by increasing the kinase activity of Src, which results in enhanced transcription of the IL6 promoter and subsequent production of IL-6 protein. Studies evaluating human ovarian cancer clinical specimens by immunohistochemistry have demonstrated that activated Src is overexpressed in the majority of ovarian carcinomas (44Wiener J.R. Windham T.C. Estrella V.C. Parikh N.U. Thall P.F. Deavers M.T. Bast R.C. Mills G.B. Gallick G.E. Gynecol. Oncol. 2003; 88: 73-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and contributes to angiogenesis in these tumors; however, the mechanism(s) by which Src is activated are unclear. The current study provides a mechanism by which Src may be activated in these tumors, i.e. by response to stress hormones through β-adrenergic receptor. Because activation of Src has been shown to enhance expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (38Fredriksson J.M. Lindquist J.M. Bronnikov G.E. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13802-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and IL-8 (45Trevino J.G. Summy J.M. Gray M.J. Nilsson M.B. Lesslie D.P. Baker C.H. Gallick G.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7214-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), catecholamines may increase tumor cell production of these proangiogenic molecules through a similar pathway. Studies showing that norepinephrine levels increase in preovulatory follicles indicate that catecholamines play a role in the physiology of the normal ovary (28Lara H.E. Dorfman M. Venegas M. Luza S.M. Luna S.L. Mayerhofer A. Guimaraes M.A. Rosa-E-Silva A.A. Ramirez V.D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 59: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Tumor cells may usurp these mechanisms to promote disease progression. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have been demonstrated to regulate IL-6 expression in adipose cells and myocytes (24Keller P. Keller C. Robinson L.E. Pedersen B.K. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Briest W. Rassler B. Deten A. Leicht M. Morwinski R. Neichel D. Wallukat G. Ziegelhoffer T. Zimmer H.G. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with these reports and reveal a novel pathway by which stress hormones enhance tumor production of IL-6. In other studies, catecholamines have been shown to augment ovarian cancer cell expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (14Lutgendorf S.K. Cole S. Costanzo E. Bradley S. Coffin J. Jabbari S. Rainwater K. Ritchie J.M. Yang M. Sood A.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4514-4521PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that stress-induced activation of β-adrenergic signal transduction pathways on ovarian tumor cells can enhance expression of multiple proangiogenic molecules critical to ovarian cancer progression (Fig. 8)."

Although it is well established that CD151 physically associates with integrins, the mechanism by which CD151 regulates integrin-dependent cell migration is basically unknown. Given the fact that CD151 is localized in both the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, we found that CD151 and its associated α3β1, α5β1, and α6β1 integrins undergo endocytosis and accumulate in the same intracellular vesicular compartments. CD151 contains a YRSL sequence, a YXXφ type of endocytosis/sorting motif, in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Mutation of this motif markedly attenuated CD151 internalization. The loss of CD151 trafficking completely abrogated CD151-promoted cell migration on extracellular matrices such as laminin and diminished the internalization of its associated integrins, indicating a critical role for integrin trafficking in regulating cell motility. In conclusion, the YXXφ motif-mediated internalization of CD151 promotes integrin-dependent cell migration by modulating the endocytosis and/or vesicular trafficking of its associated integrins.

Tetraspanin CD151 is functionally linked to cancer metastasis, hemidesmosome formation, neurite outgrowth, and vascular morphogenesis (1Sincock P.M. Kim S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R.

The regulatory role of CD151 in cell migration is supported by the knock-out studies in mice (6Wright M.D. Kim S.M. Fitter S. Moseley G.W. Lau L.M. Sheng K.C. Apostolopoulos V. Stanley E.G.

Also, the association of CD151 with integrins, especially the laminin (LN) 2The abbreviations used are: LN, laminin; FN, fibronectin; ECM, extracellular matrix; HMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; TEM, tetraspanin-enriched microdomain; PKC, protein kinase C; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.2The abbreviations used are: LN, laminin; FN, fibronectin; ECM, extracellular matrix; HMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; TEM, tetraspanin-enriched microdomain; PKC, protein kinase C; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.-binding integrins, stands out as a prominent feature (3Sterk L.M.T.

J. 1999; 340: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). CD151 is expressed in a variety of tissues and is especially abundant in epithelia, endothelia, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and megakaryocytes (12Sincock P.M. Kim G. Ashman L.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Notably, the tissue distribution of CD151 is similar to the distribution of LN-binding integrins such as α3β1, α6β1, α6β4, and α7β1 (13Sterk L.M. Kim C.A. van den Berg J.G. Claessen N. Weening J.J. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with its ability to associate with these integrins and with a likely concomitant function during development (14Kreidberg J.A.

Flinter F. Brady R.L. Daniels G. Anstee D.J. Blood. 2004; 104: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, CD151 is present on plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles (1Sincock P.M. Kim S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the cell surface, CD151 is localized in the basolateral membrane in endothelial and epithelial cells (1Sincock P.M. Kim S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yanez-Mo M. Kim A. Cabanas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de Landazuri M.O.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas intracellularly, CD151 resides in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles (1Sincock P.M. Kim S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CD151 directly associates with LN-binding integrins, it is not surprising that CD151 regulates cell-matrix adhesion. CD151 is needed for cell adhesion strengthening mediated by LN-binding integrin α6β1 (18Lammerding J. Kim A.R. Huang H. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7616-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). CD151 also potentiates the ligand binding activity of integrin α3β1 by stabilizing the activated conformation of this integrin (19Nishiuchi R. Kim N. Nada S. Sumida Y. Wada Y. Okada M. Takagi J. Hasegawa H. Sekiguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD151 is a component of hemidesmosomes that anchor epithelial cells to basal lamina (3Sterk L.M.T. Kim C.A.W. Oomen L.C.J.M. Calafat J. Janssen H. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Finally, CD151 was reported to up-regulate integrin α5β1-dependent static adhesion to fibronectin (FN) (20Hasegawa H. Kim T. Kishimoto K. Yanagisawa K. Fujita S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3087-3095PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD151 also plays a role in cell-cell adhesion (10Fitter S. Kim P.M. Jolliffe C.N. Ashman L.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For example, CD151 promotes the formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts in a protein kinase C (PKC) and Cdc42-dependent manner (17Shigeta M. Kim N. Ozawa M. Gu J. Hasegawa H. Sekiguchi K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CD151 recruits integrin α3β1 to cell-cell contacts to form a multimolecular complex that includes PKC, phosphotyrosine phosphatase μ, E-cadherin, and β-catenin (21Chattopadhyay N. Kim Z. Ashman L.K. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Kreidberg J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CD151 contains two extracellular loops and two short cytoplasmic tails. The large extracellular loop is required for the association with α3 and α6 integrins (22Yauch R.L. Kim A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9230-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 23Berditchevski F. Kim E. Griffiths M.R. Fitter S. Ashman L. Jenner S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41165-41174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The CD151 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain plays a key role in signaling. The deletion or exchange of the CD151 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail markedly impaired integrin α6β1-dependent cell spreading and cellular morphogenesis (5Zhang X.A. Kim A.R. Yang X. Bontrager A.L. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Lammerding J. Kim A.R. Huang H. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7616-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD151 negatively regulates Ras activity (24Sawada S. Kim M. Odintsova E. Hotchin N.A. Berditchevski F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26323-26326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal tail determines integrin α6β1-mediated adhesion strengthening to LN-1 (18Lammerding J. Kim A.R. Huang H. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7616-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Despite several lines of evidence indicating an essential role of the C-terminal tail of CD151, it is still unclear how only eight amino acids at the C-terminal tail regulate these CD151-mediated activities. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD151 contains a YRSL sequence that meets the criteria of the YXXφ-sorting motif, in which Y is tyrosine and X indicates any amino acid, and φ represents the amino acid residue with a bulky hydrophobic side chain (25Ohno H. Kim J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 26Bonifacino J.S. Kim L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). The YXXφ motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins are recognized by adaptor protein-2 complex, a core component of clathrin endocytic machinery (26Bonifacino J.S. Kim L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar, 27Conner S.D. Kim S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that the YRSL motif drives CD151 endocytosis, is responsible for the functional importance of CD151 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and ultimately regulates CD151 activities such as integrin-dependent cell movement. Cells and Transfectants—NIH3T3 and Du145 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cultured in ECBM-2 media (Cambrex). CD151 wild type and the YRSL → ARSA mutant (termed the Yala mutant) were constructed into a eukaryotic expression vector pZeoSV2 (Invitrogen) as described in our earlier study (5Zhang X.A. Kim A.R. Yang X. Bontrager A.L. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, the CD151 Yala mutant was generated by simultaneously replacing the Tyr and Leu residues in the YRSL sequence of wild type CD151 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with alanine residues through PCR. The full-length cDNAs encoding human wild type and Yala mutant CD151 were constructed into pZeoSV2 vector, respectively, through the XbaI and HindIII sites. The CD151 coding information was confirmed by DNA sequencing. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with Zeocin (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Hundreds of Zeocin-resistant clones were pooled, and CD151-positive clones were collected by flow cytometric cell sorting. The pooled and sorted CD151-positive clones were the CD151 wild type and Yala stable transfectants. Antibodies and Reagents—The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used in this study were human CD151 mAbs 5C11 (9Yauch R.L. Kim F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and 8C3 (19; kindly provided by Drs. K. Sekiguchi and M. Yamada of Osaka University) and mouse CD9 mAb KMC8 (BD Biosciences), mouse CD81 mAb 2F7 (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL), mouse CD44 mAb KM114 (BD Biosciences), mouse integrin α2 mAb HMα2 (BD Biosciences), and a negative control mAb mouse IgG2b (clone MOPC 141) (Sigma). The polyclonal antibodies (pAb) include integrin α3 cytoplasmic domain pAb D23 (28Zhang X.A. Kim A.L. Stipp C.S. Kraeft S.-K. Bazzoni G. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and integrin α6 cytoplasmic domain pAb (5Zhang X.A. Kim A.R. Yang X. Bontrager A.L. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated human CD151 mAb 5C11 was prepared using the Alexa protein labeling kit (Molecular Probe). FITC-conjugated human integrin α5 mAb CBL497F and integrin α6 mAb GoH3 were purchased from BD Biosciences, and all second antibodies were from Invitrogen. Alexa 488-conjugated transferrin was from Molecular Probes. Extracellular matrix proteins used in the study include human plasma fibronectin and mouse laminin 1 (Invitrogen). Flow Cytometry—NIH3T3 transfectant cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA/PBS, washed once with PBS, treated with DMEM supplemented with 5% goat serum at 4 °C for 10-15 min, and then incubated with primary mAb at 4 °C for 1 h. After washes, cells were further labeled with FITC-conjugated second antibody at 4 °C for 1 h and then analyzed on FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Brij 98 at room temperature for 2-5 min, blocked with 20% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with primary mAbs at room temperature for 30 min, followed by staining with a secondary antibody at room temperature for 30 min. After each antibody incubation, the cells were washed with PBS five times; each wash lasted 15 min. For double staining, the cells were blocked with murine IgG and then further stained with Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated human CD151 mAb 5C11. For immunofluorescent analysis, the cells were examined with an Axiophot fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss), and images were captured using an Optronics digital camera. For confocal microscopic analysis, the coverslips were examined using LSM 510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 63×/1.4 Plan-APOCHROMAT oil immersion objectives. Green fluorescent protein, FITC, or Alexa 488 and rhodamine or Texas Red were excited by the 488- and 543-nm lines of Kr-Ar lasers, respectively, and individual channels were scanned in a series to prevent cross-channel bleed through. Each image represents a stack of ∼1.0 μm “Z” optical sections of the cells. Immunoprecipitation—Immuoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (29He B. Kim L. Cook G.A. Grgurevich S. Jennings L.K. Zhang X.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with 1% Brij 97 and/or 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. In some experiments, the cell surface was labeled with 0.5 mg/ml EZlink sulfo-NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) before cell lysis. After removing the insoluble material by 14,000 × g centrifugation, the precleared lysates were incubated with primary mAb pre-absorbed protein A- and G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) from 3 h to overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with the lysis buffer three times, dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot experiments, the membranes were sequentially blotted with primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second Ab (Sigma), followed by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For biotinylation experiments, the membranes were blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated extravidin (Sigma), followed by chemiluminescence. Internalization Assay—The internalization of CD151 and integrins was examined with antibody uptake assay. Cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated CD151 mAb and/or integrin mAb at 4 °C for 1 h. The unbound antibodies were removed by three washes with serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for internalization for typically 30 or 60 min or for various periods of times as specified in the particular experiments. The antibodies that bound to the cell surface and were not internalized were removed by acid washes with the 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 m NaCl buffer (pH 3.0). The acid wash typically removed ∼80-90% of the cell surface-bound antibodies. The cells were then fixed and examined with immunofluorescent or confocal microscopy. The kinetics of integrin and CD151 internalization were determined following the established protocol (29He B. Kim L. Cook G.A. Grgurevich S. Jennings L.K. Zhang X.A. J. Biol.

Cells were incubated with reducible sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at the saturated concentration (0.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C to label the cell surface proteins. The labeling lasted for 1 h to allow maximal biotinylation of the cell surface proteins. The free biotin was removed by three washes with ice-cold PBS. The labeled cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times for the internalization and then treated with a reducing solution for 20 min on ice to remove cell surface-bound biotin. For the internalization of CD151 and its associated integrin, the reducing solution contained 42 mm GSH, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm NaOH, and 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing with PBS, the cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Brij 97 lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h, and CD151 was immunoprecipitated as aforementioned. After SDS-PAGE and electric transferring, the biotinylated integrin or CD151 was detected by peroxidase-conjugated extravidin and visualized by chemiluminescence. The integrin and CD151 bands were quantitated by densitometric analysis as described previously (29He B. Kim L. Cook G.A. Grgurevich S. Jennings L.K. Zhang X.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Integrin internalization at an indicated time point was calculated with the following formula: (the densitometry of internalized integrin at that time point - the densitometry of internalized integrin at time 0)/the total surface integrin × 100%. Cell Migration Assay—Transwell cell migration assay was performed as described previously (34Zhang X.A. Kim B. Zhou B. Liu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27319-27328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were detached from culture plates with EDTA, washed once with PBS, and replated onto the inserts of 8-μm pore size Transwell chambers (Costar). The undersides of the inserts were pre-coated with either FN (10 μg/ml) or LN 1 (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 45 min. The cell number was 8 × 103 per insert filter. The media include 500 μl of DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum in the lower well and 300 μl DMEM containing 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in the insert. After incubating at 37 °C for 3 h, cells that had not migrated through inserts were removed, and cells that had migrated to the under-sides of the inserts were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (Baxter Merz & Dade). The cells that had migrated through the insert were counted. Data from independent experiments were pooled and analyzed using two-tailed Student's t test. For wound healing assay, NIH transfectant cells were cultured in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY). After the monolayers were formed, wounds were generated by scraping the monolayers with sterile pipette tips. The detached cells were rinsed away with PBS, and the wounded monolayers were replenished with the complete medium. After overnight culture at 37 °C, the monolayers were fixed and photographed under inverted light microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). The YRSL Sequence in CD151 Cytoplasmic Domain Determines Its Trafficking—To determine whether the YRSL sequence of CD151 (Fig. 1A) is involved in regulating its intracellular trafficking and function, we mutated this motif in human CD151 molecule. The Tyr and Leu residues in CD151 YRSL motif were replaced with alanine residues simultaneously, and the resulting YRSL → ARSA mutant was designated as the Yala mutant. We transfected human CD151 WT and Yala mutant cDNA into NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells and established stable transfectants by pooling and sorting hundreds of CD151-expressing clones by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, CD151 WT and the Yala mutant were stably expressed at comparable levels on the surface of NIH3T3 cells when cells reached confluence in culture. When cells were less confluent in culture, the cell surface level of CD151 on the Yala mutant was higher than that on the wild type. For example, when cells were at the 60-70% confluent stage, the mean fluorescent intensity of CD151 was 134 in wild type and 189 in the Yala mutant. The expression levels of other cell surface proteins such as CD44 (Fig. 1B, top panel) were equivalent on all transfectants and not altered upon CD151 expression. The total cellular levels of CD151 proteins were equivalent between CD151 wild type and the Yala transfectants, with a slightly higher level in the wild type (densitometry of CD151 band in the wild type: that in the Yala mutant was 1:0.88) (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). The total CD151 proteins remained stable at different stages during cell culture. The effect of the Yala mutation on CD151 subcellular localization was analyzed at the steady state (Fig. 1C). Typically, CD151 proteins are localized on the cell surface and in intracellular endosomes and lysosomes (1Sincock P.M. Kim S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3L. Liu and X. A. Zhang, unpublished data. CD151 Yala mutant was distributed mainly at the cell surface and largely lost the vesicular staining observed with CD151 WT, suggesting that the YRSL motif is important for regulating CD151 localization. In NIH3T3-CD151 wild type transfectant cells, we confirmed that some of CD151-positive intracellular vesicles were EEA1- or Rab5-positive early endosomes (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). We further analyzed the internalization of CD151 in the WT and Yala transfectants using an antibody uptake assay. After a 30-min endocytosis, a substantial fraction of WT CD151 was internalized and accumulated in intracellular vesicles, whereas CD151 Yala mutant was barely internalized in this time frame (Fig. 1D, top panel). The quantitative analyses showed the significant diminution of CD151 endocytosis in the Yala mutant (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). A small fraction of the CD151 Yala mutant proteins were internalized after pro-longed incubation at 37 °C, such as 2 h, and the internalized CD151 Yala mutant proteins remained at the cell peripheral area (data not shown), suggesting a deficiency in the trafficking following endocytosis. Thus, the YRSL motif is required for CD151 endocytic processes. CD151 Trafficking Regulates Integrin-dependent Cell Migration—Regulation of cell motility is a prominent feature of CD151. We tested whether CD151 internalization is important for cell migration. We measured the directional motility of NIH3T3-CD151 transfectants on the substratum coated with FN or LN1, a ligand of α5 or α6 integrins, respectively. Because the α6 integrin expressed in NIH3T3 cells is the α6β1 integrin (5Zhang X.A. Kim A.R. Yang X. Bontrager A.L. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), cell migration on LN1 is mediated primarily by integrin α6β1. As shown in Fig. 2A, the expression of WT CD151 in NIH3T3 significantly enhanced cell migration on both FN and LN1, consistent with previous results (1Sincock P.M. Kim S. Parton R.G. Berndt M.C. Gamble J.R. Ashman L.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Testa J.E. Kim P.C. Liu J.-M. Quiqley J.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3812-3820PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yauch R.L.

Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de Landazuri M.O. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The ability of CD151 Yala mutant cells to migrate toward FN and LN1 was markedly reduced compared with that of CD151 WT and Mock transfectant cells. The diminished cell migration of the Yala mutant indicates that YRSL internalization signal is not only required for CD151 pro-migratory activity but also affects constitutive motility of NIH3T3 cells. We also used wound healing assay to assess the effect of the Yala mutation on cell migration. Consistent with the results obtained from the transwell cell migration assay, CD151 WT promoted wound healing, whereas CD151 Yala mutant exhibited delayed wound healing compared with the CD151 WT transfectant (Fig. 2B). Thus, CD151 endocytosis plays an essential role in regulating integrin-dependent cell migration. Deficient Endocytosis of CD151 Does Not Alter the Integrin-CD151 Association—To determine why the loss of CD151 internalization affects integrin-mediated cell migration, we first assessed if CD151 Yala mutant altered the CD151-integrin complex. We compared the CD151-integrin associations between NIH3T3-CD151 WT and Yala transfectants. CD151 immunoprecipitation profiles of surface-biotinylated NIH3T3 cells revealed that integrins coprecipitated equally well with CD151 WT and the Yala mutant under either a stringent lysis condition, i.e. 1% Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 3A), or a mild lysis condition, i.e. 1% Brij 99 (data not show). Immunoblotting analysis indicated that the coprecipitated integrin under the stringent lysis condition was endogenous murine α3, and the ones under the mild conditions were α5 and α6 (Fig. 3B). The transmembrane protein CD44 (Fig. 3A) and housekeeping protein tubulin (Fig. 3B) were included to indicate the equal loadings of the cell lysate. The blotting of CD151 immunoprecipitates with CD151 mAb ensured that the biotinylated ∼30-kDa band in CD151 immunoprecipitate is indeed CD151 (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Together, these results indicate that the Yala mutation did not alter the association of CD151 with cell surface integrins and that CD151 endocytosis is not required for CD151-integrin complex formation. In addition, the association of CD151 with endogenous murine tetraspanins such as CD9 was not altered by the Yala mutation (Fig. 3C). Thus, CD151 endocytosis does not appear to be critical for the partitioning of CD151 into tetraspanin webs (34Zhang X.A. Kim B. Zhou B. Liu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27319-27328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM) (36Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2001925176,"Biotin-dependent multifunctional enzymes carry out metabolically important carboxyl group transfer reactions and are potential targets for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. These enzymes use a tethered biotin cofactor to carry an activated carboxyl group between distantly spaced active sites. The mechanism of this transfer has remained poorly understood. Here we report the complete structure of pyruvate carboxylase at 2.0 angstroms resolution, which shows its domain arrangement. The structure, when combined with mutagenic analysis, shows that intermediate transfer occurs between active sites on separate polypeptide chains. In addition, domain rearrangements associated with activator binding decrease the distance between active-site pairs, providing a mechanism for allosteric activation. This description provides insight into the function of biotin-dependent enzymes and presents a new paradigm for multifunctional enzyme catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2007524520,"Because bacterial recombination involves the occasional transfer of small DNA fragments between strains, different sets of niche-specific genes may be maintained in populations that freely recombine at other loci. Therefore, genetic isolation may be established at different times for different chromosomal regions during speciation as recombination at niche-specific genes is curtailed. To test this model, we separated sequence divergence into rate and time components, revealing that different regions of the Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica chromosomes diverged over a ∼70-million-year period. Genetic isolation first occurred at regions carrying species-specific genes, indicating that physiological distinctiveness between the nascent Escherichia and Salmonella lineages was maintained for tens of millions of years before the complete genetic isolation of their chromosomes."

Oxygen vacancies that result from irradiating a TiO 2 (011)-2×1 surface with electrons with an energy of 300 electron volts were analyzed by scanning tunneling microscopy. The cross section for desorbing oxygen from the pristine surface was found to be 9 (±6) × 10 –17 square centimeters, which means that the initial electronic excitation was converted into atomic motion with a probability near unity. Once an O vacancy had formed, the desorption cross sections for its nearest and next-nearest oxygen neighbors were reduced by factors of 100 and 10, respectively. This site-specific desorption probability resulted in one-dimensional arrays of oxygen vacancies."

Mechanistically, these reactions could occur via a single, multifunctional cytochrome P450 or some combination of cytochrome P450s and a dehydrogenase. We report here the characterization of a single cytochrome P450 enzyme, Hyoscyamus muticus premnaspirodiene oxygenase (HPO), that catalyzes these successive reactions at carbon 2 (C-2) of the spirane substrate. HPO also catalyzes the equivalent regio-specific (C-2) hydroxylation of several eremophilane-type (decalin ring system) sesquiterpenes, such as with 5-epi-aristolochene. Moreover, HPO displays interesting comparisons to other sesquiterpene hydroxylases. 5-Epi-aristolochene di-hydroxylase (EAH) differs catalytically from HPO by introducing hydroxyl groups first at C-1, then C-3 of 5-epi-aristolochene. HPO and EAH also differ from one another by 91-amino acid differences, with four of these differences mapping to putative substrate recognition regions 5 and 6. These four positions were mutagenized alone and in various combinations in both HPO and EAH and the mutant enzymes were characterized for changes in substrate selectivity, reaction product specificity, and kinetic properties. These mutations did not alter the regio- or stereo-specificity of either HPO or EAH, but specific combinations of the mutations did improve the catalytic efficiencies 10-15-fold.

Molecular models and comparisons between HPO and EAH provide insights into the catalytic properties of these enzymes of specialized metabolism in plants. Plants possess a wide range of defense mechanisms to combat pathogens including the accumulation of phytoanticipins, phytochemicals synthesized constitutively as a pre-existing defense barrier, and by the inducible accumulation of phytoalexins, natural products possessing anti-microbial activities (1VanEtten H.D. Kim J.W. Bailey J.A. Farmer E.E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1191-1192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these chemical defenses often encompass specific chemical classes for specific plant families. For instance, plants within the legume family accumulate phenylpropanoid derivatives in response to pathogen challenge (2Dakora F.D. Kim D.A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1996; 49: 1-20Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar), whereas plants in the mustard family such as cabbage and Arabidopsis accumulate indole-based compounds (3Hansen B. Kim B. Planta. 2005; 221: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of these diverse phytochemicals have historical and contemporary significance because of the broad biological activity of these specialized compounds (4Balunas M.J. Kim A.D. Life Sci. 2005; 78: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) and because of considerable interest in defining the mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of such structurally complex molecules (5Oksman-Caldentey K.M. Kim D. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 433-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of sesquiterpene phytoalexins by solanaceous plants, including potato, tobacco, tomato, and pepper, has also received considerable attention for several reasons. First, members of this family of compounds are known to inhibit mycelial growth of Phytophthora infestans (6Engstrom K. Kim A.K. Brishammar S. Helmersson S. Potato Res. 1999; 42: 43-50Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Rhizoctonia solani (7Yao M.K. Kim H. Charles M.T. Boulanger R. Tweddell R.J. Mycorrhiza. 2003; 13: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), spore germination of Fusarium oxysporum (8Yokose T. Kim K. Park S. Matsuura H. Yoshihara T. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 2004; 68: 2640-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the growth of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis (9Kuroyanagi M. Kim T. Mikami Y. Yoshida K. Kawahar N. Hayashi T. Ishimaru H. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1998; 61: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, the induced biosynthesis of these phytoalexins coincides with a metabolic switch at a key branch point in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. Under normal growth conditions, about 40% of the carbon flux through the mevalonate pathway is directed to C30 sterol biosynthesis. Upon pathogen or elicitor challenge, sterol biosynthesis is suppressed and ∼20% of the carbon flux is diverted into a new branch pathway for C15 sesquiterpene biosynthesis (10Threlfall D.R. Kim I.M. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 2567-2580Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Vögeli U. Kim J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, sesquiterpenes encompass over 300 structural classes including macro-, mono-, bi-, and tricyclic skeletons and a variety of rearranged structures (12Cane D.E. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1089-1103Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For instance, capsidiol, the dominant sesquiterpenoid accumulating in pepper and tobacco upon elicitation, has an eremophilane nucleus consisting of fused 6-membered rings, whereas potato and henbane (Hyoscyamus muticus) accumulate solavetivone, derived from a spirodecane structure (Scheme 1). Sesquiterpene synthases catalyze the biosynthesis of these hydrocarbon skeletons by ionizing the diphosphate substituent from the farnesyl diphosphate substrate leading to a series of carbocation intermediates en route to the final hydrocarbon reaction product. Another reason for interest in sesquiterpene metabolism relates to the recent elucidations of the capsidiol biosynthetic pathway. Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) 2The abbreviations used are: EAS, 5-epi-aristolochene synthase; FPP, farensyl diphosphate; HPO, Hyoscyamus premnaspirodiene oxygenase; HPS, Hyoscyamus premnaspirodiene synthase; EAH, 5-epi-aristolochene hydroxylase; EA, 5-epi-aristolochene; EE, 4-epi-eremophilene; 2β-(OH)EA, 2β-hydroxy-5-epi-aristolochene; SRS, substrate recognition sites; CYP, cytochrome; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. is cyclized to 5-epi-aristolochene by the action of 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) (11Vögeli U. Kim J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Facchini P.J. Kim J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11088-11092Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and this hydrocarbon is then regio- and stereo-specifically hydroxylated at carbons 1 and 3 by epi-aristolochene dihydroxylase (EAH) (14Ralston L. Kim S.T. Schoenbeck M. Ralston J. Schenk D.J. Coates R.M. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At a molecular level, EAH is a typical cytochrome P450 within the CYP71 family. However, unlike other CYP71 family members, EAH catalyzes an ordered, sequential dihydroxylation. The mechanistic details of the EAH-catalyzed reaction were previously reported using a variety of experimental approaches (15Takahashi S. Kim Y.X. O'Maille P.E. Greenhagen B.T. Noel J.P. Coates R.M. Chappell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3686-3696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic analyses demonstrated an initial hydroxylation at C-1, followed by a more rapid hydroxylation at C-3. Kinetically, the second hydroxylation occurred under steady state conditions with a much lower Km and a higher turnover rate (kcat) for the C-1 monohydroxylated intermediate than for the C-3 monohydroxylated regioisomer. Site-specific mutations within substrate recognition domain (SRS) 6 (16Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also abolished the second hydroxylation reaction without perturbing the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the first. The complete biosynthetic pathway for solavetivone has yet to be defined (Scheme 1). Whereas the cyclization of FPP to the vetispirane hydrocarbon intermediate premnaspirodiene has been well documented (17Back K. Kim J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7375-7381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), how the ketone carbonyl is introduced is unknown. One possibility is that a hydroxyl group is introduced at C-2 by a CYP-mediated mechanism followed by a subsequent oxidation to the ketone via the action of a dehydrogenase (Scheme 1). Alternatively, sequential hydroxylations at C-2 followed by elimination of H2O could yield solavetivone (Scheme 1). Precedent for both mechanisms can be found in the literature and include multiple hydroxylations at a single carbon position (18Bellucci G. Kim C. Pucci L. Gervasi P.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or hydroxylation followed by a dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation (19de Kraker J.-W. Kim M.C.R. Dalm M.C.F. de Groot A. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1930-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, both mechanisms are predicated on the initial regio-specific introduction of the hydroxyl group at C-2. Because early work demonstrated that the tobacco EAH was able to utilize premnaspirodiene (20Greenhagen B.T. Kim P. Takahashi S. Ralston L. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as a substrate, we reasoned that a similar hydroxylase might exist in henbane and that its gene could be identified based on sequence similarity to the tobacco EAH. Isolation of this gene would then allow for a more detailed and comparative dissection of evolutionarily related CYP-mediated oxidation reactions in specialized plant metabolism involving a chemically and biologically diverse group of sesquiterpenes. Chemical Reagents—Standard laboratory reagents were purchased from Fisher, Sigma, and Aldrich. Authentic standards of EA, 4-epi-eremophilene (EE), 1β-hydroxy-EA (1β-(OH)EA), 3α-hydroxy-EA (3α-(OH)EA), and 3β-hydroxy-EA (3β-(OH)EA) were available from previous work (21Zhao Y.X. Kim D.J. Takahashi S. Chappell J. Coates R.M. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Premnaspirodiene was biosynthesized from FPP using premnaspirodiene synthase (17Back K. Kim J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7375-7381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Ten-ml reactions were set up with FPP (350 μg) and Hyoscyamus premnaspirodiene synthase (HPS) (1 mg) in 20-ml glass vials. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, premnaspirodiene was extracted with hexane (3 × 10 ml), and the combined extracts were applied to a 230-400-mesh silica gel column (0.5 × 4 cm). The hydrocarbon fraction was eluted with five column volumes of hexane. Combined hexane fractions were concentrated on ice under a N2 stream to limit loss of the volatile premnaspirodiene. The resultant highly pure oil, as determined by GC-MS profiling, was suspended in 500 μl of Me2SO for enzyme assays. Amplification of the HPO cDNA from H. muticus mRNA—H. muticus cell suspension cultures, initially provided by Dr. Wayne Curtis (Pennsylvania State University), were maintained in B5 media with 0.2 mg/liter of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid on a weekly subculturing regime. Cultures in rapid growth phase, 3 days after subculturing and doubling in mass every 24 h, were induced by the addition of a fungal elicitor preparation from Rhizoctonia solani at 100-μg glucose equivalents per ml of cell culture. The elicitor was prepared according to Ayers et al. (22Ayers A.R. Kim J. Valent B. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1976; 57: 760-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using fungal mycelia provided by Dr. Curtis. To increase the chances of isolating the full range of elicitor-inducible mRNAs, cells were collected at several time points (4, 6, and 8 h) and combined prior to RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted from the combined cells using the TRIzol reagent, followed by oligo(dT) cellulose column chromatography to isolate the poly(A)+ RNA fraction, both according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) recommendations. First stand cDNA was subsequently generated by reverse transcription of isolated poly(A)+ RNA using oligo(dT) as the initial primer and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), followed by PCR amplification using the primers shown in supplemental materials Fig. S1 according to Ralston et al. (14Ralston L. Kim S.T. Schoenbeck M. Ralston J. Schenk D.J. Coates R.M. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The PCR primers were designed according to DNA sequence alignments of functionally characterized terpene hydroxylase genes 71D16 (GenBank accession number AF166332) and 71D20 (AF368376; EAH), and related CYP clones 71D4 (AJ296346), 71D6 (U48434), and 71D7 (U48435) that possess significant sequence similarity to EAH. The amplified cDNA fragments of appropriate size (>1.5 kb) were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for automated DNA sequencing using the Big-Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing protocol of PerkinElmer Life Sciences in combination with an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences for the H. muticus clone, HPO or CYP71D55, based upon established nomenclature, are deposited in GenBank as accession number EF569601. Yeast Expression and Microsome Preparations—Yeast expression vector (pYeDP60) harboring EAH or HPO was introduced into the WAT11 yeast strain, a strain previously engineered with an Arabidopsis NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase gene (23Urban P. Kim C. Kazmaier M. Delorme F. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19176-19186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. P. Urban (Centre de Génétique Moléculaire, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Transformants were grown from single colonies, expression of the cDNAs was induced by galactose addition to the growth media, and microsomes were prepared as previously described (14Ralston L. Kim S.T. Schoenbeck M. Ralston J. Schenk D.J. Coates R.M. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CO Difference Spectra—CO difference spectra were measured to estimate the amount of properly folded P450s in microsomal preparations. The amount of functional P450 was calculated using the extinction coefficient of 91 mm-1 cm-1 at 450 nm (24Omura T. Kim R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant enzymes all exhibited an absorption maximum at 450 nm (supplemental materials Fig. S6). CYP Assays—Standard assays were performed in 1-ml glass vials in a final reaction volume of 200 μl containing 4% (v/v) Me2SO, 2.4 mm NADPH, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and microsomes containing 90 pmol of HPO or EAH (measured by CO difference spectroscopy) per ml. Substrate concentrations varied from 6 to 60 μm for premnaspirodiene, 6 to 100 μm for valencene, 3 to 60 μm for EA, 5 to 50 μm for EE, and 5 to 60 μm for (-)-α-cedrene. After preincubation of the reaction mixtures at 30 °C for 5 min, reactions were initiated with the addition of 2.4 mm NADPH and allowed to proceed for 0.5 (premnaspirodiene to solavetivol), 5 (premnaspirodiene to solavetivone), 0.5 (valencene to nootkatol), 2 (valencene to nootkatol), 2 (EA), 2 (EE), 5 ((-)-α-cedrene), or 3 min (solavetivol). These time periods afforded 5-20% conversion of substrate to reaction products. Reactions were terminated by the rapid addition of 400 μl of ethyl acetate with rapid mixing by vortexing, followed by removal of the upper ethyl acetate layer. A second ethyl acetate extraction was combined with the first. The combined organic extracts were concentrated on ice under N2 gas, adjusted to 30 μl with ethyl acetate, and 10 ng/μl of (-)-α-cedrene or valencene added as an internal standard, culminating in GC-MS analyses. Assays were performed in triplicate for each substrate concentration, and kinetic constants were calculated by a nonlinear regression fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using EnzymeKinetics version 1.5 software (Trinity Software). Rates were measured from reactions that were linear with respect to product formation and corresponding to a 5-20% conversion of substrate to product. Under these conditions satisfying the Michaelis-Menten assumptions, reactions were efficient enough to generate greater than 1 ng of reaction product that was readily quantified by GC/MS. GC and GC-MS Analyses of CYP Reactions—Quantification of reaction products and isoprenoid standards were routinely referenced to (-)-α-cedrene (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) as an internal standard. Accuracy of the (-)-α-cedrene standard was periodically verified relative to valencene and nootkatone standards (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Reaction products (1-μl aliquots) were quantified and identified using a Thermo Finnigan DSQ GC/MS system equipped with a Restec Rtx-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25 μm phase thickness). Samples were injected in the splitless mode at 250 °C with an initial oven temperature of 70 °C for 1 min followed by an 8 °C per min gradient to 230 °C. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV, scanning from 35 to 300 atomic mass units and compared with authentic standards for verification. The regio- and stereo-specific hydroxylation products of HPO were analyzed by GC using a chiral capillary cyclosil B column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm phase thickness) and an HP5890-FID GC with the oven temperature maintained at 100 °C for 5 min and then increased to 230 °C at 8 °C per min. Isolation and Purification of Products from HPO Incubations—Large scale reactions (20 × 5 ml) of premnaspirodiene, valencene, epi-aristolochene, and epi-eremophilene with HPO were performed under the standard assay conditions. After the incubations the dominant reaction products were isolated by three extractions with 20-ml portions of ethyl acetate, the combined extracts were carefully concentrated under a N2 stream, and the concentrates were re-dissolved/re-suspended in hexane such that the final ethyl acetate concentration was less than 2%. The solutions or suspensions were then applied to a 230-400-mesh silica gel column (2 × 15 cm). Remaining hydrocarbons were eluted with hexane and 1:24 (v/v) ethyl acetate:hexane, and the hydroxylated products were then eluted with 1:9 (v/v) ethyl acetate:hexane. The latter fractions were further purified using silica TLC (cyclohexane:ethyl acetate:triethylamine = 15:5:0.1). The relative mobilities (Rf values) for monohydroxylated sesquiterpenes are as follows: solavetivol, nootkatol, epiaristolochen-2β-ol, and 4-epieremophilen-2β-ol were 0.27, 0.26, 0.25, and 0.32, respectively. Additional purification of the alcohols was accomplished by C18 reverse phase TLC (MeOH:H2O = 85:15). Rf values of 0.35, 0.3, 0.3, and 0.3 were observed for solavetivol, nootkatol, epiaristolochen-2β-ol, and 4-epieremophilen-2β-ol. Reference standards of nootkatol (β-nootkatol) and 2-epinootkatol (α-nootkatol) were prepared by LiAlH4 reduction of nootkatone in ether according to literature procedures (25de Kraker J.W. Kim M.

Chem. 1975; 40: 2181-2185Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purification by flash chromatography on silica gel (5:1, hexane/ethyl acetate) provided pure samples of the nootkatol isomers in a 96.5:3.5 ratio (68% combined yield). The 500 MHz 1H NMR data and assignments in CDCl3 (see supplemental materials analytical and NMR information) are in good agreement with the available high field data in the literature, and the 2-R configuration (pseudo equatorial OH) for nootkatol follows from the large axial/axial H2-H3 and small H1-H2 couplings (δH 4.21, ddt, 1H, J = 9.8, 6.2, 2.1 Hz, CHOH) as noted in the literature (25de Kraker J.W.

Characterization and Identification of Purified Monohydroxylated Products—The hydroxylated sesquiterpenes solavetivol, epiaristolochen-2β-ol, and epieremophilen-2β-ol are all new compounds according to searches of the Chemical Abstracts data base through SciFinder. These fermentation products were extensively characterized by physical and spectral data, and the structures and stereochemistry were established by conformational considerations, proton NMR couplings, COSY plots, and NOE measurements. The systematic names given in parentheses are based on recommended skeletal names and positional numbering by Buckingham (30Buckingham J.E. Dictionary of Natural Products. 1994; (Chapman and Hall, London)Google Scholar). The GC retention times, mass spectra, and chromatographic Rf values of epiaristolochen-2β-ol and epieremophilen-2β-ol were distinctly different from those of epiaristolochen-1β, 3α-, and 3β-ols, and epieremophilen-3α-ol (Fig. 4) (21Zhao Y.X. Kim D.J. Takahashi S. Chappell J. Coates R.M. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Solavetivol (Premnaspirodien-2α-ol or (2S,4R,5S,7R)-Spirovetiva-1(10),11(12)-dien-2-ol)—The peak at 4.18 ppm (tdd, 1H, J = 6.3, 2.4, 1.8 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum was assigned as the CHOH proton from its chemical shift, coupling constants, and COSY correlations. The assignment of the 2α configuration was made by conformational analysis with the aid of Chem3D MM2 calculations and NOE measurements. The preferred conformation of the A ring is a half-chair with the C4 methyl group axial. Irradiation of the CHOH peak (4.18 ppm) resulted in a significant enhancement (3.8%) of the C2 vinyl proton at 5.33 ppm. In the favored conformation the H1-H2β dihedral angle is about 5°, whereas the H1-H2α dihedral angle is about 150°. The relatively large NOE reveals close spatial proximity of H1 and H2, indicating the pseudo axial position of the OH group, i.e. 2α-OH (2S). (For NMR assignments, see supplemental materials analytical and NMR information.) Epiaristolochen-2β-ol ((2R,4R,5R,7R)-Eremophila-9(10),11(12)-dien-2-ol)—The structure and stereochemistry were deduced from 1H NMR, APT, COSY, and MS data. The proton NMR peak at 3.77 ppm (tt, 1H, J = 11.4, 5.0 Hz) was assigned to the carbinyl proton CHOH at C2 based on its chemical shift, coupling constants, and COSY correlations. The two large couplings indicate axial orientations of H1, H2, and H3, and the two intermediate couplings arise from further axial-equatorial interactions between H1-H2 and H2-H3. The preferred conformation of the A ring of epiaristolochene is a half-chair with the vicinal methyl groups in axial positions (31Birnbaum G.I. Kim A. Grover S.H. Stothers J.B. Can. J. Chem. 1974; 52: 993-1005Crossref Google Scholar). Thus the hydroxyl group at C-2 was assigned an equatorial disposition. (For NMR assignments, see supplemental materials analytical and NMR information.) 4-Epieremophilen-2β-ol ((2R,4R,5R,7R)-Eremophila-1(10),11(12)-dien-2-ol)—All protons on the A ring were assigned unambiguously from 1H NMR and COSY spectra. The carbinyl proton CHOH appears as a ddd with J values at 9.1, 5.5, and 3.3 Hz. These magnitudes are consistent with axial-axial and axial equatorial couplings to the adjacent CH2, and smaller coupling with the vinyl proton at C-1. It follows that the hydroxyl group is located in the equatorial allylic position at C-2. (For NMR assignments, see supplemental materials analytical and NMR information.) Computational Studies—Homology modeling was performed with Modeler 6.2 (32Fiser A.S. Kim A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) by threading the HPO amino acid sequence (GenBank accession number EF569601) onto the structural coordinates for the mammalian CYP2B4 protein (Protein Data Bank code 1SUO) (33Scott E.E.

The ligands premnaspirodiene, valencene, EA, and EE were created using Chemdraw, energy minimized with MOPAC in Chem3D (CambridgeSoft Corporation, Cambridge, MA), and subsequently used in docking simulations. Docking calculations were conducted with the GOLD software package (Genetic Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, UK) (34Verdonk M.L. Kim J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Visualizations and three-dimensional rendered figures were prepared with PyMOL (www.pymol.org). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of CYP71D20 (EAH) and HPO cDNAs used standard conditions given in QuikChange protocols (Stratagene) (35Rising K.A. Kim C.M. Noel J.P. Chappell J. J. Am. Chem.

Site-specific mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Isolation of a Member of the CYP71D Gene Family from H. muticus—With previous success in structurally and functionally mapping molecular determinants for catalytic specificity in two evolutionary related solanaceous sesquiterpene synthases, namely tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) 5-epi-aristolochene synthase and henbane (H. muticus) premnaspirodiene synthase (HPS) (36Greenhagen B.T. Kim P.E. Noel J.P. Chappell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9826-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), comparative studies naturally extend to the final oxidative step(s) of each pathway. The goal of the current studies was therefore the isolation of a terpene hydroxylase(s) responsible for oxidation of C-2 of premnaspirodiene, followed by biochemical comparison to the previously isolated EAH from tobacco (14Ralston L. Kim S.T. Schoenbeck M. Ralston J. Schenk D.J. Coates R.M. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi S. Kim Y.X. O'Maille P.E. Greenhagen B.T. Noel J.P. Coates R.M. Chappell J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3686-3696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the close phylogenetic relationship between tobacco and henbane supported by the high degree of amino acid and DNA sequence identity between tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase and HPS, nearly 80%, it was reasonable to expect that a similar degree of sequence similarity exists between EAH and the expected premnaspirodiene-specific CYP gene. Genes encoding CYP71D family members functionally characterized as terpene hydroxylases were aligned and used to design DNA primers (supplemental Fig. S1) for reverse transcriptase-PCR with mRNA isolated from elicitor-induced henbane cell cultures. Eight independent PCR products representing different combinations of primer pairs were obtained and shown to encompass overlapping regions and identical DNA sequences. The longest amplification product, ∼1.6 kbp, contained obvious start and stop codons built into the PCR primers, which were separated by the expected length of a CYP71D homologue (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2002326161,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) was initially discovered in budding yeast extracts as a protein complex that binds with high affinity to autonomously replicating sequences in an ATP-dependent manner. We have cloned and expressed the human homologs of the ORC subunits as recombinant proteins. In contrast to other eukaryotic initiators examined thus far, assembly of human ORC in vitro is dependent on ATP binding. Mutations in the ATP-binding sites of Orc4 or Orc5 impair complex assembly, whereas Orc1 ATP binding is not required. Immunofluorescence staining of human cells with anti-Orc3 antibodies demonstrate cell cycle-dependent association with a nuclear structure. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that ORC disassembles as cells progress through S phase. The Orc6 protein binds directly to the Orc3 subunit and interacts as part of ORC in vivo. These data suggest that the assembly and disassembly of ORC in human cells is uniquely regulated and may contribute to restricting DNA replication to once in every cell division cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1981816482,"Mutations in the gene encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) cause the most aggressive form of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. In addition to its well established role in Aβ production and Notch proteolysis, PS1 has been shown to mediate other physiological activities, such as regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, modulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling, and trafficking of select membrane proteins and/or intracellular vesicles. In this study, we present evidence that PS1 is a critical regulator of a key signaling receptor tyrosine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Specifically, EGFR levels were robustly increased in fibroblasts deficient in both PS1 and PS2 (PS-/-) due to delayed turnover of EGFR protein. Stable transfection of wild-type PS1 but not PS2 corrected EGFR to levels comparable to PS+/+ cells, while FAD PS1 mutations showed partial loss of activity. The C-terminal fragment of PS1 was sufficient to fully reduce EGFR levels. In addition, the rapid ligand-induced degradation of EGFR was markedly delayed in PS-/- cells, resulting in prolonged signal activation. Despite the defective turnover of EGFR, ligand-induced autophosphorylation, ubiquitination, and endocytosis of EGFR were not affected by the lack of PS1. Instead, the trafficking of EGFR from early endosomes to lysosomes was severely delayed by PS1 deficiency. Elevation of EGFR was also seen in brains of adult mice conditionally ablated in PS1 and in skin tumors associated with the loss of PS1. These findings demonstrate a critical role of PS1 in the trafficking and turnover of EGFR and suggest potential pathogenic effects of elevated EGFR as well as perturbed endosomal-lysosomal trafficking in cell cycle control and Alzheimer disease.

Presenilins are multipass transmembrane proteins that form the core enzymatic activity of the γ-secretase complex together with nicastrin, pen-2, and aph-1. These four proteins are required for regulated intramembrane proteolysis of multiple type I transmembrane proteins, including APP and Notch, such that the loss of any one of these four proteins destabilizes the complex and abrogates γ-secretase activity (3Periz G. Kim M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accordingly, null mice for any one of these components display embryonic lethality associated with severe malformations of the axial skeleton and cerebral hemorrhage, resembling that of Notch deficiency (3Periz G. Kim M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As expected, this activity is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila where the presenilin complex functions to facilitate Notch signaling (4Levitan D. Kim I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 5Ye Y. Kim N. Fortini M.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). FAD mutations in PS1 and PS2 alter the activity of the γ-secretase complex, leading to the change in the ratio of Aβ to that favoring Aβ42 generation and accelerated amyloid deposition in brain (6De Strooper B. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although the amyloid hypothesis is the leading model for AD pathogenesis, the aggressive early age of disease onset by PS1 FAD mutations have led many to suggest that other cellular perturbations of presenilin mutations might also contribute to the early disease phenotype. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that presenilins are multifunctional proteins. First, we previously demonstrated that PS1 negatively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through facilitating the paired phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin by acting as a scaffold upon which a priming kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and β-catenin are assembled (7Kang D.E.

In a different modality, we and others also reported that PS1 and PS1 FAD mutations also differentially modulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling, a pathway that leads to glycogen synthase kinase-3 inactivation and reduced Tau phosphorylation (10Baki L.

Finally, a role for presenilins in the trafficking and maturation of select membrane proteins and/or intracellular vesicles has been shown, although the mechanisms of this activity are unclear. For example, Naruse and colleagues demonstrated that the glycosylation, trafficking, and signaling of TrkB are altered in PS1-deficient neurons (14Naruse S. Kim G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T.

Moreover, the turnover of other membrane proteins, such as α-synuclein and telencephalin, are delayed by PS1 deficiency, and the molecules accumulate in large vacuolar structures resembling autophagosomes (15Esselens C.

For example, we found that in cells genetically deficient in PS1 and PS2, PDGF receptors α and β are down-regulated, a phenotype that was rescued by PS2 but not PS1. However, FAD PS1 mutations, by reducing PS2 fragments, modified PDGFR levels and activity (11Kang D.E. Kim I.S. Repetto E. Busse T. Yermian N. Ie L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31537-31547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we hypothesized that a related cell surface signaling receptor, EGF receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), might also be regulated by presenilins. Surprisingly, EGFR was dramatically elevated in cells deficient in PS1 and PS2, a phenotype that was fully rescued by PS1 but not PS2 or FAD PS1 mutations. Consequently, EGF-depending signaling was markedly prolonged by the loss of PS1 resulting from defects in ligand induced EGFR degradation. We further demonstrate that PS1 is involved in the trafficking of EGFR from early endosomes to lysosomes and that EGFR levels are dramatically elevated in brains of mice conditionally ablated for PS1 and skin tumors associated with PS1 deficiency. Antibodies and Reagents—The monoclonal antibody PSN2 (against residues 31-56 of human PS1), and polyclonal antibodies against PS1 hydrophilic loop region (490D) and APP (CT15) have previously been described (11Kang D.E.

The polyclonal antibodies against EGFR, PS2-CTF, phospho-EGFR PY845, phospho308-Akt, Akt, ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2, and monoclonal antibody against phospho-EGFR PY1068 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal antibodies against biotin (Jackson ImmunoResearch), ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, P4D1), and β-tubulin (Iowa Hybridoma Bank) were purchased from commercial sources. The 1005/sc-03 polyclonal antibody against EGFR and blocking peptide for immunohistochemistry were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Other reagents EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), DAPT (Calbiochem), EGF (Sigma), cycloheximide (Calbiochem), puromycin (Calbiochem), bleocin (Calbiochem), EGF-Alex488 (Invitrogen), LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen), Texas Red-transferrin (Invitrogen), and 125I-EGF (Amersham Biosciences) were purchased from the indicated vendors. cDNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding wild-type PS1, PS1 D257A, PS1 A246E, PS1ΔX9, and wild-type PS2 were subcloned into the retroviral vector pBabe-puro. PS1N-PS2C, and PS2N-PS1C were also subcloned into pBabe-bleo (Fig. 1). The PS1N-PS2C construct fuses the NTF of PS1 (residues 1-280) with CTF of PS2 (residues 287-448), and the PS2N-PS1C construct fuses the NTF of PS2 (residues 1-286) with CTF of PS1 (residues 281-467), obtained from Dr. Gopal Thinakaran (21Saura C.A.

All constructs were transfected together with a plasmid encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus membrane glycoprotein envelope into 293GP packaging cells, and the resulting supernatants were prepared for retroviral transduction as previously described (8Kang D.E.

Cell Lines and Transfections—All cell lines were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum unless explicitly stated otherwise. PS+/+ cells, PS-/- cells (genetically deficient in PS1 and PS2), and PS1-/- cells have previously been described (7Kang D.E. Kim S. Frosch M.P. Collins T. Naruse S. Sisodia S.S. Leibowitz G.

To generate stable cell lines expressing presenilin variants, corresponding retroviral supernatants from 293GP cells were added in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene and selected with 3 μg/ml puromycin or 100 μg/ml bleocin. Resistant cells were pooled and maintained in the presence of appropriate antibiotic without clonal selection as previously described (11Kang D.E. Kim I.S. Repetto E. Busse T. Yermian N. Ie L.

Cell and Brain Tissue Lysis, Biotinylation, and Signaling Assays—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.002% sodium azide, 400 nm Microcystin-LR, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 1× protease complete inhibitor mixture (Sigma). For signaling assays, overnight confluent cultures were serum-starved in DMEM for 4 h, and EGF (30 ng/ml) was added for the indicated times. Protein quantitations from cell lysates were performed by using the micro-BCA method (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were then subjected to either direct immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies or immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibody and immunoblotted with ubiquitin antibody. For cell surface biotinylation experiments, adherent cells were washed three times with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 1 ml of biotin label (Pierce EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin) at 2 mg/ml for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to cell lysis as described above. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-biotin antibody and/or subjected to immunoblotting for EGFR. To extract protein from mouse brains, hippocampi, and frontal cortices were micro-dissected form 1-year-old mouse brains and homogenized with 30 strokes at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The homogenates were then centrifuged (13,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min) to remove nuclei and debris, and protein concentration was measured as above. All experiments were performed at least three times, and representative experiments and/or quantitations are shown. Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis—PS-/-, PS-/- (hPS1), and PS-/- (hPS2) cells were grown to confluence, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. Two micrograms of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcriptase first strand synthesis using the Superscript kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of the reverse transcriptase product were then used for PCR of EGFR within a linear range of amplification, empirically determined to be between 16 and 22 cycles. Quantitations were performed using a digital camera-based imaging system. All experiments were performed at least three times, and results were normalized to PS-/- cells. 125I-EGF Internalization and Degradation Assays—To assess ligand internalization, cells cultured in 12-well dishes were incubated for 1 h in HEPES binding media (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then incubated with a low concentration of 125I-EGF (1.5 ng/ml) in HEPES binding media for 1-5 min at 37 °C. At the indicated times, one set of cells was washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution on ice, lysed in 1 n NaOH, and used to determine total cellular 125I-EGF. In a replicate set of cells, cell surface-bound 125I-EGF was removed by two rapid acid washes (50 mm glycine, 100 mm NaCl, pH 3.0) on ice, lysed with 1 n NaOH, and used as a measure of internalized 125I-EGF. Percent 125I-EGF internalization was calculated by γ-radiation measured from intracellular 125I-EGF (after removing cell surface 125I-EGF) divided by total cellular 125I-EGF. For 125I-EGF degradation assays, cells were incubated with 3 ng/ml 125I-EGF for 10 min at 37 °C in binding medium, washed 3× with PBS on ice, and further incubated at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM for 1.5 or 3 h. The medium was then collected, and cells were lysed with 1 n NaOH. Radioactivity from the lysate and trichloroacetic acid-soluble medium was measured by a γ-radiation counter. Degradation of 125I-EGF was calculated by dividing trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts in the medium divided by total counts in the lysate (trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I-EGF ratio). Specific 125I-EGF binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific surface 125I-EGF binding from controls for each condition co-incubated with 200-fold excess unlabeled EGF. Non-competable 125I-EGF binding represented <10% of total binding in all experiments. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Fluorescent EGF Trafficking Assays—Mouse embryo fibroblasts were grown on coverslips and incubated with 500 ng/ml EGF-Alexa488 (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C (pulse period). After two washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated for 0, 1, or 2 h at 37 °C to monitor intracellular trafficking of the internalized EGF-Alexa488 to lysosomes (chase period). To mark lysosomes, cells were incubated with 75 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C immediately prior to the end of the chase period. After each indicated time point, mouse embryo fibroblasts were washed with ice-cold PBS on ice and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min on ice. Cells were then visualized with the Olympus IX81 microscope. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin sections were immunostained using the Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories) with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR (1005) antibody at a dilution of 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Tissue sections were pretreated with microwave for antigen recovery. Sections were blocked for endogenous peroxidase for 10 min using 3% H2O2 in deionized water and incubated with a blocking solution containing 5% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. Tissues were then incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed, and incubated with secondary antibody (1:250) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, slides were incubated in the ABC complex for 30 min at room temperature, and then stained with diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin I (Richard-Allan Scientific) and mounted in VectaMount (Vector Laboratories). The specificity of the immunoreaction was verified by the lack of immunoreactivity when stained with primary antibody preabsorbed with the blocking peptide (sc-03, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or secondary antibody alone. Presenilin 1 Deficiency Dramatically Elevates EGF Receptor Levels by Reduced Turnover at Steady State—We previously showed that PDGFR levels were reduced in PS-/- fibroblasts that are genetically deficient in both PS1 and PS2, a phenotype that was rescued by reintroduction of PS2 but not PS1 (11Kang D.E. Kim I.S. Repetto E. Busse T. Yermian N. Ie L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31537-31547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that other cell surface signaling receptors might also be deregulated by the loss of presenilins. Although we previously showed that EGF-induced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was largely normal in PS-/- cells up to 1-h of exposure, we had not performed an exhaustive study of EGFR levels and downstream signaling events (11Kang D.E. Kim I.S. Repetto E. Busse T. Yermian N. Ie L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31537-31547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As an initial attempt to characterize signaling via other cell surface receptors, we were surprised to find that EGFR levels were dramatically elevated in PS-/- cells (genetically deficient in both PS1 and PS2) compared with PS+/+ cells (Fig. 2A), despite a comparable level of Akt and ERK1/2 activation within a 1-h period of EGF exposure seen in our previous study (11Kang D.E.

To ascertain that this difference in EGFR level is not an artifact of comparing two different cell lines, we stably transfected PS-/- cells with human PS1 (PS-/-(hPS1)) or PS2 (PS-/- (hPS2)). Indeed, stable transfection of PS1 but not PS2 into PS-/- cells markedly reduced EGFR to levels similar to that seen in PS+/+ cells (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the loss of PS1 at least in part underlies this phenotype. Quantitations from multiple experiments (n = 7) showed that EGFR levels in PS-/- (hPS1) cells were dramatically reduced by ∼66% from that of parental PS-/- cells (see Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, in fibroblasts genetically deficient in PS1 alone (PS1-/-), EGFR was also elevated compared with control PS1+/+ fibroblasts, and this was again corrected by stable transfection of PS1 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 4PS1 CTF is required to reduce EGFR in PS-/- cells: Effects of FAD PS1 mutations (ΔX9 and A246E) and PS1 D257A mutation in EGFR regulation. A, confluent overnight cultures were lysed, and equal protein amounts were subjected to immunoblotting for EGFR (upper panel), β-tubulin (second panel), and PS1 (490D and PSN2; third and fourth panels). Note that the PSN2 antibody recognizes the NTF, whereas 490D recognizes the CTF of PS1. In the last panel, the graph shows the quantitation of EGFR levels from multiple experiments normalized to PS-/- cells (n = 7 for PS-/- and PS-/- (hPS1); n = 4 for PS-/- (hPS1N-PS2C) and PS-/- (hPS2N-PS1C) cells). Error bars represent standard error of the mean (S.E.). B, confluent overnight cultures were lysed, and equal protein amounts were subjected to immunoblotting for EGFR (upper panel) and PS1 (PSN2, third panel). For detection of cell surface EGFR, cells were surface biotinylated on ice, lysed, and equal protein amounts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-biotin antibody and immunoblotting for EGFR (second panel). A representative experiment is shown. In the last panel, the graph shows quantitations of the EGFR levels from multiple experiments normalized to PS-/- cells (n = 7 for PS-/-, PS-/- (hPS1), and PS-/- (hPS1 D257A); n = 5 for PS-/- (hPS1 ΔX9); n = 2 for PS-/- (hPS1 A246E) cells). Error bars represent standard error of the mean (S.E.). C, the upper graph shows quantitations of the biotinylated cell-surface EGFR from equal protein amounts of PS-/- and PS-/- (hPS1) cells normalized to that in PS-/- cells (n = 3 each). Error bar represents S.E. The lower graph shows quantitations of the relative amount of biotinylated cell-surface EGFR versus total EGFR normalized to that in PS-/- cells (n = 3 each). Error bar represents S.E. Note that PS1 does not alter the relative cell surface EGFR level, which is directly proportional to the amount of total EGFR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The marked change in EGFR levels by the loss of PS1 may be attributable to increased EGFR mRNA levels, as we had found for PDGFR α and β (11Kang D.E. Kim I.S. Repetto E. Busse T. Yermian N. Ie L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31537-31547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), or due to turnover of the EGFR protein. To test for the former possibility, we conducted quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis within an empirically determined linear range of amplification from equal amounts total RNA. PS-/- cells contained ∼50% higher EGFR mRNA levels compared with PS+/+ cells (Fig. 2C). However, this difference is likely attributable to arbitrary non-PS1-related differences between the two cell lines, because we could not detect significant changes in EGFR mRNA levels between parental PS-/- cells and PS-/- cells stably transfected with human wild-type PS1 or PS2 in three separate experiments (Fig. 2C). Thus, the marked accumulation and reduction of EGFR protein in PS-/- and PS-/- (hPS1) cells, respectively, cannot be attributed to the abundance of EGFR mRNA. To determine whether the turnover of EGFR protein is altered by PS1, we used cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/ml) to inhibit protein synthesis for increasing time intervals and monitored EGFR protein levels. In previous studies, EGFR without ligand activation, was shown to be a long-lived protein with a half-life of ∼10 h (22Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In PS-/- cells rescued with PS1, turnover of EGFR was detected starting from 3 h and progressed rapidly over a 9- to 24-h period (Fig. 3, A and B), with a half-life within the range of ∼10 h as previously seen in other cell lines (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the turnover of EGFR was virtually absent over a 9- to 24-h period in parental PS-/- cells (Fig. 3, A and B), with a half-life of EGFR not measurable within the 24-h range of CHX chase experiment. Quantitations of EGFR levels after a 24-h CHX treatment from three experiments showed that levels of EGFR relative to no CHX treatment in PS-/- and PS-/- (hPS1) cells were 73 and 15%, respectively (Fig. 3C), demonstrating a defect in the turnover of EGFR by PS1 deficiency at steady-state. PS2 and FAD PS1 Mutations Fail to Fully Correct Steady-state EGFR Levels: Role of PS1 CTF—PS1 and PS2 exert both unique and additive functions that may contribute to embryonic development and adult physiology. Taking advantage of the observation that PS2 did not contribute to the reduction in EGFR (Fig. 2, A and C), we next utilized PS1/PS2 chimeras to determine which region of PS1 is sufficient to rescue this phenotype. The PS1N-PS2C chimera in which PS1 NTF (residues 1-280) was fused to PS2 CTF (residues 287-448) completely failed to reduce EGFR levels (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the PS2N-PS1C chimera in which PS2 NTF (residues 1-286) was fused to PS1 CTF (residues 281-467) reduced steady-state EGFR levels as effectively as wild-type PS1 (Fig. 4A). Thus, the CTF of PS1 appears to be sufficient to reduce EGFR levels. PS1 FAD mutations cause the most aggressive form of AD, at least in part, by increasing the relative Aβ42 levels and amyloid deposition. It has been proposed that other aspects of PS1 dysfunction associated with PS1 FAD mutations also contribute to AD pathogenesis. Indeed, two FAD mutations tested (ΔX9 and A246E) largely failed to correct EGFR levels compared with wild-type PS1 (Fig. 4B), suggesting implications of these mutations in EGFR turnover and trafficking in AD. Specifically the PS1 A246E only partially (by ∼30%) reduced EGFR levels, whereas the PS1 ΔX9 mutations completely failed to reduce EGFR levels in PS-/- cells (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the steady-state level of total EGFR was in direct proportion with cell surface EGFR in all of the PS1 variant cell lines (including FAD PS1 mutations) tested, indicating that surface EGFR is elevated by the loss of PS1 as well as PS1 ΔX9 and A246E FAD mutations (Fig. 4, B and C).

MβLs display an unusually broad substrate profile and are not susceptible to clinically used inhibitors of the well known serine-β-lactamases. Increasingly frequent reports of transmission of MβL genes among pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria indicate that bacteria expressing these enzymes pose a significant threat to public health (3Walsh T.R.

The design of therapeutically useful inhibitors for these enzymes has been unsuccessful so far. The diverse substrate preferences of MβLs may preclude the discovery or design of a universal inhibitor with both efficacy and specificity toward all MβLs.

This site is known as the DCH site (Fig. 1B). Further spectroscopic studies revealed that when the apoenzyme is reconstituted with 1 eq of Zn(II), Cd(II), or Co(II), the metal ion is distributed between both binding sites, instead of following an ordered, sequential binding (8de Seny D.

In addition, some of these data suggested that formation of the dinuclear species takes place only at a metal/BcII ratio larger than 1 (8de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Knowing the identity of the metallated species formed at increasing metal concentration is specially important if we recall recent studies that suggest that Co(II)-BcII is only active in its dinuclear form (19Badarau A. Page M.I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11012-11020Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Metal binding studies on the homologous MβL CcrA from Bacteroides fragilis have shown a different metal binding mechanism (20Periyannan G.R. Costello A.L. Tierney D.L. Yang K.W. Bennett B. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Co(II) uptake by apo-CcrA was strictly sequential, as shown by several spectroscopic techniques. At a Co(II)/CcrA ratio equal to 1, only the 3H site becomes occupied, whereas the DCH site is metallated upon the addition of a second Co(II) equivalent. No evidence of redistribution (“scrambling”) of the metal ion between the two binding sites was found for this enzyme (20Periyannan G.R. Costello A.L. Tierney D.L. Yang K.W. Bennett B. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Co(II) can be exploited as a unique spectroscopic probe of the catalytic mechanism of MβLs by following its spectral features during turnover (7Garrity J.D. Bennett B. Crowder M.W.

We decided to characterize in detail the identity and metal content of the Co(II)-BcII adducts formed at different Co(II)/BcII ratios prior to any mechanistic study. By using UV-visible, EPR, and NMR spectroscopy, as well as through measurements of the Co(II) binding constants, we have determined that 1) BcII is able to bind up to 3 Co(II) eq in its active site and that some of the features previously assigned to the DCH site in the dinuclear species correspond to a third, weakly bound Co(II) site, 2) a di-Co(II) species is formed at a Co(II)/BcII ratio as low as 0.6, and 3) different species coexist in equilibrium at very low (<1) Co(II)/BcII ratios. These observations prompt for a reinterpretation of previous studies on Co(II)-substituted BcII and suggest that the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme cannot be analyzed without considering the different coexisting species. Reagents—All chemicals were of the highest quality available. The MTPBS buffer was 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS′ cells (Stratagene) were employed for protein production. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Sigma) was used as growth medium for all bacterial strains. DNA Techniques and Cloning Procedure—DNA preparation and related techniques were performed according to standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps kit (Promega). Enzyme Purification—Wild type BcII was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS′ as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (10Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), purified, and quantified as follows. Typically, the cell pellet obtained from 50 ml of a culture in late logarithmic phase in LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml cloramphenicol was resuspended in fresh medium and used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml cloramphenicol in a 5-liter Erlenmeyer flask. Cells were grown for 2 h at 37 °C until A600 = 1 was reached. The expression of fusion protein was induced by the addition of 10 g of lactose, and the culture was further incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4-h period. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. E. coli cells were disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer (MTPBS with 3.3 μg/ml DNase, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cell debris was separated by ultracentrifugation. The GST-BcII fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences), as previously reported (10Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The pure fractions were treated with bovine plasma thrombin (Sigma) at a 1:100 ratio, after the addition of 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, at 26 °C for 2 h. BcII was purified from the proteolysis mixture by ion exchange chromatography on Sephadex CM-50 (Amersham Biosciences) as previously reported (10Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein samples were dialyzed against >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. Purity of the enzyme preparations was checked by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using ϵ280 = 30,500 m–1 cm–1 (18Paul-Soto R. Bauer R. Frere J.M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D. Hernandez-Valladares M. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Metal content in protein samples was checked using the colorimetric reagent 4-(2-pyridilazo)-resorcinol and ranged between 1.4 and 1.8 metal/total protein, depending on the enzyme preparation (24Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25McCall K.A. Fierke C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Preparation of Apo-BcII—All buffer solutions used to prepare the apoenzyme were treated by extensive stirring with Chelex 100 (Sigma). Apo-BcII was prepared by dialysis of the purified holoprotein (∼200 μm) against two changes of >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA over a 12-h period. EDTA was removed from the resulting apoenzyme solution by three dialysis steps against >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.3 g/liter Chelex 100; one dialysis step against >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.3 g/liter Chelex 100; and finally two dialysis steps against >100 volumes of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.3 g/liter Chelex 100. All dialysis steps were carried out at 4 °C, under stirring and for at least 6 h. Metal content in apoprotein samples was checked using the colorimetric reagent 4-(2-pyridilazo)-resorcinol (24Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25McCall K.A. Fierke C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Electronic Spectroscopy of Co(II)-BcII Derivatives—A solution of 200–300 μm apo-BcII in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl was titrated with a 10.6 mm CoSO4 stock solution prepared in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. Spectra were recorded at room temperature in a Jasco 550 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The spectra were corrected for dilution upon adding Co(II), and the UV-visible difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of apo-BcII. The complete formation of the di-Co(II) adduct, as monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy, was achieved at a ratio of 1.4–1.8 Co(II)/total protein, depending on the enzyme preparation. In all preparations, the level of Co(II) uptake of the apoenzymes paralleled the original Zn(II) content of the protein as isolated. The concentration of “metallable” protein was then calculated by multiplying the concentration of protein determined by absorbance at 280 nm by the factor n/2, where n is the number of analytical Co(II) equivalents needed to reach the maximum intensity of the d-d (550 nm) and CT (343 nm) bands. At this Co(II) concentration, all of the metallable protein is in the dinuclear form. The protein concentration used in the different fits was then calculated by employing this correction factor, to account for the variable fraction of protein capable of binding metal. The changes in absorbance at 343, 383, and 550 nm with increasing Co(II) concentrations were fit simultaneously using the program DynaFit (BioKin, Ltd.) (26Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The data were fit to the following model (Model 1). Mono-Co(II)BcII⇌apo-BcII+Co(II)KD1Di-Co(II)BcII⇌Mono-Co(II)BcII+Co(II)KD2Tri-Co(II)BcII⇌Di-Co(II)BcII+Co(II)KD3MODEL 1 The model assumes that the mono-Co(II) species is a mixture of two enzyme species, one with cobalt bound to the 3H site (which absorbs at 550 nm) and a second species with metal bound to the DCH site (which absorbs at 343 nm). Di-Co(II) BcII presents both metal binding sites loaded and absorbs at 550 and 343 nm, and the tri-Co(II) species absorbs at 550 nm and at 383 nm. Metal Binding Affinities Measured with Mag-fura-2—The dissociation constants were estimated from competition experiments with the chromophoric chelator Mag-fura-2 (MF; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (8de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The indicator was first titrated with Co(II) at 30 °C, and changes in absorbance at 363 nm with added metal were fit with DynaFit to obtain the dissociation constant of Co(II) from the complex with Mag-fura-2 (KMF) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. A value of 2.8 ± 0.1 μm was obtained, with ϵMF, 363 nm = 22,000 ± 100 m–1 cm–1 and ϵCo(II)·MF, 363 nm = 4,510 ± 140 m–1 cm–1. Afterward, a solution of 2.7 μm Mag-fura-2 in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl was titrated with Co(II) in the presence of 1–3 μm apo-BcII, using a 1.12 mm CoSO4 stock solution in the same buffer, at 30 °C. The changes in absorbance at 363 nm with added metal, obtained from experiments carried out with three different apoprotein concentrations, were fit together to two different models, using the program DynaFit, in order to calculate KD1 and KD2. The first model (Model 2, described below) involves three dissociation equilibria, where KMF was fixed to the value determined independently. Co(II).MF⇌Co(II)+MFKFMMono-Co(II)BcII⇌apo-BcII+Co(II)KD1Di-Co(II)BcII⇌Mono-Co(II)BcII+Co(II)KD2MODEL 2 A second model involving four dissociation equilibria (Model 3, presented below), was also considered. KMF and KD3 were fixed to the values determined independently, from Co(II) binding to MF and from the UV-visible titration of apo-BcII with Co(II), respectively. Co(II).MF⇌Co(II)+MFKFMMono-Co(II)BcII⇌apo-BcII+Co(II)KD1Di-Co(II)BcII⇌Mono-Co(II)BcII+Co(II)KD2Tri-Co(II)BcII⇌Di-Co(II)BcII+Co(II)KD3MODEL 3 EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectroscopy was performed at either 13 K, 2 milliwatts, and 9.63 GHz (Bmicrowave ⊥ Bstatic) or 10 K, 50 milliwatts, and 9.37 GHz (Bmicrowave ∥ Bstatic), using a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer equipped with an ER 4116 DM TE012/TE102 dual mode X-band cavity and an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium flow cryostat. EPR spectra were simulated with the matrix diagonalization program XSophe (Bruker Biospin) using a spin Hamiltonian H = βg·H·S + S·D·S + S·A·I Least-squares fitting of simulations and experimental spectra was carried out using IGORPro (Wavemetrics). Recording conditions of 13 K and 2 milliwatts were determined to be nonsaturating for 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 eq of Co(II) in frozen solutions of BcII. Integration of spectra thus recorded gave pseudoabsorption curves that lay on a level base line, providing further strong evidence that there were no selectively saturated species in the spectra of BcII with 1 and 2 eq of Co(II). Spectra recorded at up to 160 milliwatts and down to 3.6 K provided no evidence at all for any species with very fast relaxation, and the spectra under these conditions were typical for spectra of MS = ½ Co(II) under rapid passage conditions. The apoprotein samples (∼1 mm), in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, were titrated stepwise with a 6 mm CoSO4 stock solution prepared in the same buffer. The Co(II)-containing solution was rapidly mixed with the sample in the EPR tube by manual flicking (27Bennett B. Benson N. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For successive additions of Co(II), EPR samples were quickly thawed (∼5 s) from 77 K to 20 °C by agitating the sample tube in water. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 600 spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz at different temperatures, as indicated. 1H NMR spectra were recorded under conditions set to optimize detection of the fast relaxing paramagnetic resonances, using either the super-WEFT pulse sequence (28Inubushi T. Becker E.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128-133Google Scholar) or water presaturation. Spectra were acquired over large spectral widths with acquisition times ranging from 16 to 80 ms and intermediate delays from 2 to 35 ms. One-dimensional experiments with solvent presaturation were used to record isotropically shifted signals closer to the diamagnetic envelope. T1 measurements were performed using the nonselective inversion-recovery method. One-dimensional NOE difference and NOESY spectra were obtained as described previously (29Fernandez C.O. Cricco J.A. Slutter C.E. Richards J.H. Gray H.B. Vila A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11678-11685Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Vila A.J. Fernandez C.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7291-7298Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with mixing times of 5 and 25 ms. The apoprotein samples (∼1 mm), in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, were titrated stepwise with a 37.8 mm CoSO4 stock solution prepared in the same buffer. Co(II) was added to the sample in the NMR tube. In order to obtain the spectra of the protein with excess Co(II) in D2O, the sample with 3.5 eq of added cobalt was diafiltrated with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.1 (pD 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, containing the same concentration of Co(II) as the protein sample, in Amicon-Ultra-4 units (Millipore). A second titration was carried out in D2O, with the apoprotein sample in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.1 (pD 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, by the stepwise addition of Co(II) from a 37.8 mm stock solution prepared in the same buffer. No evidence of protein denaturation or aggregation was detected in any of the titration experiments (UV-visible, EPR, and NMR), even when working at high protein concentrations. Spectrophotometric Titrations—The spectrum of Co(II)-substituted BcII with excess Co(II) is reported in the inset in Fig. 2A (dashed line); it presents two charge transfer bands at 343 and 383 nm (8de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and a pattern of ligand field bands (530–640 nm) similar to the one reported for the alkaline form of Co(II)-carbonic anhydrase (31Bertini I. Luchinat C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 272-279Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These spectral features have been previously assigned to each of the metal binding sites in BcII. Davies and Abraham (32Davies R.B. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) early attributed the 343 nm absorption band to a ligand to metal charge transfer band due to the interaction of Co(II) with the Cys ligand in the DCH site. Later, a hybrid adduct was obtained, in which Zn(II) occupies the 3H site and Co(II) is located in the DCH site (10Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This experiment demonstrated that the absorption features in the visible range are largely due to the 3H site, whereas the 343 nm band corresponds to the DCH site. A study performed under different conditions reported a new CT band at 383 nm (8de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The authors attributed this band to the diCo(II)-BcII adduct while assigning the 343 nm band to a mononuclear form of the enzyme. Titration of apo-BcII with Co(II) was followed by absorption spectroscopy in the UV-visible range (Fig. 2, A and B). The simultaneous buildup of the charge transfer band at 343 nm and of the d-d bands at <1 eq of Co(II) added confirms that, under these experimental conditions, the two metal sites are being filled at the same time, as already reported (8de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). Saturation of both bands took place at a Co(II)/BcII ratio higher than 1 (ranging between 1.4 and 1.8, depending on the enzyme preparation), in contrast to the data reported by de Seny et al. (8de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45065-45078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), where saturation occurs at 1 Co(II) eq per BcII. At concentrations of added Co(II) beyond this saturation point, three interesting features are observable in the data presented in Fig. 2B. The intensity of the band at 343 nm decreases asymptotically, and this is mirrored in an asymptotic increase in the intensity of the band at 383 nm, although neither of the intensities of the 343 and 383 nm bands plateaued completely, even at 4 eq of added Co(II). The third feature of note is that there is no significant change in the intensity of the d-d region of the spectrum. These spectral changes can be accounted for by the binding of Co(II) to BcII in a site that (i) exhibits higher than 4-fold coordination (with poorly resolved low intensity d-d bands) and (ii) perturbs the Co(II) ion already bound to the Cys ligand. The fact that the d-d bands in the visible range (attributable to the 3H site) do not increase significantly with further Co(II) added after saturation of the 343 nm CT band clearly indicates that both metal sites are fully loaded at this point. Therefore, the spectrum obtained at this point corresponds to the di-Co(II) enzyme (Fig. 2A), as originally suggested by us (10Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We used the point of saturation to calculate the effective metallable enzyme concentration, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From now on, the Co(II) eq refer to the corrected protein concentration. The CT band at 383 nm, which appears at higher Co(II)/BcII ratios would correspond to a third metal ion that perturbs the 343 nm signal (DCH site) without affecting the spectral features of the 3H site. The intensity of the 383 nm CT band was variable among different protein preparations, showing no correlation with the level of metal uptake to the dinuclear binding site. The absorbance changes upon Co(II) uptake at 343, 383, and 550 nm could be fit to a model assuming binding of 2 Co(II) eq at a submicromolar range and a third one with lower affinity (see Model 1). The model assumes that the mono-Co(II) species is a mixture of two enzyme species, one with Co(II) bound to the 3H site (which hence absorbs only at 550 nm) and a second species with metal bound to the DCH site (which absorbs at"

L-PGDS is a member of the lipocalin superfamily and binds lipophilic substances, such as retinoids and bile pigments, suggesting that L-PGDS is a dual functional protein acting as a PGD2-synthesizing enzyme and a transporter for lipophilic ligands. In this study we determined by NMR the three-dimensional structure of recombinant mouse L-PGDS with the catalytic residue Cys-65. The structure of L-PGDS exhibited the typical lipocalin fold, consisting of an eight-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel and a long α-helix associated with the outer surface of the barrel. The interior of the barrel formed a hydrophobic cavity opening to the upper end of the barrel, the size of which was larger than those of other lipocalins, and the cavity contained two pockets. Molecular docking studies, based on the result of NMR titration experiments with retinoic acid and PGH2 analog, revealed that PGH2 almost fully occupied the hydrophilic pocket 1, in which Cys-65 was located and all-trans-retinoic acid occupied the hydrophobic pocket 2, in which amino acid residues important for retinoid binding in other lipocalins were well conserved. Mutational and kinetic studies provide the direct evidence for the PGH2 binding mode. These results indicated that the two binding sites for PGH2 and retinoic acid in the large cavity of L-PGDS were responsible for the broad ligand specificity of L-PGDS and the non-competitive inhibition of L-PGDS activity by retinoic acid.

Two of these Cys residues, Cys-89 and Cys-186, form a disulfide bridge, which is highly conserved among most, but not all lipocalins (6Toh H. Kim H. Nakajima N. Sekiya T. Eguchi N. Tanaka T. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1067-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This disulfide bridge can be removed without a significant loss of the enzymatic activity. On the other hand, Cys-65 is unique to L-PGDS, as it has never been found in other lipocalins. Moreover, the replacement of Cys-65 with Ser/Ala by site-directed mutagenesis led to complete loss of the catalytic activity of the recombinant rat (11Urade Y. Kim T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H.

L-PGDS binds a large variety of ligands, such as retinoids (18Tanaka T. Kim Y. Kimura H. Eguchi N. Nishikawa A. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

A. 2007; 104: 6412-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), with high affinities (Kd = 20 nm to 2 μm). Thus, we thought that L-PGDS possesses dual functions as an extracellular lipophilic ligand-transporter protein as well as a PGD2-synthesizing enzyme (3Urade Y. Kim N. Hayaishi O. Akerstrom B. Lipocalins. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2006: 99-109Google Scholar). In a recent study the function of non-mammalian L-PGDS homologue without the catalytic Cys-65 residue serves as a carrier protein for lipophilic ligands but not as an enzyme (12Fujimori K. Kim T. Uodome N. Kadoyama K. Aritake K. Urade Y. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 375: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The genetic and biochemical properties of L-PGDS have been extensively studied as described above, whereas the structural information on L-PGDS and its complexes with various ligands remain to be elucidated. To understand the molecular basis of the reaction mechanism and of the ligand recognition, we determined the solution structure of recombinant mouse L-PGDS mutant, which contains the catalytic Cys-65 residue, by NMR spectroscopy and clarified the ligand binding mode by molecular docking. NMR Spectroscopy—In this study we used the recombinant Δ1–24-C89A,C186A mouse L-PGDS mutant, in which the N-terminal signal sequence and the intermolecular disulfide bridge between Cys-89 and Cys-186 were removed, but the catalytically active Cys-65 residue was retained. This mutant shows the same catalytic activity and retinoid-binding activity as those of the wild type enzyme (19Inui T. Kim T. Emi M. Irikura D. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2845-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Uniformly 15N- and 13C-labeled Δ1–24-C89A,C186A mouse L-PGDS mutant was prepared as reported previously (19Inui T. Kim T. Emi M. Irikura D. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2845-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) except that Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were cultured in M9 minimal medium containing [15N]ammonium chloride (1 g/liter) and/or 13C glucose (2 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. The NMR samples were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate of D2Oor 85% H2O, 15% D2O mixture at pH 6.5. The protein concentration was adjusted to ∼1 mm in a 5-mm microcell NMR tube (Shigemi) for all NMR experiments. All two- and three-dimensional NMR experiments were performed at 30 °C on an INOVA600 spectrometer (Varian) equipped with shielded gradient triple resonance probes. The pulsed-field gradient techniques with a WATERGATE (23Piotto M. Kim V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar) were utilized in all H2O experiments for the solvent suppression. Transmitter frequencies for 1H, 15N, 13Cα, aliphatic 13C, aromatic 13C, and carbonyl 13C were typically set to 4.75, 117.0, 60.8, 43.0, 125.0, and 176.0 ppm, respectively. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as an external reference of 1H chemical shifts. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were indirectly calibrated from each gyromagnetic ratio (24Wishart D.S. Kim C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained from two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC, 13C,1H HSQC, three-dimensional HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, and HCCH-two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (25Kay L.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 277-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Bax A. Kim F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). NOEs were collected from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOE (100-ms mixing time) and 13C-edited NOE (100-ms mixing time) spectra (25Kay L.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 277-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Bax A. Kim F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Backbone amide groups slowly exchanging with the solvent were identified from a series of two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra after a rapid buffer exchange to D2O. The retinoic acid binding site was investigated by two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra. The protein and the ligands were combined at a molar ratio of 1:1. All the NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (27Delaglio F. Kim S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the NMRVIEW (Merck). A table containing the chemical shift assignments of L-PGDS has been deposited in the BioMagResBank data base under the accession number 10137. The binding of L-PGDS to ligands was monitored by an NMR titration of 15N-labeled L-PGDS with unlabeled ligands using 1H,15N HSQC experiments. The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift changes over the range of the titration from 0 to 2 eq of ligands are plotted. Because of the instability of PGH2 in solution, the stable PGH2 analog, U-46619, was used to replace PGH2 for the interaction. The overall chemical structure of U-46619 is identical to PGH2 except for one endoperoxide oxygen that was replaced with carbon at C-9 (28So S.P. Kim D. Ruan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40679-40685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—NOE restraints were classified into four categories, strong, medium, weak, and very weak, corresponding to the distance restraints of 1.8–2.8, 1.8–3.4, 1.8–4.2, and 1.8–5.0 Å, respectively. The Ψ and φ torsion angle restraints were evaluated from the 15N, Hα, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts using the TALOS program (29Cornilescu G. Kim F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The restraints deduced from intramolecular hydrogen bonds of protein backbone, which were identified by H-D exchange experiments, were classified into two groups; between the amide proton and the carbonyl oxygen of 1.5–2.5 Å and between the amide nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of 2.5–3.5 Å (30Wüthrch K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. 1986; (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). The initial solution structures were calculated using the distance geometry algorithm in the CNS programs (31Brunger A.T. Kim P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The structure optimization and energy minimization were achieved by a simulated annealing algorithm. The final 15 lowest energy structures were analyzed by using the MOLMOL (32Koradi R. Kim M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK programs (33Laskowski R.A. Kim J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4285) Google Scholar). Structural statistics for the 15 structures are included in Table 1. Graphical representations were prepared using RASMOL and PyMOL. All of these structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2E4J.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsNo. of restraints All2081 NOE distance restraints1653 Intraresidue706 Sequential428 Medium range147 Long range372 Hydrogen bond distance restraints80 Dihedral angle restraints348Deviations from idealized covalent geometry Bonds(Å)0.0022 ± 0.0001 Angle(°)0.3493 ± 0.0056 Impropers(°)0.2273 ± 0.0168Mean coordinate r.m.s.d. from mean structureaCalculated from 15 refined structures Overall structure (residues 25–189) Backbone heavy atoms1.24 ± 0.25 Å All heavy atoms1.73 ± 0.23 Å Secondary elements Backbone heavy atoms0.41 ± 0.07 Å All heavy atoms0.85 ± 0.07 Åa Calculated from 15 refined structures Open table in a new tab Enzyme Assay—The L-PGDS activity was measured by incubating the enzyme at 25 °C for 1 min with [1-14C]PGH2 (final concentration of 1.25–40 μm) in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml IgG and 1 mm dithiothreitol (11Urade Y. Kim T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). [1-14C]PGH2 was prepared from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (2.20 GBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (1Urade Y. Kim N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The all-trans-retinoic acid was dissolved in Me2SO to give a stock solution of 2 mm. The concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid were determined spectroscopically based on its molar absorption coefficient, ϵ336, for all-trans-retinoic acid = 45,000 m-1 cm-1 (34Chen L.X. Kim Z.P. Scafonas A. Cavalli R.C. Gabriel J.L. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4518-4525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid were added to the reaction mixture. Aggregates were removed by centrifugation, and the retinoic acid concentration was calibrated by spectrophotometry at 336 nm after the assay experiments. The U-46619 was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) to give a stock solution of 2 mm. Molecular Modeling—Docking of retinoic acid and PGH2 to solution structure of L-PGDS was performed with AutoDock, Version 3.0 (35Morris G.M. Kim D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8853) Google Scholar). This program allows ligand structures to dock in a conformationally flexible manner to a protein and adopts a rigid-body protein approximation to speed up the calculation of binding free energy. The initial structures of the ligands were constructed by the Maestro molecular modeling package (Schrödinger Inc., Portland, OR). The AMBER (36Weiner S.J. Kim P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Chio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4847) Google Scholar) and Gasteiger-Marsili (37Gasteiger J. Kim M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3512) Google Scholar, 38Marsili M. Kim J. Croat. Chem. Acta. 1980; 53: 601-614Google Scholar) atomic charges were loaded on the protein and ligand atoms as partial charges, respectively. A docking space of the ligands was defined with a rectangular box (33.8 × 45.0 × 33.8 Å3) that covers the interior space of β-barrel of the protein. Grids of probe-atom interaction energies were computed on the boxes. The number of grid points in the x, y, and z axis was 90 × 120 × 90 with grid points separated by 0.375 Å. The ligand probes were then docked by Lamarckian genetic algorithm. Flexibility was allowed for all exocyclic torsion angles of the ligands by freely rotating the torsional bonds. One Lamarckian genetic algorithm calculation generated 270,000 conformers by varying the molecular position in the docking space and torsion angles of the ligand and ranked the conformers by their binding free energy. Each docking experiment consisted of a series of 200 Lamarckian genetic algorithm simulations. Structure Determination—We determined the solution structure of the Δ1–24-C89A,C186A mouse L-PGDS, which showed the same catalytic activity and retinoid binding activity as those of the wild type enzyme (19Inui T. Kim T. Emi M. Irikura D. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2845-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by using NMR-derived distance constraints. Nearly complete assignments for backbone and side-chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of L-PGDS were accomplished. The detailed restraint data for the structure calculation of L-PGDS are summarized in Table 1. A total of 1653 NOE restraints were employed for this structure calculation, including 706 intraresidue, 428 sequential, and 147 medium-range (i-i+2, i-i+3, i-i+4) and 372 long-range restraints. In addition, the 348 dihedral angle restraints were obtained from the TALOS program, and the 80 hydrogen bond restraints were observed from H-D exchange experiments. Using the CNS program, 4000 structures were calculated. The 15 structures of the lowest total energy structures with no distance restraint violations greater than 0.5 Å, and no torsion angle restraint violations above 5° were selected for further analysis as shown in Fig. 1A. Ramachandran φ-Ψ plots for the ensemble of 15 structures indicate that 72.8% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues are found in the most favored region, and 25.4% were found in the additional allowed regions. Several residues in the N terminus are found around the border of the disallowed region probably due to the lack of experimental information on the φ-Ψ angle values (39Bertini I. Kim G. Luchinat C. Poli I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A ribbon diagram of a representative lowest energy NMR structure of L-PGDS is shown in Fig. 1B. The superposition of backbone atoms clearly shows that the calculated structures were well converged (Fig. 1A). The overall average r.m.s.d. values to the mean structure for backbone heavy atoms and all heavy atoms including side chains of L-PGDS (residue 25–189) were 1.24 ± 0.25 and 1.73 ± 0.23 Å, respectively. The average r.m.s.d. values for backbone heavy atoms and all heavy atoms in the regular secondary structure elements were 0.41 ± 0.07 and 0.85 ± 0.07 Å, respectively. Structure Overview of L-PGDS—L-PGDS exhibited the typical lipocalin fold, consisting of an eight-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel with a repeated +1 topology. Secondary structural elements of L-PGDS are comprised of nine β-strands (A, amino acid residues 41–50; B, 63–71; C, 76–84; D, 89–98; E, 104–107; F, 115–121; G, 128–135; H, 144–149; I, 177–179) plus two short 310 helices (H1, 36–39; H2, 56–60) and one long α-helix (H3, 157–171) (Fig. 1B). In NMR ensemble structures of L-PGDS, the first eight residues at the N terminus, the EF loop, and GH loop are less defined due to the HN signal broadening of these loop regions. Therefore, these regions are indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 1B. The hydrophobic cavity exists in the barrel, which consists of eight strictly antiparallel β-sheets and is largely open at one end (Fig. 1C). Four relatively flexible loops connect neighboring β-strands in a pairwise manner at the end of the barrel. The cavity has an unusually bifurcated shape and a larger entry than those in other lipocalins. The size of the cavity is about 17 Å deep, 16 Å wide, and 8 Å thick. Analysis of the inner accessible surface of the cavity shows that there are two distinct pockets adjacent to each other, pocket 1 and pocket 2. Pocket 1 is located at the middle of the cavity, and pocket 2 is located at a relatively lower part of the cavity. For comparison, the cavity of representative lipocalins, retinoic acid-binding protein is illustrated in Fig. 1D, and the size of the cavity is about 17 Å deep, 8 Å wide, and 8 Å thick. Recently, the crystal structure of Δ1–24-C65 mouse L-PGDS without enzyme activity has been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (codes 2CZT and 2CZU). Comparison of the crystal and solution structures of mouse L-PGDS revealed that both structures were similar to each other and are characterized by their overall profiles with a large cavity that consisted of two pockets as described above. Mapping of the Binding Sites by Chemical Shift Perturbation—The ligand interaction sites of L-PGDS were determined using the NMR chemical shift perturbation method (40Craik D.J. Kim J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 195-232PubMed Google Scholar) in which two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra of L-PGDS were recorded with successive addition of all-trans-retinoic acid or PGH2 analog, U-46619 (Fig. 2, A and B). To allow quantification of the observed chemical shift changes, backbone resonances of L-PGDS in the complexes with retinoic acid and U-46619 were assigned (supplemental Table S1). Fig. 2A presents the magnitude of the composite 1H and 15N chemical shift differences of backbone amides observed between free and retinoic acid-bound forms of L-PGDS displayed on the primary sequence, whereas Fig. 2C presents the structural mapping of these differences. Upon retinoic acid binding, large chemical shift changes (>0.08) were observed at the region containing residues Ile-115, His-116, and Ser-117 (β-strand F) and containing Leu-131, Phe-132, and Gly-135 (β-strand G) (Fig. 2A). These residues form a well defined, spatially close region on the β-barrel (Fig. 2C). A continuous, positively charged surface for binding to the carboxyl group of retinoic acid is formed on β-strands G and H. Therefore, β-strands F and G should be the major contact sites of the retinoic acid. On the other hand, Fig. 2B presents the composite 1H and 15N chemical shift differences of backbone amides observed between free and U-46619-bound forms of L-PGDS, whereas Fig. 2C two-dimensional presents the structural mapping of these differences. Upon U-46619 binding, large chemical shift changes (>0.08) were observed at the region containing residues His-116, Ser-117 (β-strand F) and residues Phe-132, Ser-133, Gly-135 (β-strand G) (Fig. 2B), similar to those observed for the retinoic acid binding. In addition, residues around Cys-65 catalytic center, Ala-60, Leu-62, Met-64, Cys-65, Thr-82, Asn-87, and Tyr-149 also show large chemical shift changes (>0.08). These residues are located around pocket 1 in the solution structure of L-PGDS (Fig. 2D). β-Strands F and G and pocket 1 should contain the major contact sites for U-46619. Therefore, U-46619 binds in a different position from retinoic acid. Kinetic Studies of L-PGDS Mutants—To clarify the difference between U-46619 binding and PGH2 binding, the inhibition of L-PGDS reaction by U-46619 was investigated. Lineweaver-Burk plots of L-PGDS activity in the presence of various concentrations of U-46619 (see Fig. 4B) revealed an unchanged y axis intercept and an altered x axis, indicating that U-46619 inhibited L-PGDS in a competitive manner. This result clearly shows that U-46619 binds to the catalytic site of L-PGDS in the same manner as PGH2. To identify the residues important for the PGH2 binding, the catalytic activities of several mutants, C89A,C186A/S45A, C89A,C186A/T67A, and C89A,C186A/S81A, were measured. As shown in Table 2, the mutants C89A,C186A/S45A and C89A,C186A/S81A showed a comparable Km value to C89A, C186A, whereas the mutant C89A,C186A/T67A showed a 5–6-fold higher Km value. This indicates that Thr-67 is important for the recognition of PGH2. In addition, Ser45, Thr-67, and Ser-81 are not important for retinoic acid binding because these mutants have nearly the same Kd values for retinoic acid to C89A,C186A. These results suggest that the region around Cys-65 is related to PGH2 binding but not to retinoic acid binding. The catalytic activities and Kd values for retinoic acid of mutants C89A,C186A/H116E and C89A, C186A/H116A were measured (Table 2). Both Km and Kd values of mutant C89A,C186A/H116E were higher than that of C89A,C186A. The mutant C89A,C186A/H116A showed a 3-fold higher Km value but almost the same Kd value for retinoic acid. These results may indicate that the positive charge around His-116 contributes to the PGH2 and retinoic acid binding and that His-116 is involved in PGH2 binding but not in retinoic acid binding.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of mouse L-PGDS mutantsMutantKmVmaxKd for retinoic acidμmμmol/min/mgnmC89A,C186A3.53.0180C89A,C186A/S45A4.62.2180C89A,C186A/T67A23.61.9260C89A,C186A/S81A3.71.1170C89A,C186A/H116E11.13.1450C89A,C186A/H116A9.84.9110 Open table in a new tab Unusually Bifurcated Cavity of L-PGDS—Fig. 1C clearly shows that the cavity of L-PGDS has an unusually bifurcated shape and a larger entry than those in other lipocalins. Analysis of the inner accessible surface shows that there are two distinct pockets adjacent to each other. Pocket 1 is located at the middle of the cavity, and pocket 2 is located at a relatively lower part of the cavity. Most of the residues located around the pocket 2 are aromatic and hydrophobic. In contrast, the pocket 1 is surrounded by several polar residues such as Ser or Thr and is more hydrophilic than the pocket 2. The two pockets are separated by residues Tyr-149 and Thr-67. These data indicate that the two binding pockets in the large cavity of L-PGDS should be responsible for the broad ligand specificity of L-PGDS. Molecular Docking Studies—To explore the ligand binding mode, we constructed two molecular models bound to retinoic acid or PGH2. In the retinoic acid-docking model (Fig. 3A), the retinoic acid lies on the β-strand F and G, and the cyclohexene ring of retinoic acid can be placed into the hydrophobic pocket 2. Structural comparison with other retinoid binding lipocalins showed that aromatic residues important for retinoid binding are also conserved in L-PGDS. These aromatic residues, Phe-34, Phe-39, Tyr-105, and Tyr-149, are well defined (the side chain r.m.s.d. values = 0.4–0.7 Å) for L-PGDS and make up the aromatic cluster around the pocket 2 at the bottom of the β-barrel. The distances between these aromatic residues of L-PGDS and the β-ionone ring are within 4 or 5 Å, indicating the relatively strong van der Waals contacts (Fig. 3B). Corresponding distances in the crystal structure of retinoic acid-binding protein-retinoic acid complex (Protein Data Bank code 1EPA) also rang from 3.0 to 4.4 Å. Therefore, the aromatic cluster of L-PGDS, located at the bottom of the pocket 2, is considered to be important for retinoid binding. Both L-PGDS (Kd = 80–150 nm) and retinoic acid-binding protein (Kd = 900 nm) exhibit relatively strong affinity to retinoic acid. In the docking model, an aliphatic side chain of retinoic acid is pointed toward the open entry of the β-barrel. The terminal carboxylate group is located in the vicinity of the positively charged region (β-strand F). This retinoic acid binding model is consistent with the results of NMR titration experiments and mutant analysis. In the PGH2-docking model (Fig. 3C), the PGH2 was in the middle of the cavity, and the cyclopentane ring of PGH2 almost completely occupied pocket 1. In this model the thiol group of Cys-65 is located within a 5-Å distance from the oxygen atoms of the 9,11-endoperoxide group of PGH2 (Fig. 3D), indicating that these atoms are in contact distance with each other. This is consistent with the previously proposed PGH2 reaction mechanism by Urade et al. (11Urade Y. Kim T. Eguchi N. Kikuchi M. Kimura H. Toh H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1422-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the proposed mechanism, conversion of PGH2 is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of the active intrinsic thiol of Cys-65 to the oxygen at C-11 of PGH2. The extrinsic sulfhydryl group withdraws the hydrogen at C-11 to produce PGD2 in the following reaction step. Ser-45, Thr-67, and Ser-81 residues were close to oxygen atoms of the endoperoxide group of PGH2 with distances of about 4 Å (Fig. 3B). Biochemical studies of the cane toad homolog of L-PGDS suggested that these residues may be involved in the recognition of the oxygen atoms of the endoperoxide group of PGH2 (13Irikura D. Kim T. Beuckmann C.T. Aritake K. Schreiber G. Miyano M. Inoue T. Urade Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Present mutant analyses indicated that Thr-67 is the key residue among these residues. The cyclopentane ring and α and ω chains of PGH2 were not fixed in their spatial relationship in solution. However, the α chain, with a negative charge at the carboxyl group, turned on the positive-charged region arising from His-116 and Lys-137 located at the edge of the cavity of L-PGDS. This PGH2 binding model supports that PGH2 binds to the region around the Cys-65 in the catalytic pocket 1, which is suggested by the U-46619 binding experiments. Interestingly, the overall structure of PGH2 in our complex model is similar to the previously reported free form structure of U-46619 in a membrane-mimicking environment (28So S.P. Kim D. Ruan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40679-40685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Non-competitive Inhibition of Retinoic Acid—An overlay of the retinoic acid-docking model and the PGH2-docking model is shown in Fig. 4A. The terminal portions of the aliphatic chain of retinoic acid and the α chain of PGH2 are slightly overlapped (yellow circle). In both binding models of retinoic acid and PGH2, there is a possibility that each of the carboxyl groups competes for His-116. Mutational studies of His-116 revealed that the mutant H116A had a nearly comparable Kd value for retinoic acid but showed about a 2–3-fold higher Km value. These results indicate that His-116 was important for the recognition of PGH2 but not for retinoic acid. This observation prompted us to investigate the inhibition kinetic of L-PGDS by retinoic acid. Lineweaver-Burk plots of L-PGDS activity in the presence of various concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid (Fig. 4C) revealed the unchanged an x axis intercept and an altered y axis, indicating that all-trans-retinoic acid inhibited L-PGDS in a non-competitive manner. Although retinoic acid was bound to L-PGDS with the strong affinity of Kd of 80–150 nm (18Tanaka T. Kim Y. Kimura H. Eguchi N. Nishikawa A. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15789-15795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Inui T. Kim T. Emi M. Irikura D. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2845-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), all-trans-retinoic acid weakly inhibited the L-PGDS activity with the estimated Ki value of 5–6 μm in a non-competitive manner against PGH2; this is consistent with the current docking model (Fig. 3C). These results provide the direct evidence for two binding sites for PGH2 and retinoic acid in the large cavity of L-PGDS. The solution structure described here is in good agreement with the previously reported structural information from the fluorescence quenching assay and mutational studies (19Inui T. Kim T. Emi M. Irikura D. Hayaishi O. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2845-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data revealed that the Trp-43 residue contributed to the fluorescence quenching of L-PGDS upon lipophilic ligand binding. The structure of L-PGDS shows that Trp-43 is located at the bottom of the hydrophobic cavity near pocket 2 and can interact with ligands. L-PGDS can bind various structurally different hydrophobic ligands, such as retinoids (18Tanaka T. Kim Y. Kimura H. Eguchi N. Nishikawa A. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2077460505,"DNA replication is tightly controlled to ensure accurate chromosome duplication and segregation in each cell cycle. Inactivation of Geminin, an inhibitor of origin licensing, leads to re-replication in human tumor cells within the same cell cycle and triggers a G2/M checkpoint. We find that the primary pathway to signal that re-replication has been detected is the ATR kinase and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) clamp complex together with Rad17-RFC clamp loader. ATM kinase and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex do not appear to play significant roles in the checkpoint. Chk1 activation occurs at early stages, whereas Chk2 activation occurs much later. Overall we conclude that ATR/Chk1 pathway is activated at an early time point after the loss of Geminin and contributes to checkpoint arrest essential for the accumulation of re-replicated cells, whereas activation of the ATM/Chk2 pathway is a by-product of DNA re-replication at a later period.

Duplication of chromosomal DNA is a key event in the cell cycle. Cells have developed multiple mechanisms to ensure accurate duplication of genetic materials. In eukaryotes, DNA replication initiates at areas known as replication origins, which are recognized by a six-subunit complex called origin recognition complex (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 2Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 3Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Cdc6 and Cdt1 are then independently recruited at recognition complex-associated origins either in the late mitosis or early G1 phase (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 3Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 4Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MCM2–7 complex is subsequently recruited by Cdc6 and Cdt1 to the replication origins to initiate DNA replication (5Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 6Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P.

Geminin depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, short interfering RNA; ATR, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad-3-related; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; RFC, replication factor C; MRN, Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. can induce DNA re-replication and activate G2/M checkpoint in both human and Drosophila cells (10Melixetian M. Ballabeni A. Masiero L. Gasparini P. Zamponi R. Bartek J. Lukas J. Helin K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 11Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S.

Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that Geminin depletion causes the activation of DNA damage protein kinases ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad-3-related), Chk1, and Chk2 and induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in human colon cancer cells (12Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Abrogation of this checkpoint by ATR depletion leads to apoptosis (12Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus the accumulation of re-replicated cells after Geminin depletion was critically dependent on G2/M checkpoint activation. Because re-replication is expected to lead to gene amplification, we consider it important to understand the re-replication-induced checkpoint pathway. Although not much is known about the sensor proteins involved in the re-replication induced checkpoint pathway, a lot is known about the DNA damage pathways. Studies in yeast and mammals have implied that there are several important proteins working as DNA damage sensors in checkpoint pathways. Rad9, Rad1, Hus1, and Rad17 proteins are required for the checkpoint activation (15O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 16Niida H. Nakanishi M.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 form a heterotrimeric protein complex 9-1-1 and structurally resemble a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like sliding clamp in both yeast and human cells (18Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, Rad17 is a checkpoint protein, which shares homology with replication factor C 1 (RFC1) in structure and associates with four small RFC subunits (RFC2–5) to form a complex related to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp loader (16Niida H. Nakanishi M. Mutagenesis. 2006; 21: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 19Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15233-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rad17 binds to chromatin before DNA damage and recruits Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex in response to DNA damage, probably acting as a clamp loader to load the 9-1-1 complex onto the damage sites. Once the 9-1-1 complex is bound to chromatin, it facilitates the phosphorylation of the substrates (like Chk1 kinase) by ATR (22Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In cells lacking ATR, the Chk1 phosphorylation is blocked (23Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cells with reduced Rad17 or lacking Hus1, this phosphorylation is also inhibited (22Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 24Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Rad17-RFC and 9-1-1 complexes are involved in ATR/Chk1 pathway, whereas Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is implicated to play an important role in ATM/Chk2 pathway (16Niida H. Nakanishi M. Mutagenesis. 2006; 21: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Zhou J. Lim C.U. Li J.J. Cai L. Zhang Y. Cancer Lett. 2006; 243: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). MRN complex was suggested to work in both DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways (26Harrison J.C. Haber J.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 27Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). Upon the induction of double-stranded breaks, MRN complex gets recruited to the proximity of DNA damage sites independent of ATM (28Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and is involved in the initial process of double-stranded breaks because of Mre11 nuclease activity (29D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2238-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MRN complex is suggested to enhance ATM accumulation at damage sites and facilitate ATM activation (16Niida H. Nakanishi M. Mutagenesis. 2006; 21: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 30Carson C.T. Schwartz R.A. Stracker T.H. Lilley C.E. Lee D.V.

Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 34Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Additionally, in vitro studies using either Xenopus extracts or purified human proteins have shown that ATM activation requires MRN complex for its DNA-tethering and ATM-binding ability (36Dupre A. Boyer-Chatenet L. Gautier J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 37Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Collectively, MRN complex is suggested to function as a DNA damage sensor and amplifier for the ATM/Chk2 signaling pathway. Re-replication produces both single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA breaks (10Melixetian M. Ballabeni A. Masiero L. Gasparini P. Zamponi R. Bartek J. Lukas J. Helin K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 13Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and both ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 pathways are activated. To measure the relative importance of the two pathways we therefore decided to check whether the cofactors for ATR or ATM activation in the DNA damage pathways are equally important for the checkpoint activation because of re-replication (Fig. 1). Cell Lines and Drugs—Human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 (p53+/+) was grown in 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in McCoy's 5A modified medium (Cellgro).

Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Rabbit anti-Geminin was raised as described earlier (9Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A.

Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were transferred and blotted with indicated antibodies. FACS Analysis—Cells were collected by trypsinization and fixed with 70% ethanol overnight in –80 °C. Cells were centrifuged and stained with 500 μl of propidium iodide solution (0.05% Non-idet P-40, 50 ng of propidium iodide/ml, and 10 μg of RNaseA/ml) after fixation. The labeled cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer with Cellquest Pro software. Rad9 and Rad17 Proteins Are Required for G2/M Checkpoint Activation after Geminin Depletion—ATR was previously shown by our lab to be crucial in arresting cells in response to re-replication (13Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because 9-1-1 (Rad9-Rad1-Hus1) and Rad17-RFC complexes are known to be important for regulating ATR activity, we chose to address whether one representative member of each complex is involved in the G2/M checkpoint induced by Geminin depletion. RNA interference was performed to silence the expression of either Rad9 or Rad17 protein alone or together with Geminin in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2C, Rad9 or Rad17 protein levels were significantly decreased in cells transfected with Rad9 or Rad17 siRNA but not with the control siRNA (GL2) or Geminin siRNA. In addition, Geminin protein levels were extensively reduced only in cells transfected with Geminin siRNA. Previous results have shown that co-depletion of checkpoint protein (like ATR) and Geminin abrogates checkpoint activation and in turn decreases the accumulation of re-replicated cells because the cells enter mitosis with re-replicated chromosomes and undergo apoptosis (12Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, an easy way to verify the importance of a protein in the checkpoint pathway is to assay the percentage of cells accumulating with >4N DNA content by FACS analysis. Fig. 2B and Table 1 show that knock-down of Rad9 or Rad17 suppressed the accumulation of re-replicated cells after depletion of Geminin. Depletion of Rad9 or Rad17 alone does not have any effect on re-replication. Therefore, both the proteins are likely important in the G2/M checkpoint pathway. Consistent with this, biochemical analysis showed that the activation of checkpoint proteins was decreased in cells where Rad9 or Rad17 proteins were knocked down together with Geminin. Geminin depletion causes Chk1, Chk2 phosphorylation and Cdc2 phosphorylation on Tyr-15 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 6). In addition, the Fanconi anemia core complex gets activated after Geminin depletion and monoubiquitinates FANCD2, activating DNA repair pathways (12Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol.

In the absence of Rad9 or Rad17 proteins, phosphorylation of Chk1, inhibitory phosphorylation on Cdc2, and monoubiquitination of FANCD2 were decreased after Geminin depletion (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 8). Therefore both Rad9 and Rad17 proteins are independently required for the checkpoint activation after re-replication.TABLE 1Percentage of re-replication after indicated siRNACheckpoint protein knocked down in columns 4 and 5GL2 RNAiGEM RNAiCheckpoint protein RNAiCheckpoint protein + GEM RNAiRad9 knockdown5.57 ± 1.0952.93 ± 2.516.65 ± 0.5425.46 ± 1.97Rad17 knockdown4.73 ± 1.6849.85 ± 0.887.43 ± 0.7324.14 ± 4.00Mre11 knockdown3.94 ± 0.3156.60 ± 1.253.44 ± 0.1655.06 ± 1.59ATM knockdown3.43 ± 0.4652.38 ± 2.336.03 ± 1.1552.69 ± 3.44 Open table in a new tab Mre11 and ATM Are Not Required for Checkpoint Pathway and Over-replication in Geminin-depleted Cells—It was shown previously that both single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA breaks are generated during DNA re-replication (13Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because double-stranded DNA breaks activate ATM (26Harrison J.C. Haber J.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), we wanted to test whether ATM is required for the checkpoint activation and accumulation of re-replicated cells. Furthermore, MRN complex is implicated to be the DNA damage sensor for detecting double-stranded DNA breaks. We decided to choose Mre11 protein as a representative member of the complex to test the requirement of the complex for the checkpoint activation upon Geminin depletion. In Fig. 3B, either Mre11 or ATM protein levels were notably reduced in cells treated with the corresponding siRNA. Surprisingly, the accumulation of re-replicated cells was not affected by depletion of either Mre11 or ATM together with Geminin protein (Fig. 3A and Table 1). Consistent with the FACS results, Chk1 activation and Cdc2 phosphorylation on Tyr-15 were not influenced by the co-depletion of Mre11 or ATM (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 8). Additionally, FANCD2 monoubiquitination was not changed. Although the percentage of re-replicated cells did not change after co-depletion, Chk2 phosphorylation on Thr-68 was significantly decreased (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 8). This is consistent with the previous reports that ATM and MRN are required for the activation of Chk2 (33Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 35Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 37Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 39Girard P.M. Riballo E. Begg A.C. Waugh A. Jeggo P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It also suggests that ATM and Mre11 knockdowns have sufficiently decreased the corresponsive protein levels to deregulate their functions. Together, these data suggest that the ATM/MRN pathway is not involved to induce G2/M arrest and re-replication after Geminin depletion. Chk1 Is Required for Chk2 Activation after Geminin Depletion—To our surprise, Chk2 phosphorylation on Thr-68, which is normally a consequence of ATM activation (16Niida H. Nakanishi M. Mutagenesis. 2006; 21: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 34Blasina A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), was similarly reduced after co-depletion of Geminin and Rad9 or Rad17 (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 8). This could be either a direct or an indirect result because of the decrease of ATR activity. To distinguish the two possibilities, we performed siRNA against Chk1, the downstream substrate of ATR, together with Geminin and examined Chk2 activation. If ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 pathways work in parallel, and the reduction in Chk2 activation is simply because of the cross-talk between the two pathways, Chk1 depletion will not affect Chk2 activation. Otherwise, ATM/Chk2 pathway can be probably located downstream of ATR/Chk1 pathway. In Fig. 4, Chk1 protein level was significantly decreased in cells treated with the siRNA. After Geminin depletion, Chk2 was activated and phosphorylated on Thr-68 (Fig. 4, lane 2). However, the phosphorylation was reduced without the presence of Chk1. The results suggested Chk1 activation is probably upstream of Chk2 activation. Additionally, instead of functioning in parallel and overlapping with each other, ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 pathways might work together after Geminin depletion. Chk1 Is Activated Earlier in Re-replication whereas Chk2 Activation Occurs at Later Stages—As shown above, the Rad9/ATR/Chk1 pathway is required for the accumulation of re-replicated cells but MRN/ATM/Chk2 is not. In addition, Chk1 activation is possibly upstream of Chk2 activation. We wondered whether Chk2 activation was truly a later event in cells undergoing re-replication. Around 18 h after Geminin siRNA transfection, a G2/M cell cycle arrest was observed, and there was a little more re-replication in Geminin-depleted cells compared with control siRNA (GL2)-treated cells (Fig. 5A). 24 h after the knockdown, a more obvious G2/M arrest was observed in Geminin knockdown cells, and the percentage of re-replicated cells increased further. The phosphorylation of Chk1 protein at these two time points was similar (Fig. 5B). However, Chk2 protein phosphorylation was not notably seen until 30 h after the siRNA transfection, when 32.5% of re-replication was detectable in the cells in the population. In summary, Chk1 was activated around the time of G2/M cell cycle arrest and before the immense accumulation of re-replicated cells, whereas convincing Chk2 activation was observed relatively late, much after the significant accumulation of re-replicated cells. The loss of Geminin in human cancer cells causes a G2/M checkpoint activation and DNA re-replication. In this paper, we demonstrate that Rad9 and Rad17 proteins are both required for the checkpoint activation and accumulation of re-replicated cells. The downstream substrate Chk1 in the same pathway is phosphorylated probably before the huge accumulation of re-replicated cells. Nevertheless neither Mre11 nor ATM is necessary in this process. The Chk2 protein, normally activated in an ATM-dependent manner (16Niida H. Nakanishi M. Mutagenesis. 2006; 21: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), is activated comparatively late in the process. Geminin is an inhibitor of Cdt1, a pre-replicative complex component (7Lygerou Z. Nurse P. Science. 2000; 290: 2271-2273PubMed Google Scholar, 8McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 9Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A.

Cell. 2001; 106: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). After Geminin depletion in mammalian cells, an extra round of DNA replication is initiated, and cells with greater than G2 DNA content appear. Generally, the activation of ATR and Chk1 is considered as a consequence of the formation of single-stranded DNA, whereas the ATM and Chk2 activation is observed more in cells with double-stranded DNA breaks (41Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The generation of single-stranded DNA in the re-replicated cells might therefore account for the induction of the G2/M checkpoint mediated by ATR, Rad9-Rad1-Hus1, and Rad17-RFC. DNA re-replication continues as the cells are arrested in G2/M phase. Upon further re-replication, more forks collapse, which possibly produces double-stranded DNA breaks together with single-stranded DNA. During the process, the MRN complex probably works as a sensor for the double-stranded DNA breaks and as an amplifier to activate ATM and in turn Chk2 kinase. Additionally, the Mre11 nuclease might help to process the double-stranded breaks to single-stranded DNA and contribute to the ATR-regulated pathway. The ATM/MRN/Chk2 pathway activation is therefore a by-product of the accumulated re-replication that amplifies the downstream signals (inhibition of Cdc25c and Cdc2) for checkpoint activation, but is not the major determinant for the accumulation of re-replicated cells (Fig. 6). A primary role of ATR/Chk1 in the G2/M checkpoint activation following re-replication is consistent with previous studies in Drosophila, Xenopus, and human colon cancer cells. In Drosophila, Chk2 inactivation does not create an immense change on Geminin deficiency-induced re-replication (11Mihaylov I.S. Kondo T. Jones L. Ryzhikov S. Tanaka J. Zheng J. Higa L.A. Minamino N. Cooley L. Zhang H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, depletion of Geminin causes a Chk1-dependent G2 arrest (14McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In human cancer cells, co-depletion of Chk2 does not produce a significant effect on the accumulation of re-replicated cells after Geminin silencing as compared with Chk1 co-depletion (12Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Despite the distinctive functions of ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 in DNA damage checkpoint, there is plenty of evidence showing cross-talk between the two pathways (27Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar), which means that either Chk1 or Chk2 can be the substrate of both ATM and ATR proteins. We speculate that at the early time point after Geminin depletion, the ATR activation signal induced by single-stranded DNA has not reached the threshold to result in noteworthy phosphorylation of Chk2. As cells were arrested by G2/M checkpoint, more DNA re-replication occurred, and the ATR activation signal was amplified and joined by the ATM activation signal to eventually activate Chk2. Thus although the ATR and ATM kinases respond to DNA damage and activate both Chk1 and Chk2, our results suggest that the lesions caused initially by re-replication are primarily the generation of small-stranded DNA leading to the preferential activation of ATR and Chk1. Given the many reports of activation of p53 after the overactivity of Cdt1 and Cdc6 (42Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol.

Moon E. Burack W.R. Pandita T.K. Choi K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 8176-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), our results also suggest a hierarchical process of checkpoint activity leading to the activation of p53. The ATR/Chk1 pathway initially causes the G2/M arrest that allows re-replication to continue. At later stages of re-replication, fork collapse and replication across single-stranded nicks (on a template with unligated Okazaki fragments) create double-stranded DNA breaks that activate ATM/Chk2 and p53. Such a graduated response to re-replication would give the cell a chance to repair minor degrees of transient re-replication during the G2 phase although reserving the use of p53 to induce apoptosis only when there is extensive and pro-longed re-replication. We thank the members of Dr. Dutta's lab, particularly Dr. Wenge Zhu and Dr. Sara Hook, for their help and advice."
https://openalex.org/W2000092485,"The sodium-dependent glutamate transporter, excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1), has been implicated in the regulation of excitatory signaling and prevention of cell death in the nervous system. There is evidence that EAAC1 constitutively cycles on and off the plasma membrane and that under steady state conditions up to 80% of the transporter is intracellular. As is observed with other neurotransmitter transporters, the activity of EAAC1 is regulated by a variety of molecules, and some of these effects are associated with redistribution of EAAC1 on and off the plasma membrane. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that a structural component of lipid rafts, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), may participate in EAAC1 trafficking. Using C6 glioma cells as a model system, co-expression of Cav-1 S80E (a dominant-negative variant) or small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of caveolin-1 reduced cell surface expression of myc epitope-tagged EAAC1 or endogenous EAAC1, respectively. Cav-1 S80E slowed the constitutive delivery and endocytosis of myc-EAAC1. In primary cultures derived from caveolin-1 knock-out mice, a similar reduction in delivery and internalization of endogenous EAAC1 was observed. We also found that caveolin-1, caveolin-2, or Cav-1 S80E formed immunoprecipitable complexes with EAAC1 in C6 glioma and/or transfected HEK cells. Together, these data provide strong evidence that caveolin-1 contributes to the trafficking of EAAC1 on and off the plasma membrane and that these effects are associated with formation of EAAC1-caveolin complexes.

First, although initial studies showed no abnormalities in EAAC1-deficient mice, more recent studies have demonstrated that these animals develop age-dependent neurodegeneration attributed to depletion of glutathione and consequent oxidative injury (1Peghini P.

Second, antisense-mediated knock-down of EAAC1 results in mild excitotoxicity and a seizure-like phenotype that apparently arises from decreased synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (3Rothstein J.D.

Fourth, preliminary studies suggest that knock-down of EAAC1 in the hippocampus followed by high frequency stimulation evokes long-term depression instead of long-term potentiation, and may impair learning in the Morris water maze (6Beckman M.L.

Several studies have provided evidence that the activity and cell surface expression of EAAC1 can be rapidly regulated (for reviews, see Refs. 7Nieoullon A. Canolle B. Masmejean F. Guillet B.

In vivo, a substantial amount of EAAC1 immunoreactivity is observed in intracellular compartments (15Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W.

Cortex. 1998; 8: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), consistent with the possibility that an intracellular pool of EAAC1 is available for redistribution to the plasma membrane in the intact nervous system. In fact, long-term potentiation or contextual fear conditioning increase the amount of EAAC1 observed in a subcellular fraction enriched in plasma membranes (18Levenson J. Weeber E. Selcher J.C.

These studies provide strong evidence that EAAC1 trafficking is regulated and support the notion that EAAC1 trafficking may be important for synaptic plasticity. Morphologically, caveolae are 50–100-nm plasma membrane invaginations observed in different cell types including adipocytes, endothelial cells, muscle cells, and fibroblasts. The members of the caveolin gene family are caveolin-1, -2, and -3. Interestingly, neurons express all three caveolins but lack morphologically defined caveolae (for review, see Ref. 20Head B.P. Insel P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Traditionally caveolae have been associated with endocytosis, but more recently caveolin has also been implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including targeting of proteins, assembly/organization of signaling complexes, and lipid transport (for reviews, see Refs. 21Smart E.J.

Plasma membrane transporters appear to be regulated by caveolae/lipid rafts. The glutamate transporter EAAT2 is highly enriched in lipid rafts, and EAAT2 cell surface expression and activity are decreased by the disruption of these microdomains (25Butchbach M.E. Tian G.

Pharmacological disruption of lipid rafts inhibits the PKC-dependent redistribution of serotonin transporters from the plasma membrane to an intracellular compartment (27Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J.

In preliminary studies, we found that depletion or disruption of cholesterol increased EAAC1 cell surface expression and slowed endocytosis, implicating caveolae/lipid rafts in EAAC1 internalization (28González M.I.

Because some studies have provided evidence that caveolin may play a key role in endocytosis of other membrane proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 29Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 30Parton R.G. Richards A.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 31Razani B. Woodman S.E.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), we decided to pursue the hypothesis that caveolin might participate in trafficking of EAAC1. In the present study, the effects of dominant-negative variants, siRNA-mediated knock-down, and knock-out of caveolin-1 on steady state cell surface expression, delivery, and internalization of EAAC1 were examined. Based on these analyses, we conclude that caveolin facilitates both the constitutive delivery and internalization of EAAC1. We also provide evidence that caveolin interacts with EAAC1, suggesting that this interaction may participate in the regulation of EAAC1 trafficking by caveolin. Materials—Sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin), sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin), Ultralink® immobilized monomeric avidin beads, and the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent kit were purchased from Pierce. The affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-EAAC1 antibody and the corresponding antigenic peptide were obtained from Alpha Diagnostics International (ADI, San Antonio, TX). A second anti-EAAC1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein (Johns Hopkins University). The anti-caveolin-1 and anti-caveolin-2 mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The anti-transferrin receptor antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The rabbit anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The protein G-agarose beads were obtained from Invitrogen. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Mes-sodium salt (MesNa) were purchased from Sigma. Silencer® pre-designed siRNA for rat caveolin-1 (siRNA numbers 53737 and 56643), GAPDH Silencer (catalog number 4624), Silencer Cy3-labeled Negative Control number 1, and Negative Control number 1 siRNA were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). TransIT-TKO® transfection regent was purchased from Mirus BioCorporation (Madison, WI). cDNA Constructs—The myc-EAAC1 plasmid was obtained by subcloning EAAC1 into the pCMV-Myc expression vector from Clontech after addition of XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites to the full-length rat EAAC1 cDNA by PCR using the appropriate primers. Myc-tagged variants of the human homologs of wild type and caveolin-1 S80E cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey E. Pessin (Stony Brook University, New York, NY) (33Shigematsu S. Watson R.T.

A cDNA encoding the rat homolog of caveolin-1 was obtained from Open Biosystems (clone 7125390, accession number CK476444) and used as a template to produce mutant variants of caveolin-1. This cDNA was amplified with oligos designed to introduce XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites outside the coding region and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The point mutation of Ser80 to Glu80 was prepared using QuikChange (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Caveolin-1 Δ80, a NH2-terminal truncation of caveolin-1, was obtained by PCR using a 5′-primer that eliminates the 80 amino-terminal amino acids of caveolin-1. This primer also inserted the coding sequence for methionine at position 1. The sequences of all constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Cultures—C6 glioma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as previously described (9Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. This cell line endogenously expresses EAAC1 and none of the other subtypes of glutamate transporters (9Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293T were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured similarly. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, except the defined fetal bovine serum that was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). C6 glioma were transfected using genePORTER reagent (GTS, San Diego, CA) as previously described (34Kalandadze A. Wu Y. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45741-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HEK-293T cells were transfected using the CalPhos transfection kit (Clontech) according to manufacturer's specifications. Neuron/Astrocyte-mixed Cultures—Caveolin-1 knock-out mice and genetic F1 control mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (strain: Cav1tm1Mls/J, stock number 004585) and bred in the animal facility of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Embryos (day 17–19) were removed from pregnant control and knock-out mice bred in parallel. After dissection and removal of the meninges and blood vessels, cortical tissue was incubated with trypsin for 25 min at 37 °C with intermittent agitation. After gentle trituration, 4 ml of cell suspension (400,000 cells/ml) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media supplemented with 1× B27, 10% fetal bovine serum, 6 g/liter glucose, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin onto a 6-cm dish that had been precoated with poly-d-lysine. Cultures were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. After 2 days, the media was exchanged with Neurobasal media containing 1× B27, 0.5 mml-glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cultures were fed with a one-fifth medium exchange every 3–4 days and used after 12 days in vitro. Caveolin-1 Knock-down by siRNA—C6 cells plated on 6-cm plates were transfected with the corresponding siRNA using transIT-TKO transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. In these experiments each siRNA was used at a final concentration of 100 nm, and cells were used 48 h after transfection. In initial experiments, Silencer Cy3-labeled Negative Control number 1 was used to assess the efficiency of transfection by visual inspection. Using nuclear staining to estimate the number of cells, transfection efficiency was at least 90%. The efficiency of caveolin-1 knock-down was determined by Western blot. Expression of actin was also examined to determine whether these siRNAs have nonspecific effects on protein expression and to control for gel loading. Measurement of EAAC1 Cell Surface Expression by Biotinylation—EAAC1 cell surface expression was measured as previously described (9Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M.

C6 glioma cells (grown in 10-cm dishes) or primary cultures (grown in 6-cm dishes) were first rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mm Ca2+ and 1.0 mm Mg2+ (PBS Ca2+/Mg2+), then cells were incubated with 2 ml (C6 cells) or 1 ml (primary cultures) of biotin solution (sulfo-NH-S-biotin at 1 mg/ml in PBS Ca2+/Mg2+) for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After two rinses with PBS Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine, plates were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C to quench unreacted biotin. Finally, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate containing protease inhibitors, including 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 250 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm iodoacetamide) for 1 h at 4 °C. After scraping, lysates were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min. An aliquot of cell lysate was saved and mixed with an equal volume of 4× Laemmli buffer (240 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol) for further analysis as the “lysate fraction.” A second aliquot of cell lysate was incubated with an equal volume of Ultralink avidin-conjugated beads. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, supernatant containing non-biotinylated proteins (“intracellular fraction”) was recovered by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min and mixed with an equivalent volume of 4× Laemmli buffer. Beads containing the biotinylated (“cell surface proteins”) fraction were washed once with RIPA buffer, twice with a high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5), and once with a no salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Finally, beads were incubated with 2× Laemmli buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing biotinylated proteins was saved for further analysis. The dilutions of all three fractions were the same so that the sum of the immunoreactivity found in the biotinylated and non-biotinylated fractions would equal that observed in the lysate fraction if the yield from extraction is 100%. Fractions were stored at–20 °C. The amount of protein in the lysate was determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Measurement of EAAC1 Delivery to the Plasma Membrane— Cells were incubated in PBS containing biotin (4 ml for C6 cells and 2 ml for primary cultures at 1 mg/ml) at 37 °C as previously described (14Fournier K.M.

It is generally assumed that these conditions are permissive for normal intracellular trafficking (38Royle S.J. Murell-Lagnado R.D. Bioessays. 2002; 25: 39-46Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After different periods of time, cells were immediately cooled to 4 °C by washing the monolayer with ice-cold PBS Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine to both halt protein trafficking and quench unreacted biotin. In parallel, a control plate was incubated with ice-cold biotin (4 ml for C6 cells and 2 ml for primary cultures) for 30 min to quantify the amount of biotinylated transporter at the plasma membrane at time (t) = 0 min. Extraction of biotinylated transporters was performed as described above. Previous studies have shown that the changes in biotinylated material do not result from the biotinylation of intracellular proteins due to the entrance of biotinylating reagent via endocytosis or pinocytosis (14Fournier K.M. González M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol.

Int. 2006; 48: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The acylation reaction between the biotinylating reagent and primary amines of cell surface proteins is thought to be quite fast relative to the rate of typical endocytic events (Refs. 40Miller B.T. Collins T.J. Rogers M.E. Kurosky A. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and 41Morpurgo M. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. J. Biochem. Biophys.

Int. 2006; 48: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it is theoretically possible that some fraction of transporters could transit through the plasma membrane without being biotinylated, therefore the rate of delivery measured with this technique may represent an underestimate of the true rate. Measurement of EAAC1 Endocytosis Using Reversible Biotinylation—Reversible biotinylation was performed as previously described (14Fournier K.M. González M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol.

Cell surface proteins were biotinylated with the disulfide-containing reagent (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) and quenched as described above. Cells were rapidly rinsed with ice-cold PBS and ice-cold culture media. Except where indicated, they were then rinsed once with warmed (37 °C) culture media and then incubated in cell culture media for varying periods of time. Under these conditions, proteins undergo endocytosis. To halt internalization, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold sodium-Tris (NT) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.6). Biotin was “stripped” from cell surface proteins by incubating the cells twice for 25 min at 4 °C with the membrane impermeant disulfide reducing reagent, MesNa (50 mm, freshly dissolved in NT buffer). Two controls were used in each experiment. A plate of cells was incubated with NT buffer without MesNa to measure total surface expression of EAAC1. A second plate was used to control for the efficiency of stripping. These cells were not re-warmed prior to incubation with MesNa, and this sample was labeled as “0 min.” All stripping occurred at the same time. Biotinylated proteins were batch extracted as described above. We used a variety of reagents and different concentrations of these reagents, including glutathione, Bond-Breaker™ TCEP solution, or MesNa. The maximal stripping observed (without re-warming) was 70–80%. The amount of transporter internalized at various times was calculated by subtracting the amount of biotinylated transporter observed at time = 0 after stripping (no re-warming) from the amount of biotinylated transporter observed after various periods of re-warming. This was expressed as a percentage of the amount of un-stripped transporter subtracted from the total amount of biotinylated transporter. These data were fit to a first-order decay process. Because the un-stripped pool of EAAC1 is also likely internalized, the rate calculated under these conditions is an underestimate of the rate of endocytosis. With the comparisons conducted (Cav-1 WT versus Cav-1 S80E or control versus caveolin-1 knock-out cultures), the percentage of strip was not significantly different between groups (see figure legends). Therefore, the differences in rates of endocytosis observed in the present study are independent of the artifact introduced by incomplete strip. Immunoprecipitation—C6 or HEK-293T cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of the RIPA buffer (see above) modified to contain only 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and no SDS. Plates were agitated on a rotating orbiter for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g to remove cell debris. Lysates were pre-cleared with 40 μl of protein G-agarose beads and gentle shaking for 1 h at 4°C. Approximately 1 mg of cell lysate protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μgof affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-EAAC1 antibody (ADI). Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with 25 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C and washed four times with lysis buffer. Finally, immunoprecipitated proteins were released in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer by boiling at 90–95 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western Blot—For biotinylation experiments, ∼25 μgof total cell lysate and equivalent volumes of the biotinylated and the non-biotinylated fractions were loaded on 8% gels. Immunoprecipitated proteins were loaded on 12% gels, and an aliquot of cell lysate was used as a positive control. After samples were resolved, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked by incubation in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The dilutions of the primary antibodies were anti-caveolin-1 (1:200), anti-caveolin 2 (1:100), anti-EAAC1 (1:75), and anti-transferrin receptor (1:100). After incubation with the primary antibody, immunoreactive proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence. All Western blots were exposed for different periods of time to ensure signal linearity. Immunoreactivity was quantified using NIH Image after scanning the films. When probing the Western blots for EAAC1 immunoreactivity bands are observed at ∼66 kDa (monomer) and ∼220 kDa (multimer) (9Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); these larger molecular mass bands are thought to represent irreversibly aggregated multimers (42Haugeto Ø. Ullensveng K. Levy L.M.

In experiments where both bands are observed, each band was quantified. Although results presented represent the sum of the immunoreactivity observed in both bands, in no case did the monomers or multimers respond differently. The amount of transporter immunoreactivity observed in each fraction was expressed as a percentage of the immunoreactivity in the corresponding control. The percentage of actin found in the biotinylated fraction is expressed as a percentage of the immunoreactivity found in the lysate. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. and compared using ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis or Student's t test.

https://openalex.org/W2088424911,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase enzyme is required for the integration of viral DNA into the host cell chromosome. Integrase complex assembly and subsequent strand transfer catalysis are mediated by specific interactions between integrase and bases at the end of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). The strand transfer reaction can be blocked by the action of small molecule inhibitors, thought to bind in the vicinity of the viral LTR termini. This study examines the contributions of the terminal four bases of the nonprocessed strand (G2T1C–1A–2) of the HIV LTR on complex assembly, specific strand transfer activity, and inhibitor binding. Base substitutions and abasic replacements at the LTR terminus provided a means to probe the importance of each nucleotide on the different functions. An approach is described wherein the specific strand transfer activity for each integrase/LTR variant is derived by normalizing strand transfer activity to the concentration of active sites. The key findings of this study are as follows. 1) The G2:C2 base pair is necessary for efficient assembly of the complex and for maintenance of an active site architecture, which has high affinity for strand transfer inhibitors. 2) Inhibitor-resistant enzymes exhibit greatly increased sensitivity to LTR changes. 3) The strand transfer and inhibitor binding defects of a Q148R mutant are due to a decreased affinity of the complex for magnesium. 4) Gln148 interacts with G2, T1, and C–1 at the 5′ end of the viral LTR, with these four determinants playing important and overlapping roles in assembly, strand transfer catalysis and high affinity inhibitor binding.

As such, integration presents an attractive target for the development of small molecule inhibitors that could be used to treat HIV. Several integrase (IN) inhibitors that are progressing through clinical development (2Markowitz M. Kim J.O. Nguyen B.Y. Kovacs C.M. Steigbigel R.T. Cooper D.A. Liporace R. Schwartz R. Isaacs R.

The virus-encoded IN protein catalyzes two essential activities in the viral life cycle, 3′-processing and strand transfer. The 3′-processing reaction cleaves off the final two bases (5′-GT dinucleotide) from the 3′ ends of the viral LTR. The strand transfer activity catalyzes the concerted insertion of the two viral 3′ ends into the host genome with a 5-bp separation. To accomplish this, IN simultaneously positions the two 3′-hydroxyls of the LTRs for nucleophilic attack onto the phosphodiester bonds of the genomic DNA (4Engelman A. Kim K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In vitro, both reactions are catalyzed by divalent magnesium or manganese, although magnesium is thought to be the actual metal cofactor in cells (5Kulkosky J. Kim A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 61: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Suitable in vitro systems for studying these processes have been described, in which the full-length protein is minimally required to direct both 3′-processing and strand transfer (6Sherman P.A. Kim J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Bushman F.D. Kim T. Craigie R. Science. 1990; 249: 1555-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In these systems, IN is typically allowed to form an in situ complex with a model DNA substrate mimicking a viral LTR end, which then undergoes 3′-processing. The product of the 3′-processing reaction remains bound to IN, forming a strand transfer IN-DNA complex, which is then set up for subsequent strand transfer with a target DNA. In practice, the same synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides that mimic the U3 and U5 termini of retroviral DNA are often used for both steps in the same reaction, and the products are then separated by gel electrophoresis and quantified by imaging software. The minimal complex thought to be capable of catalyzing strand transfer in vitro is a dimer, although in cells concerted integration of both ends is thought to proceed through a tetrameric complex (8Faure A.

The assembly of IN onto the viral LTR stimulates the high affinity binding of strand transfer inhibitors, suggesting that the binding pocket for these inhibitors is derived from a specific structural arrangement of the nucleoprotein complex (16Pommier Y.

However, no x-ray crystal structures are available yet on the specific arrangement of the LTR at the HIV IN active site, although a number of structural models have been proposed (19Chen A. Kim I.T.

The objective of this study was to determine the individual contributions of each of the four terminal bases at the 5′ end of the pre-processed U5 LTR on HIV IN assembly, specific strand transfer activity, and strand transfer inhibitor binding, under conditions where assembly and strand transfer activity were decoupled. Next, we sought to understand if these processes were affected by mutations in the IN protein which confer resistance to IN strand transfer inhibitors. These studies indicate that the 5′-GTCA bases play important and differential roles in strand transfer complex assembly, strand transfer catalysis, and high affinity inhibitor binding. These studies also confirm a central role for Gln148 in assembly, strand transfer catalysis, and inhibitor binding. Reagents—Compound 1 and [3H]compound 1 (specific activity 28.6 cpm/fmol, 0.96 × 106 cpm/μl) were prepared by the Medicinal Chemistry Department, Bristol-Myers Squibb. Oligonucleotides were prepared by Sigma Genosys (Woodlands, TX). Scintillation proximity beads were from Amersham Biosciences. The d-spacer and aminopurine monomers were from Glen Research, Sterling, VA. Purification of HIV IN Enzymes—Recombinant IN enzymes were derived from an NL4-3 clone. The mutant enzymes used in this study were Q148R and N155H, reflective of their amino acid substitutions compared with the WT NL4-3 enzyme. Mutant enzymes were constructed through site-specific mutagenesis of the NL4-3 WT IN enzyme using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were checked for accuracy by subsequent sequence analysis. Induction and purification of active enzyme were carried out as follows. A pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing the NL4-3 HIV IN gene was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). Cells were induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside during the exponential growth phase (OD = 0.6), incubated for 3–4 h, harvested, and stored frozen. Cell pellets from 6 liters of cells were thawed and lysed with 400 ml of Lysis Buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.25% CHAPS), sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for an additional 30 min to remove residual cloudy material and then applied to a 5-ml HiTrap chelating FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+ and equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole). The column was sequentially washed with 20 ml of Buffer A, 50 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 60 mm imidazole, and 30 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. IN was eluted with a 120-ml gradient of 150–600 mm imidazole in Buffer A with 10% (v/v) glycerol. Dithiothreitol and glycerol were added to each fraction to final concentrations of 2 mm and 15% (v/v), respectively. Purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and the activity of the enzyme was measured by the in vitro strand transfer reaction. Fractions were frozen and stored at –80 °C. Yields from a 6-liter culture were typically 50 –70 mg of IN at greater than 95% purity. LTR Duplexes—The 5′ end of the plus strand was synthesized with a biotin linker attached. Abasic sites in oligonucleotides were engineered by substitution with a hydrolytically stable replacement of the deoxyribose base by a furanyl derivative. (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). Duplex LTRs were prepared as follows: 25 μl of the plus strand DNA (96 μm in TE) and 30 μlof the minus strand DNA (96 μm in TE) were combined with 145 μl of TE and annealed at 80 °C for 4 min and then allowed to slowly cool to 20 °C over a 60-min period. Determination of Strand Transfer Activity and Inhibition—The in vitro activities of purified INs complexed with the various duplex LTRs were measured through a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). In a first step, the viral LTR duplexes are prepared by annealing individual oligonucleotides. The viral (donor) LTR DNA is then attached, via a 5′-biotin linker on the plus strand, to streptavidin-coated SPA PVT beads (Amersham Biosciences) as follows. SPA PVT beads (10 mg) were suspended in 0.2 ml of PBS. The suspension was then centrifuged at <5000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended with 0.2 ml of PBS, 0.85 m NaCl, and 21 μl of 12 μm duplex HIV LTR DNA. The sequences of the duplexes are as follows, except for the variations in the underlined bases which are noted in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4: plus strand, 5′-biotin-ACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA; minus strand, 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAG. The LTR DNA was allowed to bind for 60 min at room temperature with gentle rocking, after which time 0.8 ml of TE was added. The mixture was then centrifuged at <5000 × g and resuspended in 0.8 ml of TE, 50 mm NaCl. The beads were washed four additional times with TE, 50 mm NaCl, each time centrifuging to remove unbound viral LTR DNA. The final pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of PBS and stored at 4 °C before use. Enzyme complexes for 80 strand transfer reactions were prepared as follows: 0.15 ml of bead-DNA complexes, 2.25 ml of SPA buffer (13.3 mm dithiothreitol, 32 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.067% Nonidet P-40, 6.4% polyethylene glycol, 25.6 mm MgCl2, 12.8% (v/v) Me2SO, and 100 mm NaCl), and IN (37 μgof WT, 88 μg of N155H, and 36 μg of Q148R) were incubated at 37 °C. After 1.5 h, complexes were pelleted and resuspended with 2.4 ml of SPA buffer. The proper amount of each IN was determined through titration experiments and represented the minimal amount of enzyme required to produce the maximal amount of strand transfer products. The target DNA was prepared (5′-[33P]TGACCAAGGGCTAATTCACT-3′ annealed to 5′-[33P]AGTGAATTAGCCCTTGGTCA-3′) in a separate step by individually 5′ end labeling each of the oligonucleotides with [γ-33P]ATP. The 33P-labeled oligonucleotides were then annealed to form the target duplex DNA. Strand transfer assays consisted of combining 30 μl of IN complexes with 10 μl of 25% Me2SO/H2O) (v/v) in white microtiter plates (catalog number 3600, Corning Glass). After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, 10 μl of 33P-labeled target DNA (1 × 106 cpm) was added (final concentration of target was 0.92 nm). Plates were returned to 37 °C for 2 h, after which time the strand transfer reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of PBS, 50 mm EDTA. Plates were allowed to stand overnight before reading on a Topcount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) scintillation counter. HIV-1 IN complexes were evaluated for inhibitor sensitivity using the SPA assay, except that 10 μl of a 5-fold serial dilution of compound 1 in 25% (v/v) Me2SO/H2O was added in the place of 10 μl of 25% (v/v) Me2SO/H2O. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego) by fitting to a sigmoidal dose-response curve.TABLE 1Effects of changes to the U5 LTR on HIV IN strand transfer activity and the binding of [3H]compound 1 to HIV IN complexesRowLTRStrand transfer activity3H-Inhibitor 1 binding1GTCA++++++2GTCT++++++3GTCC++++++4GTCACA++++++5GTCAGT++++++6GT_--7GTGA++++++8GTGT++++9GTTC++++10GTGC++++11GTAA+++12GTAG++13GTAT++14GTAC++15GCCA++++++16GACA+++++17GGCA++18GACA/CT-+19ATCA++++20TTCA+++21CTCA+++22GTCA/CC++++23GTCA/CG+++24GTCA/CT++25GTCA/CddC-+++26GTCA/C_-+ Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Relative strand transfer activities, assembly, and [3H]compound 1 binding to WT, N155H, and Q148R IN complexes assembled with LTR variantsWT integraseN155H integraseQ148R integraseRowLTRRelative ST activityRelative [3H]compound 1 affinityRelative complexes (Bmax)Relative specific ST activityRelative ST activityRelative [3H]compound 1 affinityRelative complexes (Bmax)Relative specific ST activityRelative ST activity[3H]compound 1 affinityRelative complexes (Bmax)Relative specific ST activity1GTCA10010010010084101038226328932GTC-109591091009048410719523833GT-d-A32377742171248352.52*≤5≥504G-d-CA704068103332153620.632235d-TCA1015156722*≤5≥40————6TTCA4082615441*≤5≥2041*≤5≥807INTCA4562271672321171350.62*≤5≥128ApTCA22454022*≤5≥400.40.5*≤5≥89G-d-C-10365419NDNDNDNDNDNDNDND10G-d- d-A1353630.69183———— Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Relative strand transfer (ST) activities, assembly, and [3H]compound 1 binding to WT IN complexes assembled with LTR variants at C-1RowLTRRelative ST activityRelative [3H]compound 1 affinityRelative complexes (Bmax)Relative specific ST activity1GTCA1001001001002GTGA9074661363GTTA8651601434GT-d-A323777425GTAA28225452 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Relative strand transfer (ST) activities, assembly, and [3H]compound 1 binding to WT IN complexes assembled with LTR variants at T1RowLTRRelative ST activityRelative [3H]compound 1 affinityRelative complexes (Bmax)Relative specific ST activity1GTCA1001001001002G-d-CA7040681033GACA623564974GGCA5186685GInCA702861115 Open table in a new tab Determination of Dissociation Constants (Kd) and Bmax Values for [3H]Compound 1—Compound 1 (Fig. 1A) is a specific HIV IN inhibitor, with an IC50 in the in vitro strand transfer reaction of 15 nm. A tritiated version of 1 was used to quantify the binding toward WT and mutant IN enzymes assembled with the various LTRs. Reactions were carried out in white 96-well microtiter plates containing 40 μl of pre-formed IN complexes, prepared as described above. A dilution series of [3H]compound 1 was prepared (in SPA buffer), and 10 μlof each dilution was added to separate wells, in duplicate. Microtiter plates were shaken for 3 h to allow complete binding of 1 to the enzyme-SPA bead complex. Binding was measured on a Topcount scintillation counter. Kd and Bmax values were calculated by fitting the data to a one-site binding curve using GraphPad Prism version 4.03. Calculation of Relative Strand Transfer Activities, Assembly, and [3H]Compound 1 Binding to WT IN Complexes—Relative strand transfer activities are expressed as a percent of that observed with complexes assembled using WT IN and the WT LTR. [3H]Compound 1 affinity is expressed as a percentage of the association constant Ka (Ka = 1/Kd) for binding to variant complexes, relative to that observed with complexes assembled using WT enzyme and WT LTR. The relative concentrations of complexes are derived from the maximal binding of [3H]compound 1 (Bmax), relative to that of [3H]compound 1 binding to complexes assembled using WT IN and a WT LTR. The relative specific activity is defined as the relative strand transfer activity/relative concentration of complexes × 100. Competition between Compound 1 and Target DNA—Thirty μl of pre-formed IN complexes were added to the wells of a 96-well white microtiter plate. Identical sets of control wells contained 30 μl of SPA beads without IN complexes. Ten μlof a serial dilution of 1 in 25% (v/v) Me2SO was added to the complexes. Binding of a serial dilution of target DNA was initiated by rapid addition, with shaking, of 10 μl of increasing concentrations (1–29 nm) of 33P-labeled target DNA in SPA buffer. The total of the binding and the products of the strand transfer reaction with target were taken as the difference in signal between wells containing IN and the control wells (without EDTA quenching) after 4 h at 20°C. The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to give values of Vmax and Km using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 for Windows. The Michaelis-Menten constants were then used to prepare double-reciprocal plots for easier visualization of the mode of inhibition. Binding of IN to Strand Transfer Inhibitors and Target DNA Are Mutually Exclusive—One goal of this study was to delineate the individual contributions of assembly and intrinsic strand transfer activity on the overall strand transfer activities of variant LTR/enzyme combinations. Strand transfer activity can be considered to be the result of two different processes. The first is assembly of a functional enzyme-DNA complex, with more efficient assembly expected to produce greater concentrations of active complexes. The second process is considered to be the intrinsic catalytic activity of the complexes. Typically, IN complexes form in vitro at enzyme concentrations between 100 and 1000 nm. However, the actual concentration of active sites is thought to be far lower than the total concentration of IN enzyme, even accounting for the formation of IN tetramers (8Faure A. Kim S. Parissi V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, to distinguish assembly from intrinsic activity, we measured the concentrations of functionally active sites (those capable of strand transfer) formed for each LTR/enzyme combination. For this analysis we made use of 1 (Fig. 1A), which inhibits HIV IN strand transfer activity in vitro with an IC50 of 15 nm. Radiolabeled [3H]compound 1 binds reversibly to a WT HIV IN complex assembled in vitro with a WT pre-processed LTR substrate (Fig. 1B) with a Kd of 21 nm (Fig. 1C). The binding of 1 and target DNA to IN was mutually exclusive, as shown by a Michaelis-Menten analysis of strand transfer catalysis in the presence of increasing concentrations of 1 and target DNA. Inhibition by 1 (Fig. 2) was overcome by increasing the concentration of target DNA. A common y-intercept was obtained, indicating that 1 inhibits strand transfer in a manner that is competitive with target DNA, as had been suggested previously (18Espeseth A.S. Kim P. Wolfe A. Witmer M. Grobler J. Anthony N. Egbertson M. Melamed J.Y. Young S. Hamill T. Cole J.L. Hazuda D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 27Hazuda D.J. Kim P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espeseth A. Gabryelski L. Schleif W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) for a diketo acid inhibitor. The x intercept provides the –Ki for inhibition by 1. This value is 17 nm, which is in good agreement with the dissociation constant noted above for binding of radiolabeled 1, and similar to the IC50 (15 nm) for inhibition of strand transfer activity. When complexes derived from 330 nm WT IN were allowed to react with increasing concentrations of 33P-labeled target DNA to form strand transfer products, the maximal strand transfer product, obtained at saturating concentrations of target DNA, was 2.0 ± 0.4 nm (n = 5). Alternatively, when the same complexes were allowed to bind [3H]compound 1, maximal binding was 4.0 ± 1.0 nm (n = 5). The concentration of active sites capable of entering into strand transfer was about half that of the concentration of sites capable of binding to [3H]compound 1. Thus, under the strand transfer conditions of this study, IN acts in a stoichiometric fashion, as the turnover of target DNA was less than 1. A detailed study of the other catalytic activity of IN, i.e. the 3′-processing function (28Smolov M. Kim M. Tashlitskii V. Korolev S. Demidyuk I. Brochon J.C. Mouscadet J.F. Deprez E. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), concluded that that function also behaved in a single turnover fashion. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, the normalized strand transfer activity for any given LTR/IN combination is calculated as the concentration of observed strand transfer products divided by the maximal concentration of sites capable of binding [3H]compound 1. Effect of Changes to the Viral LTR on Strand Transfer Activity and Inhibitor Binding—We surveyed the effects of changes to the end of the U5 LTR (Fig. 1B) on strand transfer activity and on the binding of [3H]compound 1 to WT IN complexes. Single base substitutions or 2 base extensions of A–2 (Table 1, rows 1–5) did not significantly reduce either strand transfer activity (29Bushman F.D. Kim R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 30Leavitt A.D. Kim R.B. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2359-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vink C. Kim D.C. Elgersma Y. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4636-4644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or [3H]compound 1 binding. By comparison, replacement of A–2 by iododeoxyuridine reportedly reduced strand transfer activity by 40% (32Jenkins T.M. Kim D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A blunt-ended substrate lacking the 5′ C–1A–2 overhang was devoid of both strand transfer and binding activities (Table 1, row 6). This blunt-ended substrate has been examined before, with groups reporting little or no activity (30Leavitt A.D. Kim R.B. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2359-2368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bushman F.D. Kim R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3458-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Sherman P.A. Kim M.L. Fyfe J.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3593-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes to C–1 or T1 produced only minor changes to either strand transfer activity or [3H]compound 1 binding. However, there were two exceptions. First, replacement of C–1 by A (Table 1, row 11) was disruptive, as has been previously reported (34Sherman P.A. Kim M.L. Fyfe J.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3593-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, strand transfer activity and inhibitor binding were reduced to <25 and 50%, respectively. Second, replacement of T1 by G (Table 1, row 17) greatly reduced (<25% WT) both strand transfer activity and the binding of [3H]compound 1. The consequences of this latter change are discussed in more detail below. Interestingly, some changes substantially reduce or destroy strand transfer activity but still preserve inhibitor binding. For example, substitution of T1 by A (Table 1, row 16) reduced [3H]compound 1 binding by only 50%. However, when potential base pairing was restored by simultaneously replacing the cleaved strand 3′ A1 base to T1 (Table 1, row 18), no strand transfer products were observed, as has been reported previously (35Van Den Ent F.M.I. Kim C. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7825-7832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this loss of activity, [3H]compound 1 still bound to this complex, albeit with lower affinity (<25% of WT). Complexes containing a 3′-terminal dideoxy C (ddC1, Table 1, row 25), or a deletion of A1 (Table 1, row 26), were devoid of strand transfer activity, as would be expected. Notably, IN complexes with substitutions of A1 by C, G, T, ddC, or those assembled with a deletion of A1 (Table 1, rows 22–26) were still capable of substantial [3H]compound 1 binding. Thus, the catalytic adenosine is dispensable for inhibitor binding. An opposite result was obtained when G2 was replaced with A, T, or C (Table 1, rows 19–21). In this case, strand transfer activity was only minimally affected, but all three of these changes caused substantial losses in [3H]compound 1 binding (<25% WT). Overall, these results show that changes to the viral LTR produce one of four different profiles as follows. 1) Changes can be neutral with respect to strand transfer activity and [3H]compound 1 binding, i.e. they are without discernible effects, at least under the specific conditions used for these assays (e.g. GCC(A/C)A; Table 1, row 15). 2) Changes can simultaneously reduce both strand transfer activity and [3H]compound 1 binding (e.g. GAC(A/C)T; Table 1, row 18). 3) Changes can inde"

This is achieved through the activity of two conserved domains, formin homology 1 (FH1) and FH2. FH1 consists of proline-rich repeats of varying sizes that can serve as ligands for SH3 and WW domains as well as the small actin-binding protein profilin (14Wallar B.J. Alberts A.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 435-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 15Kovar D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). FH2 is more highly conserved and has been shown in vitro to nucleate directly de novo actin polymerization and to stimulate F-actin accumulation in vivo (7Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L.

Formins can be subdivided into families based on their associated regulatory domains. The diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) are distinguished by the presence of two interacting regulatory domains, an N-terminal GTPase binding domain (GBD) and a C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) (19Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 21Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y.

Recent in vitro functional and structural studies of mDia1 have subdivided the N-terminal GBD/FH3 into 4 subdomains: GBD (residues 69-129); the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) (residues 129-369); N-terminal dimerization domain (DD) (residues 377-452); coiled-coil (residues 452-568) (23Rose R.

In the autoinhibited conformation the FH1 domain is thought to serve as a flexible hinge that allows the N-terminal DID and C-terminal DAD to interact. In this conformation the core conserved DAD sequence (aa 1181-1191) makes contact with the concave DAD binding pocket in DID, but complete autoregulation is dependent upon a tight interaction between DID and a series of basic residues (aa 1192-1196) immediately C-terminal to the DAD core (19Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 25Nezami A.G. Poy F. Eck M.J.

Both DID and DAD are highly conserved among mDia1, -2, and -3 and the related proteins DAAM1 and -2 (25Nezami A.G. Poy F. Eck M.J. Structure. 2006; 14: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A recent report has also suggested that the N terminus contains a Rho-independent membrane targeting domain that is also subject to DID/DAD autoregulation (28Seth A. Otomo C. Rosen M.K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The presence of two dimerization domains in mDia1, the N-terminal DD and the C-terminal FH2, has called into question previous models which suggest that DRFs in the autoinhibited conformation are monomeric (15Kovar D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Rose R. Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A.

In addition, the individual contributions of the N-terminal subdomains toward mDia1 autoregulation have not been addressed in the context of the full-length protein. We report here the results of an in vivo structure/function analysis of the mDia1 N terminus using in part the MAL/SRF transcription pathway as a quantitative functional assay. We showed previously that activation of the MAL/SRF pathway occurs in response to depletion of the cellular G-actin pool (11Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 12Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and that activation of a MAL/SRF-dependent reporter gene serves as an accurate and quantitative measure of mDia1 activity (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30Copeland J.W. Copeland S.J. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50250-50256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using this assay we show that the DD is required for autoregulation of mDia1 in vivo. We also found that DD is likely required for the GBD-independent targeting of the N terminus to the plasma membrane and that this domain forms homo- but not heterooligomers. In contrast, we show that the DID/DAD interaction is able to mediate interaction between closely related DRF proteins and is able to act in trans to inhibit their activity. Finally we provide data that are supportive of a model where autoinhibited DRFs form dimeric or higher order structures. Plasmids—The constructs pMLV-LacZ, p3D.A-Luc, pEF-SRFVP16, RhoA.V14, rac1.V12, cdc42.V12, mDia1 F1F2+C, F1F2, ΔDAD, ΔRBD.DID and mDia2 F1F2+C, F1F2 were described previously (11Sotiropoulos A.

Copeland J.W. Treisman R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) as indicated. GST-DAD contains codons 1116-1255 of mDia1 cloned into pGEX.6P2. pEFN.Cherry is a mammalian expression vector derivative of pRSetb.Cherry (Dr. Roger Tsien). Immunofluorescence—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends and maintained in 0.5% fetal calf serum in DMEM, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton-X-100 in PBS.

Secondary antibodies used were Alexa350 anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes A21049) and Alexa594 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes A21207). Raw264.7 cells were cultured in 5% CO2, 10% fetal calf serum in DMEM and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the supplied protocol. Optical sections in Figs. 3 and 4 were captured with a 63× oil immersion objective using the apotome on a Zeiss Axioimager.Z1.FIGURE 3mDia1 N terminus targeting to the membrane has a Rho-independent component.

The precipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting using M2 anti-FLAG peroxidase conjugate antibody (Sigma A8592) and rabbit anti-Myc (Sigma C3956 or Santa Cruz Sc-789) and anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate antibodies (Sigma A6667). Reporter Gene Assays—The SRF reporter gene assays were performed as previously described (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30Copeland J.W. Copeland S.J. Treisman R. J. Biol.

Activation induced by expression of the indicated proteins is presented as a percent of the activation induced by expression of a fixed amount of SRF-VP16 fusion protein included as a positive control standard in each experiment (50 ng of DNA/35-mm plate). For inhibition studies, activation of the SRF reporter gene in the absence of the dominant negative is set to 100% in each experiment. Transfection efficiency is standardized to expression of β-galactosidase from a co-transfected MLV-LacZ reporter (250 ng/35-mm plate). Actin Polymerization Assays—The in vitro actin polymerization assays were performed as previously described (30Copeland J.W. Copeland S.J. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50250-50256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). mDia1 F1F2+C and mDia2 F1F2+C were cloned into pET30a and purified as His-tag proteins from Escherichia coli strain Rosetta BL21.DE3 using Ni2+ affinity resin. mD1N was cloned into pGEX.6P2, expressed in BL21, and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and cleavage of the GST moiety using prescission protease. Protein concentrations were determined using A280 and molar extinction coefficients obtained from the ExPASy website (mD1N = 16,305; mD1.F1F2+C = 21,805; mD2.F1F2+C = 25,035). N- and C-terminal derivatives were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature before initiation of polymerization. Final concentrations are as noted in Fig. 9. IC50 values were calculated by plotting the polymerization rate from the linear section of each curve and interpolating the concentration of mD1N that would yield half-maximal inhibition. To study the organization of the mDia1 N-terminal regulatory domain in more detail, we examined mDia1 derivatives lacking only RBD (aa residues 1-129), DD (aa 377-452), or DD and DAD (1-1192Δ377-452) (Fig. 1C). The previously described constitutively active mDia1 derivatives ΔRBDΔDID (263-1255) and ΔDAD (1-1192) were included for comparison. These derivatives were expressed by transient transfection in NIH3T3 cells, and the effect on activation of the co-transfected SRF reporter gene 3D.Aluc was assayed. This reporter is activated via the actin/MAL/SRF pathway in response to changes in actin treadmilling dynamics and serves as a rapid and quantitative measure of mDia1 activity (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30Copeland J.W. Copeland S.J. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50250-50256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As expected, expression of mDia1 ΔRBD had no effect on reporter gene activation, consistent with the DID/DAD interaction remaining intact in this derivative. In contrast, expression of ΔRBDΔDID, ΔDAD, or ΔDDΔDAD all induced potent activation of the SRF reporter gene (Fig. 1A). Expression of ΔDD also induced activation of the SRF reporter even though this deletion does not remove any residues that are predicted to be involved in the DID/DAD regulatory interaction (23Rose R. Weyand M. Lammers M. Ishizaki T. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2005; 435: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Otomo T. Otomo C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Rosen M.K. Mol.

Structure. 2006; 14: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To determine whether the ΔDD deletion disrupted the structure of the adjacent DID, we performed GST-DAD pulldown experiments using lysates from transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells. ΔDAD served as a positive control and was efficiently captured by GST-DAD. Full-length mDia1 was very weakly captured by GST-DAD and only visible on very long exposures. Similarly, ΔDD was also poorly captured by GST-DAD. To determine whether this was due to competition with the intact DAD of ΔDD, we performed the same pulldown using ΔDDΔDAD. In this case ΔDDΔDAD was captured with similar efficiency to ΔDAD, suggesting that the ΔDD mutation has not disrupted the conformation of DID. The negative control ΔRBDΔDID was not detectable in the GST-DAD pulldown even upon long exposures of the blot. We used immunofluorescence to extend these observations and show directly the effect of expression of these proteins on actin polymerization in vivo (Fig. 2). As in the SRF assay, expression of mDia1 ΔRBD, like full-length mDia1, had no effect on F-actin accumulation in transfected cells (Fig. 2). Expression of mDia1 ΔDD, ΔRBDΔDID, ΔDDΔDAD, and ΔDAD all induced the formation of actin stress fibers but of differing appearance (Fig. 2). ΔRBDΔDID induced robust thin stress fibers that run from end to end of the cell (Fig. 2). ΔDDΔDAD and ΔDAD induced thin stress fiber formation as well as numerous cellular extensions and filopodia (Fig. 2, D and F), whereas ΔDD induced the formation of thick stress fibers with an obvious long axis of polarity (Fig. 2E). We also noticed a distinctive subcellular localization for each of these derivatives. Full-length mDia1, ΔRBD, and ΔDD all showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining with some puncta of protein apparent in full-length and ΔDD-expressing cells similar to the endogenous protein (32Gomez T.S. Kumar K. Medeiros R.B. Shimizu Y. Leibson P.J. Billadeau D.D. Immunity. 2007; 26: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In contrast ΔRBDΔDID was concentrated at the ends of stress fibers at the periphery of the cell, whereas ΔDAD and ΔDDΔDAD seemed to be localized over the entire surface of the cell. To further explore the requirements for mDia1 membrane targeting, we created a series of deletion derivatives of the isolated N terminus. We found that the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 cells lacked sufficient depth to easily distinguish between cytoplasmic localization and membrane targeting (data not shown). Instead, we expressed these derivatives by transient transfection in Raw264.7 cells whose morphology enables a more obvious distinction between cytoplasm and membrane (28Seth A. Otomo C. Rosen M.K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). mD1N (aa 1-568) was efficiently targeted to the membrane in all transfected cells and can be seen in optical sections as a ring around the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase interferes with this localization, resulting in loss of membrane targeting in roughly 50% of transfected cells (Fig. 3, B and E). mD1NΔRBD (aa 129-568), which lacks the RBD, was targeted to the membrane in half of the transfected cells (Fig. 3, C and E), and this targeting was unaffected by co-expression of C3 (Fig. 3, D and E). The red fluorescent protein mCherry was co-expressed as a space-filling marker and was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in all cells (Fig. 3, A-D). To determine which subdomain of the N terminus is required for Rho-independent membrane targeting, we generated the additional deletion derivatives mD1N.DD/CC (aa 354-568), mD1NΔDD (aa 1-369), and mD1N.DID (aa 129-369). mD1N.DD/CC was targeted to the membrane in ∼15% of transfected cells (Fig. 4A), whereas in the remaining cells it was found to be distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4B). mD1NΔDD was also membrane targeted in ∼20% of transfected cells (Fig. 4C) with the remainder exhibiting a punctate cytoplasmic distribution of the protein that was largely excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4D). mD1N.DID was distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in all transfected cells. Co-expression of C3 had no effect on mD1N.DD/CC membrane targeting but completely eliminated membrane localization of mD1NΔDD (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that the DD/CC subdomain mediates Rho-independent membrane localization of the mDia1 N terminus. We also made use of this series of N-terminal deletion derivatives to further investigate which subdomains are required for efficient autoinhibition in trans. mDia1 F1F2+C was expressed in the absence or presence of mDia1 N-terminal derivatives mD1N, mD1NΔRBD, mD1N.DD/CC, mD1NΔDD, mD1N.DID, and mD1NΔDID, and the effects on activation of SRF-dependent transcription were determined (Fig. 5A). Expression of mD1.F1F2+C alone induced potent activation of the SRF reporter gene. This activation is completely inhibited by co-expression of mD1N or mD1NΔRBD. However, derivatives lacking an intact DID or DD (mD1N.DD/CC, mD1NΔDD, mD1N.DID, and mD1NΔDID) had a greatly reduced ability to inhibit F1F2+C activity (Fig. 5A), consistent with the results obtained in the context of full-length mDia1 (Fig. 1A). As expected, this inhibition is dependent on the presence of DAD as the activity of mDia1 derivatives that lack DAD are not affected by co-expression of 129-568 (Fig. 5, B and C). Expression of the N-terminal derivatives alone did not activate the SRF reporter gene (data not shown). mD1NΔRBD is also able to inhibit the activity of the longer constitutively active derivatives ΔRBDΔDID, ΔDD, and ΔDAD (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that ΔDD is competent for regulation by the DID/DAD interaction if DID-DD is supplied in trans. The SRF reporter gene assay results were corroborated by immunofluorescence. mD1.F1F2+C was co-expressed with the N-terminal deletion derivatives by transient transfection in NIH3T3 cells. mD1.F1F2+C induces the formation of thin stress fibers and, surprisingly, accumulates in the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig. 6C, D, and N, and see “Discussion”). mD1.F1F2+C nuclear localization is dependent on a cryptic C-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS); the related mDia1 derivative F1F2 is found primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6F). The DD/CC region acts as a cytoplasmic anchor to prevent mDia1 nuclear localization (Figs. 2C and 6, A and M). The activity of the C-terminal NLS is also subject to autoinhibition. Co-expression of mD1N or mD1NΔRBD strongly inhibits the formation of F1F2+C-induced stress fibers and also prevents F1F2+C nuclear accumulation (Fig. 6, G-L and N). Similarly, co-expression of any of the DID-containing N-terminal derivatives of mDia1 largely prevented F1F2+C nuclear accumulation (Fig. 6N). Expression of mD1N or mD1NΔRBD has no effect on F1F2-induced stress fiber formation (data not shown). We noted that expression of mD1N completely eliminated stress fiber formation (Fig. 6G), similar to the effects of expression of the Rho-inhibiting exoenzyme C3 transferase (13Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This suggests that mD1N acts in part to titrate out endogenous RhoA"
https://openalex.org/W2109641142,"The Mre11/Nbs1/Rad50 complex (MRN) plays multiple roles in the maintenance of genome stability, including repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and activation of the S-phase checkpoint. Here we demonstrate that MRN is required for the prevention of DNA rereplication in mammalian cells. DNA replication is strictly regulated by licensing control so that the genome is replicated once and only once per cell cycle. Inactivation of Nbs1 or Mre11 leads to a substantial increase of DNA rereplication induced by overexpression of the licensing factor Cdt1. Our studies reveal that multiple mechanisms are likely involved in the MRN-mediated suppression of rereplication. First, both Mre11 and Nbs1 are required for facilitating ATR activation when Cdt1 is overexpressed, which in turn suppresses rereplication. Second, Cdt1 overexpression induces ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Nbs1 at Ser343 and this phosphorylation depends on the FHA and BRCT domains of Nbs1. Mutations at Ser343 or in the FHA and BRCT domains lead to more severe rereplication when Cdt1 is overexpressed. Third, the interaction of the Mre11 complex with RPA is important for the suppression of rereplication. This suggests that modulating RPA activity via a direct interaction of MRN is likely one of the effector mechanisms to suppress rereplication. Moreover, we demonstrate that MRN is also required for preventing the accumulation of DSBs when rereplication is induced. Therefore, our studies suggest new roles of MRN in the maintenance of genome stability through preventing rereplication and rereplication-associated DSBs when licensing control is compromised."

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a ligand (vitamin D3)-dependent transcription factor, which is shown to play a major role in calcium homeostasis and keratinocyte differentiation. Vitamin D and its analogues in combination with DNA-damaging agents are extensively used for cancer chemotherapy. In this report, we examined whether p53 affects p63-mediated induction of VDR and studied the effect of DNA damage on VDR induction in p53 null cell lines. Our results demonstrate that p53 itself does not induce VDR expression, nor does it affect p63-mediated VDR induction in the cell lines tested in this study. Furthermore, we observed p53-independent activation of VDR upon DNA damage and associated the induction of VDR to p73. We have demonstrated that ectopic expression of various p73 isoforms can induce VDR expression. Inhibition of p73 in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents exhibited decreased VDR expression. Finally, we show that upon DNA damage, induction of VDR sensitizes the cells to vitamin D treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate that VDR is regulated by p63 and p73 and that the induction of VDR expression upon DNA damage is p73-dependent. p63 and p73, members of the p53 family, have been shown to be functionally distinct from p53.

Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Stabilization of p53 protein occurs in response to various stress stimuli including DNA damage, viral infection, or oncogenic activation (1Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 2Schuler M. Green D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 684-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of p53 and its interacting proteins have been studied extensively, it was not until 1997 that the functional homologues of p53, namely p63 and p73, were discovered. Despite being structurally similar to p53, p63 and p73 were shown to be functionally more diverse and distinct from p53 (3Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C.

Functional diversities associated with p63 and p73 are partly due to their ability to generate multiple transcripts. Differential promoter usage by both p63 and p73 results in the generation of either transactivation domain containing isoforms (TAp63 and TAp73) or NH2-terminally truncated isoforms (ΔNp63 and ΔNp73) (7Scoumanne A. Harms K.L. Chen X. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally, multiple carboxyl termini variants, α, β, and γ of p63 and α, β, γ, ϵ, and δ of p73, are generated due to the differential splicing of COOH terminus. Due to their structural similarity with p53, TA isoforms of both p63 and p73 have been shown to activate various p53-responsive genes and promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (8Dietz S. Rother K. Bamberger C. Schmale H. Mossner J. Engeland K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). On the contrary, elevated levels of ΔNp63 and ΔNp73 isoforms have been reported in several human cancers, and these isoforms have also been associated with the induction of various genes involved in promoting cell proliferation (10Kang K.H.

Additionally, ΔN isoforms of p63 and p73 have also been shown to act in a dominant negative manner and suppress the TAp63 and TAp73 isoforms and p53-mediated antiproliferative functions (15Westfall M.D. Mays D.J. Sniezek J.C. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Several reports have implicated that, upon DNA damage, both TAp63 and TAp73 isoforms can lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (16Moll U.M. Slade N. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 371-386PubMed Google Scholar). DNA damage-induced expression of TAp63α promotes apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cell lines (17Gressner O. Schilling T. Lorenz K. Schulze Schleithoff E. Koch A. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Maria Lena A. Candi E. Terrinoni A. Valeria Catani M. Oren M. Melino G. Krammer P.H. Stremmel W. Muller M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2458-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). TAp73 variants were also shown to be induced by a subset of DNA-damaging agents in various cancer cell lines (18Ozaki T. Nakagawara A. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, TAp73α and TAp73β play a pivotal role in p53-independent chemosensitivity (19Irwin M.S. Kondo K. Marin M.C. Cheng L.S. Hahn W.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In particular, transcriptional activity of p73α is required for E2F1-mediated apoptosis of T-cells (20Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irwin M. Kaelin W.G. Dowdy S.F. Nature. 2000; 407: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of p63 and p73 in p53-dependent apoptosis is still unclear, a significant down-regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis upon γ-irradiation in p63- and p73-ablated mouse embryo fibroblasts suggests that both p63 and p73 are required for the biological activity of p53 (21Flores E.R.

VDR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, which belongs to the nuclear receptor family of proteins (22Nezbedova P. Brtko J. Endocr. Regul. 2004; 38: 29-38PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of VDR by the active form of vitamin D results in heterodimerization of VDR with the retinoic acid receptor and subsequent transcriptional regulation of its responsive genes (22Nezbedova P. Brtko J. Endocr. Regul. 2004; 38: 29-38PubMed Google Scholar). Vitamin D receptor primarily regulates the genes involved in calcium homeostasis and bone formation (23Demay M.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1068: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Apart from exerting its classical functions, vitamin D receptor has been shown to exert antiproliferative actions in several different cancer cell lines (24Campbell M.J. Gombart A.F. Kwok S.H. Park S. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5091-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Banerjee P. Chatterjee M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 253: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, VDR has been implicated to play a broader role in the differentiation of epithelial keratinocytes and immunomodulatory activities (26Hawker N.P. Pennypacker S.D. Chang S.M. Bikle D.D. J.

Anticancer Res. 2006; 26: 2531-2542PubMed Google Scholar). Although extensive work has been performed on the biological function of vitamin D and its analogs, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of VDR. In this report, we studied the transcriptional regulation of VDR by p53 family members in both stressed and unstressed conditions. Our results demonstrate the differential regulation of VDR by p63 and p73 as well as the p53-independent activation of VDR upon DNA damage. Examination of the mechanism of VDR induction upon DNA damage demonstrated the requirement of p73 for DNA damage-induced expression of VDR. Cell Lines and Plasmids—Human non-small lung carcinoma cell line H1299 and human osteosarcoma cell line SaoS2 were obtained from ATCC and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine calf serum, 250 units of penicillin, and 250 μg of streptomycin. Expression plasmids encoding TAp63γ, TAp73β, ΔNp73β, and TAp73α were constructed in cytomegalovirus-driven pcDNA3.1A vector as described earlier (28Caserta T.M. Kommagani R. Yuan Z. Robbins D.J. Mercer C.A. Kadakia M.P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). VDR full-length and minimal promoter luciferase constructs were constructed as described previously (29Kommagani R. Caserta T.M. Kadakia M.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3745-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). p53 expression plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Steven Berberich (Wright State University). VDRE-luciferase (VDRE-Luc) reporter was a generous gift from Dr. Alberto Munoz (University of Madrid). Etoposide, doxorubicin, and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were purchased from Sigma. For constructing VDR short hairpin RNA expression vector, shVDR target sequence was selected using algorithms obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL) and Genscript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). Subsequently, the target sequence to VDR was cloned into the PstI site in the pSilencer 3.1 vector obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Target sequence used for shVDR was as follows: shVDR-sense, 5′-GATCCGCAGCGCATTGCCATATTCTGCAGATATGGCAATGATGCGCTGCTGTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; shVDR-antisense, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAACAGCAGCGCATCATTGCCATATCTGCAGAATATGGCAATGATGCGCTGCG-3′. Transfections—Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates prior to the day of transfection. At around 80% confluence, transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with the desired plasmids in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For all of the studies, a total of 3 μg of expression plasmids, encoding TAp63γ, TAp73β, ΔNp73β, p53, and TAp73α, were used. For p53 dose-dependent studies, 1, 2, and 3 μg of p53 plasmid was used. After a 5-h incubation, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum and 1% PS. p73 Knock-down by siRNA—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates prior to the day of transfection. At around 30-40% confluence, cells were subjected to calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Briefly, 1 h before transfection, medium was changed, and the cells were kept in an incubator with 3% CO2. For each transfection reaction, siRNA (Qiagen) was mixed with CaCl2 (125 mm final concentration) and 2× BBS (50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4). The transfection mixture was incubated for 3 min at room temperature and then added to the respective wells. As control, an AllStars negative control nonsilencing RNA (Qiagen) was used. Six hours post-transfection, medium was changed, and cells were transferred to an incubator with 5% CO2. At 24 h, another round of transfection was performed as described above. After an additional 48 h, total RNA was harvested using the RNAeasy kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequences used for p73 siRNA were as follows: sense, r(CGGGAUGCUCAACAACCAU)dTdT; antisense, r(AUGGUUGUUGAGCAUCCC G)dGdG. Reverse Transcription-PCR—1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate format on an ABI Prism7900HT sequence detection system using TaqMan Universal master mix and Assays on Demand specific for VDR (Hs_0017213_m1), p21 (Hs_00355782_m1), p73 (Hs_00232088_m1), and CYP27B1 ((Hs_00168017_m1) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Relative mRNA quantitation was performed by using the comparative ΔΔCt method as described earlier (28Caserta T.M. Kommagani R. Yuan Z. Robbins D.J. Mercer C.A. Kadakia M.P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Kommagani R. Caserta T.M. Kadakia M.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3745-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein and Immunoblot Studies—At 24 h after transfection or treatments, total protein was extracted from cells using radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). Protein extracts were run on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 5% blocking milk solution. Membranes were subsequently immunoblotted with antibodies to detect specific proteins. Monoclonal anti-VDR, rabbit polyclonal anti-p21, rabbit polyclonal anti-p53 FL-193, monoclonal anti-p63 4A4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies were used to detect VDR, p21, p53, p63, and β-actin expression, respectively. Monoclonal Ab-6 (Calbiochem) was used to detect p53. Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) were used as secondary antibodies, and the Supersignal Westpico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Pierce) was used to detect the chemiluminescence signal. Immunoprecipitation for Endogenous p73α—After 24 h of doxorubicin and etoposide treatments, cells were harvested for total protein using radioimmune precipitation buffer, and 1 mg of total protein was used for immunoprecipitation. Briefly, total protein was precleared with 20 μl of rec-protein G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C. After preclearing, beads were removed, and total protein was incubated with rotation overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-p73 antibody (Ab-4 Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA). The next day, immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with rec-protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h, followed by four washes with radioimmune precipitation buffer to remove the unbound proteins. Immunoprecipitated samples with beads were run on 10% SDS gel and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-p73 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX). Transactivation Assays—To measure the VDR-Luc and VDR(min)-Luc reporter activities, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2.25 × 105 cells/well. At 24 h after seeding, cells were transfected with 100 ng of reporter constructs along with the desired plasmids as indicated. After 24 h of post transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Dual luciferase assays were performed to detect both firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter 1000 Assay System as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). The relative luciferase activity was measured by calculating the ratio of Renilla luciferase activity to firefly luciferase activity. To measure the vitamin D3-mediated transcriptional activity of VDR, H1299 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 6 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 50 ng of VDRE-Luc reporter along with the desired plasmids as indicated. The next day, cells were treated with 8 μm etoposide for 12 h, and then medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3). After 24 h of post VD3 treatments, cells were subjected to a dual luciferase assay as mentioned earlier. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, H1299 cells were seeded onto three 15-cm dishes, and after 24 h, cells were fixed on a plate by using formaldehyde for 10 min. After fixation, cells were homogenized, and nuclei were subjected to sonication to shear the DNA. Fragmented chromatin was precleared using protein G beads for 1.5 h. Precleared chromatin was subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with Mouse monoclonal anti-p73 Ab-4 (Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, CA) or normal rabbit IgG antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Part of the precleared chromatin that was not subjected to immunoprecipitation was used as input DNA. After immunoprecipitation, both input DNA and immunoprecipitated chromatin were reverse cross-linked, and DNA was eluted. The eluted DNA was subjected to PCR amplification using GoTaq Green PCR master mix as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI) using primers specific for VDR (forward, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGATGATTATAGGTGCGGATACCCG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGGGTACCCAGTAACAGGTTGCGACGGAG-3′) and p21 (forward, 5′-GGTACCGGCACTCTTGTTCCCCCAGGCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCGAGACCATCCCCTTCCTCACCTGAAAA-3′). PCR conditions used for both VDR and p21 were as follows. A total of 40 cycles were performed, each consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 68 °C. p53 Does Not Induce VDR Expression or Affect p63-mediated Induction of VDR—Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that p63 but not p53 induces VDR expression (29Kommagani R. Caserta T.M. Kadakia M.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3745-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, a recent report has demonstrated that p53 can induce VDR expression (30Maruyama R. Aoki F. Toyota M. Sasaki Y. Akashi H. Mita H. Suzuki H. Akino K. Ohe-Toyota M. Maruyama Y. Tatsumi H. Imai K. Shinomura Y. Tokino T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Toward understanding this discrepancy, we wanted to further understand the role of p53 family members in VDR induction. Given the significant homology between p53 and TAp63 isoforms, we asked whether p53 had any effect on p63-mediated VDR induction. To address this, we overexpressed p53 and p63 alone or together in p53–/– H1299 and HeLa cell lines (Fig. 1). We demonstrated that although TAp63γ by itself, as expected, induces VDR expression, co-transfection of p53 along with p63 did not significantly affect the ability of p63 to induce VDR expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Regulation of p21 was used as a positive control for the transactivation of both p53 and p63. Similar results were obtained when we tested the ability of p63 alone or along with p53 to regulate the activity of either the full-length VDR reporter or the minimal VDR reporter, previously shown to be activated by p63 (29Kommagani R. Caserta T.M. Kadakia M.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3745-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although p63 significantly up-regulated the activity of both of these reporters, p53 did not affect p63-mediated transactivation of either of these VDR reporters (Fig. 1C). Consistent with our previous report, p53 alone was once again unable to induce expression of VDR or affect the VDR reporter activity in both of the cell lines tested (Fig. 1). In order to address whether the effect of p53 on VDR was dose-dependent, we further tested the effect of increasing concentrations of p53 on endogenous VDR expression (Fig. 2). We confirmed that p53 at all doses tested did not result in induction of VDR at either the mRNA or protein level in both of the cell lines tested (Fig. 2, A and B). As expected, p21, a downstream target of p53, was significantly induced by p53 and served as a positive control. In addition, p53 at any dose tested also did not significantly change full-length VDR or the minimal VDR reporter activity (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2p53 does not induce VDR expression. H1299 and HeLa cells were transfected with either empty vector (Vec) or increasing doses of expression plasmids encoding p53 or p63 alone as indicated. A, at 24 h post-transfection, total RNA was harvested and subjected to TaqMan reverse transcriptase PCR. The y axis represents -fold change in VDR and p21 mRNA levels relative to empty vector-transfected cells. B, whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-VDR, anti-p21, anti-p53, anti-β-actin, and anti-p63 antibodies. C, H1299 and HeLa cells were co-transfected with either full-length VDR promoter construct or the minimal VDR promoter construct with increasing concentrations of expression plasmids encoding p53 or p63 alone as indicated. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in PLB and subjected to dual luciferase assays as per the protocol. RLU/R-Luc ratios were calculated to normalize for transfection efficiency. The y axis represents -fold change relative to empty vector control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA Damage-induced Expression of VDR Is Independent of p53 and Correlates with p73 Expression Levels—To test whether p53 is required for DNA damage-induced VDR expression, as demonstrated earlier, we examined the effects of two DNA-damaging agents, doxorubicin and etoposide, on two p53 null cells, H1299 and SaoS2 (Fig. 3). Both DNA-damaging agents led to an induction of VDR compared with untreated cells, demonstrating that DNA damage alone can lead to the transcriptional activation of VDR (Fig. 3A). To assess whether increase in VDR upon DNA damage leads to a concomitant increase in the transcriptional activity of VDR, we examined the transcript levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), a downstream target of VDR. An increase in CYP27B1 transcript levels was also observed in the doxorubicin- and etoposide-treated cells in both the H1299 and SaoS2 cell lines (Fig. 3A). Since previous reports have demonstrated that both of these cell lines have endogenous p73, and p73 is induced upon DNA damage in various cancer cell lines (31Urist M. Tanaka T. Poyurovsky M.V. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Chen X. Zheng Y. Zhu J. Jiang J. Wang J.

To test this, we treated both H1299 and SaoS2 cell lines with doxorubicin or etoposide and monitored transcript levels of both VDR and p73 (Fig. 3A). We demonstrated that both p73 and VDR are induced upon DNA damage. Consistent with the simultaneous increase in the transcript levels of both VDR and p73 upon DNA damage, we also observed an increase in the protein levels of both VDR and p73 upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in another p53 null HeLa cell line (data not shown). In order to assess whether p73 precedes the VDR induction upon DNA damage, we monitored the p73 and VDR transcript levels at different time points following the etoposide treatment. Consistent with a previous report, we observed a significant increase in p73 transcript levels at the 4 h time point following DNA damage (31Urist M. Tanaka T. Poyurovsky M.V. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, induction in VDR transcript levels was only observed at the 8 h time point post-treatment (Fig. 3C). Together, these results suggest that VDR induction upon DNA damage may possibly occur via p73. p73 Is Required for DNA Damage-induced Expression of VDR—To examine whether p73 is required for the induction of VDR upon DNA damage, we first tested whether VDR is transcriptionally activated by the p73 isoforms in a p53 null background. Ectopic expression of TAp73β and TAp73α in H1299 cells led to a significant increase in VDR and p21 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, ΔNp73β led to a modest increase in both VDR and p21 expression levels when compared with the other TAp73 isoforms. TAp63γ was used as a positive control for both VDR and p21 induction (Fig. 4, A and B). We next tested the ability of different p73 isoforms to regulate the activity of the full-length VDR reporter, previously shown to be activated by p63. An increase in VDR reporter activity was observed with both TAp73β and TAp73α isoforms (Fig. 4C). Silencing of p73 expression in cells led to a concomitant decrease in the basal levels of both VDR and CYP27B1, a downstream target of VDR (Fig. 4D). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with intact H1299 cells demonstrated that endogenous p73 protein binds to the endogenous VDR promoter (Fig. 4E). Binding of p73 to the p21 promoter, a known target of p73, was used as a positive control. Together, these results demonstrate that VDR is transcriptionally activated by multiple p73 isoforms and that VDR is a direct target of p73. To demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of p73 is required for VDR induction upon DNA damage, we employed a dominant negative p53(R248W) mutant shown to inhibit the transcriptional activity of p73 (34Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We first tested whether p53 (R248W) mutant can inhibit the ectopic p73-mediated induction of VDR protein. We observed that p53 (R248W) mutant significantly affected TAp73α-mediated induction of VDR protein levels (Fig. 5A). However, wild type p53 did not affect TAp73α-mediated induction of VDR. This is consistent with previous observations that wild type p53 cannot inhibit p73-mediated transcriptional activity (34Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Next, we studied the effect of this p53 mutant on DNA damage-induced VDR induction to address whether blocking the endogenous p73α transcriptional activity affects the VDR induction seen upon DNA damage. We observed that inhibition of endogenous TAp73 transcriptional activity by p53 (R248W) mutant but not wild type p53 indeed significantly down-regulated the etoposide-induced VDR protein expression levels (Fig. 5B). To unequivocally demonstrate that p73 is required for VDR expression, we further examined whether silencing p73 expression affects VDR induction upon DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 5C, etoposide treatment alone can lead to a significant increase in expression of both p73 and VDR in cells transfected in control siRNA. VDR induction was inhibited in cells expressing siRNA against p73 in the presence or absence of etoposide treatment. Although siRNA against VDR abolishes VDR expression in the presence or absence of etoposide, it does not affect etoposide-mediated p73 induction. Similarly, in the presence of p73 siRNA, VDR protein levels were inhibited upon DNA damage (Fig. 5D). These results confirm that VDR induction upon DNA damage requires p73 induction, which occurs upstream of VDR. These findings clearly demonstrate that induction of VDR upon DNA damage in p53 null cells is occurring via induction of endogenous p73. DNA Damage-induced VDR Expression Sensitizes the Cells to Vitamin D Treatment—Since we have shown that VDR induction occurs upon DNA damage, and VD3 and its analogues are already used extensively for cancer chemotherapy, we wanted to determine whether VDR induction upon DNA damage sensitizes cells to the effects of VD3. To address this, we tested the VD3-mediated transcriptional activity using a reporter containing VDREs upstream of the luciferase gene in the presence or absence of VDR. Silencing of VDR was achieved by constructing a short hairpin RNA specific to VDR, and as a negative control, we used a nonsilencing control short hairpin RNA. To confirm that the shVDR can specifically silence VDR, we transfected H1299 cells with expression vector encoding TAp63γ along with short hairpin RNA to VDR or nonsilencing control. As shown in Fig. 6A, shVDR but not shNSC completely abolished the increase in VDR levels induced by TAp63γ, confirming the specificity of the shVDR. The effects of DNA damage and/or VD3 treatment on a VDRE-Luc reporter were studied in cells expressing shVDR or shNSC. Although etoposide alone did not lead to a significant increase in VDRE-Luc reporter activity, VD3 treatment led to a significant increase in the reporter activity, which was further increased in the presence of etoposide treatment (Fig. 6B). This suggested that although etoposide leads to increased VDR induction, as shown in Fig. 3, the increase in VDRE-Luc reporter activation is dependent on activation of VDR by its ligand. To confirm this, we showed that silencing VDR abolishes VDRE-Luc reporter activity in the presence or absence of etoposide and VD3. Furthermore, to confirm that p73-mediated induction of VDR is essential for the etoposide-mediated sensitization of VD3, we monitored the VD3-induced VDRE-Luc activity in the presence and absence of etoposide in cells transfected with p73 siRNA or control siRNA. We observed a significant decrease in VDRE-Luc reporter activity in cells treated with VD3 alone or in combination with etoposide treatment in cells in which p73 was silenced compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 6C). Together, our results suggest that upon DNA damage, induction of endogenous p73 upon DNA damage leads to VDR induction, which can sensitize the cells to VD3. Identification of new transcriptional networks of p53 family members has given significant insight into the functional diversities of each member (35Deyoung M.P. Ellisen L.W. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5169-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, understanding the functional cross-talk between each p53 family member based on its regulation of common and unique target genes will be crucial in deciphering their respective roles in tumorigenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that p53 can neither induce VDR expression by itself nor affect the p63-mediated up-regulation of VDR expression (Figs. 1 and 2). This therefore rules out the possibility of direct or indirect regulation of VDR by p53 in the cell lines tested in this study. Our results are contradictory to another report wherein p53 was shown to induce VDR and VDR was shown to be induced upon DNA damage in p53-containing cells. However, in depth analysis of VDR expression in multiple cancer cell lines under genotoxic stress has further ruled out the involvement of p53 in induction of VDR under physiological conditions. Induction of VDR mRNA and protein expression levels upon DNA damage was observed in HCT116 (p53–/–) as well as in SaoS2 (p53–/–) and in U2OS (p53+/+) cells (data not shown), suggesting a possible p53-independent VDR induction upon DNA damage. In addition, these results suggest transcriptional activation of VDR rather than protein stabilization. Human cancers display genetic alterations of key components involved in the DNA damage response signaling pathways, which lead to metastasis and invasiveness (36Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). p73 has been shown to be induced upon DNA damage in several different cancer cell lines and shown to be critical for chemosensitivity of these cells (10Kang K.H. Lee J.H. Kim K.C. Ham S.W. Kim M.Y. Choi K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Chen X. Zheng Y. Zhu J. Jiang J. Wang J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed a strong correlation between p73 and VDR levels upon DNA damage in these cell lines (Fig. 3). Ectopic expression of multiple p73 isoforms resulted in transcriptional activation of VDR, and silencing p73 expression led to reduction in endogenous VDR levels, suggesting a possible role of p73 in DNA damage-induced VDR expression (Fig. 4). Recently, a subset of tumor-derived mutants of p53 has been shown to inhibit p73 transcriptional activity through direct physical interaction (37Li Y. Prives C. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Ahn J. Zhang T. Prives C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1874-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of p53 (R248W) mutant resulted in down-regulation of VDR expression levels upon DNA damage, thus indicating the requirement of p73 for DNA damage-mediated VDR induction (Fig. 5). In support of this observation, with immunoprecipitation analysis, we did not observe any sort of interaction between VDR and p53 (R248W) mutant; however, as reported earlier, we observed an interaction between p73 and p53 (R248W) mutant (data not shown). Interestingly, lack of p73-mediated growth suppression has been reported in cells harboring p53 mutations (39Prabhu N.S. Somasundaram K. Satyamoorthy K. Herlyn M. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 5-9PubMed Google Scholar), and knockdown of p53 mutants resulted in enhanced growth suppression various cancer cell lines (40Vikhanskaya F. Lee M.K. Mazzoletti M. Broggini M. Sabapathy K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 41Scian M.J. Stagliano K.E. Ellis M.A. Hassan S. Bowman M. Miles M.F. Deb S.P. Deb S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7447-7454Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Inhibition of DNA damage-induced p73 expression levels resulted in a concomitant decrease in VDR expression levels (Fig. 5). Furthermore, consistent with our chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 4E), inhibition of endogenous p73 resulted in down-regulation of basal VDR expression levels and its transcriptional activity, implying a direct transcriptional activation of VDR by p73 both at basal and stressed conditions. Our results demonstrate that DNA damage-induced VDR expression occurs via p73, which may be inhibited by tumor-derived p53 mutants (Fig. 5). Thus, researchers should consider the status of both p73 and mutant p53 when VDR-mediated growth inhibitions studies are conducted in human cancer cell lines. It is well documented that VD3 and its analogues exert their antiproliferative activities through VDR and are extensively used for cancer chemotherapy (42Rashid S.F. Mountford J.C. Gombart A.F. Campbell M.J. Steroids. 2001; 66: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Banwell C.M. Singh R. Stewart P.M. Uskokovic M.R. Campbell M.J. Recent Res.

However, the sensitivity of VD3 analogues entirely depends on the endogenous levels of VDR (48Palmer H.G. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Espada J. Berciano M.T. Puig I. Baulida J. Quintanilla M. Cano A. de Herreros A.G. Lafarga M. Munoz A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar); thus, elevation in VDR levels will further enhance the VD3-mediated antiproliferative activities. Results from our studies showed a significant increase in vitamin D-mediated VDR transcriptional activity with etoposide treatment (Fig. 6). Additionally, we have demonstrated that transcriptional activation of VDR by p73 upon DNA damage is essential for the DNA damage-mediated sensitization of vitamin D. In conclusion, we demonstrated the differential regulation of VDR by p53 family members and describe a novel p73-dependent and p53-independent activation of VDR upon DNA damage. p73-mediated induction of VDR levels upon DNA damage result in sensitization to VD3. This observation will aid in combinatorial use of DNA-damaging agents with vitamin D analogues, which will aid in better therapeutic strategies for cancer chemotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W2017979090,"Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), a DNA damage-activated protein kinase, is phosphorylated at Thr-68 by ataxia telangiectasia mutated leading to its activation by phosphorylation at several additional sites. Using mass spectrometry we identified a new Chk2 phosphorylation site at Ser-456. We show that phosphorylation of Ser-456 plays a role in the regulation of Chk2 stability particularly after DNA damage. Mutation of Ser-456 to alanine results in hyperubiquitination of Chk2 and dramatically reduced Chk2 stability. Furthermore, cells expressing S456A Chk2 show a reduction in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. These findings suggest a mechanism for stabilization of Chk2 in response to DNA damage via phosphorylation at Ser-456 and proteasome-dependent turnover of Chk2 protein via dephosphorylation of the same residue."

Remarkably, this illness is precipitated by an innate immune response to altered self glycans that mimic molecular patterns found on pathogens. Autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile (type 1) diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and over 80 others, are generally thought to be triggered by aggressive responses of the adaptive immune system to self antigens, resulting in tissue damage and pathological sequelae (Davidson and Diamond, 2001Davidson A. Diamond B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Yet, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the initiation and progression of autoimmune diseases are still poorly understood. In work recently published in Immunity, Green et al., 2007Green R.S. Stone E.L. Tenno M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2007; (Published online August 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2007.06.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar report on a mouse model of an autoimmune disease similar to lupus that does not require the adaptive immune system but is instead triggered by the innate immune response. For many autoimmune diseases, the key roles of T cells and B cells are well documented and are evident in the success of T cell (anti-CD3) and B cell (anti-CD20) depletion strategies for the treatment of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Research continues to reveal new insights into the respective roles of the humoral and cell-mediated arms of adaptive immunity and the distinct roles of T cell subsets, for example Th17 cells, in autoimmunity (Bettelli et al., 2007Bettelli E. Oukka M. Kuchroo V.K. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Dendritic cells, macrophages, and other myeloid cells also play important roles in autoimmune diseases, both as antigen presenting cells and as effector cells that mediate tissue damage (Davidson and Diamond, 2001Davidson A. Diamond B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, Geijtenbeek et al., 2004Geijtenbeek T.B. van Vliet S.J. Engering A. 't Hart B.A. van Kooyk Y. Annu. Rev.

Because these cells are also major mediators of innate immunity, interest has surfaced in the potential for innate immune responses to contribute to disease pathology. Receptors that mediate innate immune responses such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and glycan-specific C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) have been implicated in autoimmune disease mechanisms, both directly through recognition of self ligands and indirectly through the regulation of immune homeostasis (Geijtenbeek et al., 2004Geijtenbeek T.B. van Vliet S.J.

Nat Immunol. 2006; 7: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In light of the roles of myeloid cells as effector cells in disease progression, can “autoimmune” disease occur in the absence of adaptive immunity? The case of the motheaten mouse mutant suggests that it can (Yu et al., 1996Yu C.C. Tsui H.W. Ngan B.Y. Shulman M.J. Wu G.E. Tsui F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Motheaten mice are deficient in hematopoietic cell phosphatase. They exhibit a severe autoimmune-like disease characterized by alopecia (hence the “moth-eaten” appearance) inflamed paws, high titers of autoimmune antibodies, deposition of immune complexes in kidney and other tissues, and shortened lifespan resulting from pneumonia associated with accumulation of leukocytes in the lungs. Although this mouse was considered a model of classic autoimmune disease, Yu et al., 1996Yu C.C. Tsui H.W. Ngan B.Y. Shulman M.J. Wu G.E. Tsui F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar crossed the mice deficient in the hematopoietic cell phosphatase with mice lacking recombinase-activating gene-1 (RAG-1) that are deficient in production of T and B cells. They found that the disease progressed normally in the absence of an adaptive immune response (Yu et al., 1996Yu C.C. Tsui H.W. Ngan B.Y. Shulman M.J. Wu G.E. Tsui F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although the mice lacked the high titers of antibodies and deposition of immune complexes in tissues, they exhibited all of the other symptoms of the disease, including shortened lifespan. Although the detailed mechanism of the initiation and progression of the disease was not defined, it was concluded that the autoimmune disease of motheaten mice was mediated by an aggressive response of macrophages and other myeloid cells. Now, Green et al., 2007Green R.S. Stone E.L. Tenno M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2007; (Published online August 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2007.06.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar describe an SLE-like disease in mice deficient in the enzyme α-mannosidase II (αM-II) that appears to be driven solely by a mechanism involving an innate immune response (Green et al., 2007Green R.S. Stone E.L. Tenno M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2007; (Published online August 2, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2007.06.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Aging αM-II null mice acquire symptoms characteristic of SLE and lupus nephritis including high titers of anti-DNA antibody, immunoglobulin deposition in the kidney and other tissues, glomerulonephritis, renal dysfunction, and kidney failure. To assess the role of antibodies and the adaptive immune system in the pathology of the disease, mice lacking αM-II were crossed with RAG-1-deficient mice, which are incapable of producing T and B lymphocytes. Surprisingly, the absence of an adaptive immune system exacerbated and accelerated the onset of the SLE-like disease, demonstrating that the initiation and propagation of the disease was independent of an immune response to self antigen. High dose intravenous immunoglobulin actually reduced the disease pathology, suggesting that the adaptive immune system had a moderating effect. These and supporting results led to the conclusion that the disease is mediated by an innate immune response resulting from αM-II deficiency. So, what is the link between αM-II deficiency and induction of an autoimmune-like disease? The αM-II enzyme carries out a key step in the biosynthesis of N-linked glycans of glycoproteins and is constitutively expressed in most cell types. Its function is to complete the trimming of mannose residues from the high-mannose type N-linked glycans of newly synthesized glycoproteins, prior to addition of terminal “complex” sugars to the three mannose core structure (Figure 1A). Without this step, the cell makes “hybrid” structures that contain two additional mannose residues on one branch of the N-linked glycans. The deficiency of αM-II has a minimal effect on glycan biosynthesis in most cell types because another mannosidase, αM-IIx, can compensate for the absence of αM-II. In cells deficient in both αM-II and αM-IIx, glycoproteins are produced with the aberrant hybrid type structures. In αM-II null mice, hybrid structures are increased in serum glycoproteins and are abundantly expressed on kidney cells and cells of the erythroid lineage. Green et al. provide evidence that the abnormal presence of hybrid glycoprotein structures acts as a trigger for the induction of an innate immune response mediated by members of the C-type lectin family that are specific for mannose. The serum mannose binding lectins (MBL-A and MBL-B) are soluble lectins that mediate innate immunity to pathogenic bacteria and fungi that express mannose-containing glycans. The cell surface macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) is similarly thought to participate in innate immune responses, and its expression has been documented on kidney mesangial cells (Linehan et al., 1999Linehan S.A. Martinez-Pomares L. Stahl P.D. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Robinson et al., 2006Robinson M.J. Sancho D. Slack E.C. LeibundGut-Landmann S. Reis e Sousa C. Nat Immunol. 2006; 7: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In αM-II null mice, MBL lectins are deposited on kidney glomeruli that express high levels of mannose-containing glycans. Mesangial cells also express increased levels of MMR, which can bind mannose-containing ligands in the serum. Elevated levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), produced by activated mesangial cells, account for the influx of activated macrophages. From these findings, Green et al. propose that the aberrantly expressed mannose-containing glycans in αM-II null mice act as a trigger for an innate immune response mediated by mannose-specific C-type lectins programmed to recognize high mannose glycans as a PAMP. This results in production of MCP-1 and recruitment and activation of macrophages. The macrophages then serve as the primary effector cells that cause tissue damage and loss of kidney function. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Or, in this case, the adaptive or innate immune response? The demonstration of anti-DNA antibodies in serum of αM-II null mice led the investigators to initially conclude that the SLE-like disease was caused by an aberrant adaptive immune response to self antigens. In fact, this now appears secondary to the primary disease mechanism. The surprisingly minor roles of autoantibodies in the disease mechanisms of the motheaten mice and αM-II null mice are strikingly similar. The take-home lesson may be to keep an open mind with respect to the roles of the adaptive and innate immune responses in mechanisms of autoimmune disease.

In this study we tested the role of N-terminal extension on MPG hypoxanthine (Hx) cleavage activity. Our results showed that MPG lacking N-terminal extension excises hypoxanthine with significantly reduced efficiency, one-third of that exhibited by full-length MPG under similar conditions. Steady-state kinetics showed full-length MPG has higher Vmax and lower Km than NΔ100 MPG. Real time binding experiments by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy suggested that truncation can substantially increase the equilibrium binding constant of MPG toward Hx, but under single-turnover conditions there is apparently no effect on catalytic chemistry; however, the truncation of the N-terminal tail affected the turnover of the enzyme significantly under multiple turnover conditions. Real time binding experiments by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy further showed that NΔ100 MPG binds approximately six times more tightly toward its product apurinic/apyrimidinic site than the substrate, whereas full-length MPG similarly binds to both the substrate and the product. We thereby conclude that the N-terminal tail in MPG plays a critical role in overcoming the product inhibition, which is achieved by reducing the differences of MPG binding affinity toward Hx and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and thus is essential for the Hx cleavage reaction of MPG.

We thereby conclude that the N-terminal tail in MPG plays a critical role in overcoming the product inhibition, which is achieved by reducing the differences of MPG binding affinity toward Hx and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and thus is essential for the Hx cleavage reaction of MPG. The results from this study also affirm the need for reinvestigation of full-length MPG for its enzymatic and structural properties, which are currently available mostly for the truncated protein. Cellular DNA is continuously damaged by various endogenous or exogenous chemical or physical agents. Multiple DNA repair pathways repair damaged bases and prevent cell death and mutations responsible for genomic instability, cancer, and aging (1Lindahl T.

In all organisms, repair of DNA-containing small adducts, as well as altered and abnormal bases, occurs primarily via the base excision repair pathway, beginning with cleavage of the base by a DNA glycosylase.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we showed that MPG is organized into three distinct domains with a protease-hypersensitive ∼100-amino acid region at the N terminus (13Roy R. Kumar A. Lee J.C. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23690-23697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also found that truncated (NΔ100CΔ18) and full-length enzymes retained similar binding and kinetic properties toward ϵA (7Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Later, several x-ray structures of human truncated MPG in complex with ϵA or control DNA were published with the notion that the seemingly unstructured (protease-sensitive) N-terminal extension may hinder crystallization of MPG (14Labahn J.

U. S. A. 2000; 5: 13573-13578Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). But different studies by us and others showed that the N-terminal extension of MPG could be critical for recognition of substrates such as 3-methylguanine, 7-methylguanine, and 1,N2-ethenoguanine (1,N2-ϵG) adducts (9Roy R. Kennel S.J. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2177-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Saparbaev M. Langouet S. Privezentzev C.V. Guengerich F.P. Cai H. Elder R.H. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26987-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Notably, there is a report that truncated and full-length forms of human MPG do not show a significant difference in Hx cleavage activity, although the long incubation period, instability of the full-length MPG, and insufficient kinetic details could have contributed to such results (11Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Hx is one of the preferred substrates elucidated so far for MPG or related enzymes that are ubiquitously present in all organisms, including humans (18O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hx was shown to be significantly mutagenic (19Hill-Perkins M. Jones M.D. Karran P. Mutat. Res. 1986; 162: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Lindahl T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1979; 22: 135-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated through analyzing individual intermediate kinetic steps that the N-terminal tail is crucial for MPG binding to Hx, dissociation from its product AP site, and its overall turnover. However, it does not have an effect on catalysis of Hx-containing DNA. The results from this study also underscore the need for the reinvestigation of full-length MPG for its enzymatic and structural properties, which are currently available in literature primarily for the truncated protein. Purification of Recombinant Mouse MPG—Mouse MPG wild type was purified as previously described (7Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cloning and Purification of NΔ100 MPG—An expression construct encoding NΔ100 mMPG was prepared by ligating a PCR product containing the MPG coding sequence but lacking the first 100 amino acid residues at the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pRSETB vector. PCR was carried out using a previous mouse MPG (NΔ48) construct as template and the primers (5′-CATATGGACCATTCTGGCCGGCTA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTTACTTTTGAACAATTAAAAGCCCC-3′). The primers allowed the introduction of NdeI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR products were then subcloned in pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector digested with NdeI and EcoRI and subcloned into expression vector pRSETB at NdeI/EcoRI sites, allowing us to express a nonfusion NΔ100 mMPG protein. The identity of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. NΔ100 mMPG was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified to near electrophoretical homogeneity. The purification was carried out as follows. The conditions for cell growth and induction of protein expression were as described previously (9Roy R. Kennel S.J. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2177-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For purification, the cells were harvested from 1 liter of culture in 50 ml of Buffer A (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.1, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT). The cells were then lysed as described previously (7Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied onto tandemly attached ion exchange columns consisting of Q Sepharose (5 ml) and SP Sepharose (1 ml), which were pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The columns were washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A. The Q column was then detached, and the SP column was eluted with a gradient of 0–100% of Buffer B (Buffer A plus 600 mm NaCl) in Buffer A. The peak fractions containing NΔ100 mMPG, tested by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and diluted three times with Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.8 m ammonium sulfate, 1 mm DTT) before loading onto a hydrophobic phenyl Sepharose column that was pre-equilibrated with Buffer C. After washing with Buffer C, the protein was eluted using a linear gradient of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). The peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer E (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT), and stored at -80 °C in aliquots for future use. Oligonucleotide Substrates Preparation—Hx and ϵA containing 50-mer oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-TCGAGGATCCTGAGCTCGAGTCGACGXTCGCGAATTCTGCGGATCCAAGC-3′ (where X represents Hx) were purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) and Gene Link (Hawthorne, NY). The complementary oligonucleotide containing T opposite Hx was synthesized by the Recombinant DNA Laboratory Core Facility at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX). The oligonucleotides were purified on a sequencing gel. The Hx or ϵA oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP and annealed to complementary oligonucleotide to prepare 32P-end-labeled duplex oligonucleotide as described previously (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MPG-mediated Excision Activity Assay—The MPG proteins, mouse full-length (15–30 nm) and NΔ100 (15–30 nm) were individually incubated with 5′-32P-labeled Hx-containing duplex oligonucleotide substrates (4–8 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C in an assay buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by inactivating the enzyme at 75 °C for 5 min. The products containing the AP sites were analyzed as described previously (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetic Study—The full-length or truncated enzyme (8.5 nm) was incubated with 5′-32P-labeled Hx-containing duplex oligonucleotide (0–60 nm) substrates for 5 min at 37 °C under assay conditions similar to those described above. The reaction products were also analyzed and quantified as described for the activity assay. DNA Binding Studies Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—A 50-mer duplex oligonucleotide containing an Hx or abasic site (tetrahydrofuran) at the 26th position from the 5′ end of one strand was used for measuring enzyme-DNA interactions. Oligonucleotides were biotinylated and immobilized on streptavidin-coated Biacore chips (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Then we measured the binding parameters of truncated (0–300 nm) or full-length MPG (0–25 nm) for Hx and abasic site using a binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% surfactant) at 25 °C. The MPGs at various concentrations were injected, and the surface plasmon resonance units were measured, with 60-s injections. Following each injection, the chip was regenerated with 1 m NaCl. The binding kinetics for oligonucleotides containing Hx or AP sites were established with a series of MPG concentrations. The Langmuir isotherms (1:1 binding) at various protein concentrations allowed us to calculate the kinetic binding parameters based on on/off rates and protein concentrations. Single-Turnover (STO) Kinetic Study—The full-length (20–40 nm) and truncated enzymes (450–900 nm) were individually incubated with 2 nm of 5′-32P-labeled Hx-containing duplex oligonucleotide substrates at 37 °C in an assay buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) in a total volume of 100 μl. Aliquots of 5 μl were taken out at different time points (0–17 min) and heat-inactivated at 80 °C in a preheated micro centrifuge tube. The products containing the AP sites were quantitatively cleaved into smaller fragments, followed by resolution on denaturing gels. Radioactivity in the incised oligonucleotide was also quantified as described in the activity assay. Burst Analysis—The enzymes (10 nm) were individually incubated with 5′-32P-labeled Hx-containing duplex oligonucleotide (84–112 nm) at 37 °C under conditions similar to those described in the STO kinetic study. Purification of NΔ100 MPG and MPG-mediated Excision Activity Assay—The wild type and NΔ100 MPGs were purified using the methods described under “Materials and Methods.” Both the proteins were 85–88% pure electrophoretically (Fig. 1). Then the activity of the purified full-length and truncated MPG was measured using Hx as a substrate. The full-length MPG had 2–3-fold more activity than the truncated protein at different enzyme:substrate (2–4:1) molar ratios, indicating that the overall decreasing effect on product formation during the Hx reaction can most likely be attributed to the deletion of the N-terminal extension. Thus, it appears that that the N-terminal extension plays a role in the excision activity of MPG toward Hx (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2MPG-mediated excision of Hx.Left panel, 15 and 30 nm concentrations of full-length and NΔ100 MPGs were reacted with a 50-mer 32P-labeled Hx-containing oligonucleotide (8 nm) at 37 °C for 10 min.

The data represent the mean values with standard error derived from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Steady-state Kinetic Study—To understand the mechanism of reduced activity of truncated MPG, we then compared the steady-state kinetic parameters for both the full-length and truncated MPGs. We measured the full-length as in a previous study (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) but included NΔ100 MPG here and found that NΔ100 MPG has significantly higher Km and lower Vmax compared with its full-length counterpart (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of N-terminal tail on steady-state kinetics of MPG-Hx reactions The reaction conditions are described under “Materials and Methods.”ProteinKmVmaxTurnovernmnmol/min/nmol of MPGmin–1MPG35 ± 1.56 ± 0.26.6 ± 0.2NΔ100 MPG84 ± 91 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Mechanism Analysis to Understand the Role of N-terminal Tail in Hx-MPG Reaction—To have further insight into this mechanism, we used both surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and pre-steady-state kinetics. In Fig. 3 we described the basic reaction steps of MPG, which are slightly modified from our published scheme (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previously, we hypothesized that the cleaved base will be diffused spontaneously, but that may not be the case. The cleaved base may still remain bound with the enzyme by a specific hydrogen bond (details under “Discussion”). Therefore, the dissociation of both products from MPG may contribute to the overall product dissociation rate. Using surface plasmon resonance, we measured the binding of MPG toward substrate (Hx) and product (abasic site). Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis provides the opportunity to identify the intermediate reaction step(s) that might be affected by the N-terminal tail. We took advantage of the slow reaction rates of MPG and measured the effect of the N-terminal tail on the glycosidic bond cleavage (catalysis) step by STO kinetics and the product dissociation step by multiple turnover reaction conditions. Hx Binding Studies Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—In search of a mechanism of modulation of MPG activity by N-terminal extension, we examined the MPG-Hx binding using a Biacore-T100 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Our results showed that the equilibrium binding constant (KD) is 0.15 nm for the full-length protein, whereas it is 25 nm for the truncated one (Fig. 4). Apparently, the major effect of N-terminal extension on KD is primarily due to the high rate of microscopic association (kon; 4.03 ± 0.4 × 108m-1 s-1) for full-length MPG, which is close to the diffusion-controlled limit (109m-1 s-1) (22Miao F. Bouziane M. O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal extension plays a significant role in Hx recognition and binding. STO Kinetics—Prompted by the observation that the N-terminal tail could play a critical role in product formation in Hx-MPG reactions, we tested whether the N-terminal tail affects any of the catalytic intermediate steps other than the binding step. We conducted STO kinetics with full-length MPG proteins to measure the kchem (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Porello S.L. Leves A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at substrate and enzyme concentrations of 2 and 20–40 nm for full-length enzyme or 450–900 nm for truncated enzyme, respectively. The data were analyzed using the first order rate equation, [P] t=A0{1−exp(−kobst)}(Eq. 1) where A0 represents the amplitude of the exponential phase, and kobs is the observed rate constant associated with the reaction process. Under the STO conditions ([E] >> [S]), all of the substrate molecules should remain bound by enzymes. The binding step should not affect the rate of product formation, and hence, under these conditions kobs can be considered as kchem. Two different enzyme substrate ratios for both of the proteins provide similar values of kchem, ensuring the enzymatic reactions following STO conditions. However, the full-length and NΔ100 MPG have similar kchem (0.3 ± 0.03) (Fig. 5), indicating the minimal effect of N-terminal extension on the chemistry step of MPG-Hx reaction. Burst Analysis—Next, we tried to measure the rate of product release (kpd) and active enzyme concentration available for the reaction (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Roy R. J. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The extremely slow turnover rate of MPG during excision of Hx provided the opportunity to perform burst analysis under the reaction conditions of [S] >> [E], where the substrate and enzyme concentration were 84–112 and 10 nm, respectively. The data were fit to the following equation. [P] t=A0{1−exp(−kobst)}+ksst(Eq. 2) Plot of product concentration (Pt) versus time (t) can be analyzed using Equation 2 as before (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Porello S.L. Leves A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) to determine the kinetic parameters, A0 (amplitude of the burst) and kss (slope of the linear phase; turnover). At full-length MPG and Hx concentrations of 5 and 50 nm, we previously found a kpd value (0.016 ± 0.001 min-1) that was low and apparently rate-limiting in the MPG-mediated multi-step reaction process (21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we found a similar kpd value for full-length MPG, but notably at the same MPG and Hx concentrations the truncated protein had much lower turnover (Fig. 6). In fact, the dissociation was extremely slow, and it was neither practical nor possible to perform curve fitting to assign an accurate value of kpd for the truncated protein. Therefore, it is evident that the N-terminal extension regulates the product dissociation rate or MPG turnover for Hx reactions in a significant fashion in addition to its modulating effect on the substrate binding step. AP Site Binding Studies Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—Further, we asked whether the N-terminal extension has any direct effect on MPG-AP site interactions to reflect the poor product dissociation rate and turnover of truncated MPG. We directly measured the binding kinetics of full-length and NΔ100 MPGs to AP sites using a Biacore-T100. Our results showed an apparent equilibrium binding constant (KD) of 0.18 nm for the full-length protein, whereas 4.3 nm was found for the truncated one (Fig. 7). Apparently, the truncated MPG binds AP sites with ∼6-fold higher affinity than to its substrate Hx, whereas the full-length protein has affinity comparable with that of both AP site and Hx (Figs. 4 and 7). These results indicate that the N-terminal extension plays a critical role in assisting MPG to overcome product inhibition and ensure facile turnover. N-terminal extension is present in all MPGs from higher eukaryotes. This suggests an evolutionarily conserved critical function of the N-terminal tail for MPG activity. However, neither the structure of MPG including the N-terminal tail nor the role of this extension in enzymatic activity is fully elucidated yet. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal tail is a regulatory domain and is essential for MPG turnover. We found in a previous study that the N-terminal tail also had a modulating effect on the function of a bifunctional DNA glycosylase, such as human endonuclease III, but it inhibited the turnover of this enzyme and in turn its activity (24Liu X. Roy R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In fact, the truncation of the N-terminal tail stimulated human endonucleases III activity at the product dissociation step (24Liu X. Roy R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the present study shows that the truncation of the N-terminal tail inhibited MPG activity. Thus, the N-terminal tail apparently regulates the activity of DNA glycosylases, such as a monofunctional enzyme MPG and a bi-functional NTH1, but in a diverse manner. We had shown before by systematic deletion analysis of MPG from N and C termini that a minimally sized polypeptide (NΔ100CΔ18) lacking 100 and 18 amino acid residues from the N and C termini, respectively, and wild type enzyme had similar kinetic and binding properties for ϵA (7Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since then, there have been several reports on the crystallographic structures of similarly truncated protein in complex with ϵA or control DNA (14Labahn J. Scharer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

A. 2000; 5: 13573-13578Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). But our present study indicates that the structural information on ϵA-truncated MPG complex is not sufficient and does not reveal the full scenario for other DNA adducts including Hx. In another previous study with a recombinant chimeric protein containing N- and C-terminal halves of human and mouse MPG, we found that the N-terminal half is critical for the recognition of 3-methylguanine and 7-methylguanine (9Roy R. Kennel S.J. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2177-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, both of the methylated substrates were positively charged, and the proteins were partially purified, so it was of interest to evaluate the role of the N-terminal tail for MPG activity toward a neutral substrate, such as Hx. From this study, it is apparent that the mode of action of MPG toward Hx and ϵA are strikingly different. The first 70 amino acid residues of hMPG were also indispensable for 1,N2-ϵG excision reaction (17Saparbaev M. Langouet S. Privezentzev C.V. Guengerich F.P. Cai H. Elder R.H. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26987-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), because the N-terminally truncated protein was less active toward 1,N2-ϵG. However, unlike Hx the 1,N2-ϵG binding was not affected by truncation; rather, a possible change in the catalytic pocket or lack of amino acids specifically involved in the catalysis of that substrate was suggested to be the cause (17Saparbaev M. Langouet S. Privezentzev C.V. Guengerich F.P. Cai H. Elder R.H. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26987-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that 1,N2-ϵG has yet to be detected in genomic DNA of biological samples (17Saparbaev M. Langouet S. Privezentzev C.V. Guengerich F.P. Cai H. Elder R.H. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26987-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown by detailed mechanistic analysis of all three major steps in the MPG-Hx reaction that product formation is affected by the N-terminal tail. Nonetheless, being a broad substrate enzyme, MPG must be flexible for DNA binding to recognize DNA lesions of varied structures. In fact, for similar reasons O'Brien and Ellenberger (18O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) proposed that a “nonspecific catalytic mechanism” must be met for an enzyme to succeed as a generalist as one of the major criteria, which comes “at the expense of catalytic power.” In the future, it would be interesting to study the details of the binding and catalytic mechanisms of full-length MPG toward substrates other than Hx of different structures, including N-3 and N-7 of deoxyguanine adducts generated by nitrogen and sulfur mustards (26Mattes W.B. Lee C.S. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Obviously, the structures of these MPG-cleavable adducts containing large modifications, especially at N-7 of deoxyguanine, are very different from those of Hx and ϵA. Another interesting point is that the equilibrium binding constant (KD) between MPG and Hx is entirely different for the full-length and truncated versions. The KD is apparently ∼160-fold less for NΔ100 MPG compared with full-length protein, but overall product formation is only ∼3-fold different. One possible explanation could be that compared with its chemistry and turnover step, the binding of MPG to Hx is extremely fast, as is evident from the kon value of 4.03 ± 0.4 × 108m-1 s-1, which is close to the diffusion-controlled limit (109m-1 s-1). Thus, the chemistry or turnover should provide the overall rate determining step. The effect of the N-terminal tail on turnover is significant, because there is no apparent turnover of NΔ100 MPG caused by product inhibition, whereas the latter is less significant for full-length MPG. Interestingly, the koff (from surface plasmon resonance studies) of two different forms of MPG for AP site are similar. However, the turnover (kss) of the truncated MPG is extremely slow compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 6). This could be explained by the apparent relative affinity of both the proteins toward Hx and AP site DNA (Figs. 4 and 7). Notably, kpd is composed of koff values for both free base and the AP site containing DNA. Moreover, the kss consists of kpd and the effective rate constant (k′) for the process, MPG + Hx-DNA→MPG·AP site DNA (details discussed in Refs. 21Adhikari S. Toretsky J.A. Yuan L. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Porello S.L. Leves A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Generally, for obtaining the definite value for product dissociation from burst kinetics, it is assumed that kpd is much slower than the k′, and thus the contribution of the latter is ignored, and kss becomes identical to kpd. But huge product inhibition in the case of N-terminally truncated MPG obscures that assumption, and therefore, an accurate kpd value for the truncated protein could not be assigned. Therefore, the overall effect on product formation is apparently arising from the alternations in the turnover step, and also the N-terminal extension is playing a critical role in that regard. N-terminally truncated hMPG also showed ∼5-fold higher affinity toward AP sites than Hx (22Miao F. Bouziane M. O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The contribution of free base in the overall product dissociation cannot be ruled out. From the tertiary structures of MPG in complexes with ϵA-containing DNA, it was suggested that the enzyme selects the substrate bases through a combination of hydrogen bonds and the steric constraints of the active site (18O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Several other principles, such as shape and electrostatic properties of the binding pocket that accepts the flipped-out nucleotide, also dictate MPG to select its substrates. As revealed from crystal structures, the backbone amide of His-136 donates a hydrogen bond to the etheno N-6 nitrogen of ϵA (18O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond can discriminate against adenine, which has a 6-amino group that cannot accept a hydrogen bond (18O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, this hydrogen bond may also be important in discrimination and excision of Hx and ϵA and perhaps in the dissociation of the cleaved base. Notably, the microscopic dissociation rates of full-length and NΔ100 MPGs from MPG-Hx complex (koff) are comparable, whereas the kon of these proteins are significantly different. Full-length MPG binds Hx at a ∼500-fold faster rate than NΔ100. The most probable explanation could be that MPG lacking N-terminal tail must collide with the substrates multiple times before engaging in a productive binding leading to catalysis. This indicates that without the N terminus, MPG possibly changes its conformation, or the N terminus in the full-length enzyme helps guide productive interaction with the modified base. Surprisingly, the differences in kon values for the subsequent product, an abasic site, are only ∼10-fold for these two proteins. However, the apparent lack of an effect for the N terminus for AP site binding further underscores the importance of the N-terminal tail for substrate binding. In the future, it would be interesting to study in detail the role of the N-terminal tail in substrate binding and perhaps in scanning and base flipping. Furthermore, the reinvestigation of biochemistry, kinetics, and structural analysis of full-length MPG (so far elucidated for truncated protein) with different substrates is undoubtedly important.

To analyze the pathway of OHT-ERα-induced apoptosis, we developed stably transfected lines of HeLa cells expressing wild-type ER and an inactive mutant ERα unable to bind estrogen response elements. HeLa cells expressing the mutant ERα and HeLa cells expressing wild-type ERα in which the ER was knocked down with an ER-specific small interfering RNA were not killed by Tam or OHT, suggesting that estrogen response element-mediated transcription is required for Tam- and OHT-induced apoptosis. Microarray analysis to identify a gene(s) whose expression is important in OHT-ER-mediated apoptosis identified 19 mRNAs that OHT up-regulated by >1.6-fold and 15 down-regulated mRNAs. Gene function and the time course of induction by OHT-ERα led us to further investigate CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), which has roles in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and p21. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot analysis, and RNA interference knockdown suggest that cell cycle arrest resulting from OHT-ERα induction of p21 may facilitate apoptosis. OHT-ERα, but not E2-ERα, induced C/EBPα mRNA and protein. RNA interference knockdown of C/EBPα nearly abolished OHT-ERα-induced apoptosis. We isolated stable cell lines that were resistant to OHT-induced apoptosis, contain full-length functional ERα, and undergo apoptosis in response to etoposide. In these OHT-resistant cell lines both before and after OHT treatment, C/EBPα levels are much lower than in OHT-sensitive cells.

Binding of a potent estrogen such as 17β-estradiol (E2) to the ER may induce dissociation of ER from a heat shock protein/chaperone complex (1Klinge C.M. Brolly C.L. Bambara R.A. Hilf R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 283-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and enable the ER to dimerize and bind to specific DNA sequences termed estrogen response elements (EREs) (2Nilsson S. Makela S. Treuter E. Tujague M. Thomsen J. Andersson G. Enmark E. Pettersson K. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1535-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Transcription activation by ERs is mediated by two interacting activation functions, AF1 and AF2. AF1 mediates ligand-independent transactivation and is thought to be especially important in transcription by the clinically important selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen (Tam), and by its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). AF2 activity depends on estrogen binding to the ER ligand binding domain (LBD) (3Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 4Webster N.J. Green S. Jin J.R. Chambon P.

White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). When bound to estrogen, the ER LBD assumes a conformation that enables the recruitment of coactivators. The bound coactivators help assemble a multiprotein complex that facilitates both chromatin remodeling and formation of an active transcription complex (8Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). When bound to Tam or OHT, the ligand binding domain of ER assumes a different conformation that interferes with coactivator binding and appears to facilitate corepressor binding (9Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). By competing with E2 and other estrogens for binding to the ligand binding site of ER, Tam and OHT may induce formation of an ER complex that is unable to effectively activate transcription of estrogen-regulated genes important in the growth and development of estrogen-dependent tumors. Tam and OHT can both arrest cell growth by preventing the growth promoting activities of E2 and can induce death of both ER-positive and ER-negative cells (10Ferlini C. Scambia G. Marone M.

Tam triggers apoptosis in vitro and shrinks some tumors in vivo. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain tamoxifen-induced cell death including transcriptional regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins (13Zhang G.J. Kimijima I. Onda M. Kanno M. Sato H. Watanabe T. Tsuchiya A. Abe R. Takenoshita S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2971-2977PubMed Google Scholar), activating mitogen-activated protein kinase and other kinases through nongenomic pathways (11Mandlekar S. Kong A.N. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and triggering an increase of intracellular Ca2+ (14Kim J.A. Kang Y.S. Jung M.W. Lee S.H. Lee Y.S. Cancer Lett. 1999; 147: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in many of these experiments, very high μm concentrations of Tam or OHT were used, and some of the studies were carried out in cells that lack ER. To analyze these processes in cells that were otherwise identical and differed only in the presence or absence of ER, we analyzed Tamand OHT-induced cell death in ER-negative HeLa cells stably transfected to express hERα (HeLaER6 (15Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). We identified two pathways by which OHT induces cell death. When ER-negative HeLa cells are maintained in medium containing 10–20 μm Tam, OHT, E2, or raloxifene, the cells die within 24 h by a reactive oxygen-based pathway that triggers classical caspase-dependent apoptosis (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Low (nm) concentrations of OHT and submicromolar concentrations of Tam do not kill or damage ER-negative HeLa cells (Fig. 1). When ER positive HeLaER cells are maintained in medium containing 1–100 nm OHT, they undergo apoptosis over several days. The antagonist ICI 182,780, the selective estrogen receptor modulator, raloxifene, and E2 protect the cells against OHT-ER-mediated cell death, suggesting a role for ERα (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the most widely accepted current standard of proof for the involvement of a protein in a response, demonstrating an effect using RNAi knockdown was not performed. The mechanism(s) by which low concentrations of OHT induce cell death remains largely unknown. The long time course of OHT-ERα-induced cell death suggested that genomic processes based on ER-regulated transcription were likely to be important. In this study we analyzed the role of ERα-mediated gene transcription in OHT-ER-induced cell death. We initially used RNAi and stable transfection of mutant ERs to examine the requirement for ERα and for ERα-mediated gene transcription. Because these experiments supported a role for OHT-ERα-mediated gene transcription in cell death, we carried out microarray analysis. The microarray data, more detailed regulatory studies, and what was known about their function led us to focus on CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and p21/waf1/CDKN1A/Cip1. C/EBPα and p21 encoded proteins whose roles in cell growth and cell death and expression patterns were consistent with a possible role in OHT-ERα-dependent apoptosis. CEBP/α was originally reported as a transcriptional factor containing a basic leucine zipper DNA binding motif (17Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 18Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 19Agre P. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). C/EBPα is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to tumor necrosis factor α (20Xu L.X. Sui Y.F. Wang W.L. Liu Y.F. Gu J.R. Chin. Med. J. (Engl. Ed.). 1994; 107: 596-599PubMed Google Scholar, 21Buck M. Zhang L. Halasz N.A. Hunter T. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6712-6723Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Williams S.C. Angerer N.D.

Roles for C/EBPα in signal transduction, inhibition of cell cycle progression based on protein-protein interactions through C-terminal interaction with p21 and cyclin-dependent kinase have been proposed (23Umek R.M.

Karp D.D. Tenen D.G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 528-534PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the roles of C/EBPα and p21 in OHT-ER-induced apoptosis and conclude that although p21 likely contributes to OHT-ER-induced apoptosis, the induction of C/EBPα by OHT-ER plays the central role in OHT-induced apoptosis. Construction of Plasmids pIE-LBD and pIE-M-DBD—Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. Plasmid pIE-LBD was constructed by subcloning the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of pCMV-hER(EF) (30Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) into pIRESIneo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid pIE-M-DBD was constructed by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) with primers 5′-GGAGTCTGGTCCTGTGCGGCCTGCAAGGCCTTCTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGAAGAAGGCCTTGCAGGCCGCACAGGACCAGACTCC-3′ on pCMV-hER. This results in the mutations E203A and G204A in ERα. The EcoRI/BamHI fragment was subcloned into pIRESIneo. Cell Culture—HeLaER cells were grown in Phenol Red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and 150 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Establishment of the HeLaER LBD and HeLaER M-DBD Cell Lines—HeLa cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes at a concentration of 1.6 × 106 cells per dish. HeLa cells obtained from ATCC were used to construct the HeLaER M-DBD and HeLaER LBD cell lines. The original ERα M-DBD mutant was a gift from Prof. L. Jameson and was recloned into the pIE plasmid (15Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with 6 μg of SspI-linearized pIE-LBD, pIE-M-DBD using Polyfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) liposome following the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was replaced with selection media (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% charcoal-dextran-fetal bovine serum, 50% conditioned medium, 500 μg/ml G418 in the HeLaER LBD and HeLaER M-DBD selections) ∼24 h post-transfection. After sufficient growth, colonies were isolated and reseeded into 24-well culture plates in selection medium. Cell lines were further expanded to confluence in 6-well plates, then T-75 flasks. For long-term growth, the cells were maintained under selection in medium containing 150∼200 μg/ml G418. ER expression was detected by Western blotting. H222 anti-ER antibody (NeoMarkers) was used to detect ER in the HeLaER LBD cells, and NCL-ER-6F11 anti-ER antibody was used to detect ER in the HeLaER M-DBD cells. Isolation of OHT-resistant Cell Lines—HeLaER cells in Phenol Red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and 150 μg/ml G418 were plated in 96-well plates at 0.5 cell/well in medium containing 100 nm OHT. After several weeks, colonies from wells containing a single colony were isolated as OHT-resistant clonal cell lines. Microarray Analysis—HeLaER cells were treated with 10 nm OHT or ethanol vehicle for 34 h. RNAs were purified with the RNeasy® kit (Qiagen). The mRNAs were reverse-transcribed to cDNAs by using Moloney murine leukemia reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Genome U133A Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The array data were initially processed by the W. M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois using the GeneChip Robust Multichip Average package in R/Bioconductor. A false discovery rate of <0.05, as determined by Significance Analysis of Microarray software (31Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9772) Google Scholar), was used to identify genes significantly regulated by ligand treatment. Expression data were then loaded into GeneSpring software and normalized to the control (ethanol-treated) samples. Microarray analysis was carried out in triplicate for OHT-treated samples and for ethanol-treated samples. Quantitative Real Time PCR—RNA levels in ethanol-treated control samples were set equal to 1. Genes up-regulated or down-regulated by OHT at least 1.6-fold were selected for quantitative RT-PCR analysis for further confirmation. RNAs from HeLaER cells treated with OHT or E2 for 4, 24, or 34 h were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with the RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen). One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 1% of the cDNA product was used in quantitative RT-PCR. The forward and reverse primer mix (1 μl of 10 μm) and 12.5 μl of SYBR® green 2× PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 25 μl were put into each well of a 96-welliCycler iQ™ PCR plate and assayed using a Bio-Rad iCycler™ optical system (Bio-Rad). PCR was as follows: 95 °C for 2 min; 45 repeats (95 °C for 25 s, 55 °C for 25 s, 72 °C for 15 s); melting from 55 to 95 °C with 0.5 °C increases per 10 s in each cycle for 80 cycles. The internal standard was 36B4 mRNA. RNA Interference—siRNA sequences were BLAST-searched against the human genome to ensure that they were sequence-specific for ERα, C/EBPα, and p21. The siRNA sequences showed no exact or near exact matches to any other sequences in the human genome. siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). ERα siRNA: 5′-AAGCUACUGUUUGCUCCUAACTT-3′ (nucleotides 1201–1223 of hERα relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon); C/EBPα siRNA: 5′-ACG AGA CGU CCA UCG ACA U-3′ (nucleotides 173–191); p21 siRNA: 5′-CAU ACU GGC CUG GAC UGU UUU-3′ (nucleotides 1943–1963 or 2083–2103 of transcript variants 1 and 2, respectively. Variant 2 contains an extra internal sequence segment in the 5′-untranslated region but encodes the same protein as Variant 1.). When cells were ∼30–40% confluent, 4 μl of the 20 μm siRNAs were transfected into the HeLaER cells in 12-well plates with Oligofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen). Western Blotting—Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (adapted from Schreiber et al. (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar)): 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma) was added right before use). After sonication on ice, the extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined with Coomassie Blue (Bio Rad). Samples were combined with 6× SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on to a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Primary and secondary antibodies were each used at a 1:1000 dilution. Primary antibodies were C/EBPα (sc-9314), p21 (sc-6246), c-Myc (sc-40), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, actin, and calnexin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and estrogen receptor α antibody (Clone 6F11, Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA). Proteins were visualized by reacting with ECL plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and band intensity was quantitated using a GE Healthcare Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Apoptosis Analysis—Apoptosis was assayed essentially as we described previously (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections—Transient transfections of HeLaER, HeLaER LBD, and HeLaER M-DBD cells were performed using Lipofectin Plus reagent (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. 100,000 cells per well were seeded in 12-well plates. After 24 h the cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of either (ATL)4-luc or AP1-luc reporter and 50 ng of pRLSV40 per well. E2 or OHT was added to a final concentration of 10 nm after transfection. After 48 h the cells were harvested, and dual luciferase assays (Promega) were performed using the manufacturer's protocol. Flow Cytometry and Light Phase Microscopy—Flow cytometry assays were performed as previously described (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol.

After treatment with 10–8 m OHT or EtOH vehicle for 3 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested using PBS-EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 40 nm of 3,3′-dihexylocarbocyanine iodide was added to the resuspended pellet, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, after which propidium iodide was added to 5 μg/ml. Relative fluorescence intensities were measured using a Coulter XL benchtop flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm. The cell sorter was also used to ascertain the light scattering properties of the cells. Cells were visualized by light phase microscopy using a TE 300 Micron Eclipse inverted fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—p values were calculated using the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Significance was established when p < 0.05. RNAi Knockdown of ERα Blocks OHT-mediated Apoptosis—Our observations that low concentrations of Tam and OHT do not induce apoptosis of wild-type ER-negative HeLa cells and that pretreatment with an excess of ICI 182,780/Faslodex (ICI), the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene (RAL), or E2 largely protected HeLaER cells from OHT- and TAM-induced death (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) strongly suggested a role for ERα in Tam- and OHT-induced cell death. To test the role of ERα more directly, we carried out an RNAi knockdown of ERα in the HeLaER cells. The cells were transfected with either the control pGL3 (luciferase) siRNA or the ER-specific siRNA. Western blot analysis showed that the ERα knockdown lasted at least 5 days (Fig. 2A). The cells were transfected with the control pGL3 siRNA or with the ERα siRNA and then treated with either EtOH vehicle or 10–8 m OHT (Fig. 2B). Cells transfected with the pGL3 siRNA and treated with OHT became sparse and exhibited the elongated morphology we previously described (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). When displayed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the OHT-treated cells transfected with the pGL3 siRNA exhibited a shoulder showing a substantial population of cells undergoing apoptosis. In contrast, in the cells in which ERα was knocked down with the ERα-specific siRNA, OHT did not cause a reduction in cell number, a change in cell morphology, or the appearance of a peak of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2B). These data clearly demonstrate that ERα mediates OHT- and TAM-induced cell death in HeLaER cells. OHT Does Not Induce Apoptosis in Stably Transfected Cell Lines Expressing ER Mutants That Do Not Bind to EREs—Although our data show that ER is required for OHT-induced cell death, the functions of ER that are essential were not known. ERα exerts its actions by rapid nongenomic actions based on modulation of signal transduction pathways (33McEwen B.S. Alves S.E. Endocr.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To identify the ER functions important in OHT-ERα-induced apoptosis, we isolated stably transfected lines of HeLa cells expressing mutant ERs defective in specific ER functions. Because the ER LBD alone reportedly is sufficient for many non-genomic actions of ER, we isolated a stably transfected cell line expressing only the ER LBD. Previous reports indicated that OHT-ERα is far more effective than E2-ERα in activating transcription when ERα is tethered to DNA through AP1 sites (46Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, prepared a stably transfected cell line containing two mutations in the ERα DNA binding domain (E203A and G204A) previously shown to nearly abolish direct binding to EREs while retaining the ability to activate transcription when tethered to an AP1 site (47Jakacka M. Ito M. Weiss J. Chien P.Y. Gehm B.D. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13615-13621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To produce the stably transfected cell lines, plasmids containing the constructs coding for the ER LBD or the ER with a mutated DNA binding domain (ER M-DBD) were constructed in the bicistronic expression plasmid that expresses the ER mutant and neomycin phosphotransferase as a bicistronic mRNA transcribed from a single promoter (15Zhang C.C. Krieg S. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 632-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After selection using medium containing G418, we showed that although the HeLa M-DBD did not efficiently activate transcription from an ERE-luciferase plasmid, it retained the capacity for ligand-dependent activation of an AP1-luciferase plasmid as previously reported (data not shown and Ref. 47Jakacka M. Ito M. Weiss J. Chien P.Y. Gehm B.D. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13615-13621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To examine the role of ER-mediated transcription in OHT-ERα-induced apoptosis, we examined at the ability of OHT to induce apoptosis of the cell lines expressing wild-type ERα, the ERα LBD that cannot activate transcription by either direct binding to DNA or through tethering, and the ERα M-DBD that only activates transcription through tethering. Very high, >10 μm, OHT should induce apoptosis through the ER-independent pathway (Fig. 1). Because all three cell lines were killed by 20μm OHT, they remained sensitive to caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 3, 2 × 10–5 m). OHT at 10–1000 nm should induce apoptosis through the ER-dependent pathway (Fig. 1). The HeLaER, HeLaER LBD, and HeLaER M-DBD cell lines were maintained in medium containing either ethanol vehicle or the indicated concentrations of OHT (10 nm to 20 μm) for 3 days, and cell death was determined (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As expected, OHT at 10–1000 nm induced apoptosis in the HeLaER cells. Neither the HeLaER LBD nor the HeLaER M-DBD cell lines were killed by 10–1000 nm OHT (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with Tam (data not shown). These data support the idea that ERE-mediated transcription is required for OHT-ERα-induced apoptosis. ICI Protects HeLaER Cells from OHT-induced Cell Death up to 33 h Post-OHT Treatment—We previously reported that ICI 182,780 does not induce apoptosis. By competing with OHT for binding to ERα, the addition of excess ICI 182,780 blocks OHT-ERα-induced apoptosis (16Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether ICI can protect HeLaER6 cells when it is added to the medium after OHT, HeLaER6 cells were treated with 10–8 m OHT and 10–6 m ICI 182,780 0, 2, 12, 24, 33, 36, and 48 h after OHT treatment. Consistent with our earlier report, the addition of an excess of ICI 182,780 at the same time as OHT blocked OHT-induced apoptosis. Surprisingly, the addition of ICI 182,780 up to 33 h after OHT also blocked OHT-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4). By 36 h the cells commit"
