https://openalex.org/W2165700458,"Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large data sets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships."

https://openalex.org/W2157959019,"Circadian co-regulators cryptochrome 1 and 2 are shown to alter globally the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Mammalian metabolism follows a regular 24-hour or circadian pattern. The major hormonal circuits, including that of the glucocorticoids, are linked to the circadian clock, but the nature of the linkage is poorly understood. This study shows that two clock co-regulators, cryptochromes 1 and 2, interact with the glucocorticoid receptor in a ligand-dependent manner to influence gene expression and normal metabolic homeostasis, and thus change the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are used clinically to suppress inflammation, but their nonspecific mode of action has been linked with various undesirable side effects. Altering the timing of treatment, or combining it with agents that specifically target the cryptochromes, may help to alleviate these side effects. Mammalian metabolism is highly circadian and major hormonal circuits involving nuclear hormone receptors display interlinked diurnal cycling1,2. However, mechanisms that logically explain the coordination of nuclear hormone receptors and the clock are poorly understood. Here we show that two circadian co-regulators, cryptochromes 1 and 2, interact with the glucocorticoid receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote repression. In mice, genetic loss of cryptochrome 1 and/or 2 results in glucose intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis coupled with increased glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, cryptochromes 1 and 2 associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 promoter in a hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers. These results reveal a specific mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal metabolic homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2001391456,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been used empirically as standardized candles to reveal the accelerating universe even though fundamental details, such as the nature of the progenitor system and how the star explodes, remained a mystery. There is consensus that a white dwarf star explodes after accreting matter in a binary system, but the secondary could be anything from a main sequence star to a red giant, or even another white dwarf. The uncertainty stems from the fact that no recent SN Ia has been discovered close enough to detect the stars before explosion. Here we report early observations of SN 2011fe (PTF11kly) in M101 at a distance of 6.4 Mpc, the closest SN Ia in the past 25 years. We find that the exploding star was likely a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, and from the lack of an early shock we conclude that the companion was most likely a main sequence star. Early spectroscopy shows high-velocity oxygen that varies on a time scale of hours and extensive mixing of newly synthesized intermediate mass elements in the outermost layers of the supernova. A companion paper uses pre-explosion images to rule out luminous red giants and most helium stars as companions."
https://openalex.org/W2110760619,"Cells use both deterministic and stochastic mechanisms to generate cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which enables the population to better withstand environmental stress. Here we show that, within a clonal population of mycobacteria, there is deterministic heterogeneity in elongation rate that arises because mycobacteria grow in an unusual, unipolar fashion. Division of the asymmetrically growing mother cell gives rise to daughter cells that differ in elongation rate and size. Because the mycobacterial cell division cycle is governed by time, not cell size, rapidly elongating cells do not divide more frequently than slowly elongating cells. The physiologically distinct subpopulations of cells that arise through asymmetric growth and division are differentially susceptible to clinically important classes of antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W2102864190,"Use of a three-level system allows the Toffoli gate, an important primitive for quantum error correction schemes, to be implemented with many fewer elementary gates than was previously thought possible. Quantum processors based on fragile quantum coherence are especially prone to errors due to sources of disturbance inevitable in any real system. The Toffoli gate, a logic gate that makes universal reversible classical computation possible, is a key element of universal quantum computation and error-correction schemes. Its realization is challenging, requiring many single and two-qubit operations executed with high fidelity. Fedorov et al. have developed a Toffoli gate in a superconducting circuit, exploiting three-level qubits to simplify implementation. Its performance confirms the potential of macroscopic superconducting qubits in complex quantum operations. The Toffoli gate is a three-quantum-bit (three-qubit) operation that inverts the state of a target qubit conditioned on the state of two control qubits. It makes universal reversible classical computation1 possible and, together with a Hadamard gate2, forms a universal set of gates in quantum computation. It is also a key element in quantum error correction schemes3,4,5,6,7. The Toffoli gate has been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance3, linear optics8 and ion trap systems9. Experiments with superconducting qubits have also shown significant progress recently: two-qubit algorithms10 and two-qubit process tomography have been implemented11, three-qubit entangled states have been prepared12,13, first steps towards quantum teleportation have been taken14 and work on quantum computing architectures has been done15. Implementation of the Toffoli gate with only single- and two-qubit gates requires six controlled-NOT gates and ten single-qubit operations16, and has not been realized in any system owing to current limits on coherence. Here we implement a Toffoli gate with three superconducting transmon qubits coupled to a microwave resonator. By exploiting the third energy level of the transmon qubits, we have significantly reduced the number of elementary gates needed for the implementation of the Toffoli gate, relative to that required in theoretical proposals using only two-level systems. Using full process tomography and Monte Carlo process certification, we completely characterize the Toffoli gate acting on three independent qubits, measuring a fidelity of 68.5 ± 0.5 per cent. A similar approach15 to realizing characteristic features of a Toffoli-class gate has been demonstrated with two qubits and a resonator and achieved a limited characterization considering only the phase fidelity. Our results reinforce the potential of macroscopic superconducting qubits for the implementation of complex quantum operations with the possibility of quantum error correction17."

https://openalex.org/W2005425934,"Type Ia supernovae are thought to result from a thermonuclear explosion of an accreting white dwarf in a binary system, but little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physical properties of the progenitor system. There are two classes of models: double-degenerate (involving two white dwarfs in a close binary system) and single-degenerate models. In the latter, the primary white dwarf accretes material from a secondary companion until conditions are such that carbon ignites, at a mass of 1.38 times the mass of the Sun. The type Ia supernova SN 2011fe was recently detected in a nearby galaxy. Here we report an analysis of archival images of the location of SN 2011fe. The luminosity of the progenitor system (especially the companion star) is 10-100 times fainter than previous limits on other type Ia supernova progenitor systems, allowing us to rule out luminous red giants and almost all helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the exploding white dwarf."

With the exception of modest X-ray and infrared flares, Sgr A* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate and radiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low. Here we report the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass of Earth that is falling into the accretion zone of Sgr A*. Our observations tightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost radius of approach of only ~3,100 times the event horizon that will be reached in 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably mainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational force. The cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years will probe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of the super-massive black hole. The kilo-electronvolt X-ray emission of Sgr A* may brighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. There may also be a giant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and its fragments feed gas into the central accretion zone."

https://openalex.org/W2017792896,"Sensitive measurement of electrical signals is at the heart of modern science and technology. According to quantum mechanics, any detector or amplifier is required to add a certain amount of noise to the signal, equaling at best the energy of quantum fluctuations. The quantum limit of added noise has nearly been reached with superconducting devices which take advantage of nonlinearities in Josephson junctions. Here, we introduce a new paradigm of amplification of microwave signals with the help of a mechanical oscillator. By relying on the radiation pressure force on a nanomechanical resonator, we provide an experimental demonstration and an analytical description of how the injection of microwaves induces coherent stimulated emission and signal amplification. This scheme, based on two linear oscillators, has the advantage of being conceptually and practically simpler than the Josephson junction devices, and, at the same time, has a high potential to reach quantum limited operation. With a measured signal amplification of 25 decibels and the addition of 20 quanta of noise, we anticipate near quantum-limited mechanical microwave amplification is feasible in various applications involving integrated electrical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2018156694,"Changes in the upwelling and degassing of carbon from the Southern Ocean form one of the leading hypotheses for the cause of glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. We present a 25,000-year-long Southern Ocean radiocarbon record reconstructed from deep-sea corals, which shows radiocarbon-depleted waters during the glacial period and through the early deglaciation. This depletion and associated deep stratification disappeared by ~14.6 ka (thousand years ago), consistent with the transfer of carbon from the deep ocean to the surface ocean and atmosphere via a Southern Ocean ventilation event. Given this evidence for carbon exchange in the Southern Ocean, we show that existing deep-ocean radiocarbon records from the glacial period are sufficiently depleted to explain the ~190 per mil drop in atmospheric radiocarbon between ~17 and 14.5 ka."

A microorganism can respond to environmental stimuli using metabolic exchange-the transfer of molecular factors, including small molecules and proteins. Microbial interactions not only influence the survival of the microbes but also have roles in morphological and developmental processes of the organisms themselves and their neighbors. This, in turn, shapes the entire habitat of these organisms. Here we highlight our current understanding of metabolic exchange as well as the emergence of new technologies that are allowing us to eavesdrop on microbial conversations comprising dozens to hundreds of secreted metabolites that control the behavior, survival and differentiation of members of the community. The goal of the rapidly advancing field studying multifactorial metabolic exchange is to devise a microbial 'Rosetta stone' in order to understand the language by which microbial interactions are negotiated and, ultimately, to control the outcome of these conversations."

(p. 82 , published online 15 December; see the Perspective by Deplancke and Verstrepen ) found that prior exposure to mild environmental stimuli and the stimulation of a stress response in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans reduced the detrimental effects of diverse mutations. Moreover, because of interindividual variation in stress signaling, this protective effect was not the same in all individuals. In the absence of mutations, a stronger response increased stress resistance but also delayed reproduction. Such variability among individuals may be beneficial in an unpredictable environment, acting as a “bet-hedging” strategy to diversify risk."

https://openalex.org/W2088825653,"The increasing prevalence of bacteria that are insensitive to our current antibiotics emphasizes the need for new antimicrobial therapies. Conventional approaches to antibacterial development that are based on the inhibition of essential processes seem to have reached the point of diminishing returns. The discovery that diverse antibiotics stimulate a common oxidative cell-death pathway represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of bactericidal antibiotic modes of action. A number of studies, as discussed above, also provide hints about how intra- and extracellular metabolism can enable antibiotic resistance and tolerance. We have, nonetheless, just begun to understand the repertoire of tactics that bacteria use to evade antibiotics. Biosynthetic pathways for natural antibiotics are ancient, and numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance and tolerance are likely to have evolved over the past few million years. Unraveling these mechanisms will require concerted efforts by chemical biologists, microbiologists and clinicians. These efforts will benefit from the use of metabolic models and other network-biology approaches to guide investigation of processes that modulate antibiotic susceptibility. Importantly, by helping to identify common points of vulnerability as well as key differences between pathogens, these models may lead to the development of effective adjuvants, novel antibiotics and new antimicrobial strategies. There is also a crucial need to better understand how bacteria within a population cooperate to overcome antibiotic treatments. Such investigations may benefit from the use of novel chemical probes and experimental techniques to interrogate the physiology and functional dynamics of natural microbial communities. Insights gained from these studies will augment metagenomic models that can be used to identify biomolecules responsible for these cooperative strategies. Leveraging chemical biology methodologies and systems-biology approaches for further studies of microbial environments may reveal a wealth of untapped targets for the development of novel compounds to counter the growing threat of resistant and tolerant bacterial infections."

https://openalex.org/W2049476249,"The protein acetyltransferases p300 and cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein (CBP) are homologous, ubiquitously expressed proteins that interact with hundreds of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and are involved globally as transcriptional coregulators. Although these two proteins acetylate and interact with overlapping sets of proteins, we found that p300 and CBP contribute to androgen-induced regulation of distinct sets of genes in C4-2B prostate cancer cells, a model of advanced prostate cancer. CBP cannot compensate for the loss of p300 to support androgen-induced expression of many genes, such as TMPRSS2 and PSA. Global gene expression analysis indicated that 47% of androgen-regulated genes are p300-dependent in these cells, whereas, surprisingly, only 0.3% of them are CBP-dependent.

Upon binding of the ligand, the AR translocates to the nucleus where it binds directly to DNA sequences known as androgen-responsive elements (AREs), which serve as regulatory (enhancer and silencer) elements for associated genes (1Claessens F.

AR plays important roles in male reproductive system development, including the development of the prostate gland and in the onset and progression of prostate cancer (3Lamont K.R. Tindall D.J. Androgen regulation of gene expression.Adv. Cancer Res. 2010; 107: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Initially, prostate adenocarcinoma cells depend on androgens to drive their proliferation by regulating genes that control that process. This dependence on the hormone-stimulated actions of AR makes therapy possible by interfering with the physiological levels or actions of androgens either by chemical or physical castration. Androgen ablation therapy of early-stage tumors is generally successful, leading to a decrease in tumor size. However, in many cases the tumors begin to grow again, and they no longer rely on high levels of androgen for their growth or survival, although they do still depend on a functional AR. The disease is now regarded as androgen depletion-independent (ADI), and a key difference in this phenotype is hyperactivation of AR through various mechanisms. AR amplification or gain of function mutations can allow AR activation by castration levels of androgens or even by non-androgenic steroids and antiandrogens, which do not activate the wild-type AR. Enhanced activity of other signaling pathways or altered androgen metabolism can also enhance AR activity (4Dutt S.S. Gao A.C. Molecular mechanisms of castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.Future Oncol. 2009; 5: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Increased levels or activity of coregulators or posttranslational modifications to AR or coregulators as a result of deregulation of other signaling pathways can also contribute to the ADI phenotype (5Heemers H.V.

Although dozens or even hundreds of coregulators are generally recruited by DNA-bound transcription factors, including AR, to carry out the regulation of chromatin conformation and transcription complex assembly required to control transcription, increasing evidence suggests that different subsets of coregulators may be required for the transcription of different target genes (7Ma H.

Of particular relevance to this study, expression of p300 correlates positively with prostate tumor grade, tumor volume, proliferation markers, and other features of aggressive tumors (24Debes J.D. Sebo T.J. Lohse C.M. Murphy L.M. Haugen D.A. Tindall D.J. p300 in prostate cancer proliferation and progression.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7638-7640PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, over-expression of p300 is required for the transition from androgen dependent to ADI prostate cancer (6Heemers H.V. Sebo T.J. Debes J.D. Regan K.M. Raclaw K.A. Murphy L.M. Hobisch A. Culig Z. Tindall D.J. Androgen deprivation increases p300 expression in prostate cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3422-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the reasons for the importance of p300 versus CBP in advanced prostate cancer. We investigated the individual contributions that CBP and p300 make to androgen-regulated gene expression in the ADI cell line C4-2B. Our study defined the specific sets of genes that require CBP or p300 for their androgen-regulated expression. Through microarray analysis we show that there are indeed separate groups of genes that preferentially require p300 or CBP in ADI prostate cancer cells. In addition, we explored the promoter-specific mechanisms of androgen-regulated gene expression by defining the specific stage of the androgen-induced chromatin remodeling and transcription complex assembly processes at which p300, in particular, contributes to these processes. These novel findings are critical for understanding the hypersensitive actions of AR in ADI prostate cancer and lay the foundation for further study of the mechanism of progression to advanced prostate cancer and for subsequently designing novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. C4-2B cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator. Prior to any hormone treatment, cells were plated and maintained for 3 days in RPMI 1640 phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped serum, to which we will subsequently refer as treatment medium. All hormone treatments were with 10 nm DHT unless noted otherwise, and an equivalent volume of ethanol was used as the vehicle control. C4-2B cells were plated in 12-well plates in treatment medium at 8 × 104 cells per well. The following day they were transfected with 60 pmol of On-Targetplus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were maintained in treatment medium for 3 days before harvest, including treatment with 10 nm DHT for the specified times. Either human EP300, human CREBBP (CBP) On-Targetplus SMARTpool (Dharmacon), or both in combination were used. Total RNA was harvested using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen), and whole cell protein extracts were obtained using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40). Global gene expression analysis was performed at the Southern California Genotyping Consortium at University of California Los Angeles with an Illumina Human HT12v4 microarray using randomized placement of four biological replicates generated on different days. Using Illumina Genomestudio software, output of summarized probe information was done with minimal preprocessing and removal of imputed genes. These data were imported into Bioconductor (25Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y. Gentry J. Hornik K. Hothorn T. Huber W. Iacus S.

Background correction, normalization, and transformation, in that order, were done by the limma package using neqc (26Shi W. Oshlack A. Smyth G.K. Optimizing the noise versus bias trade-off for Illumina whole genome expression BeadChips.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e204Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Combat was used to remove batch effects because of experimental day bias (27Johnson W.E. Li C. Rabinovic A. Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical Bayes methods.Biostatistics. 2007; 8: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes were identified using a two-sample modified Student's t test from eBayes in the limma package (28Smyth G.K. Linear models and empirical Bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments.Stat. Appl. Genet Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9158) Google Scholar). False discovery was accounted for by using q values (29Storey J.D. The positive false discovery rate: a Bayesian interpretation and the q-value.Ann. Stat. 2003; 31: 2013-2035Crossref Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Original microarray data sets have been submitted to NCBI GEO (accession number GSE31873). Total RNA was harvested using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10–25 μg total RNA was treated with DNase I (Roche) prior to reverse transcription. For measuring mRNA, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcribing 500 ng total RNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). For measuring pre-mRNA, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the standard RT-PCR procedure with random hexamers of the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche). In each case, the resulting cDNA was diluted 5-fold, and 1.5 μl of diluted cDNA was amplified by qPCR using the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I master mix (Roche) on the LightCycler 480 system (Roche) and primers described in supplemental Table 1. C4–2B cells were plated at 3 × 106 cells per 150-mm dish in treatment medium and maintained for 3 days prior to hormone treatment and cross-linking. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (30Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. CoCoA, a nuclear receptor coactivator which acts through an N-terminal activation domain of p160 coactivators.Mol.

Cells were grown to confluence and treated with 10 nm DHT for 4 h and subsequently incubated for 10 min with a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde. Reactions were quenched for 5 min with 125 mm glycine. Cells were harvested and sonicated for 15 to 30 min (in repeated cycles of 30 s on and 30 s off) using a BioRuptor sonicator (Diagenode) kept at 4 °C with a circulating water bath to achieve fragments 200–800 bp in size. After a 1-h preclearing step using protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), chromatin was immunoprecipitated by end-over-end rotation overnight at 4 °C with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and the following antibodies: 3 μg of AR PG-21 (Millipore), 3 μg of p300 (Bethyl Laboratories), 4 μg of CBP (A-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1 μg RNA polymerase II clone CTD4H8 (Millipore), 3 μg TATA box binding protein (TBP) (N-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 0.5 μg of H3K18Ac (Abcam), 1 μg of H3K27Ac (Abcam), 1 μg of H4Ac (Millipore), 1 μg of H3K4me1 (Abcam), and 3 μg of H3K4me3 (Active Motif). Immunoprecipitates were washed and eluted, and purified DNA was obtained as described previously. Purified immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA (preimmunoprecipitation) were used as template for subsequent quantitative real-time PCR. Briefly, 1.5 μl of DNA was amplified with 2.5 pmol each of forward and reverse primer (supplemental Table 2) in a final reaction volume of 10 μl using LightCycler 480 SYBRGreen I Master mix (Roche) on a LightCylcer 480 system (Roche). Percent input was calculated using the percent input method (Invitrogen). To identify genes that are specifically regulated by p300 or CBP, we used C4-2B prostate cancer cells, a model of advanced ADI prostate cancer. These cells express AR and exhibit androgen-regulated gene expression. Transfection of cells with siRNA against p300 (sip300), CBP (siCBP), or a nonspecific sequence (siNS) specifically depleted the intended target mRNA and protein, and cellular levels of p300 and CBP mRNA and protein were not altered by DHT treatment (Fig. 1, A and B, and data not shown). For global gene expression analysis, C4-2B cells were transfected with siRNA and, after 3 days to allow depletion of the target protein, treated with DHT or vehicle for 16 h before preparing total RNA for microarray analysis. Four independent experiments were conducted on different days. Each experiment consisted of six samples: siNS vehicle, siNS DHT, si p300 vehicle, si p300 DHT, siCBP vehicle, and siCBP DHT. Of the greater than 40,000 probes present on the Illumina BeadChip, we found that a total of 676 probes were hormone-regulated (q value threshold ≤ 0.05), i.e. when we compared siNS vehicle-treated versus siNS DHT-treated samples (Fig. 1C, hormone-regulated set). Each gene or putative gene is represented by a single probe on the BeadChip with only a small number of exceptions where one gene is represented by multiple probes. Of these 676 DHT-regulated genes, 416 were up-regulated and 260 were down-regulated in response to DHT. With depletion of p300 a total of 4582 genes (q value threshold ≤ 0.05) had altered expression in the sip300 DHT sample as compared with the siNS DHT sample (Fig. 1C, p300-regulated set). One of the down-regulated genes was p300, thus validating our initial qRT-PCR and Western blot observations. Of those 4582 p300-dependent genes, 319 were also members of the 676-member DHT-regulated gene set. Thus, 47% of the DHT-regulated genes required p300 to achieve their DHT-regulated expression level. For the 416 genes that were up-regulated by DHT, depletion of p300 interfered with the DHT-induced expression levels of 218 of those (52.4%) (q value threshold ≤ 0.05). This includes the known AR target genes PSA/KLK3, KLK2, and TMPRSS2. A small number (10 genes) were hyperactivated by DHT after p300 depletion. When we look at the 260 genes down-regulated by DHT, p300 depletion interfered with the DHT-stimulated down-regulation of 69 genes (26.5%). Depletion of p300 also caused increased repression of 22 genes by DHT. The large number of DHT-regulated genes affected by p300 depletion indicates that p300 plays a major role in gene regulation by DHT, a role for which CBP cannot compensate. Surprisingly, when we analyzed the data set for CBP-dependent genes, we found that only seven genes were affected by CBP depletion (q-value threshold ≤ 0.1) (Fig. 1C, CBP-regulated set). It is important to note that we had to raise the q value cut-off to obtain these candidate genes, as a q value cut-off ≤ 0.05 did not yield any results of genes affected by CBP depletion, except for CBP itself. Of those seven genes, only two (SERPINE2 and ANXA9) also belonged to the 676-member DHT-regulated gene set. DHT normally up-regulates the SERPINE2 mRNA level, but the DHT-induced level of this mRNA was significantly reduced in the microarray data when CBP (but not p300) was depleted (Fig. 1D, left panel). ANXA9 mRNA was reduced by DHT treatment, but CBP depletion caused a significant increase in the DHT-treated level of mRNA (Fig. 1D, right panel). From the data, it appears that the basal as well as the DHT-treated levels of the mRNA were affected by CBP depletion, but the significance of these differences was not evaluated in this analysis. In the microarray data, neither of the two DHT-regulated, CBP-dependent genes was significantly altered in its DHT-regulated expression level by depletion of p300. Expression of some of the androgen-regulated, p300-dependent genes identified from the microarray analysis was examined further using qRT-PCR. Because the biological phenotype of DHT-treated cells is dependent on the level of gene expression achieved after DHT treatment, we focused our attention on the effects of p300 depletion on mRNA levels in DHT-treated cells rather than the fold induction by DHT. PSA, probably the most well characterized androgen-regulated gene, is used as a biomarker of prostate cancer onset and progression. The qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the PSA mRNA level was up-regulated in C4-2B cells after 16 h of DHT treatment (Fig. 2A). Depletion of p300 caused a decrease in both the basal and DHT-induced levels of PSA mRNA. In contrast, CBP depletion did not decrease PSA expression (the increase observed in this experiment was not reproducible). Similar results were obtained with two other DHT-regulated genes identified as p300-dependent in the microarray analysis, KLK2 and TMPRSS2. Depletion of p300, but not CBP, caused statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) decreases in the DHT induced levels of these mRNAs compared with RNA from cells treated with siNS and DHT (Fig. 2, B and C). As also predicted by the microarray results, DHT-induced levels of mRNAs for some genes were not affected by depletion of either p300 or CBP. FKBP5 is an example of such a gene (Fig. 2D). This indicates either a possible compensatory role for these cofactors on genes such as FKBP5 or no involvement of either coactivator in the expression of this gene. To discriminate between these two possibilities, siRNAs specific for p300 and CBP were transfected in combination. The DHT-induced FKBP5 mRNA level was significantly reduced only when both p300 and CBP were depleted, indicating that either p300 or CBP is required and that the function of these proteins is redundant for DHT induction of FKBP5 gene expression (Fig. 2D). We also observed other DHT-regulated genes that were modestly affected or unaffected by single coactivator depletion, whereas dual siRNA treatment caused a significant effect (data not shown). Results similar to those observed for FKBP5 were also observed for genes that were repressed by DHT. For example, the level of LMO4 mRNA decreased in response to DHT. Individual depletion of either p300 or CBP had little or no effect on the level of mRNA observed after DHT treatment, but depletion of both p300 and CBP caused a significant elevation of the DHT-depressed level of mRNA (data not shown). In general, results from the microarray and qRT-PCR analyses were in good agreement. However, there were some cases where differences that did not reach the q value cut-off in the microarray results still turned out to be significant in the qRT-PCR results. One of those differences defined a new class of genes with respect to the requirements for p300 and CBP. The microarray results for the DHT-regulated gene GADD45γ indicated a requirement for p300 (q value ≤ 0.05) but not for CBP (q value > 0.1), even though the CBP depletion appeared to reduce the level of mRNA in the presence of DHT. Likewise, in qRT-PCR analysis, depl"

We provide here the proteomic and immunological analyses that verify the identity of all six Chlamydomonas A proteins. Using sucrose density gradient centrifugation and antibody pulldowns, we show that all six A subunits are associated in a 16 S complex in both the cell bodies and flagella. A significant fraction of the cell body IFT43, however, exhibits a much slower sedimentation of ∼2 S and is not associated with the IFT A complex. To identify interactions between the six A proteins, we combined exhaustive yeast-based two-hybrid analysis, heterologous recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, and analysis of the newly identified complex A mutants, ift121 and ift122. We show that IFT121 and IFT43 interact directly and provide evidence for additional interactions between IFT121 and IFT139, IFT121 and IFT122, IFT140 and IFT122, and IFT140 and IFT144. The mutant analysis further allows us to propose that a subset of complex A proteins, IFT144/140/122, can form a stable 12 S subcomplex that we refer to as the IFT A core. Based on these results, we propose a model for the spatial arrangement of the six IFT A components."
https://openalex.org/W2095575703,"Stochastic or Asymmetric Fate Determination? During an adaptive immune response, B lymphocytes rapidly divide and differentiate into effector cell populations, including antibody-secreting plasmablasts and memory B cells. Many also change the class of antibody they secrete, through a process called isotype switching. During this process, some cells die. Whether cells acquire these different fates in a stochastic or programmed manner, however, is unclear. Duffy et al. (p. 338 , published online 5 January) used single-cell tracking to determine the times to division, differentiation into a plasmablast, isotype switching, and death of stimulated B lymphocytes. Statistical analysis and mathematical modeling revealed that these cell-fate decisions appear to be the result of random clocks: Which clock went off first (division, differentiation, or death), determined the fate of the cell. Barnett et al. (p. 342 , published online 15 December) sought to determine whether asymmetrical cell division, which is thought to contribute to effector cell-fate decisions in T cells, may be at work in B lymphocytes. Indeed, factors important for the initiation and maintenance of germinal center B lymphocyte identity, along with an ancestral polarity protein, were asymmetrically distributed and maintained their asymmetry during cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2108494101,"The mechanism by which amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) accumulation causes neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unresolved. Given that Aβ perturbs calcium homeostasis in neurons, we investigated the possible involvement of calpain, a calcium-activated neutral protease. We first demonstrated close postsynaptic association of calpain activation with Aβ plaque formation in brains from both patients with AD and transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP). Using a viral vector-based tracer, we then showed that axonal termini were dynamically misdirected to calpain activation-positive Aβ plaques. Consistently, cerebrospinal fluid from patients with AD contained a higher level of calpain-cleaved spectrin than that of controls. Genetic deficiency of calpastatin (CS), a calpain-specific inhibitor protein, augmented Aβ amyloidosis, tau phosphorylation, microgliosis, and somatodendritic dystrophy, and increased mortality in APP-Tg mice. In contrast, brain-specific CS overexpression had the opposite effect. These findings implicate that calpain activation plays a pivotal role in the Aβ-triggered pathological cascade, highlighting a target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of AD.—Higuchi, M., Iwata, N., Matsuba, Y., Takano, J., Suemoto, T., Maeda, J., Ji, B., Ono, M., Staufenbiel, M., Suhara, T., Saido, T.

We report here that zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important developmental model species, possesses six nrf genes, including duplicated nrf1 and nrf2 genes.

Zebrafish-human comparisons demonstrate conserved synteny involving nrf2 and hox genes, indicating that nrf2a and nrf2b are co-orthologs of human NRF2. nrf2a and nrf2b displayed distinct patterns of expression during embryonic development; nrf2b was more highly expressed at all stages. Embryos in which Nrf2a expression had been knocked down with morpholino oligonucleotides were more sensitive to tert-butylhydroperoxide but not tert-butylhydroquinone, whereas knockdown of Nrf2b did not affect sensitivity of embryos to either chemical. Gene expression profiling by microarray identified a specific role for Nrf2b as a negative regulator of several genes, including p53, cyclin G1, and heme oxygenase 1, in embryos. Nrf2a and Nrf2b exhibited different mechanisms of cross-talk with the Ahr2 signaling pathway. Together, these results demonstrate distinct roles for nrf2a and nrf2b, consistent with subfunction partitioning, and identify a novel negative regulatory role for Nrf2b during development.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)/p45-related factor 2 (NRF2; also called NFE2L2), 3Nomenclature is as follows. NRF is a commonly used notation for NF-E2-related factor genes, which are officially designated as NFE2L (NF-E2-like). For example, NRF2 is officially designated as NFE2L2, and NRF1 is designated as NFE2L1. Throughout the paper, we use the more common NRF designation. Otherwise, we utilize the approved format for designating genes and proteins (see the ZFIN Zebrafish Nomenclature Web site). In particular, human genes and proteins are designated using all capitals (NRF2 and NRF2, respectively), whereas zebrafish genes are designated nrf2 and Nrf2 for genes and proteins, respectively. Similarly, we refer to human and zebrafish aryl hydrocarbon receptors as AHR/AHR and ahr/Ahr, respectively.

Under normal conditions, NRF2 is maintained in the cytoplasm by a repressor protein, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (KEAP1), which targets it for ubiquitination by the 26 S proteasome. KEAP1 contains redox-sensitive cysteines that release NRF2 in the presence of redox imbalances or oxidative stress (3Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Distinct cysteine residues in Keap1 are required for Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2 and for stabilization of Nrf2 by chemopreventive agents and oxidative stress.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). NRF2 then translocates to the nucleus, where it dimerizes with small MAF proteins to activate ARE-regulated genes. The NRF2 protein consists of six Neh domains, originally assigned based upon regions identified as homologous between cross-species orthologues (4Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Keap1 represses nuclear activation of antioxidant responsive elements by Nrf2 through binding to the amino-terminal Neh2 domain.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). Within each domain, particular features have been identified that contribute to either the transactivation or stability of the protein. Neh1 contains the DNA binding domain and serves to heterodimerize with small MAF proteins. Transactivation activities are promoted by Neh3, Neh4, and Neh5. Degrons are located in Neh6 and the KEAP1 binding domain in Neh2. NRF2 can also participate in cross-talk with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. The AHR is a bHLH/PAS (basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim) family transcription factor that, upon ligand binding in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, where it dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). This dimer then recognizes xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in the promoter regions of numerous genes, such as the CYP1 family of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In the mouse, Nrf2 expression can be regulated by the AHR via three functional XREs in the promoter and first intron of Nrf2 (5Miao W. Hu L. Scrivens P.J. Batist G.

Because of a whole-genome duplication that occurred after the divergence of the fish and mammalian lineages, teleost fish often possess paralogous genes that are duplicates of single mammalian genes; the zebrafish paralogs have often partitioned the multiple functions of their mammalian ortholog, a process known as “subfunction partitioning” (9Postlethwait J.

We report here the set of six nrf genes in zebrafish, which includes duplicated nrf1 and nrf2 genes. A zebrafish ortholog of the mammalian nrf2 has been previously described (10Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Identification of the interactive interface and phylogenic conservation of the Nrf2-Keap1 system.Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); here, we identify a second nrf2 gene in zebrafish, referred to as nrf2b. We demonstrate that nrf2a and nrf2b5 have undergone subfunction partitioning and provide evidence that the Nrf2b protein functions as a repressor to regulate constitutive gene expression during embryonic development. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) of the Tupfel/Long fin mutation (TL) wild-type strain were used in all experiments. Fish were maintained, and embryos were collected under standard light and temperature conditions as described previously (19Jönsson M.E. Orrego R. Woodin B.R. Goldstone J.V. Stegeman J.J. Basal and 3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl-induced expression of cytochrome P450 1A, 1B, and 1C genes in zebrafish.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2007; 221: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Animal Care and Use Committee. tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBOOH), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). 3,3′,4,4′,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) were from Ultra Scientific (Hope, RI). Zebrafish NRF homologs were identified by using mammalian NRF2 protein sequences to search draft assemblies of the zebrafish genome (see the Zebrafish Sequencing Project Web site) using BLAST. Sequences of NF-E2-related transcripts were obtained from GenBankTM (predicted Nrf1a, Nrf1b, and Nrf3) or determined by cDNA cloning and sequencing (Nrf2b; see below). Multiple sequence alignments of the deduced proteins were performed using ClustalX (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. The CLUSTAL_X Windows interface. Flexible strategies for multiple sequence alignment aided by quality analysis tools.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35414) Google Scholar) and Muscle (version 3.8.31 (21Edgar R.C. MUSCLE. Multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30229) Google Scholar)). After masking regions of uncertain alignment, the aligned amino acid sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum parsimony and minimum evolution (distance) criteria in PAUP*4.0b8 (22Swofford D.L. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods). Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar) or the maximum likelihood criterion with RAxML (version 7.2.6 (23Stamatakis A.

Bootstrap analysis with 100 or 1000 resamplings was used to assess confidence in individual nodes. Trees were rooted using the Drosophila CNC_C protein. Additional details can be found in the figure legends. To determine whether all of these nrf genes are expressed in embryos, PCR primers were designed based on the predicted sequences (see supplemental Table S1). Samples at 24 and 48 h postfertilization (hpf) were pools of 10 embryos each, and four embryos were pooled for the 96 hpf time point. Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test B, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using the MicroPoly(A)Purist kit (Ambion). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR was performed using Amplitaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA), with a PCR cycle of 94 °C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 or 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. Products were visualized with gel electrophoresis. The full-length cDNA for nrf2b was obtained using 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR. The Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) was used to generate double-stranded cDNA from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from pooled zebrafish livers. Adaptors were ligated to both ends of the cDNAs as per the manufacturer's instructions. Nested gene-specific primers were designed and used with adaptor primers (AP1 and AP2) provided with the Marathon kit. The 5′ RACE used 5′-GGCAAGCTTGAGCTGTCAGACTCC-3′ in combination with AP1 and 5′-AAACAGCAGGGCAGACAACAAGG-3′ in combination with AP2; the 3′ RACE used 5′-CTTCACCTGTTACCCAGAATCCCT-3′ in combination with AP1 and then 5′-TCACCTGTTACCCAGAATCCCTTG-3′ in combination with AP2, and the PCR programs were as instructed by the manufacturer. The products were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), plasmids were isolated (PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System, Promega), restriction digest was performed, and products were sequenced (MWG Operon, Huntsville, AL). After obtaining the full-length sequence with RACE, we then amplified the full-length cDNA with forward primer 5′-AGCTGGAAGACATGGACGACCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACAGCAACATTTAAATCCCCTG-3′, using the proofreading Pfu Ultra II Fusion HA DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The PCR cycle was 95 °C for 1 min and then 95 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 50 s for 38 cycles, followed by 3 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector, and then the insert was transferred into the pcDNA 3.2/V5-DEST vector via site-specific recombination (Invitrogen). The construct was then confirmed for in vitro protein synthesis using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Promoter analysis for putative XREs and AREs was conducted using the JASPAR Core vertebrate data set (24Bryne J.C. Valen E. Tang M.H. Marstrand T. Winther O. da Piedade I. Krogh A. Lenhard B.

Using the position weight matrix algorithm for NFE2L2 (MA0150.1) for AREs and the ARNT:AHR (MA0006.1) algorithm for XREs, we searched 3000 bp upstream of the Nrf2a translation start site and the entire first intron and 1712 bp upstream of the Nrf2b translation start site and its first intron. A relative score of 0.80 was accepted for AREs, and 0.90 was accepted for the XREs. Potential sites were then manually evaluated, and sequences that did not contain bases known to be essential for binding activity were excluded. A manual search for AREs was also conducted to include a previously described functional zebrafish ARE variant not identified by the position weight matrix (TGA(G/C)nnnTC) (16Suzuki T. Takagi Y.

To compare the protein structure and important motif features of Nrf2b, a ClustalW multiple alignment of mouse NRF2, the three isoforms of the human NRF2 (which differ by use of an alternate promoter and also an alternate splice site), chicken ECH, and the two zebrafish Nrf2s was conducted using the BioEdit program (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. CLUSTAL W. Improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties, and weight matrix choice.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar). Percentage identity between proteins and within the Neh regions was calculated using BioEdit's Sequence Identity Matrix. Nrf2a and Nrf2b cDNAs were amplified with the primer pairs Nrf2a-GFPF/Nrf2a-GFPR and Nrf2b-GFPF/Nrf2b-GFPR (supplemental Table S1), respectively, using Pfu Ultra II DNA Polymerase (Agilent Technologies). The pCS2-nrf2a (a generous gift from Dr. Makoto Kobayashi (10Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M.

The cycling condition was 95 °C for 1 min and then 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for 20 cycles, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified and A-tailed prior to ligation into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen). Constructs were sequenced, and expression was confirmed by the TNT Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) with [35S]methionine. COS-7 monkey kidney cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were plated on coverslips in 6-well plates as described previously (28Evans B.R. Karchner S.I. Allan L.L. Pollenz R.S. Tanguay R.L. Jenny M.J.

Cells were treated 24 h after transfection with water or 100 μm tBOOH for 1 h and fixed with 4% formaldehyde (28Evans B.R. Karchner S.I. Allan L.L. Pollenz R.S. Tanguay R.L. Jenny M.J. Sherr D.H.

Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To stain nuclei, coverslips were washed with PBS, and cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton for 10 min. Cells were washed in PBS again, incubated with RNase and propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) for 30 min, and then washed with PBS. Slides were imaged immediately using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 with Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss). Ten representative fields were imaged at ×200 for each condition. The number and intensity of GFP-positive pixels that either overlapped with propidium iodide-positive pixels (nucleus) or did not overlap (cytoplasmic localization) were quantified using Axiovision co-localization software (Carl Zeiss) with access provided by the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA). Each field of cells was corrected for background fluorescence and exposure time. To provide an independent measure of subcellular localization, we also conducted a blind cell count that categorized up to 10 cells/field (61–93 cells/group) according to the localization of GFP expression within each cell: predominantly in the nucleus, in both nucleus and cytoplasm, or predominantly in the cytoplasm (no cells were found in the latter category). MOs (Gene Tools, LLC, Philomath, OR) were targeted to knock down both maternally loaded and embryonic mRNAs by inhibiting translation at the ATG start site. The Nrf2a-MO was previously described (5′-CATTTCAATCTCCATCATGTCTCAG-3′ (10Kobayashi M. Itoh K. Suzuki T. Osanai H. Nishikawa K. Katoh Y. Takagi Y. Yamamoto M. Identification of the interactive interface and phylogenic conservation of the Nrf2-Keap1 system.Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar)). The sequence for the Nrf2b-MO was 5′-AGCTGAAAGGTCGTCCATGTCTTCC-3′. The zebrafish Ahr2-MO was also previously described (5′-TGTACCGATACCCGCCGACATGGTT-3′ (29Prasch A.L. Teraoka H. Carney S.A. Dong W.

Sci. 2003; 76: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). The standard control-MO from Gene Tools was also used (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′). For the Nrf2a+b-MO combination injection, the MOs were mixed in an injection solution containing 0.1 mm Nrf2a-MO and 0.1 mm Nrf2b-MO and matched with a control-MO concentration of 0.2 mm. All MOs were tagged with a 3′-end carboxyfluorescein modification in order to monitor injection success. To confirm that the MOs were able to prevent protein synthesis in a specific manner, we used the TNT Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) for in vitro target protein transcription and translation. [35S]Methionine-labeled zebrafish Nrf2a and Nrf2b proteins were synthesized as per the manufacturer's protocols. TNT reagents were combined with 1 μl of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml), 1 μg of nrf2a in pCS2, or 1 μg of nrf2b in pcDNA 3.2/V5-DEST. To test the efficacy of the target MOs, the standard control-MO, gene-specific MO, or an MO specific for the paralogous gene was added to the reaction for a final concentration of 500 nm. Mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The labeled proteins were resolved by gel electrophoresis, dried onto Whatman filter paper, and visualized on film. Densitometric analysis was performed with AlphaView (AlphaInnotech/Cell Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA). The relative densitometric units were determined by normalizing the target MO treatments to the control-MO treatments after all densitometric values were adjusted for local background and band size. Embryos at the 1–4-cell stage were injected with 3–5 nl of Nrf2a-MO, Nrf2b-MO, control-MO, or Nrf2a-MO+Nrf2b-MO using a Narishige IM-300 Microinjector (Tokyo, Japan). Only healthy embryos exhibiting strong, uniform distribution of the fluorescent MO at 24 hpf were used in experiment"

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying the prevention of prostate cell growth by 17-HASs still remains elusive. Here, we assess the effects of 17-HASs on androgen receptor (AR) activity in LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells. We demonstrate that both TOK-001 and abiraterone reduced AR protein and mRNA expression, and antagonized AR-dependent promoter activation induced by androgen. TOK-001, but not abiraterone, is an effective apparent competitor of the radioligand [3H]R1881 for binding to the wild type and various mutant AR (W741C, W741L) proteins. In agreement with these data, TOK-001 is a consistently superior inhibitor than abiraterone of R1881-induced transcriptional activity of both wild type and mutant AR. However, neither agent was able to trans-activate the AR in the absence of R1881. Our data demonstrate that phospho-4EBP1 levels are significantly reduced by TOK-001 and to a lesser extent by abiraterone alcohol, and suggest a mechanism by which cap-dependent translation is suppressed by blocking assembly of the eIF4F and eIF4G complex to the mRNA 5′ cap. Thus, the effects of these 17-HASs on AR signaling are complex, ranging from a decrease in testosterone production through the inhibition of Cyp17 as previously described, to directly reducing both AR protein expression and R1881-induced AR trans-activation.

In contrast, reactions between two unstable radicals have received much less attention due to the added complexity of producing and measuring excess radical concentrations. We performed kinetic experiments on the barrierless N((4)S) + OH((2)Π) → H((2)S) + NO((2)Π) reaction in a supersonic flow (Laval nozzle) reactor. We used a microwave-discharge method to generate atomic nitrogen and a relative-rate method to follow the reaction kinetics.

https://openalex.org/W2006327505,"Human embryo implantation is a critical multistep process consisting of embryo apposition/adhesion, followed by penetration and invasion. Through embryo penetration, the endometrial epithelial cell barrier is disrupted and remodeled by an unknown mechanism. We have previously developed an in vitro model for human embryo implantation employing the human choriocarcinoma cell line JAR and the human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line Ishikawa. Using this model we have shown that stimulation with ovarian steroid hormones (17β-estradiol and progesterone, E2P4) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the attachment and adhesion of JAR spheroids to Ishikawa. In the present study we showed that the attachment and adhesion of JAR spheroids and treatment with E2P4 or SAHA individually induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Ishikawa cells. This was evident by up-regulation of N-cadherin and vimentin, a mesenchymal cell marker, and concomitant down-regulation of E-cadherin in Ishikawa cells. Stimulation with E2P4 or SAHA accelerated Ishikawa cell motility, increased JAR spheroid outgrowth, and enhanced the unique redistribution of N-cadherin, which was most prominent in proximity to the adhered spheroids. Moreover, an N-cadherin functional blocking antibody attenuated all events but not JAR spheroid adhesion. These results collectively provide evidence suggesting that E2P4- and implanting embryo-induced EMT of endometrial epithelial cells may play a pivotal role in the subsequent processes of human embryo implantation with functional control of N-cadherin."

https://openalex.org/W2100783291,"Caenorhabditis elegans and human HRG-1-related proteins are conserved, membrane-bound permeases that bind and translocate heme in metazoan cells via a currently uncharacterized mechanism. Here, we show that cellular import of heme by HRG-1-related proteins from worms and humans requires strategically located amino acids that are topologically conserved across species. We exploit a heme synthesis-defective Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant to model the heme auxotrophy of C. elegans and demonstrate that, under heme-deplete conditions, the endosomal CeHRG-1 requires both a specific histidine in the predicted second transmembrane domain (TMD2) and the FARKY motif in the C terminus tail for heme transport. By contrast, the plasma membrane CeHRG-4 transports heme by utilizing a histidine in the exoplasmic (E2) loop and the FARKY motif. Optimal activity under heme-limiting conditions, however, requires histidine in the E2 loop of CeHRG-1 and tyrosine in TMD2 of CeHRG-4. An analogous system exists in humans, because mutation of the synonymous histidine in TMD2 of hHRG-1 eliminates heme transport activity, implying an evolutionary conserved heme transport mechanism that predates vertebrate origins. Our results support a model in which heme is translocated across membranes facilitated by conserved amino acids positioned on the exoplasmic, cytoplasmic, and transmembrane regions of HRG-1-related proteins. These findings may provide a framework for understanding the structural basis of heme transport in eukaryotes and human parasites, which rely on host heme for survival."
https://openalex.org/W2116708679,"Geminiviruses primarily encode only few factors, such as replication initiator protein (Rep), and need various host cellular machineries for rolling-circle replication (RCR) and/or recombination-dependent replication (RDR). We have identified a host factor, RAD54, in a screen for Rep-interacting partners and observed its role in DNA replication of the geminivirus mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV). We identified the interacting domains ScRAD54 and MYMIV-Rep and observed that ScRAD54 enhanced MYMIV-Rep nicking, ATPase, and helicase activities. An in vitro replication assay demonstrated that the geminiviral DNA replication reaction depends on the viral Rep protein, viral origin of replication sequences, and host cell-cycle proteins. Rad54-deficient yeast nuclear extract did not support in vitro viral DNA replication, while exogenous addition of the purified ScRAD54 protein enhanced replication. The role of RAD54 in in planta replication was confirmed by the transient replication assay; i.e., agroinoculation studies. RAD54 is a well-known recombination/repair protein that uses its DNA-dependent ATPase activity in conjunction with several other host factors. However, this study demonstrates for the first time that the eukaryotic rolling-circle replicon depends on the RAD54 protein.— Kaliappan, K., Choudhury, N. R., Suyal, G., Mukherjee, S. K.

https://openalex.org/W2063876018,"Cardiolipin (CL) is a major membrane phospholipid specifically localized in mitochondria. At the cellular level, CL has been shown to have a role in mitochondrial energy production, mitochondrial membrane dynamics, and the triggering of apoptosis. However, the in vivo role of CL in multicellular organisms is largely unknown. In this study, by analyzing deletion mutants of a CL synthase gene (crls-1) in Caenorhabditis elegans, we demonstrated that CL depletion selectively caused abnormal mitochondrial function and morphology in germ cells but not in somatic cell types such as muscle cells. crls-1 mutants reached adulthood but were sterile with reduced germ cell proliferation and impaired oogenesis. In the gonad of crls-1 mutants, mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly decreased, and the structure of the mitochondrial cristae was disrupted. Contrary to the abnormalities in the gonad, somatic tissues in crls-1 mutants appeared normal with respect to cell proliferation, mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial morphology. Increased susceptibility to CL depletion in germ cells was also observed in mutants of phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, an enzyme responsible for producing phosphatidylglycerol, a precursor phospholipid of CL. We propose that the contribution of CL to mitochondrial function and morphology is different among the cell types in C. elegans. Cardiolipin (CL) is a major membrane phospholipid specifically localized in mitochondria. At the cellular level, CL has been shown to have a role in mitochondrial energy production, mitochondrial membrane dynamics, and the triggering of apoptosis. However, the in vivo role of CL in multicellular organisms is largely unknown. In this study, by analyzing deletion mutants of a CL synthase gene (crls-1) in Caenorhabditis elegans, we demonstrated that CL depletion selectively caused abnormal mitochondrial function and morphology in germ cells but not in somatic cell types such as muscle cells. crls-1 mutants reached adulthood but were sterile with reduced germ cell proliferation and impaired oogenesis. In the gonad of crls-1 mutants, mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly decreased, and the structure of the mitochondrial cristae was disrupted. Contrary to the abnormalities in the gonad, somatic tissues in crls-1 mutants appeared normal with respect to cell proliferation, mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial morphology. Increased susceptibility to CL depletion in germ cells was also observed in mutants of phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, an enzyme responsible for producing phosphatidylglycerol, a precursor phospholipid of CL. We propose that the contribution of CL to mitochondrial function and morphology is different among the cell types in C. elegans. Cardiolipin (CL) 2The abbreviations used are: CLcardiolipinCDP-DAGcytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerolDiSC33,3′-dipropylthiocarbocyanine iodidePGphosphatidylglycerolPGPphosphatidylglycerophosphate. is an anionic phospholipid with a unique diphosphatidylglycerol structure containing four acyl groups (1Schlame M.

Cellular functions of cardiolipin in yeast.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, CL localizes predominantly to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it serves specific roles in mitochondrial structure and function. CL biosynthesis occurs via three enzymatic reactions, all catalyzed by enzymes present in the mitochondria (Fig. 1A) (4Schlame M. Haldar D. Cardiolipin is synthesized on the matrix side of the inner membrane in rat liver mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step, catalyzed by phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) synthase, is the synthesis of PGP from cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) and glycerol 3-phosphate. PGP phosphatase dephosphorylates PGP to phosphatidylglycerol (PG). In the final step, CL synthase catalyzes the formation of CL from PG and CDP-DAG. These enzymes are highly conserved in eukaryotes (Figs. 1A, 2B, and 9B) (5Osman C. Voelker D.R. Langer T. Making heads or tails of phospholipids in mitochondria.J.

Consistent with these observations, yeast CL synthase mutants (crd1 mutants), in which CL is not detected, show instability of electron transport chain supercomplexes, perturbation of coupling, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to a decrease in the oxidative phosphorylation rate (14Jiang F.

In contrast, knockdown of CL synthase in HeLa cells does not cause any defects in mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative phosphorylation rate, or cell division under normal conditions (20Choi S.Y.

In addition to the contribution of CL to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, CL has also been shown to be involved in induction of apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c and tBid (22Nomura K.

As described above, the CL function has been analyzed at the cellular level using yeast and mammalian cells. However, the in vivo role of CL in multicellular organisms is largely unknown. Caenorhabditis elegans is a suitable model organism to investigate the effects of gene depletion on individual cells or tissues because it is anatomically simple and has invariant lineage. In this study, we analyzed C. elegans mutants lacking the CL synthase gene (crls-1) and found that CL is required for germ cell proliferation. The number of germ cells was reduced in crls-1 mutants due to a reduction in the mitotic proliferation of germ cells. In the germ cells of crls-1 mutants, the mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly decreased and the structure of the mitochondrial cristae was disrupted. However, somatic cells in crls-1 mutants appeared normal with respect to cell proliferation, mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial morphology. These findings were confirmed by analysis of C. elegans mutants lacking a PGP synthase. This is the first study to show varying susceptibilities among different cell types to CL depletion in vivo. Maintenance and genetic manipulation of C. elegans were carried out as described previously (25Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Bristol strain N2 was used as the standard wild type strain. In addition, the following mutations, rearrangement, and transgenes were used: pgs-1(tm2211)I, bli-3(e767)I, rrf-3(pk1426)II, crls-1(tm2542)III, crls-1(tm2575)III, qC1 dpy-19(e1259) glp-1(q339)[qIs26]III, and wIs51[scm::gfp]. All strains were maintained at 20 °C. The deletion mutant strains crls-1(tm2542), crls-1(tm2575), and pgs-1(tm2211) were isolated as described previously (26Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Characterization of mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate, UV, and trimethylpsoralen in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Each mutant was backcrossed seven times and was balanced with qC1 dpy-19(e1259) glp-1(q339)[qIs26] or bli-3(e767) for crls-1(tm2542) or pgs-1(tm2211), respectively. Fluorescent images were obtained with an Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled AxioCam MRm CCD camera (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) if not otherwise specified. Nomarski images were obtained with an IX71 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled DS-5Mc CCD camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For gonad staining, young adult stage hermaphrodites were decapitated just below the pharyngeal bulb, allowing extrusion and extension of the gonad arms. The gonad was fixed with gonad fixative solution (3% formaldehyde, 75% methanol, and 6.2 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.2)) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 (PBS-T, containing 0.1% Tween 20), the gonad was stained with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS-T for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS-T, the gonad was mounted on a slide for observation. DNA injection into the C. elegans germ line was carried out as described previously (59Mello C.C. Kramer J.M.

Extrachromosomal maintenance and integration of transforming sequences.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA of crls-1 was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-GGA AGT GGT ACC ATG ATA GTA ACA TCG ATG TT-3′ and 5′-GCG AAA ACG AGC TCT AAT TAA ATT TTT TTG ATG G-3′ (the underlined sequences are KpnI and SacI sites, respectively). The amplified fragments were cloned into the pPD49.78 and pPD49.83 heat-shock vectors (a gift from A. Fire) at the KpnI/SacI sites for pST1 and pST2, respectively. Two fragments containing a point mutation to change Asp-116 to Ala were amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-GGA AGT GGT ACC ATG ATA GTA ACA TCG ATG TT-3′ and 5′-GAG AAG TTT ATC AGC GAC AGG AGC AAG CAC G-3′; 5′-AAA TCA CTG CTT GGC TCC GTG CTT GCT CCT-3′ and 5′-GCG AAA ACG AGC TCT AAT TAA ATT TTT TTG ATG G-3′ (italicized nucleotides represent the Asp-to-Ala mutation). The two overlapping fragments were fused by PCR with following primers: 5′-GGA AGT GGT ACC ATG ATA GTA ACA TCG ATG TT-3′ and 5′-GCG AAA ACG AGC TCT AAT TAA ATT TTT TTG ATG G-3′. The amplified fragments, forming a full-length crls-1D116A cDNA, were cloned into pPD49.78 and pPD49.83 at the KpnI/SacI sites for pST3 and pST4, respectively. The array Ex[hsp::crls-1] contained the plasmids pST1 (hsp16-41::crls-1), pST2 (hsp16-2::crls-1), and pRF4[rol-6(su1006)]. The array Ex[hsp::crls-1D116A] contained the plasmids pST3 (hsp16-41::crls-1D116A), pST4 (hsp16-2::crls-1D116A), and pRF4. For the experiments of transgenic rescue of crls-1 mutants, L1-staged hermaphrodites crls-1(tm2542), crls-1(tm2542);Ex[hsp::crls-1], and crls-1(tm2542); Ex[hsp::crls-1D116A] were subjected to heat shock at 37 °C for 45 min. The heat-shocked hermaphrodites were transferred to new nematode growth medium plates individually and were incubated at 20 °C until they finished egg laying. The frequency of germ cell division was scored in the DAPI-stained extruded gonad (27Maciejowski J. Ugel N. Mishra B. Isopi M. Hubbard E.J. Quantitative analysis of germ line mitosis in adult C. elegans.Dev. Biol. 2006; 292: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The boundary between the mitotic and transition zones was determined by the presence of the characteristic crescent-shaped germ nuclei, and the number of germ cells in the mitotic zone was counted. To calculate the frequency of germ cell divisions, the number of germ cells in the mitotic phase showing condensed chromatin or dividing nuclei was counted and then divided by the total number of germ cells in the mitotic zone. Seam cell nuclei were visualized using the wIs51 transgene. wIs51[scm::gfp] expresses green fluorescent protein under a control of seam cell-specific promoters. Heterozygous crls-1(+/tm2542) or pgs-1(+/tm2211) worms, which carry a background transgenic insertion of wIs51, were generated. Gravid hermaphrodites were placed on nematode growth medium plates and incubated for 2 h to lay eggs. After removal of the parent hermaphrodites, the F1 progeny were incubated for 48 h. Young adult F1 hermaphrodites were mounted on a 4% agar pad and immobilized in 50 mm sodium azide. The number of seam cells on one lateral side was counted. L4-staged hermaphrodites were placed on nematode growth medium plates containing 0.075, 0.15, or 0.3 μm of DiSC3 (Sigma) and incubated for 24 h at 20 °C in the dark. Gonad arms were extruded and extended on a slide by decapitation just below the pharyngeal bulb. To avoid rupture of the extruded gonad, the samples were sealed with a piece of PCR-slide seal. The intensity of DiSC3 fluorescence was monitored on a BZ-8000 fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Tokyo, Japan) using a fixed exposure time and was quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). To determine the mean fluorescence values, the sum of the fluorescence values of the area corresponding to gonad or muscles was divided by the number of pixels. Transmission electron microscopy was performed by the Hanaichi Ultrastructure Research Institute Co. (Okazaki, Japan). Young adult hermaphrodites were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm PBS for 1 h at 20 °C, followed by further fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm PBS for more than 24 h at 4 °C. The samples were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide in 100 mm phosphate buffer for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by dehydration in an ethanol series, substitution with propylene oxide, and infiltration with Q651 resin (Mitsui Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). Transverse sections were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The specimens were observed with a JEM-200EX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Young adult hermaphrodites were placed in drops of PBS, and simple rhythmic thrashing swimming was measured. Swimming was scored as the number of seconds taken for 30 thrashes and calculated backward to the swimming rate. Each worm was scored twice. RNAi against the crls-1 gene was performed by the feeding of double-stranded RNA as described previously (28Timmons L. Endogenous inhibitors of RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans.BioEssays. 2004; 26: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain HT115 (DE3) was transformed with the pPD129.36 L4440 DoubleT-7scriptII vector (a gift from A. Fire, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) containing the full-length cDNA region of crls-1. An empty pPD129.36 plasmid was used for a mock RNAi control. Single colonies of transformed E. coli were cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. The pre-cultured E. coli was diluted 1:100 and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. After that, E. coli was seeded on nematode growth medium plates containing 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and further incubated overnight at room temperature to induce the expression of double-stranded RNA. Late L4-staged hermaphrodites of rrf-3 mutants were placed on the feeding RNAi plates and incubated overnight at 20 °C to lay eggs (29Simmer F. Tijsterman M. Parrish S. Koushika S.P. Nonet M.L. Fire A. Ahringer J. Plasterk R.H. Loss of the putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase RRF-3 makes C. elegans hypersensitive to RNAi.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1317-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The F1 progeny that were laid during this period were incubated for 48 h at 25 °C. Young adult F1 hermaphrodites were collected and used for biochemical analyses. Total RNA was extracted from young adult worms with Isogen (Nippongene, Toyama, Japan). cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using a CFX96 real time detection system with SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad). The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: 5′-CTC GGC TGT ATC ACA GGA TTC ACC A-3′ and 5′-ACG AGG AGG ATC ACA GTC TAG CGA-3′ for crls-1; 5′-GGC CGT CCC AGG AGA CAA CG-3′ and 5′-GAC CTG GGC GTG GAA GGT GC-3′ for eft-3. eft-3 was amplified as an internal control, and crls-1 gene expression was normalized against eft-3 expression. Approximately 10,000 young adult worms were collected, and the total phospholipids were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:13, v/v/v). Phospholipids were identified by comigration with known standards. The position of each spot was visualized by staining with 0.001% primuline in acetone/H2O (4:1, v/v) under ultraviolet light. The area of silica gel corresponding to each phospholipid was scraped off and subjected to phosphorus quantification (31Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatographic separation of polar lipids and determination of phospholipids by phosphorus analysis of spots.Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). CL synthase catalyzes the formation of CL using PG and CDP-DAG as substrates (Fig. 1A) (1Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. The biosynthesis and functional role of cardiolipin.Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). A data base search of the complete C. elegans genome sequence revealed the presence of a single CL synthase homologue, F23H11.9, which we named crls-1 (cardiolipin synthase homologue-1). The crls-1 gene product, CRLS-1, consists of 246 amino acid residues and shows 45% identity with the human CL synthase. CRLS-1 has a CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase motif that is highly conserved in the CRLS family proteins (32Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. Scanning alanine mutagenesis of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cholinephosphotransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13482-13487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, the “DGXXARXXXXXXXXGXXXDXXXD” sequence, which is essential for the enzyme activity of CL synthase, is completely conserved within the phosphatidyltransferase motif of C. elegans CRLS-1 (Fig. 2B). To confirm that CRLS-1 contributes to CL synthesis in C. elegans, we determined the CL content in worms subjected to crls-1 RNAi (Fig. 1, B and C). In crls-1 RNAi worms, the expression of crls-1 mRNA and the CL content were decreased to 18 and 39%, respectively, of those in mock RNAi worms (CL content: 1.94 nmol/mg protein in mock RNAi worms versus 0.76 nmol/mg protein in crls-1 RNAi worms). Concurrently, the content of PG, which is the precursor of CL, increased 8-fold in crls-1 RNAi worms compared with mock RNAi worms (0.64 nmol/mg protein in mock RNAi worms versus 5.26 nmol/mg protein in crls-1 RNAi worms). However, the amount of other phospholipids was not substantially affected in crls-1 RNAi worms. These data indicate that CRLS-1 is a functional homologue of CL synthase in C. elegans. To investigate the physiological role of CL in vivo, we examined the phenotypes of two different deletion alleles of crls-1; tm2542 and tm2575 (Fig. 2A). Both alleles lack the DGXXARXXXXXXXXGXXXDXXXD sequence that is essential for the enzyme activity of CL synthase, suggesting that the products are functionless (Fig. 2A) (33Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Cardiolipin is not essential for the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on fermentable or nonfermentable carbon sources.Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Consistent with the crls-1 RNAi worms, the CL content was significantly decreased in crls-1(tm2542) (Fig. 2C). Both the crls-1(tm2542) and crls-1(tm2575) mutants were viable and reached adulthood; however, they showed extremely reduced brood size compared with the wild type (Table 1). In C. elegans, the gonadal arm of an adult hermaphrodite is U-shaped, with a distal arm containing a syncytium of germ line nuclei and a proximal arm containing oocytes and fertilized eggs (Fig. 2, D and E). Germ cells at the distal end of the gonad proliferate by mitosis, and as they migrate proximally, they initiate meiosis at the transition zone (34Kimble J. Hirsh D. The postembryonic cell lineages of the hermaphrodite and male gonads in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1979; 70: 396-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In crls-1 mutants, the distal gonadal arm was reduced in size, and the number of oocytes was decreased (Fig. 2, F and G). DAPI staining revealed that the number of germ cells in the distal arm was reduced in crls-1 mutants (Fig. 3, A–C). The reduced germ cell number was not due to enhanced apoptosis of germ cells b"
https://openalex.org/W2002774460,"In eukaryotic endomembrane systems, Qabc-SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) on one membrane and R-SNARE on the opposing membrane assemble into a trans-QabcR-SNARE complex to drive membrane fusion. However, it remains ambiguous whether pairing of Qabc- and R-SNAREs mediates membrane fusion specificity. Here, we explored the fusion specificity of reconstituted proteoliposomes bearing purified SNAREs in yeast vacuoles and other organelles. We found that not only vacuolar R-SNARE Nyv1p but also the non-cognate R-SNAREs, endosomal Snc2p, and endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi Sec22p caused efficient fusion with vacuolar Qabc-SNAREs. In contrast, their fusion is blocked completely by replacing vacuolar Qc-SNARE Vam7p with the non-cognate endosomal Tlg1p and Syn8p, although these endosomal Qc-SNAREs fully retained the ability to form cis-SNARE complexes with vacuolar SNAREs in solution and on membranes. Thus, our current study establishes that an appropriate assembly of Qabc-SNAREs is crucial for regulating fusion specificity, whereas R-SNARE itself has little contribution to specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2091258569,"We recently demonstrated that the bZip transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nfe2) represses protein acetylation and expression of the transcription factor glial cell missing 1 (Gcm1) in trophoblast cells, preventing excess syncytiotrophoblast formation and permitting normal placental vascularization and embryonic growth. However, the Gcm1 promoter lacks a Nfe2-binding site and hence the mechanisms linking Nfe2 and Gcm1 expression remained unknown. Here we show that Nfe2 represses JunD DNA-binding activity to the Gcm1 promoter during syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. Interventional studies using knockdown and knockin approaches show that enhanced JunD DNA-binding activity is required for increased expression of Gcm1 and syncytiotrophoblast formation as well as impaired placental vascularization and reduced growth of Nfe2(-/-) embryos. Induction of Gcm1 expression requires binding of JunD to the -1441 site within the Gcm1 promoter, which is distinct from the -1314 site previously shown to induce Gcm1 expression by other bZip transcription factors. Nfe2 modulates JunD binding to the Gcm1 promoter via acetylation, as reducing JunD acetylation using the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor curcumin reverses the increased JunD DNA-binding activity observed in the absence of Nfe2. This identifies a novel mechanism through which bZip transcription factors interact. Within the placenta this interaction regulates Gcm1 expression, syncytiotrophoblast formation, placental vascularization, and embryonic growth."
