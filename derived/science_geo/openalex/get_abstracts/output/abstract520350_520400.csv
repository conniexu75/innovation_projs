Here we describe a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screen in tumor growth and metastasis. We mutagenized a non-metastatic mouse cancer cell line using a genome-scale library with 67,405 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). The mutant cell pool rapidly generates metastases when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Enriched sgRNAs in lung metastases and late-stage primary tumors were found to target a small set of genes, suggesting that specific loss-of-function mutations drive tumor growth and metastasis. Individual sgRNAs and a small pool of 624 sgRNAs targeting the top-scoring genes from the primary screen dramatically accelerate metastasis. In all of these experiments, the effect of mutations on primary tumor growth positively correlates with the development of metastases. Our study demonstrates Cas9-based screening as a robust method to systematically assay gene phenotypes in cancer evolution in vivo.

Cancer genomes have complex landscapes of mutations and diverse types of genetic aberrations (Lawrence et al., 2013Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Polak P. Kryukov G.V. Cibulskis K. Sivachenko A.

The Biology of Cancer. Garland Science, 2007Google Scholar). A major challenge in understanding the cancer genome is to disentangle alterations that are driving the processes of tumor evolution from passenger mutations (Garraway and Lander, 2013Garraway L.A. Lander E.S. Lessons from the cancer genome.Cell. 2013; 153: 17-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Primary tumor growth and metastasis are distinct yet linked processes in the progression of solid tumors (Nguyen et al., 2009Nguyen D.X. Bos P.D. Massagué J.

It has been observed in the clinic that the probability of detecting metastases in a patient correlates positively with the size of a primary tumor (Heimann and Hellman, 1998Heimann R. Hellman S. Aging, progression, and phenotype in breast cancer.J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 2686-2692PubMed Google Scholar). Several possible explanations have been suggested: metastatic properties may only be acquired in late-stage tumors, larger tumors may seed proportionally more cells into circulation that eventually migrate to other sites, or cells with a strong ability to proliferate may also have enhanced ability to metastasize (Weinberg, 2007Weinberg R.A. The Biology of Cancer. Garland Science, 2007Google Scholar). In early studies using random insertional mutagenesis, it was observed that metastatic cell subpopulations overgrow to complete dominance in the primary tumor, suggesting progressive selection at both sites (Korczak et al., 1988Korczak B. Robson I.B. Lamarche C. Bernstein A. Kerbel R.S. Genetic tagging of tumor cells with retrovirus vectors: clonal analysis of tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.Mol. Cell.

Genetic screens are powerful tools for assaying phenotypes and identifying causal genes in various hallmarks of cancer progression (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

When the Cas9 nuclease is targeted to specific locations in the genome, DNA cleavage results in double-stranded breaks (DSBs), which are repaired via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (Rouet et al., 1994Rouet P. Smih F. Jasin M. Introduction of double-strand breaks into the genome of mouse cells by expression of a rare-cutting endonuclease.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8096-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). NHEJ repair results in insertion or deletion (indel) mutations that can cause loss of function if the DSB occurs in a coding exon. The Cas9 nuclease can be guided to its DNA target by a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9324) Google Scholar), a synthetic fusion between the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) (Deltcheva et al., 2011Deltcheva E.

In cells, Cas9-mediated gene disruption requires the full-length tracrRNA (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F.

Screens utilizing Cas9 have identified genes that are essential for cell survival and genes involved in drug resistance in various cell lines (Shalem et al., 2014Shalem O. Sanjana N.E. Hartenian E.

In vivo pooled screens are challenging due to many factors, such as the complexity of the library, limitations of virus delivery and/or cell transplantation, uniformity of viral transduction at a low MOI, and the complex dynamics and interactions of cells in animals. In this study, we report a genome-wide Cas9 knockout screen in a mouse model of tumor evolution. This screen provides a systematic phenotypic measurement of loss-of-function mutations in primary tumor growth and metastasis. We derived and cloned a cell line (Chen et al., 2014Chen S. Xue Y. Wu X. Le C. Bhutkar A. Bell E.L. Zhang F. Langer R. Sharp P.A. Global microRNA depletion suppresses tumor angiogenesis.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1054-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) from a mouse non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Kumar et al., 2009Kumar M.S. Pester R.E. Chen C.Y. Lane K. Chin C. Lu J. Kirsch D.G. Golub T.R. Jacks T. Dicer1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This cell line possesses an oncogenic Kras in conjunction with homozygous p53 and heterozygous Dicer1 loss of function (KrasG12D/+;p53−/−;Dicer1+/−, denoted KPD) and is capable of inducing tumors when transplanted into immunocompromised mice (Chen et al., 2014Chen S.

Lu J. Kirsch D.G. Golub T.R. Jacks T. Dicer1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We transduced this cell line with a lentivirus carrying a Cas9 transgene fused to a GFP and generated clonal cell lines (Cas9-GFP KPD) (Experimental Procedures) (Figures S1A and S1B). A clonal Cas9-GFP KPD cell line (clone 5) was selected to provide genetic and cellular homogeneity for subsequent screens. We utilized a pooled genome-wide mouse sgRNA library (termed mouse genome-scale CRISPR knockout library A, or mGeCKOa) containing 67,405 sgRNAs targeting 20,611 protein-coding genes and 1,175 microRNA precursors in the mouse genome (Sanjana et al., 2014Sanjana N.E. Shalem O. Zhang F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 783-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). The library also contains 1,000 control sgRNAs (termed non-targeting sgRNAs) designed to have minimal homology to sequences in the mouse genome (Sanjana et al., 2014Sanjana N.E. Shalem O. Zhang F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 783-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar, Shalem et al., 2014Shalem O. Sanjana N.E. Hartenian E.

Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells.Science. 2014; 343: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). We transduced the Cas9-GFP KPD cell line with the mGeCKOa library in three independent infection replicate experiments; for each replicate, the library representation (cells per lentiviral CRISPR construct) was greater than 400× (Figure 1A) (Experimental Procedures). After in vitro culture for 1 week, we subcutaneously transplanted 3 × 107 cells into the flanks of immunocompromised Nu/Nu mice (Figure 1A). We transplanted the cells from each infection replicate into four mice, using one mouse for early tumor sequencing and three mice for sequencing of late-stage primary tumor and metastases (Figure 1A). Both mGeCKOa-transduced and untransduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells formed tumors at the injection site (Figure 1B). Like most subcutaneously transplanted tumors, these tumors were poorly differentiated. The primary tumors induced by mGeCKOa-transduced cells grew slightly faster than tumors from the untransduced cells at an early stage (Figure 1C) (2 weeks post-transplantation) (paired two-tailed t test, p = 0.05), but at late stages all tumors were similar in size (paired two-tailed t test, p = 0.18 for data at 4 weeks, p = 0.6 for data at 6 weeks) (Figure 1C). At 6 weeks post-transplantation, we imaged the mice using micro-computed tomography (μCT) and found tumors in the lungs of the mice transplanted with mGeCKOa-transduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells (mGeCKOa mice), but not in the mice transplanted with untransduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells (control mice) (Figure 1D, Figure S1C). Mice were sacrificed and examined for metastases in various organs. Under a fluorescent stereoscope at 6× magnification, metastases were visually detected in the lung in 89% (8/9) of the mGeCKOa mice (Figure S1D). The mGeCKOa mice on average had 80% of their lung lobes positive for metastases (Figure 1E). In contrast, none (0/3) of the control mice developed detectable metastases in the lung (Figure 1E). At this time, metastases were not detected in the liver, kidney, or spleen in either group (Figure 1F). These data indicated that mGeCKOa library transduction enhanced the ability of the Cas9-GFP KPD cells to form metastases in the lung. To investigate the sgRNA representation through different stages of tumor evolution and to identify genes where loss of function confers a proliferative or metastatic phenotype, we used deep sequencing to readout the sgRNA representation (see Data S1 in Dataset S1). At 6 weeks post transplantation, we sequenced the late-stage primary tumor and three random lobes from the lung of each of the nine mGeCKOa mice (Figure 1A) (Experimental Procedures). In parallel, we also sequenced the mGeCKOa input plasmid library, the pre-transplantation mGeCKOa-transduced Cas9-GFP KPD cells (cultured in vitro for 7 days after transduction), and early-stage primary tumors (2 weeks post transplantation, one mouse from each infection replicate). In the cell samples, the sgRNA representations showed high concordance between technical replicates (correlation, ρ = 0.95 on average, n = 3) and biological infection replicates (correlation, ρ = 0.84 on average, n = 3) (Figures 2A, S2A, S2B, and S2E ). The sgRNA representation of cell samples correlates highly with the plasmid representation (correlation, ρ = 0.93 on average, n = 3) (Figures 2A, S2C, and S2E). Furthermore, different sgRNAs that target the same gene are correlated in terms of rank change (correlation, ρ = 0.49 on average, n = 3) (Figure S2D). Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we found that the sgRNAs with significantly decreased abundance in cells compared to plasmid are enriched for genes involved in fundamental cellular processes, such as ribosomal proteins, translation factors, RNA splicing factors, and RNA processing factors, indicating selection against the loss of these genes after 1 week in culture (Figure S2F).Figure S2Correlations between Different Samples and Replicates in the mGeCKOa Genome-wide Screen, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Pearson correlation of sgRNA normalized read counts between two technical replicates of the mGeCKOa-transduced cell pool from infection replicate 1 (R1) before transplantation.

To investigate the sgRNA library dynamics in different sample types (plasmid, pre-transplantation cells, early primary tumor, late primary tumor, and lung metastases), we compared the overall distributions of sgRNAs from all samples sequenced. Cell samples clustered tightly with each other and the plasmid, forming a cell-plasmid clade (Figures 2A and S2E). Early primary tumor samples also clustered with each other and then with the cell-plasmid clade, whereas late tumors and lung metastases clustered together in a distinct group (Figures 2A and S2E). The overlap of detected sgRNAs between different pre-transplantation infection replicates is over 95% (Figure S3A). The detected sgRNAs in the three infection replicates of early tumor samples overlap 63%–76% with each other (Figure S3B). Early primary tumors retained less than half (32%–49%) of the sgRNAs found in the transplanted cell populations (Figures 2B, 2C, S3C, and S3D). Compared to the cell populations, sgRNAs whose targets are genes involved in fundamental cellular processes are further depleted in early tumors (Table S1). Interestingly, only a small fraction of sgRNAs (less than 4% of all sgRNAs, or less than 8% of sgRNAs in the early primary tumor of the corresponding replicate) were detected in the late-stage primary tumor samples (Figures 2B, 2C, S3C, and S3D). The sgRNA diversity (i.e., number of different sgRNAs detected) further decreased in samples from lung metastases (Figures 2B, 2C, S3C, and S3D). The lung samples retained ≤0.4% of all sgRNAs in the mGeCKOa library, or ≤1.1% of sgRNAs found in the early primary tumor of the corresponding replicate, with a subset of highly enriched sgRNAs (Figures 2B, 2C, S3C, and S3D). The global patterns of sgRNA distributions in different sample types are distinct, as is evident in the strong shifts in the respective cumulative distribution functions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test, p < 10−15 for all pairwise comparisons) (Figure 2D). Late primary tumors retain few sgRNAs (on average 813 ± 264 sgRNAs, n = 9 mice), with even fewer at high frequencies (4 ± 1 sgRNAs with >5% of total reads) in each mouse (Figures 2B, 2C, S2C, S2D, 3A , and S4H). We used three methods to identify enriched sgRNAs in late primary tumors: (1) sgRNAs above a certain threshold, (2) top-ranked sgRNAs in the tumor of each mouse, and (3) using false discovery rate (FDR), i.e., sgRNAs enriched compared to the distribution of the 1,000 non-targeting sgRNAs. All three methods generated similar results (Figure S4A). Taking the results from (3) as an example, a total of 935 sgRNAs (targeting 909 genes) are enriched over the non-targeting controls (FDR cutoff = 0.2%) in the late primary tumor of one or more mice (Figures 3B and 3C). These sgRNAs are targeting genes highly enriched in apoptosis pathways (Table S2), with many of them being pro-apoptotic, such as BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid), phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a), and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (Mgmt), suggesting strong selection for mutations that inactivate apoptosis in primary tumor cells.Figure S4Enriched sgRNAs in Late Tumors and Lung Metastases, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) Venn diagram of enriched sgRNAs in late primary tumor, using three different methods, by rank, by read count cutoff, or by FDR.(B) Venn diagram of enriched sgRNAs in lung metastases, using three different methods, by rank, by read count cutoff, or by FDR.(C) Venn diagram of sgRNAs from the mGeCKOa library enriched in 3 lobes of the lung from a single mouse at ∼6 weeks after transplantation of the transduced cell pool.(D) Venn diagram of sgRNAs from the mGeCKOa library enriched in lung metastases of 3 different mice at ∼6 weeks after transplantation of the transduced cell pool from a single infection replicate.

https://openalex.org/W1994386346,"Background High-throughput sequencing has enabled detailed insights into complex microbial environments, including the human gut microbiota. The accuracy of the sequencing data however, is reliant upon appropriate storage of the samples prior to DNA extraction. The aim of this study was to conduct the first MiSeq sequencing investigation into the effects of faecal storage on the microbiota, compared to fresh samples. Culture-based analysis was also completed. Methods Seven faecal samples were collected from healthy adults. Samples were separated into fresh (DNA extracted immediately), snap frozen on dry ice and frozen for 7 days at -80°C prior to DNA extraction or samples frozen at -80°C for 7 days before DNA extraction. Sequencing was completed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Culturing of total aerobes, anaerobes and bifidobacteria was also completed. Results No significant differences at phylum or family levels between the treatment groups occurred. At genus level only Faecalibacterium and Leuconostoc were significantly different in the fresh samples compared to the snap frozen group (p = 0.0298; p = 0.0330 respectively). Diversity analysis indicated that samples clustered based on the individual donor, rather than by storage group. No significant differences occurred in the culture-based analysis between the fresh, snap or -80°C frozen samples. Conclusions Using the MiSeq platform coupled with culture-based analysis, this study highlighted that limited significant changes in microbiota occur following rapid freezing of faecal samples prior to DNA extraction. Thus, rapid freezing of samples prior to DNA extraction and culturing, preserves the integrity of the microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W1979315404,A conserved feature of the midblastula transition (MBT) is a requirement for a functional DNA replication checkpoint to coordinate cell-cycle remodeling and zygotic genome activation (ZGA). We have investigated what triggers this checkpoint during Drosophila embryogenesis. We find that the magnitude of the checkpoint scales with the quantity of transcriptionally engaged DNA. Measuring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding at 20 min intervals over the course of ZGA reveals that the checkpoint coincides with widespread de novo recruitment of Pol II that precedes and does not require a functional checkpoint. This recruitment drives slowing or stalling of DNA replication at transcriptionally engaged loci. Reducing Pol II recruitment in zelda mutants both reduces replication stalling and bypasses the requirement for a functional checkpoint. This suggests a model where the checkpoint functions as a feedback mechanism to remodel the cell cycle in response to nascent ZGA.

As confinement of diffusible proteins is ubiquitous in cells, the associated entropic forces are likely of importance for cellular mechanics beyond cytoskeletal networks. Diffusion, originating from the random, thermal motion of molecules, is one of nature’s most important transport mechanisms. It can be exploited for the generation of directed forces when the molecules are spatially confined. An every-day example is a gas spring, where the expansion of a gas compressed in a cylinder can be understood as an entropy-driven process that maximizes the total number of microscopic states the system can adopt. We here ask if, analogously, subcellular mechano-systems like cytoskeletal networks, can harness the entropic forces arising from the confinement of diffusible molecules. In many cellular systems, the molecules are not confined to three dimensions, but rather to two dimensions or even to one dimension. A prominent example of the latter is the diffusion of proteins along microtubules (Helenius et al., 2006Helenius J. Brouhard G. Kalaidzidis Y. Diez S. Howard J. The depolymerizing kinesin MCAK uses lattice diffusion to rapidly target microtubule ends.Nature. 2006; 441: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ends of microtubules have been shown to constitute diffusion barriers for proteins involved in forcefully tethering kinetochores to the shrinking ends of depolymerizing microtubules (Asbury et al., 2006Asbury C.L.

An example of a diffusible microtubule crosslinker is S. pombe Ase1 (a member of the Ase1/PRC1/Map65 family), which is believed to stabilize bipolar microtubule arrays. Ase1 localizes to the anti-parallel microtubule overlaps in the midzone of the mitotic spindle during anaphase (Yamashita et al., 2005Yamashita A. Sato M. Fujita A. Yamamoto M. Toda T.

Still, because Ase1 can diffuse in the confined space of microtubule overlaps (Braun et al., 2011Braun M. Lansky Z. Fink G. Ruhnow F. Diez S. Janson M.E. Adaptive braking by Ase1 prevents overlapping microtubules from sliding completely apart.Nat.

Microtubule-driven multimerization recruits ase1p onto overlapping microtubules.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1713-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we reasoned that Ase1, apart from generating friction, might also generate entropic forces. We here devised a well-controlled experimental assay to confine small numbers of Ase1 diffusible crosslinkers in between two partially overlapping microtubules. Using total-internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we showed that the entropic expansion of the confined crosslinkers is strong enough to induce the directed sliding of the microtubules with respect to each other. We directly measured the entropic forces generated by Ase1 in the expanding overlaps using optical tweezers and found them to be in the piconewton (pN) range. This suggests that the entropy of the crosslinkers in an overlap can generate biologically relevant forces that are on the same scale as forces induced by microtubule-crosslinking motor proteins. To test this hypothesis, we employed kinesin-14 motor proteins and found that motor-driven microtubule-microtubule sliding could indeed be reversed by the addition of Ase1. We quantitatively describe the force generation by Ase1 by a statistical-mechanical model, which predicts the expansion force to follow the ideal gas law. Taken together, our results show that Ase1 diffusible crosslinkers confined between partially overlapping microtubules create a pressure, analogously to gas molecules confined in a cylinder by a piston. Our results are a demonstration of the unexpected effects entropy may have in cells. We suggest that forces generated by diffusible crosslinkers of the Ase1/PRC1/MAP65 family are likely of importance in the midzone of the mitotic spindle, where they may regulate the motorized sliding of anti-parallel microtubules. To study force generation by confined Ase1 crosslinkers in vitro, we generated overlapping microtubules by (1) immobilizing dimly rhodamine-labeled “template” microtubules on a coverslip, (2) allowing 50 picomolar (pM) Ase1-GFP to bind diffusively to the immobilized template microtubules, and (3) flushing in brightly rhodamine-labeled “transport” microtubules to bind to the template microtubules using a solution without Ase1-GFP; this effectively removed Ase1-GFP molecules that were not bound to the template microtubules (Figure 1; Experimental Procedures). We then applied hydrodynamic flow of assay buffer without Ase1-GFP to slide the transport microtubules along the template microtubules, generating partial overlaps with reduced overlap lengths (Figures 1A and 1B). Due to their high affinity for microtubule overlaps, as compared to their lower affinity for single microtubules (Braun et al., 2011Braun M. Lansky Z. Fink G. Ruhnow F. Diez S. Janson M.E. Adaptive braking by Ase1 prevents overlapping microtubules from sliding completely apart.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the diffusible Ase1-GFP molecules did not leave the overlap regions during this process. The reduction in the overlap lengths consequently led to an increased confinement of the crosslinkers. As soon as the flow stopped, the overlap lengths increased through directed sliding of the transport microtubules (Figure 1B and Movie S1). During this expansion, the confined Ase1-GFP molecules redistributed themselves uniformly within the overlap regions by one-dimensional diffusion. Again, no Ase1-GFP molecules were lost as evidenced by the constancy of the integrated Ase1-GFP fluorescence intensity along the overlap regions (Figure S1B). Compression and expansion could be cyclically repeated (Figure 1D and Movie S1), resembling the macroscopic mechanism of a gas spring (Figure 1C).Figure S1The Number of Ase1-GFP Molecules in Microtubule Overlaps during Overlap Expansion Is Constant for the Duration of the Experiments, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) SDS-PAGE of the Ase1-GFP preparation used in all presented experiments (see also Experimental Procedures).(B) Box and whisker plot of the total change of the amount of Ase1-GFP as inferred from the Ase1-GFP fluorescence intensity in microtubule overlaps (n = 79) compared to the first frame after the application of the hydrodynamic flow in experiments such as shown in Figure 1B.

The average Ase1-GFP fluorescence intensity at the start of the experiments is 34 ± 30 AU (average ± SD). We quantified the forces generated by Ase1 confined between partially overlapping microtubules by optical tweezers (Figure 2). First, we formed microtubule overlaps in a similar manner as in the previous experiment (Experimental Procedures). In the absence of Ase1-GFP in solution, we attached a silica microsphere to a transport microtubule by optical tweezers. Using a piezo translation stage, we then moved the template microtubule in steps relative to the laser trap in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the template microtubule, forming partial microtubule-overlaps and compacting Ase1-GFP until the two microtubules were pulled apart (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B and Movie S2). After each step, we allowed the system to equilibrate before measuring the force. We found that the force increased with decreasing overlap length, reaching values up to 3.7 ± 1.8 pN (average ± SD, n = 10) just before the two microtubules were pulled apart (Figure 2C). The observed forces increased linearly with increasing Ase1-GFP densities in the overlaps as inferred from fluorescence intensities (Figures 2C, inset, and S2C; Experimental Procedures).Figure S2Ase1-Induced Expansion Forces Can Be Directly Measured by Optical Tweezers; Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Time-lapse fluorescence multichannel micrographs showing the positions of a transport and a template microtubule as function of time (event from Figure 2B).

For the yellow trace this manipulation took longer due to the imaging of overlap expansion (the frames acquired before the force measurement, which led to the yellow curve, were used to generate Movie S2, right). To explain the origin of the observed forces generated by Ase1, we analytically modeled the mutually exclusive binding of crosslinkers to discrete binding sites along a single protofilament in a microtubule overlap (Figure 3). For the case of a constant number of confined crosslinkers in the overlap; i.e., when no crosslinkers bind into or unbind from the overlap (scenario as in Figures 1 and 2), the entropic expansion force, F, acting on the transport microtubule is found to be given by the one-dimensional analog of the ideal gas law FL≅nkBT (Extended Results, Text 1). Here, L is the overlap length and n is the number of crosslinkers within the overlap, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. This model predicts that the force increases linearly with the density of the crosslinkers in the overlap, as observed in our experiments (Figures 2C, inset, and S2C). While a quantitative test of the predicted relation between force and crosslinker density is not possible due to experimental uncertainties in overlap lengths and protein numbers, the range of maximum measured forces is predicted correctly. The model predicts the generation of forces in the 1 pN range when the crosslinkers are maximally compressed between two microtubule protofilaments, that is when all binding sites within the overlap are fully occupied by Ase1. Structural work on Ase1 homologs suggests that such high densities of crosslinkers are indeed possible (Subramanian et al., 2010Subramanian R. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Arthur C.P. Bick M.J. Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. Milligan R.A. Kapoor T.M. Insights into antiparallel microtubule crosslinking by PRC1, a conserved nonmotor microtubule binding protein.Cell. 2010; 142: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The observed maximal forces of 3.7 ± 1.8 pN may indicate that multiple rows of Ase1 crosslinkers bind to neighboring protofilaments in the overlap (Extended Results, Text 1). We next investigated whether entropic forces, in combination with frictional drag exerted by the Ase1 crosslinkers, can also explain the observed sliding velocities of transport microtubules in absence of external load (scenario as in Figure 1). The viscous drag exerted by the solution was neglected due to its small contribution at low velocities (Hunt et al., 1994Hunt A.J. Gittes F. Howard J.

Sekimoto K. Protein friction exerted by motor enzymes through a weak-binding interaction.J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 150: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We described the frictional drag coefficient γ of a single Ase1-microtubule link following the Einstein relation γ=kBT/DAse1MT (Einstein, 1906Einstein A. Zur theorie der Brownschen bewegung.Annalen der Physik. 1906; 19: 371-381Crossref Scopus (685) Google Scholar), where DAse1MT is the diffusion constant of a single Ase1 molecule on a single microtubule. Assuming a linear dependence of the frictional drag on the number of diffusible crosslinkers (Tawada and Sekimoto, 1991Tawada K. Sekimoto K. Protein friction exerted by motor enzymes through a weak-binding interaction.J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 150: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the velocity of overlap expansion is given by vMT = 2 DAse1MT / L (Extended Results, Text 2). This analytical expression, independent of the number of crosslinkers in the overlap, qualitatively reproduced the trend of the measured velocities (Figure 3B). However, it overestimated the absolute values, suggesting that friction might be underestimated in our analytical model. To explain the magnitude of entropy-driven sliding velocities quantitatively, we set up a particle-based, computational model in which the microtubule-Ase1-microtubule links are described as harmonic springs whose ends can hop between neighboring binding sites within an overlap formed by two opposing protofilaments (Figure 3A; Extended Results, Text 3). The spring constant of the individual microtubule-Ase1-microtubule links was estimated from the about 8-fold lower diffusion coefficient of Ase1-GFP in microtubule overlaps compared to Ase1-GFP on single microtubules (Figure S3C). This computational model yielded time traces of the overlap expansion that are in good agreement with those measured experimentally (Figures 3B–3D and Movies S1 and S3). Interestingly, our computational model predicted that the total friction between two microtubules increases exponentially, instead of linearly, with the number of Ase1 crosslinkers in the overlap (Figure 3E). This non-linearity explains why our simple analytical model overestimated the sliding velocities. To test the predicted exponential dependence of the friction on the number of crosslinkers, we characterized the Ase1-generated friction experimentally. We again formed microtubule overlaps in a similar manner as in the previous experiments (Experimental Procedures). In the absence of Ase1-GFP in solution, we observed the transport microtubules diffusing along the template microtubules (Figure S3D and Movie S4). For each transport microtubule that fully overlapped with a template microtubule, we estimated the diffusion coefficient by determining the mean square displacement as a function of time. Using the Einstein relation, we calculated the friction between the transport and the template microtubules. While a quantitative comparison between simulations and experiments was not possible due to experimental uncertainties in determining the number of crosslinkers (Experimental Procedures), the experiments confirmed the predicted exponential increase of the friction with the number of Ase1-GFP molecules as inferred from fluorescence intensities (Figure 3F). Experiments so far were performed in the absence of Ase1 in solution. In this situation, the entropic force for overlap expansion decreased with overlap length, as the available Ase1 was diluted in the overlap (Extended Results, Text 1). However, in the presence of Ase1 in solution, the binding of new crosslinkers into filament overlaps, “crosslinker condensation”, generates additional forces for filament sliding (Lan et al., 2009Lan G. Daniels B.R. Dobrowsky T.M. Wirtz D. Sun S.X. Condensation of FtsZ filaments can drive bacterial cell division.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Peskin et al., 1993Peskin C.S. Odell G.M. Oster G.F. Cellular motions and thermal fluctuations: the Brownian ratchet.Biophys.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8649-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our analytical model predicts that, in the presence of crosslinker condensation, a constant, length-independent, driving force is obtained, analogous to gas being continuously added into an expanding gas spring such that the pressure remains constant (Extended Results, Text 1). However, binding of additional crosslinkers also increases friction. The analytical model, in which the friction increases linearly with the number of bound crosslinkers, predicts that condensation of new crosslinkers to the expanding overlap slightly increases the velocity of overlap expansion, as compared to the case in which overlap expansion is driven by entropy alone (Extended Results, Text 1). In contrast, the computational model, in which the friction increases exponentially with the number of bound crosslinkers, predicts that binding of new crosslinkers to the overlap rapidly brings overlap expansion to a standstill; while crosslinker condensation keeps the driving force for overlap expansion constant, the exponential increase of the friction prohibits sliding (Figure 4A). To test this prediction experimentally, we added assay buffer with Ase1-GFP to partially overlapping microtubules. This resulted in Ase1-GFP condensation into the overlap. We observed that the microtubules slid slower as compared to the situation without crosslinker condensation and that, in agreement with our computational model, they stopped sliding before full overlap was reached (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4). Our computational model thus explains overlap expansion in absence (Figures 3B–3D) and presence of crosslinker condensation (Figure 4). To test whether the forces associated with the entropic expansion of the Ase1-GFP molecules are sufficient to counteract forces generated by microtubule-crosslinking motor proteins, we formed and imaged microtubule overlaps in the presence of Ase1-GFP and D. melanogaster kinesin-14 Ncd (Figure 5; Experimental Procedures). Ncd, which does not directly interact with Ase1 (Braun et al., 2011Braun M. Lansky Z. Fink G. Ruhnow F. Diez S. Janson M.E. Adaptive braking by Ase1 prevents overlapping microtubules from sliding completely apart.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; Figure S5A) started to slide the microtubules apart, thereby compressing the Ase1 molecules in the shortening microtubule overlaps. During this compression, the number of bound Ase1-GFP linkers stayed roughly constant because of their high affinity for the overlap, while the number of Ncd molecules decreased linearly with decreasing overlap length (Braun et al., 2011Braun M. Lansky Z. Fink G. Ruhnow F. Diez S. Janson M.E. Adaptive braking by Ase1 prevents overlapping microtubules from sliding completely apart.Nat.

After about 10 min, sliding came to a halt and the lengths of the overlaps stayed constant (Figures 5A and S5B and Movie S5, left). This suggests that the sliding force induced by the Ncd motors is balanced by the entropic expansion force of Ase1, analogous to a gas spring, in which the external load is balanced by the internal pressure of the gas. The equilibrium overlap lengths increased with increasing numbers of Ase1-GFP molecules in the overlap (Figure 5B). When simulating the motor force as an external load that scales linearly with overlap length (Braun et al., 2011Braun M. Lansky Z. Fink G. Ruhnow F. Diez S. Janson M.E.

We compared the effects of intratracheally-administered AgNPs (20nm and 110nm; polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citrate-capped; 0.1 mg/Kg) in Brown-Norway (BN) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In BN rats, there was both a neutrophilic and eosinophilic response, while in SD rats, there was a neutrophilic response at day 1, greatest for the 20nm citrate-capped AgNPs. Eosinophilic cationic protein was increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in BN and SD rats on day 1. BAL protein and malondialdehyde levels were increased in BN rats at 1 and 7 days, and BAL KC, CCL11 and IL-13 levels at day 1, with increased expression of CCL11 in lung tissue. Pulmonary resistance increased and compliance decreased at day 1, with persistence at day 7. The 20nm, but not the 110 nm, AgNPs increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness on day 1, which continued at day 7 for the citrate-capped AgNPs only. The 20nm versus the 110 nm size were more proinflammatory in terms of neutrophil influx, but there was little difference between the citrate-capped versus the PVP-capped AgNPs. AgNPs can induce pulmonary eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, features characteristic of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2031767376,"Background Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental fungus that can cause life-threatening meningitis and fungemia, often in the presence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, or other medical conditions. To distinguish risk factors from comorbidities, we performed a hospital-based, density-sampled, matched case-control study. Methods All new-onset cryptococcal meningitis cases and cryptococcemia cases at a university hospital in Taiwan from 2002–2010 were retrospectively identified from the computerized inpatient registry and were included in this study. Controls were selected from those hospitalized patients not experiencing cryptococcal meningitis or cryptococcemia. Controls and cases were matched by admission date, age, and gender. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors. Results A total of 101 patients with cryptococcal meningitis (266 controls) and 47 patients with cryptococcemia (188 controls), of whom 32 patients had both cryptococcal meningitis and cryptococcemia, were included in this study. Multivariate regression analysis showed that AIDS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 181.4; p < 0.001), decompensated liver cirrhosis (aOR = 8.5; p = 0.008), and cell-mediated immunity (CMI)-suppressive regimens without calcineurin inhibitors (CAs) (aOR = 15.9; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for cryptococcal meningitis. Moreover, AIDS (aOR = 216.3, p < 0.001), decompensated liver cirrhosis (aOR = 23.8; p < 0.001), CMI-suppressive regimens without CAs (aOR = 7.3; p = 0.034), and autoimmune diseases (aOR = 9.3; p = 0.038) were independent risk factors for developing cryptococcemia. On the other hand, diabetes mellitus and other medical conditions were not found to be risk factors for cryptococcal meningitis or cryptococcemia. Conclusions The findings confirm AIDS, decompensated liver cirrhosis, CMI-suppressive regimens without CAs, and autoimmune diseases are risk factors for invasive C. neoformans diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2046507636,"Background Persons with unsuppressed HIV viral load (VL) who disengage from care may experience poor clinical outcomes and potentially transmit HIV. We assessed the feasibility and yield of using the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) enhanced HIV surveillance system (eHARS) to identify and re-engage such persons in care. Methods Using SFDPH eHARS data as of 4/20/2012 (index date), we selected HIV-infected adults who were alive, had no reported VL or CD4 cell count results in the past nine months (proxy for “out-of-care”) and a VL >200 copies/mL drawn nine to 15 months earlier. We prioritized cases residing locally for investigation, and used information from eHARS and medical and public health databases to contact them for interview and referral to the SFDPH linkage services (LINCS). Twelve months later, we matched-back to eHARS data to assess how HIV laboratory reporting delays affected original eligibility, and if persons had any HIV laboratory results performed and reported within 12 months after index date (‘new labs’). Results Among 434 eligible persons, 282 were prioritized for investigation, of whom 75 (27%) were interviewed, 79 (28%) could not be located, and 48 (17%) were located out of the area. Among the interviewed, 54 (72%) persons accepted referral to LINCS. Upon match-back to eHARS data, 324 (75%) in total were confirmed as eligible, including 221 (78%) of the investigated; most had new labs. Conclusions Among the investigated persons presumed out-of-care, we interviewed and offered LINCS referral to about one-quarter, demonstrating the feasibility but limited yield of our project. Matching to updated surveillance data revealed that a substantial minority did not disengage from care and that most re-engaged in HIV care. Verifying persons’ HIV care status with medical providers and improving timeliness of transfer and cross-jurisdictional sharing of HIV laboratory data may aid future efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2095346591,"Background and Aims A better understanding of the effects of human adipocytes on breast cancer cells may lead to the development of new treatment strategies. We explored the effects of adipocytes on the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Methods To study the reciprocal effects of adipocytes and cancer cells, we co-cultured human mature adipocytes and breast cancer cells in a system devoid of heterogeneous cell-cell contact. To analyze the factors that were secreted from adipocytes and that affected the invasive abilities of breast cancer cells, we detected different cytokines in various co-culture media. To study the communication of mature adipocytes and breast cancer cells in vivo, we chose 10 metastatic pathologic samples and 10 non-metastatic pathologic samples to do immunostaining. Results The co-culture media of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and human mature adipocytes increased motility of MCF-7 cells. In addition, MMP-2 was remarkably up-regulated, whereas E-cadherin was down-regulated in these MCF-7 cells. Based on our co-culture medium chip results, we chose four candidate cytokines and tested their influence on metastasis individually. We found that IGFBP-2 enhanced the invasion ability of MCF-7 cells in vitro more prominently than did the other factors. In vivo, metastatic human breast tumors had higher levels of MMP-2 than did non-metastatic tumor tissue, whereas adipocytes around metastatic breast tumors had higher levels of IGFBP-2 than did adipocytes surrounding non-metastatic breast tumors. Conclusions IGFBP-2 secreted by mature adipocytes plays a key role in promoting the metastatic ability of MCF-7 breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003648628,"Objective Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are heterogeneous and their therapeutic effect is pleiotropic. Multilineage-differentiating stress enduring (Muse) cells are recently identified to comprise several percentages of BMSCs, being able to differentiate into triploblastic lineages including neuronal cells and act as tissue repair cells. This study was aimed to clarify how Muse and non-Muse cells in BMSCs contribute to functional recovery after ischemic stroke. Methods Human BMSCs were separated into stage specific embryonic antigen-3-positive Muse cells and -negative non-Muse cells. Immunodeficient mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and received transplantation of vehicle, Muse, non-Muse or BMSCs (2.5×104 cells) into the ipsilateral striatum 7 days later. Results Motor function recovery in BMSC and non-Muse groups became apparent at 21 days after transplantation, but reached the plateau thereafter. In Muse group, functional recovery was not observed for up to 28 days post-transplantation, but became apparent at 35 days post-transplantation. On immunohistochemistry, only Muse cells were integrated into peri-infarct cortex and differentiate into Tuj-1- and NeuN-expressing cells, while negligible number of BMSCs and non-Muse cells remained in the peri-infarct area at 42 days post-transplantation. Conclusions These findings strongly suggest that Muse cells and non-Muse cells may contribute differently to tissue regeneration and functional recovery. Muse cells may be more responsible for replacement of the lost neurons through their integration into the peri-infarct cortex and spontaneous differentiation into neuronal marker-positive cells. Non-Muse cells do not remain in the host brain and may exhibit trophic effects rather than cell replacement."
https://openalex.org/W2153723005,"Blinding protects against bias but the success of blinding is seldom assessed and reported in clinical trials including studies of acupuncture where blinding represents a major challenge. Recently, needles with the potential for double-blinding were developed, so we tested if acupuncture can be double-blinded in a randomized study of sixty-seven patients with acute pain ≥ 3 (0-10 scale following third molar removal) who received active acupuncture with a penetrating needle or placebo acupuncture with a non-penetrating needle. To test if acupuncture was administered double-blind, patients and acupuncturists were asked about perceived treatment allocation at the end of the study. To test if there were clues which led to identification of the treatment, deep dull pain associated with needle application and rotation (termed ""de qi"" in East Asian medicine), and patients' pain levels were assessed. Perceived treatment allocation depended on actual group allocation (p < 0.015) for both patients and acupuncturists, indicating that the needles were not successful in double-blinding. Up to 68% of patients and 83% of acupuncturists correctly identified the treatment, but for patients the distribution was not far from 50/50. Also, there was a significant interaction between actual or perceived treatment and the experience of de qi (p = 0.027), suggesting that the experience of de qi and possible non-verbal clues contributed to correct identification of the treatment. Yet, of the patients who perceived the treatment as active or placebo, 50% and 23%, respectively, reported de qi. Patients' acute pain levels did not influence the perceived treatment. In conclusion, acupuncture treatment was not fully double-blinded which is similar to observations in pharmacological studies. Still, the non-penetrating needle is the only needle that allows some degree of practitioner blinding. The study raises questions about alternatives to double-blind randomized clinical trials in the assessment of acupuncture treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2120569862,"Potassium bromate (KBrO3) is widely used as a food additive and is a major water disinfection by-product. It induces multiple organ toxicity in humans and experimental animals and is a probable human carcinogen. The present study reports the protective effect of dietary antioxidant taurine on KBrO3-induced damage to the rat intestine. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: control, KBrO3 alone, taurine alone and taurine+ KBrO3. Administration of KBrO3 alone led to decrease in the activities of intestinal brush border membrane enzymes while those of antioxidant defence and carbohydrate metabolism were also severely altered. There was increase in DNA damage and DNA-protein cross-linking. Treatment with taurine, prior to administration of KBrO3, resulted in significant attenuation in all these parameters but the administration of taurine alone had no effect. Histological studies supported these biochemical results showing extensive intestinal damage in KBrO3-treated animals and greatly reduced tissue injury in the taurine+ KBrO3 group. These results show that taurine ameliorates bromate induced tissue toxicity and oxidative damage by improving the antioxidant defence, tissue integrity and energy metabolism. Taurine can, therefore, be potentially used as a therapeutic/protective agent against toxicity of KBrO3 and related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2089531839,"Protein kinase D (PKD) has been implicated in many aspects of tumorigenesis and progression, and is an emerging molecular target for the development of anticancer therapy. Despite recent advancement in the development of potent and selective PKD small molecule inhibitors, the availability of in vivo active PKD inhibitors remains sparse. In this study, we describe the discovery of a novel PKD small molecule inhibitor, SD-208, from a targeted kinase inhibitor library screen, and the synthesis of a series of analogs to probe the structure-activity relationship (SAR) vs. PKD1. SD-208 displayed a narrow SAR profile, was an ATP-competitive pan-PKD inhibitor with low nanomolar potency and was cell active. Targeted inhibition of PKD by SD-208 resulted in potent inhibition of cell proliferation, an effect that could be reversed by overexpressed PKD1 or PKD3. SD-208 also blocked prostate cancer cell survival and invasion, and arrested cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Mechanistically, SD-208-induced G2/M arrest was accompanied by an increase in levels of p21 in DU145 and PC3 cells as well as elevated phosphorylation of Cdc2 and Cdc25C in DU145 cells. Most importantly, SD-208 given orally for 24 days significantly abrogated the growth of PC3 subcutaneous tumor xenografts in nude mice, which was accompanied by reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis and decreased expression of PKD biomarkers including survivin and Bcl-xL. Our study has identified SD-208 as a novel efficacious PKD small molecule inhibitor, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeted inhibition of PKD for prostate cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2027044374,"Background Psychotic experiences are common in the general population, and predict later psychotic illness. Much less is known about negative symptoms in the general population. Method This study utilized a sample of 4,914 Israel-born individuals aged 25–34 years who were screened for psychopathology in the 1980's. Though not designed to specifically assess negative symptoms, data were available on 9 self-report items representing avolition and social withdrawal, and on 5 interviewer-rated items assessing speech deficits, flat affect and poor hygiene. Psychotic experiences were assessed using the False Beliefs and Perceptions subscale of the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview. Psychiatric hospitalization was ascertained 24 years later using a nation-wide psychiatric hospitalization registry. Results After removing subjects with diagnosable psychotic disorders at baseline, 20.2% had at least one negative symptom. Negative symptoms were associated with increased risk of later schizophrenia only in the presence of strong (frequent) psychotic experiences (OR = 13.0, 9% CI: 2.1–79.4). Conclusions Negative symptoms are common in the general population, though the majority of people with negative symptoms do not manifest a clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorder. Negative symptoms and psychotic experiences critically depend on each other’s co-occurrence in increasing risk for later schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2051485320,"Microbially-induced concrete corrosion in headspaces threatens wastewater infrastructure worldwide. Models for predicting corrosion rates in sewer pipe networks rely largely on information from culture-based investigations. In this study, the succession of microbes associated with corroding concrete was characterized over a one-year monitoring campaign using rRNA sequence-based phylogenetic methods. New concrete specimens were exposed in two highly corrosive manholes (high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide gas) on the Colorado Front Range for up to a year. Community succession on corroding surfaces was assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S bacterial rRNA amplicons and Sanger sequencing of 16S universal rRNA clones. Microbial communities associated with corrosion fronts presented distinct succession patterns which converged to markedly low α-diversity levels (< 10 taxa) in conjunction with decreasing pH. The microbial community succession pattern observed in this study agreed with culture-based models that implicate acidophilic sulfur-oxidizer Acidithiobacillus spp. in advanced communities, with two notable exceptions. Early communities exposed to alkaline surface pH presented relatively high α-diversity, including heterotrophic, nitrogen-fixing, and sulfur-oxidizing genera, and one community exposed to neutral surface pH presented a diverse transition community comprised of less than 20% sulfur-oxidizers."
https://openalex.org/W1995345754,"Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) is highly expressed in the pulmonary vasculature, but its expression in the myocardium is controversial. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) activates protein kinase G (PKG), which has been hypothesized to blunt cardiac hypertrophy and negative remodeling in heart failure. Although PDE5 has been suggested to play a significant role in the breakdown of cGMP in cardiomyocytes and hence PKG regulation in the myocardium, the RELAX trial, which tested effect of PDE5 inhibition on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) failed to show a beneficial effect. These results highlight the controversy regarding the role and expression of PDE5 in the healthy and failing heart. This study used one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting to examine PDE5 expression in mouse (before and after trans-aortic constriction), dog (control and HFpEF) as well as human (healthy and failing) heart. We were unable to detect PDE5 in any cardiac tissue lysate, whereas PDE5 was present in the murine and bovine lung samples used as positive controls. These results indicate that if PDE5 is expressed in cardiac tissue, it is present in very low quantities, as PDE5 was not detected in either humans or any model of heart failure examined. Therefore in cardiac muscle, it is unlikely that PDE5 is involved the regulation of cGMP-PKG signaling, and hence PDE5 does not represent a suitable drug target for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy. These results highlight the importance of rigorous investigation prior to clinical trial design."
https://openalex.org/W2089511243,"Background Although 5-HTTLPR has been shown to influence the risk of life stress-induced depression in the majority of studies, others have produced contradictory results, possibly due to weak effects and/or sample heterogeneity. Methods In the present study we investigated how age, type and intensity of life-stressors modulate the effect of 5-HTTLPR on depression and anxiety in a European population cohort of over 2300 subjects. Recent negative life events (RLE), childhood adversity (CHA), lifetime depression, Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI) depression and anxiety scores were determined in each subject. Besides traditional statistical analysis we calculated Bayesian effect strength and relevance of 5-HTTLPR genotypes in specified models. Results The short (s) low expressing allele showed association with increased risk of depression related phenotypes, but all nominally significant effects would turn to non-significant after correction for multiple testing in the traditional analysis. Bayesian effect strength and relevance analysis, however, confirmed the role of 5-HTTLPR. Regarding current (BSI) and lifetime depression 5-HTTLPR-by-RLE interactions were confirmed. Main effect, with other words direct association, was supported with BSI anxiety. With more frequent RLE the prevalence or symptoms of depression increased in ss carriers. Although CHA failed to show an interaction with 5-HTTLPR, in young subjects CHA sensitized towards the depression promoting effect of even mild RLE. Furthermore, the direct association of anxiety with the s allele was driven by young (≤30) individuals. Limitations Our study is cross-sectional and applies self-report questionnaires. Conclusions Albeit 5-HTTLPR has only weak/moderate effects, the s allele is directly associated with anxiety and modulates development of depression in homogeneous subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2057353670,"The contamination of surface environments with hydroxide rich wastes leads to the formation of high pH (>11.0) soil profiles. One such site is a legacy lime works at Harpur Hill, Derbyshire where soil profile indicated in-situ pH values up to pH 12. Soil and porewater profiles around the site indicated clear evidence of the presence of the α and β stereoisomers of isosaccharinic acid (ISA) resulting from the anoxic, alkaline degradation of cellulosic material. ISAs are of particular interest with regards to the disposal of cellulosic materials contained within the intermediate level waste (ILW) inventory of the United Kingdom, where they may influence radionuclide mobility via complexation events occurring within a geological disposal facility (GDF) concept. The mixing of uncontaminated soils with the alkaline leachate of the site resulted in ISA generation, where the rate of generation in-situ is likely to be dependent upon the prevailing temperature of the soil. Microbial consortia present in the uncontaminated soil were capable of surviving conditions imposed by the alkaline leachate and demonstrated the ability to utilise ISAs as a carbon source. Leachate-contaminated soil was sub-cultured in a cellulose degradation product driven microcosm operating at pH 11, the consortia present were capable of the degradation of ISAs and the generation of methane from the resultant H2/CO2 produced from fermentation processes. Following microbial community analysis, fermentation processes appear to be predominated by Clostridia from the genus Alkaliphilus sp, with methanogenesis being attributed to Methanobacterium and Methanomassiliicoccus sp. The study is the first to identify the generation of ISA within an anthropogenic environment and advocates the notion that microbial activity within an ILW-GDF is likely to influence the impact of ISAs upon radionuclide migration."
https://openalex.org/W2068650794,"The anaerobic packed-bed (AP) and hybrid packed-bed (HP) reactors containing methanogenic microbial consortia were applied to treat synthetic soft drink wastewater, which contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and fructose as the primary constituents. The AP and HP reactors achieved high COD removal efficiency (>95%) after 80 and 33 days of the operation, respectively, and operated stably over 2 years. 16S rRNA gene pyrotag analyses on a total of 25 biofilm samples generated 98,057 reads, which were clustered into 2,882 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Both AP and HP communities were predominated by Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and candidate phylum KSB3 that may degrade organic compound in wastewater treatment processes. Other OTUs related to uncharacterized Geobacter and Spirochaetes clades and candidate phylum GN04 were also detected at high abundance; however, their relationship to wastewater treatment has remained unclear. In particular, KSB3, GN04, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi are consistently associated with the organic loading rate (OLR) increase to 1.5 g COD/L-d. Interestingly, KSB3 and GN04 dramatically decrease in both reactors after further OLR increase to 2.0 g COD/L-d. These results indicate that OLR strongly influences microbial community composition. This suggests that specific uncultivated taxa may take central roles in COD removal from soft drink wastewater depending on OLR."
https://openalex.org/W2166762733,"In this paper we propose a method to create data-driven mappings from components of cognitive models to brain regions. Cognitive models are notoriously hard to evaluate, especially based on behavioral measures alone. Neuroimaging data can provide additional constraints, but this requires a mapping from model components to brain regions. Although such mappings can be based on the experience of the modeler or on a reading of the literature, a formal method is preferred to prevent researcher-based biases. In this paper we used model-based fMRI analysis to create a data-driven model-brain mapping for five modules of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We then validated this mapping by applying it to two new datasets with associated models. The new mapping was at least as powerful as an existing mapping that was based on the literature, and indicated where the models were supported by the data and where they have to be improved. We conclude that data-driven model-brain mappings can provide strong constraints on cognitive models, and that model-based fMRI is a suitable way to create such mappings."
https://openalex.org/W2047101752,"Background Microbiota of Anopheles midgut can modulate vector immunity and block Plasmodium development. Investigation on the bacterial biodiversity in Anopheles, and specifically on the identification of bacteria that might be used in malaria transmission blocking approaches, has been mainly conducted on malaria vectors of Africa. Vietnam is an endemic country for both malaria and Bancroftian filariasis whose parasitic agents can be transmitted by the same Anopheles species. No information on the microbiota of Anopheles mosquitoes in Vietnam was available previous to this study. Method The culture dependent approach, using different mediums, and culture independent (16S rRNA PCR – TTGE) method were used to investigate the bacterial biodiversity in the abdomen of 5 Anopheles species collected from Dak Nong Province, central-south Vietnam. Molecular methods, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize the microbiota. Results and Discussion The microbiota in wild-caught Anopheles was diverse with the presence of 47 bacterial OTUs belonging to 30 genera, including bacterial genera impacting Plasmodium development. The bacteria were affiliated with 4 phyla, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, the latter being the dominant phylum. Four bacterial genera are newly described in Anopheles mosquitoes including Coxiella, Yersinia, Xanthomonas, and Knoellia. The bacterial diversity per specimen was low ranging from 1 to 4. The results show the importance of pairing culture and fingerprint methods to better screen the bacterial community in Anopheles mosquitoes. Conclusion Sampled Anopheles species from central-south Vietnam contained a diverse bacterial microbiota that needs to be investigated further in order to develop new malaria control approaches. The combination of both culture and DNA fingerprint methods allowed a thorough and complementary screening of the bacterial community in Anopheles mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2049640995,"Rapid prototyping (RP) of microfluidic channels in liquid photopolymers using standard lithography (SL) involves multiple deposition steps and curing by ultraviolet (UV) light for the construction of a microstructure layer. In this work, the conflicting effect of oxygen diffusion and UV curing of liquid polyurethane methacrylate (PUMA) is investigated in microfabrication and utilized to reduce the deposition steps and to obtain a monolithic product. The conventional fabrication process is altered to control for the best use of the oxygen presence in polymerization. A novel and modified lithography technique is introduced in which a single step of PUMA coating and two steps of UV exposure are used to create a microchannel. The first exposure is maskless and incorporates oxygen diffusion into PUMA for inhibition of the polymerization of a thin layer from the top surface while the UV rays penetrate the photopolymer. The second exposure is for transferring the patterns of the microfluidic channels from the contact photomask onto the uncured material. The UV curing of PUMA as the main substrate in the presence of oxygen is characterized analytically and experimentally. A few typical elastomeric microstructures are manufactured. It is demonstrated that the obtained heights of the fabricated structures in PUMA are associated with the oxygen concentration and the UV dose. The proposed technique is promising for the RP of molds and microfluidic channels in terms of shorter processing time, fewer fabrication steps and creation of microstructure layers with higher integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2142902654,"Anhydrobiotic animals can survive the loss of both free and bound water from their cells. While in this state they are also resistant to freezing. This physiology adapts anhydrobiotes to harsh environments and it aids their dispersal. Panagrolaimus davidi, a bacterial feeding anhydrobiotic nematode isolated from Ross Island Antarctica, can survive intracellular ice formation when fully hydrated. A capacity to survive freezing while fully hydrated has also been observed in some other Antarctic nematodes. We experimentally determined the anhydrobiotic and freezing-tolerance phenotypes of 24 Panagrolaimus strains from tropical, temperate, continental and polar habitats and we analysed their phylogenetic relationships. We found that several other Panagrolaimus isolates can also survive freezing when fully hydrated and that tissue extracts from these freezing-tolerant nematodes can inhibit the growth of ice crystals. We show that P. davidi belongs to a clade of anhydrobiotic and freezing-tolerant panagrolaimids containing strains from temperate and continental regions and that P. superbus, an early colonizer at Surtsey island, Iceland after its volcanic formation, is closely related to a species from Pennsylvania, USA. Ancestral state reconstructions show that anhydrobiosis evolved deep in the phylogeny of Panagrolaimus. The early-diverging Panagrolaimus lineages are strongly anhydrobiotic but weakly freezing-tolerant, suggesting that freezing tolerance is most likely a derived trait. The common ancestors of the davidi and the superbus clades were anhydrobiotic and also possessed robust freezing tolerance, along with a capacity to inhibit the growth and recrystallization of ice crystals. Unlike other endemic Antarctic nematodes, the life history traits of P. davidi do not show evidence of an evolved response to polar conditions. Thus we suggest that the colonization of Antarctica by P. davidi and of Surtsey by P. superbus may be examples of recent “ecological fitting” of freezing-tolerant anhydrobiotic propagules to the respective abiotic conditions in Ross Island and Surtsey."
https://openalex.org/W2047586973,"The majority of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients suffer from a live-threatening loss of intercellular adhesion between keratinocytes (acantholysis). The disease is caused by auto-antibodies that bind to desmosomal cadherins desmoglein (Dsg) 3 or Dsg3 and Dsg1 in mucous membranes and skin. A currently unresolved controversy in PV is whether apoptosis is involved in the pathogenic process. The objective of this study was to perform preclinical studies to investigate apoptotic pathway activation in PV pathogenesis with the goal to assess its potential for clinical therapy. For this purpose, we investigated mouse and human skin keratinocyte cultures treated with PV antibodies (the experimental Dsg3 monospecific antibody AK23 or PV patients IgG), PV mouse models (passive transfer of AK23 or PVIgG into adult and neonatal mice) as well as PV patients' biopsies (n=6). A combination of TUNEL assay, analyses of membrane integrity, early apoptotic markers such as cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and the collapse of actin cytoskeleton failed to provide evidence for apoptosis in PV pathogenesis. However, the in vitro and in vivo PV models, allowing to monitor progression of lesion formation, revealed an early, transient and low-level caspase-3 activation. Pharmacological inhibition confirmed the functional implication of caspase-3 in major events in PV such as shedding of Dsg3, keratin retraction, proliferation including c-Myc induction, p38MAPK activation and acantholysis. Together, these data identify low-level caspase-3 activation downstream of disrupted Dsg3 trans- or cis-adhesion as a major event in PV pathogenesis that is non-synonymous with apoptosis and represents, unlike apoptotic components, a promising target for clinical therapy. At a broader level, these results posit that an impairment of adhesive functions in concert with low-level, non-lethal caspase-3 activation can evoke profound cellular changes which may be of relevance for other diseases including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1991472648,"Prenatal exposure to alcohol affects the expression and function of glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors in diverse brain regions. The present study was undertaken to fill a current gap in knowledge regarding the regional specificity of ethanol-related alterations in glutamatergic receptors in the frontal cortex. We quantified subregional expression and function of glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors (AMPARs, NMDARs, GluN2B-containing NMDARs, mGluR1s, and mGluR5s) by radioligand binding in the agranular insular cortex (AID), lateral orbital area (LO), prelimbic cortex (PrL) and primary motor cortex (M1) of adult rats exposed to moderate levels of ethanol during prenatal development. Increased expression of GluN2B-containing NMDARs was observed in AID of ethanol-exposed rats compared to modest reductions in other regions. We subsequently performed slice electrophysiology measurements in a whole-cell patch-clamp preparation to quantify the sensitivity of evoked NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of AID to the GluN2B negative allosteric modulator ifenprodil. Consistent with increased GluN2B expression, ifenprodil caused a greater reduction in NMDAR-mediated EPSCs from prenatal alcohol-exposed rats than saccharin-exposed control animals. No alterations in AMPAR-mediated EPSCs or the ratio of AMPARs/NMDARs were observed. Together, these data indicate that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure has a significant and lasting impact on GluN2B-containing receptors in AID, which could help to explain ethanol-related alterations in learning and behaviors that depend on this region."
https://openalex.org/W2026425969,"Clearcutting is a common timber harvesting technique that represents a significant and abrupt change in habitat conditions for wildlife living in industrial forests. Most research on this type of impact has focused on comparing populations or communities in mature forests/plantations and the resulting clearcut stands. However, this approach does not separate the effect of changes in habitat attributes from direct mortality produced by the intensive use of heavy machinery required for cutting down trees and dragging them to a road. Because knowing the fate of individuals after a disturbance is important for modelling landscape-scale population dynamics in industrial forests, we conducted a study in South-Central Chile to understand the short-term response to clearcutting operations of the long-haired Akodont (Abrothrix longipillis), a forest specialist mouse. Between 2009 and 2013 we radiotracked a total of 51 adult male Akodonts, before, during and after the clearcutting of the pine plantations in which they lived. A minimum of 52.4% of the individuals died as a direct cause of the timbering operations, being crushed by vehicles or logs during logging operations. Our observations suggest that, instead of fleeing the area, the response of long-haired Akodonts to the approaching machinery is to hide under the forest litter or in burrows, which exposes them to a serious risk of death. The real mortality rate associated to clearcutting may be higher than that estimated by us because of some methodological biases (i.e. individuals with crushed radiotransmitters not recorded) and the fact that additional mortality sources may affect the population in the weeks following logging operations (e.g. higher exposure to predation, effects of site preparation for the new plantation, etc)."
https://openalex.org/W1984072922,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the principal apical route for transepithelial fluid transport induced by enterotoxin. Inhibition of CFTR has been confirmed as a pharmaceutical approach for the treatment of secretory diarrhea. Many traditional Chinese herbal medicines, like Rhodiola kirilowii (Regel) Maxim, have long been used for the treatment of secretory diarrhea. However, the active ingredients responsible for their therapeutic effectiveness remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to identify CFTR inhibitors from Rhodiola kirilowii (Regel) Maxim via bioactivity-directed isolation strategy. We first identified fractions of Rhodiola kirilowii (Regel) Maxim that inhibited CFTR Cl- channel activity. Further bioactivity-directed fractionation led to the identification of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as CFTR Cl- channel inhibitor. Analysis of 5 commercially available EGCG analogs including (+)-catechins (C), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) and EGCG revealed that ECG also had CFTR inhibitory activity. EGCG dose-dependently and reversibly inhibited CFTR Cl- channel activity in transfected FRT cells with an IC50 value around 100 μM. In ex vivo studies, EGCG and ECG inhibited CFTR-mediated short-circuit currents in isolated rat colonic mucosa in a dose-dependent manner. In an intestinal closed-loop model in mice, intraluminal application of EGCG (10 μg) and ECG (10 μg) significantly reduced cholera toxin-induced intestinal fluid secretion. CFTR Cl- channel is a molecular target of natural compounds EGCG and ECG. CFTR inhibition may account, at least in part, for the antidiarrheal activity of Rhodiola kirilowii (Regel) Maxim. EGCG and ECG could be new lead compounds for development of CFTR-related diseases such as secretory diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2028868938,"Cerebellar symptoms significantly diminish quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We previously showed that sodium channel Nav1.8, although normally restricted to peripheral somatosensory neurons, is upregulated in the cerebellum in MS, and that Nav1.8 expression is linked to ataxia and MS-like symptoms in mice. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of the Nav1.8 blocker A-803467 temporarily reversed electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations of disease in a mouse MS model; unfortunately A-803467 is not orally bioavailable, diminishing the potential for translation to human patients. In the present study, we assessed the effect of per os (p.o.) dosing of a new orally bioavailable Nav1.8-selective blocker, PF-01247324, in transgenic mice expressing Nav1.8 in Purkinje neurons, and in wildtype mice in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. PF-01247324 was administered by oral gavage at 1000 mg/kg; control groups received an equal volume of vehicle. Behavioral assays of motor coordination, grip strength, and ataxia were performed. We observed significant improvements in motor coordination and cerebellar-like symptoms in mice that received PF-01247324 compared to control littermates that received vehicle. These preclinical proof-of-concept data suggest that PF-01247324, its derivatives, or other Nav1.8-selective blockers merit further study for providing symptomatic therapy for cerebellar dysfunction in MS and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2003675945,"Gammapapillomavirus (Gamma-PV) is a diverse and rapidly expanding PV-genus, currently consisting of 76 fully characterized human papillomavirus (HPV) types. In this study, DNA genomes of two novel HPV types, HPV179 and HPV184, obtained from two distinct facial verrucae vulgares specimens of a 64 year-old renal-transplant recipient, were fully cloned, sequenced and characterized. HPV179 and HPV184 genomes comprise 7,228-bp and 7,324-bp, respectively, and contain four early (E1, E2, E6 and E7) and two late genes (L1 and L2); the non-coding region is typically positioned between L1 and E6 genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the L1 nucleotide sequence placed both novel types within the Gamma-PV genus: HPV179 was classified as a novel member of species Gamma-15, additionally containing HPV135 and HPV146, while HPV184 was classified as a single member of a novel species Gamma-25. HPV179 and HPV184 type-specific quantitative real-time PCRs were further developed and used in combination with human beta-globin gene quantitative real-time PCR to determine the prevalence and viral load of the novel types in the patient’s facial warts and several follow-up skin specimens, and in a representative collection, a total of 569 samples, of HPV-associated benign and malignant neoplasms, hair follicles and anal and oral mucosa specimens obtained from immunocompetent individuals. HPV179 and HPV184 viral loads in patients’ facial warts were estimated to be 2,463 and 3,200 genome copies per single cell, respectively, suggesting their active role in the development of common warts in organ-transplant recipients. In addition, in this particular patient, both novel types had established a persistent infection of the skin for more than four years. Among immunocompetent individuals, HPV179 was further detected in low-copy numbers in a few skin specimens, indicating its cutaneous tissue tropism, while HPV184 was further detected in low-copy numbers in one mucosal and a few skin specimens, suggesting its dual tissue tropism."
https://openalex.org/W1992655189,"We have recently shown that IKK complex plays an important non-genomic role in platelet function, i.e., regulates SNARE machinery-dependent membrane fusion. In this connection, it is well known that MALT1, whose activity is modulated by proteasome, plays an important role in the regulation of IKK complex. Therefore, the present studies investigated the mechanism by which IKK signaling is regulated in the context of the platelet proteasome. It was found that platelets express a functional proteasome, and form CARMA/MALT1/Bcl10 (CBM) complex when activated. Using a pharmacological inhibitor, the proteasome was found to regulate platelet function (aggregation, integrin activation, secretion, phosphatidylserine exposure and changes in intracellular calcium). It was also found to regulate thrombogenesis and physiologic hemostasis. We also observed, upon platelet activation, that MALT1 is ubiquitinated, and this coincides with the activation of the IKK/NF-κB-signaling pathway. Finally, we observed that the proteasome inhibitor blocks CBM complex formation and the interaction of IKKγ and MALT1; abrogates SNARE formation, and the association of MALT1 with TAK1 and TAB2, which are upstream of the CBM complex. Thus, our data demonstrate that MALT1 ubiquitination is critical for the engagement of CBM and IKK complexes, thereby directing platelet signals to the NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1986312548,"The endogenous estradiol metabolite 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) reduces atherosclerotic lesion formation, while the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In this work, we investigated the vasodilatory effect of 2-ME and the role of nitric oxide (NO) involved. In vivo studies using noninvasive tail-cuff methods showed that 2-ME decreased blood pressure in Sprague Dawley rats. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that cumulative addition of 2-ME to the aorta caused a dose- and endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This effect was unaffected by the pretreatment with the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, but was largely impaired by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin (WM). Moreover, 2-ME（10−7 ∼10−5 M）enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS and promoted NO release from cultured human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). These effects were blocked by PI3K inhibitor WM, or by the transfection with Akt specific siRNA, indicating that endothelial Akt/eNOS/NO cascade plays a crucial role in 2-ME-induced vasodilation. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) mRNA and protein expression were detected in HUVECs and the antagonist GW9662 or the transfection with specific PPARγ siRNA inhibited 2-ME-induced eNOS and Akt phosphorylation, leading to the impairment of NO production and vasodilation. In conclusion, 2-ME induces vasodilation by stimulating NO release. These actions may be mediated by PPARγ and the subsequent activation of Akt/eNOS cascade in vascular endothelial cells."

Of these patients, 117 patients were treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using IMRT and 63 cases were treated by IMRT alone.The median follow-up time was 58.97 months (range, 2.79-114.92) months. For all the patients, the 1, 3 and 5-year local failure-free survival (LFFS) rates were 97.7%, 89.2% and 85.9%, regional failure free survival (RFFS) rates were 98.9%, 94.4% and 94.4%, distant failure-free survival (DFFS) rates were 89.7%, 79.9% and 76.2%, and overall survival (OS) rates were 92.7%, 78.9% and 65.3%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in LFFS, RFFS, DFFS and OS between the CCRT group and the IMRT alone group. No statistically significant difference was observed in acute toxicity except leukopenia (p = 0.000) during IMRT between the CCRT group and the IMRT alone group.IMRT alone for T4 classification NPC achieved similar treatment outcomes in terms of disease local control and overall survival as compared to concurrent chemotherapy plus IMRT. However, this is a retrospective study with a limited number of patients, such results need further investigation in a prospective randomized clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W1978532128,"A novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus causes severe human infections and was first identified in March 2013 in China. The H7N9 virus has exhibited two epidemiological peaks of infection, occurring in week 15 of 2013 and week 5 of 2014. Taiwan, which is geographically adjacent to China, faces a large risk of being affected by this virus. Through extensive surveillance, launched in April 2013, four laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases imported from China have been identified in Taiwan. The H7N9 virus isolated from imported case 1 in May 2013 (during the first wave) was found to be closest genetically to a virus from wild birds and differed from the prototype virus, A/Anhui/1/2013, in the MP gene. The other three imported cases were detected in December 2013 and April 2014 (during the second wave). The viruses isolated from cases 2 and 4 were similar in the compositions of their 6 internal genes and distinct from A/Anhui/1/2013 in the PB2 and MP genes, whereas the virus isolated from case 3 exhibited a novel reassortment that has not been identified previously and was different from A/Anhui/1/2013 in the PB2, PA and MP genes. The four imported H7N9 viruses share similar antigenicity with A/Anhui/1/2013, and their HA and NA genes grouped together in their respective phylogenies. In contrast with the HA and NA genes, which exhibited a smaller degree of diversity, the internal genes were heterogeneous and provided potential distinctions between transmission sources in terms of both geography and hosts. It is important to strengthen surveillance of influenza and to share viral genetic data in real-time for reducing the threat of rapid and continuing evolution of H7N9 viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2087972429,"Choices are not only communicated via explicit actions but also passively through inaction. In this study we investigated how active or passive choice impacts upon the choice process itself as well as a preference change induced by choice. Subjects were tasked to select a preference for unfamiliar photographs by action or inaction, before and after they gave valuation ratings for all photographs. We replicate a finding that valuation increases for chosen items and decreases for unchosen items compared to a control condition in which the choice was made post re-evaluation. Whether choice was expressed actively or passively affected the dynamics of revaluation differently for positive and negatively valenced items. Additionally, the choice itself was biased towards action such that subjects tended to choose a photograph obtained by action more often than a photographed obtained through inaction. These results highlight intrinsic biases consistent with a tight coupling of action and reward and add to an emerging understanding of how the mode of action itself, and not just an associated outcome, modulates the decision making process."
https://openalex.org/W2124092087,"The role of olfactory cues such as carbon dioxide, pheromones, and kairomones in bed bug, Cimex lectularius L. behavior has been demonstrated. However, the role of vision and mechanoreception in bed bug behavior is poorly understood. We investigated bed bug vision by determining their responses to different colors, vertical objects, and their ability to detect colors and vertical objects under low and complete dark conditions. Results show black and red paper harborages are preferred compared to yellow, green, blue, and white harborages. A bed bug trapping device with a black or red exterior surface was significantly more attractive to bed bugs than that with a white exterior surface. Bed bugs exhibited strong orientation behavior toward vertical objects. The height (15 vs. 30 cm tall) and color (brown vs. black) of the vertical object had no significant effect on orientation behavior of bed bugs. Bed bugs could differentiate color and detect vertical objects at very low background light conditions, but not in complete darkness. Bed bug preference to different substrate textures (mechanoreception) was also explored. Bed bugs preferred dyed tape compared to painted tape, textured painted plastic, and felt. These results revealed that substrate color, presence of vertical objects, and substrate texture affect host-seeking and harborage-searching behavior of bed bugs. Bed bugs may use a combination of vision, mechanoreception, and chemoreception to locate hosts and seek harborages."
https://openalex.org/W2002137117,"Pre-existing low-frequency resistance-associated variants (RAVs) may jeopardize successful sustained virological responses (SVR) to HCV treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). However, the potential impact of low-frequency (∼0.1%) mutations, concatenated mutations (haplotypes), and their association with genotypes (Gts) on the treatment outcome has not yet been elucidated, most probably owing to the difficulty in detecting pre-existing minor haplotypes with sufficient length and accuracy. Herein, we characterize a methodological framework based on Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with bioinformatics of quasispecies reconstruction (QSR) to realize highly accurate variant calling and genotype-haplotype detection. The core-to-NS3 protease coding sequences in 10 HCV monoinfected patients, 5 of whom had a history of blood transfusion, and 11 HCV/HIV coinfected patients with hemophilia, were studied. Simulation experiments showed that, for minor variants constituting more than 1%, our framework achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% and sensitivities of 91.7–100% for genotyping and 80.6% for RAV screening. Genotyping analysis indicated the prevalence of dominant Gt1a infection in coinfected patients (6/11 vs 0/10, p = 0.01). For clinical samples, minor genotype overlapping infection was prevalent in HCV/HIV coinfected hemophiliacs (10/11) and patients who experienced whole-blood transfusion (4/5) but none in patients without exposure to blood (0/5). As for RAV screening, the Q80K/R and S122K/R variants were particularly prevalent among minor RAVs observed, detected in 12/21 and 6/21 cases, respectively. Q80K was detected only in coinfected patients, whereas Q80R was predominantly detected in monoinfected patients (1/11 vs 7/10, p < 0.01). Multivariate interdependence analysis revealed the previously unrecognized prevalence of Gt1b-Q80K, in HCV/HIV coinfected hemophiliacs [Odds ratio = 13.4 (3.48–51.9), p < 0.01]. Our study revealed the distinct characteristics of viral quasispecies between the subgroups specified above and the feasibility of NGS and QSR-based genetic deconvolution of pre-existing minor Gts, RAVs, and their interrelationships."
https://openalex.org/W2033415854,"Honey bees are important model systems for the investigation of learning and memory and for a better understanding of the neuronal basics of brain function. Honey bees also possess a rich repertoire of tones and sounds, from queen piping and quacking to worker hissing and buzzing. In this study, we tested whether the worker bees’ sounds can be used as a measure of learning. We therefore conditioned honey bees aversively to odours in a walking arena and recorded both their sound production and their movement. Bees were presented with two odours, one of which was paired with an electric shock. Initially, the bees did not produce any sound upon odour presentation, but responded to the electric shock with a strong hissing response. After learning, many bees hissed at the presentation of the learned odour, while fewer bees hissed upon presentation of another odour. We also found that hissing and movement away from the conditioned odour are independent behaviours that can co-occur but do not necessarily do so. Our data suggest that hissing can be used as a readout for learning after olfactory conditioning, but that there are large individual differences between bees concerning their hissing reaction. The basis for this variability and the possible ecological relevance of the bees’ hissing remain to be investigated."

We examined the effect of a lactation support intervention on breastfeeding duration in hospitalized jaundiced infants.We conducted a randomized controlled trial with a qualitative component involving mothers of hospitalized jaundiced breastfed infants <4 weeks of age. Mothers receiving the intervention met with an International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant in hospital and 1-3 times post discharge. Both groups received the standard care for jaundice. The primary outcome was exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months. To the exception of research assistants enrolling participants and completing qualitative interviews, all research staff, investigators and statisticians were blinded to group assignment. Qualitative interviews elicited feedback on breastfeeding experiences for both groups.99 participants were recruited, and 86 analyzed for primary outcome. There was no difference in exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56-1.24, p = 0.40) or in the secondary outcomes. 31 participants were included in the qualitative analysis. Participants in the intervention group described an increase in comfort and confidence levels with breastfeeding. Participants in the control group reported limited lactation support.Our hospital-based lactation support program did not result in a higher proportion of mothers exclusively breastfeeding at 3 months compared to current hospital standard care. Qualitative feedback from the intervention group suggests that mothers' confidence was increased, which is linked to breastfeeding duration. The decision to breastfeed is multifactorial and hospital-based lactation support may be only a small piece of the puzzle in hospitalized jaundiced infants. Further studies may be needed to fully elucidate the impact of an in-hospital lactation support program on successful breastfeeding for these infants.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00966719 https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00966719?term=Lactation+Support+and+Breastfeeding+Duration+in+Jaundiced+Infants%3A+a+Randomized+Controlled+Trial&rank=1."
https://openalex.org/W2050186163,"Recent pertussis outbreaks have prompted re-examination of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategies, when immunization is not immediately protective. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended to household contacts; however there are concerns of clinical failure and significant adverse events, especially with erythromycin among infants who have the highest disease burden. Newer macrolides offer fewer side effects at higher drug costs. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of PEP strategies from the health care payer perspective.A Markov model was constructed to examine 4 mutually exclusive strategies: erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or no intervention, stratified by age group of contacts (""infant"", ""child"", and ""adult""). Transition probabilities, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived from the literature. Chronic neurologic sequelae were modeled over a lifetime, with costs and QALYs discounted at 5%. Associated health outcomes and costs were compared, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated in 2012 Canadian dollars. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the degree of uncertainty in the results.Azithromycin offered the highest QALYs in all scenarios. While this was the dominant strategy among infants, it produced an ICER of $16,963 per QALY among children and $2,415 per QALY among adults. Total QALYs with azithromycin were 19.7 for a 5-kg infant, 19.4 for a 10-year-old child, and 18.8 for a 30-year-old adult. The costs of azithromycin PEP among infants, children and adults were $1,976, $132 and $90, respectively. While results were sensitive to changes in PEP effectiveness (11% to 87%), disease transmission (variable among age groups) and hospitalization costs ($379 to $59,644), the choice of strategy remained unchanged.Pertussis PEP is a cost-effective strategy compared with no intervention and plays an important role in contact management, potentially in outbreak situations. From a healthcare payer perspective, azithromycin is the optimal strategy among all contact groups."
https://openalex.org/W1978827544,"Microfluidics is used increasingly for engineering and biomedical applications due to recent advances in microfabrication technologies. Visualization of bubbles, tracer particles, and cells in a microfluidic device is important for designing a device and analyzing results. However, with conventional methods, it is difficult to observe the channel geometry and such particles simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Darkfield Internal Reflection Illumination (DIRI) system that improved the drawbacks of a conventional darkfield illuminator. This study was performed to investigate its utility in the field of microfluidics. The results showed that the developed system could clearly visualize both microbubbles and the channel wall by utilizing brightfield and DIRI illumination simultaneously. The methodology is useful not only for static phenomena, such as clogging, but also for dynamic phenomena, such as the detection of bubbles flowing in a channel. The system was also applied to simultaneous fluorescence and DIRI imaging. Fluorescent tracer beads and channel walls were observed clearly, which may be an advantage for future microparticle image velocimetry (μPIV) analysis, especially near a wall. Two types of cell stained with different colors, and the channel wall, can be recognized using the combined confocal and DIRI system. Whole-slide imaging was also conducted successfully using this system. The tiling function significantly expands the observing area of microfluidics.

https://openalex.org/W2052690244,"The preference for immediate negative events contradicts the minimizing loss principle given that the value of a delayed negative event is discounted by the amount of time it is delayed. However, this preference is understandable if we assume that the value of a future outcome is not restricted to the discounted utility of the outcome per se but is complemented by an anticipated negative utility assigned to an unoffered dimension, which we termed the ""outgrowth."" We conducted three studies to establish the existence of the outgrowth and empirically investigated the mechanism underlying the preference for immediate negative outcomes. Study 1 used a content analysis method to examine whether the outgrowth was generated in accompaniment with the delayed negative events. The results revealed that the investigated outgrowth was composed of two elements. The first component is the anticipated negative emotions elicited by the delayed negative event, and the other is the anticipated rumination during the waiting process, in which one cannot stop thinking about the negative event. Study 2 used a follow-up investigation to examine whether people actually experienced the negative emotions they anticipated in a real situation of waiting for a delayed negative event. The results showed that the participants actually experienced a number of negative emotions when waiting for a negative event. Study 3 examined whether the existence of the outgrowth could make the minimizing loss principle work. The results showed that the difference in pain anticipation between the immediate event and the delayed event could significantly predict the timing preference of the negative event. Our findings suggest that people's preference for experiencing negative events sooner serves to minimize the overall negative utility, which is divided into two parts: the discounted utility of the outcome itself and an anticipated negative utility assigned to the outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2149012676,"Consistent individual differences in behaviour have been well documented in a variety of animal taxa, but surprisingly little is known about the fitness and life-history consequences of such individual variation. In wild salmonids, the timing of fry emergence from gravel spawning nests has been suggested to be coupled with individual behavioural traits. Here, we further investigate the link between timing of spawning nest emergence and behaviour of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), test effects of social rearing environment on behavioural traits in fish with different emergence times, and assess whether behavioural traits measured in the laboratory predict growth, survival, and migration status in the wild. Atlantic salmon fry were sorted with respect to emergence time from artificial spawning nest into three groups: early, intermediate, and late. These emergence groups were hatchery-reared separately or in co-culture for four months to test effects of social rearing environment on behavioural traits. Twenty fish from each of the six treatment groups were then subjected to three individual-based behavioural tests: basal locomotor activity, boldness, and escape response. Following behavioural characterization, the fish were released into a near-natural experimental stream. Results showed differences in escape behaviour between emergence groups in a net restraining test, but the social rearing environment did not affect individual behavioural expression. Emergence time and social environment had no significant effects on survival, growth, and migration status in the stream, although migration propensity was 1.4 to 1.9 times higher for early emerging individuals that were reared separately. In addition, despite individuals showing considerable variation in behaviour across treatment groups, this was not translated into differences in growth, survival, and migration status. Hence, our study adds to the view that fitness (i.e., growth and survival) and life-history predictions from laboratory measures of behaviour should be made with caution and ideally tested in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2156737696,"Chronic psychological stress and nutritional deficiencies are factors that impact negatively on human health and disease risk. Chronic stress has been associated with accelerated leukocyte telomere shortening in numerous cohorts, however, a mechanistic link has proven elusive. This study tested the hypotheses that chronic exposure to the stress hormone, cortisol, causes telomere shortening and chromosome instability (CIN) in vitro, and that these effects would be further exacerbated by folate (vitamin B9) deficiency. Primary human lymphocytes were maintained in vitro for 12 days in medium containing either 25 nM folic acid (FA(low)) or 100 nM FA (FA(high)), together with either 0, 400, 1000 or 3500 nM cortisol. The interactive effects of cortisol and FA were examined by comparing telomere length (TL), biomarkers of DNA damage, and cytostasis. At day 12 TL was 5-17% longer in lymphocytes cultured in FA(low) conditions (mean ± SD;10.2% ± 1.6), compared with those in FA(high) medium (9.1% ± 1, p = 0.02). Refuting the hypothesis, TL was consistently greater in the presence of cortisol. The effect of FA deficiency on the frequency of DNA damage was significant for nucleoplasmic bridges, circular nuclei, micronuclei and nuclear buds, (p < 0.0001 – 0.001). The effect of cortisol, however, was negligible, only reaching statistical significance for the frequency of fused nuclei (p = 0.04). Cortisol was significantly associated with reduced cell division and growth and had an apparent protective effect on cell viability in the FA(low) conditions. Conclusions: Both chronic cortisol exposure, and folate deficiency, resulted in telomere elongation, however, the effect of cortisol was marginal relative to that of folate. Cortisol was not associated with increased chromosomal instability, but caused a significant reduction in cell division and growth. Together these results indicate that cortisol is not directly genotoxic and that the telomere shortening associated with increased psychological stress in vivo may not be explained by a direct effect of cortisol."

However, the molecular mechanisms of S1P regulated migration of papillary thyroid cancer cells are still unknown. In this study, we showed that S1P induced PTK6 mRNA and protein expression in two thyroid follicular cancer cell lines (ML-1 and FTC-133). Further studies demonstrated that induced PTK6 and its downstream signal component (ERK1/2) are involved in S1P-induced migration. Upon investigating the mechanisms behind this event, we found that miR-17 inhibited the expression of PTK6 through direct binding to its 3’-UTR. Through overexpression and knockdown studies, we found that miR-17 can significantly inhibit S1P-induced migration in thyroid follicular cancer cells. Interestingly, overexpression or knockdown of PTK6 or ERK1/2 effectively removed the inhibition of S1P-induced migration by miR-17. Furthermore, we showed that S1P decreased miR-17 expression levels. Meanwhile, in papillary thyroid cancers, miR-17 is downregulated and negatively associated with clinical staging, whereas PTK6 is upregulated and positively associated with clinical stages. Collectively, our work defines a novel signaling pathway implicated in the control of thyroid cancer migration."

However, the involvement of GP receptors in human ischemic stroke pathophysiology and their utility as biomarkers for ischemic stroke risk and severity requires elucidation. Aims To determine whether platelet GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa receptors are differentially expressed in patients with AIS and chronic cerebrovascular disease (CCD) compared with healthy volunteers (HV) and to identify predictors of GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa expression. Methods This was a case—control study of 116 patients with AIS or transient ischemic attack (TIA), 117 patients with CCD, and 104 HV who were enrolled at our University hospital from 2010 to 2013. Blood sampling was performed once in the CCD and HV groups, and at several time points in patients with AIS or TIA. Linear regression and analysis of variance were used to analyze correlations between platelet GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa receptor numbers and demographic and clinical parameters. Results GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa receptor numbers did not significantly differ between the AIS, CCD, and HV groups. GPIb receptor expression level correlated significantly with the magnitude of GPIIb/IIIa receptor expression and the neutrophil count. In contrast, GPIIb/IIIa receptor numbers were not associated with peripheral immune-cell sub-population counts. C-reactive protein was an independent predictor of GPIIb/IIIa (not GPIb) receptor numbers. Conclusions Platelet GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa receptor numbers did not distinguish between patient or control groups in this study, negating their potential use as a biomarker for predicting stroke risk."

For example, the respiratory control network in pregnant rats becomes relatively insensitive to barbiturates due to increased expression of ε-subunit-containing GABAARs in the ventral respiratory column. We hypothesized that this plasticity may be a compensatory response to a chronic increase in inhibitory tone caused by increased central neurosteroid levels. Thus, we tested whether increased inhibitory tone was sufficient to induce ε-subunit upregulation on respiratory and cortical neurons in adult rats. Chronic intermittent increases in inhibitory tone in male and female rats was induced via daily 5-min exposures to 3% isoflurane. After 7d of treatment, phrenic burst frequency was less sensitive to barbiturate in isoflurane-treated male and female rats in vivo. Neurons in the ventral respiratory group and cortex were less sensitive to pentobarbital in vitro following 7d and 30d of intermittent isoflurane-exposure in both male and female rats. The pentobarbital insensitivity in 7d isoflurane-treated rats was reversible after another 7d. We hypothesize that increased inhibitory tone in the respiratory control network and cortex causes a compensatory increase in ε-subunit-containing GABAARs."
https://openalex.org/W2006559810,"Maintaining an appropriate concentration of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution is critical for efficient operation of a bioreactor, requiring sophisticated engineering design and a system of regulation to maximize oxygen transfer from the injected air bubbles to the cells. Bacterial hemoglobins are oxygen-binding proteins that transfer oxygen from the environment to metabolic processes and allow bacteria to grow even under microaerophilic conditions. To improve the oxygen utilization efficiency of cells and overcome the oxygen shortage in bioreactors, the gene coding for the Campylobacter jejuni single domain hemoglobin (CHb) gene was artificially synthesized and functionally expressed under the control of inducible expression promoters PT7 and Pvgh in Escherichia coli. The effects of the recombinants PT7-CHb and Pvgh-CHb on cell growth were evaluated in aerobic shake flasks, anaerobic capped bottles and a 5-L bioreactor, and a pronounced improvement in cell biomass was observed for CHb-expressing cells. To determine the growth curves, CHb gene expression, and CHb oxygen-binding capacity of specific recombinants with different promoters, we determined the time course of CHb gene expression in the two recombinants by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and CO differential spectrum assays. Based on the growth patterns of the two recombinants in the bioreactor, we proposed different recombinant types with optimal performance under specific culture conditions."
