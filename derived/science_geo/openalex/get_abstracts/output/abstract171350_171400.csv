https://openalex.org/W2037174767,"Single-cell mouse embryos were infected in vitro with recombinant lentiviral vectors to generate transgenic mice carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene driven by a ubiquitously expressing promoter . Eighty percent of founder mice carried at least one copy of the transgene, and 90% of these expressed GFP at high levels. Progeny inherited the transgene(s) and displayed green fluorescence. Mice generated using lentiviral vectors with muscle-specific and T lymphocyte–specific promoters expressed high levels of GFP only in the appropriate cell types. We have also generated transgenic rats that express GFP at high levels, suggesting that this technique can be used to produce other transgenic animal species."
https://openalex.org/W2128475635,"T-bet is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors that appears to regulate lineage commitment in CD4 T helper (T H ) lymphocytes in part by activating the hallmark T H 1 cytokine, interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IFN-γ is also produced by natural killer (NK) cells and most prominently by CD8 cytotoxic T cells, and is vital for the control of microbial pathogens. Although T-bet is expressed in all these cell types, it is required for control of IFN-γ production in CD4 and NK cells, but not in CD8 cells. This difference is also apparent in the function of these cell subsets. Thus, the regulation of a single cytokine, IFN-γ, is controlled by distinct transcriptional mechanisms within the T cell lineage."

Here we report on two abstract representations engraved on pieces of red ochre recovered from the Middle Stone Age layers at Blombos Cave in South Africa. A mean date of 77,000 years was obtained for the layers containing the engraved ochres by thermoluminescence dating of burnt lithics, and the stratigraphic integrity was confirmed by an optically stimulated luminescence age of 70,000 years on an overlying dune. These engravings support the emergence of modern human behavior in Africa at least 35,000 years before the start of the Upper Paleolithic."

The devices were fabricated as buried heterostructure lasers with high-reflection coatings on both laser facets, resulting in continuous wave operation with optical output power ranging from 17 milliwatts at 292 kelvin to 3 milliwatts at 312 kelvin, at an emission wavelength of 9.1 micrometers. The results demonstrate the potential of quantum cascade lasers as continuous wave mid-infrared light sources for high-resolution spectroscopy, chemical sensing applications, and free-space optical communication systems."

https://openalex.org/W2168581900,"Human asthma is associated with airway infiltration by T helper 2 (TH2) lymphocytes. We observed reduced expression of the TH1 transcription factor, T-bet, in T cells from airways of patients with asthma compared with that in T cells from airways of nonasthmatic patients, suggesting that loss of T-bet might be associated with asthma. Mice with a targeted deletion of the T-bet gene and severe combined immunodeficient mice receiving CD4+ cells from T-bet knockout mice spontaneously demonstrated multiple physiological and inflammatory features characteristic of asthma. Thus, T-bet deficiency, in the absence of allergen exposure, induces a murine phenotype reminiscent of both acute and chronic human asthma."

https://openalex.org/W2079644509,"Prostaglandin D2(PGD2), a major cyclooxygenase product in a variety of tissues, readily undergoes dehydration to yield the cyclopentenone-type PGs of the J2 series, such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2), which have been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Meanwhile, the mechanism of these effects is not well understood and the natural site and the extent of its productionin vivo remain unclear. In the present study, we raised a monoclonal antibody specific to 15d-PGJ2 and determined its production in inflammation-related events. The monoclonal antibody (mAb11G2) was raised against the 15d-PGJ2-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate and was found to recognize free 15d-PGJ2 specifically. The presence of 15d-PGJ2 in vivo was immunohistochemically verified in the cytoplasm of most of the foamy macrophages in human atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, the immunostaining of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages with mAb11G2 demonstrated an enhanced intracellular accumulation of 15d-PGJ2, suggesting that the PGD2 metabolic pathway, generating the anti-inflammatory PGs, is indeed utilized in the cells during inflammation. The activation of macrophages also resulted in the extracellular production of PGD2, which was associated with a significant increase in the extracellular 15d-PGJ2 levels, and the extracellular 15d-PGJ2production was reproduced by incubating PGD2 in a cell-free medium and in phosphate-buffered saline. Moreover, using a chiral high performance liquid chromatography method for separation of PGD2 metabolites, we established a novel metabolic pathway, in which PGD2 is converted to 15d-PGJ2 via an albumin-independent mechanism.

Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 2Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). PGs are derived from fatty acids, primarily arachidonate, which are released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipases. Arachidonate is first converted to an unstable endoperoxide intermediate by cyclooxygenases and subsequently converted to one of several related products, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, prostacyclin (PGI2), and thromboxane A2, through the action of specific PG synthetases. PGD2, among them, is a major cyclooxygenase (COX) product in a variety of tissues and cells and has marked effects on a number of biological processes, including platelet aggregation, relaxation of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscles, and nerve cell functions (3Giles H. Leff P. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The PGs are physiologically present in body fluids in picomolar-to-nanomolar concentrations (4Fukushima M. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar); however, arachidonate metabolism is highly increased under several pathological conditions, including hyperthermia, infection, and inflammation (5Herschman H.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 407: 61-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and local PG concentrations in the micromolar range have been detected at sites of acute inflammation (6Offenbacher S. Odle B.M. Van Dyke T.E. J. Periodontal Res. 1986; 21: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In vitro, PGD2spontaneously converts into the cyclopentenone PGs of the J series, such as PGJ2, Δ12-PGJ2, and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) (see Fig. 1) (7Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol.

A. 1984; 81: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this pathway is utilized in the organism, but it is clear that J2 prostanoids are synthesized in vivo. This is based on the observations that Δ12-PGJ2 is a natural component of human body fluids (9Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayashi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that Δ12-PGJ2 synthesis is suppressed by treatment with COX inhibitors (9Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S.

The natural precursor of PGJ2 derivatives appears to be PGD2, because its in vivo administration leads to a large increase in Δ12-PGJ2 (9Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M.

The cyclopentenone PGs have been reported to have their own unique spectrum of biological effects, including inhibition of macrophage-derived cytokine production (10Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M.

Furthermore, recent studies have reported that they can function as a feedback regulator of the inflammatory response (12Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 13Straus D. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.-H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, the mechanism of these effects is not well understood, and the natural site and the extent of their productions in vivo remain unclear. Because PGD2is the major prostaglandin in most tissues (4Fukushima M. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the cyclopentenone-type PGD2 metabolites are produced at a number of sites and may reach functionally significant levels in inflammation and its related disorders. In the present study, we raised a monoclonal antibody specific to 15d-PGJ2 and determined its endogenous production in human atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, we investigated the intracellular and extracellular production of 15d-PGJ2 in the activated RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro and established a novel mechanism of transformation of PGD2 into the cyclopentenone-type PGJ2 derivatives, in which PGD2 is converted to 15d-PGJ2 via an albumin-independent mechanism. PGs were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was obtained from Pierce. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulin and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK). Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO). Murine RAW264.7 macrophages were kind gifts from Dr. A. Murakami (Kinki University) and Dr. W. Maruyama (National Institutes of Longevity Sciences), respectively. RAW264.7 cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 0.2% NaHCO3, at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells post-confluency were exposed to LPS (10 μg/ml) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. 15d-PGJ2 was coupled to KLH by 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) as described by Grabarek and Gergely (20Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Female BALB/c mice were immunized three times with the 15d-PGJ2-KLH conjugate. Spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine selection medium. Culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using ELISA, employing pairs of wells of microtiter plates on which was absorbed 15d-PGJ2-BSA conjugate as the antigen (0.5 μg of protein/well). After incubation with 100 μl of hybridoma supernatants, and with intervening washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by a substrate solution containing 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Hybridoma cells corresponding to supernatants that were positive on 15d-PGJ2-BSA were then cloned by limiting dilution. After repeated screening, two clones were obtained. Among them, clone 11G2 showed the most distinctive recognition of 15d-PGJ2-BSA. A gel was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and treated with anti-COX-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). This procedure was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The bands were visualized by exposure of the membranes to autoradiography film. Cells were fixed overnight in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid at 4 °C. Membranes were permeabilized by exposing the fixed cells to PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated sequentially in PBS solutions containing 2% BSA and primary antibody (mAb11G2). The cells were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) or Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), rinsed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and covered with anti-fade solution. Images of cellular immunofluorescence were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoroview, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd, Tokyo) with a ×40 objective (488-nm excitation and 518-nm emission). Extracellular PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 levels were determined in the culture medium of RAW264.7 macrophages activated with LPS. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was collected and stored at −80 °C. For determination of PGD2, a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical) was performed as suggested by the manufacturer, and the PGD2 level was determined using a standard curve and a linear log-logit transformation. For determination of 15d-PGJ2 in the cell culture medium, the medium (5 ml) was extracted immediately with 3 × 5 ml of ethyl acetate, and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen. The residue was reconstituted in 200 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween) and incubated with the antibody (mAb11G2) for 20 h at 4 °C to yield competitor/antibody mixtures containing antibody at 0.2 μg/ml. A 100-μl aliquot of the competitor/antibody mixture was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with PBS/Tween, the second antibody was added, and the enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed as previously described. The 15d-PGJ2 levels in the medium were determined using a standard curve and a linear log-logit transformation. For determination of 15d-PGJ2upon in vitro incubation of PGD2 in cell-free medium or PBS, an aliquot (200 μl) of the reaction mixtures was directly subjected to the competitive ELISA assay. Aortic wall samples were obtained at autopsy from five cases of arterial atherosclerosis without diabetes mellitus or any other arterial disorders, performed after their family members granted informed consent. Tissue samples of each case were processed for making frozen materials and used for hematoxylin-eosin stain and immunohistochemical stain. The samples were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Fine Technical Co., Tokyo, Japan), stored at −80 °C, and cut into 6-m-thick sections by a cryostat. The sections were rehydrated in distilled water, quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, and pretreated with 3% nonimmune serum followed by blocking endogenous avidin/biotin activity using a kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies. Immunoreaction was visualized by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method using the appropriate Vectastain ABC kit (Vector). Immunostained sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Sections from which the primary antibodies were omitted served as negative reaction controls. Incubation of PGs was carried out in PBS at 37 °C. Samples were withdrawn periodically and extracted immediately with 3 × 0.2 ml of ethyl acetate. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the residue was reconstituted in 50 μl of the chromatographic mobile phase. PG metabolites were separated on a ChiralPak AD-RH column (0.46 × 15 cm, Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (90/10/0.01, v/v) (solvent A) − acetonitrile (solvent B) (time = 0–5 min, 100% A; 60 min, 0% A), at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by UV absorbance at 200–400 nm. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was measured with a Jasco PlatformII-LC instrument. 15d-PGJ2 is believed to be physiologically formed through the nonenzymatic conversion of PGD2 (Fig. 1) but has never been definitively proven to exist in vivo. In view of its biological significance, it is critical to provide evidence that 15d-PGJ2 is endogenously produced in vivo. To this end, we produced a monoclonal antibody directed to 15d-PGJ2. The antibody was raised against the 15d-PGJ2-KLH conjugate, which was prepared from the reaction of KLH with 15d-PGJ2 in the presence of EDC and sulfo-NHS (Fig. 2 A). During the preparation of the monoclonal antibodies, hybridomas were selected on the basis of the ability of their antibodies to bind to the 15d-PGJ2-BSA conjugate. After repeated screening, three clones were obtained. Among them, the antibody produced by the clone 11G2 most strongly recognized the 15d-PGJ2-BSA conjugate but did not recognize the native BSA (Fig. 2 B). The antibody was then tested for immunoreactivity with PGs. As shown in Fig.2 C, mAb11G2 recognized 15d-PGJ2 most significantly. Both PGJ2 and Δ12-PGJ2 also served as weak antigens, although their inhibitions were about 50% times lower than 15d-PGJ2. The antibody did not cross-react with other PGs, such as PGA2, PGB2, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, and PGI2 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicated that mAb11G2 was directed almost exclusively against the structure of 15d-PGJ2. We first examined the in vivopresence of 15d-PGJ2 in human atherosclerotic lesions. In broad outline, atherosclerosis is considered to be a form of chronic inflammation. The early stage of atherosclerosis is characterized histopathologically by formation of fatty streaks composed of macrophage-derived foamy cells and exudate-rich extracellular matrix in the intima. The advanced stage of this disease is characterized by increased numbers of foamy macrophages and ulceration and calcification of the fibrously thickened intima. As shown in Fig.3, intense immunoreactivities for COX-2 (panel C) and 15d-PGJ2 (panel D) were found to be localized in the cytoplasm of foamy macrophages identified in hematoxylin-eosin-stained (panel A) or CD68-immunostained (panel B) sections. Aortic wall areas showing atherosclerotic changes displayed no significant 15-PGJ2immunoreactivity. No immunoreaction product deposits were detected in sections with omission of the primary antibodies (data not shown). These observations verified for the first time the intracellular accumulation of 15d-PGJ2 in vivo. To examine whether 15d-PGJ2 is produced in response to inflammatory stimuli in vitro, RAW264.7 macrophages were exposed to a pro-inflammatory agent (LPS) and 15d-PGJ2 produced within the cells was stained with mAb11G2. As shown in Fig. 4 Aand 4 B (panels a and b), LPS led to a significant induction of COX-2 in RAW264.7 macrophages. Consistent with the COX-2 up-regulation, exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in the appearance of 15d-PGJ2 immunoreactivity in essentially all cells (Fig. 4 B, panels c and d). An immunofluorescence double labeling of the activated cells revealed almost identical cellular distribution of COX-2 and 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 4 C). These results were consistent with the in vivo observations that 15d-PGJ2 was detected intracellularly in the macrophage-derived foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions (Fig. 3). Taking these in vivo and in vitro data together, it is evident that the production of 15d-PGJ2 is highly accelerated in the cells during inflammatory processes. PGs are synthesized in a broad range of tissue types and serve not only as autocrine but also as paracrine mediators to signal changes within the immediate environment. Hortelanoet al. (17Hortelano S. Castrillo A. Alvarez A.M. Bosca L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6525-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have also suggested that 15d-PGJ2may contribute to the resolution of inflammation as a paracrine factor. The extracellular production of 15d-PGJ2 in the activated macrophages was indeed suggested by the observation that the culture medium of macrophages treated with LPS exerted an excitotoxic effect on neurons (data not shown). To examine whether 15d-PGJ2 is extracellularly produced during inflammation, the levels of 15d-PGJ2 in the culture medium of the activated macrophages were measured by a competitive ELISA assay. As shown in Fig.5 A, the calibration range (0.1–10 nmol) of the standard curve for 15d-PGJ2 was obtained. In parallel with the COX-2 up-regulation, the extracellular levels of PGD2 in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were significantly increased (Fig. 5 B). In addition, accompanied by the production of PGD2, a significant amount of 15d-PGJ2 was accumulated in the culture medium (Fig.5 C). The levels of these PGs reached maximums after 12 h of incubation and then decreased thereafter. These data proved that 15d-PGJ2 was produced extracellularly during inflammatory processes. Because PGD2 is known to be converted sequentially to the J2 derivatives of PGs in vitro (Fig. 1) (21Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), it was anticipated that 15d-PGJ2could be produced extracellularly in the medium through the metabolism of PGD2. To examine the extracellular conversion of PGD2 to 15d-PGJ2, 1 mmPGD2 was incubated in the cell-free medium and the formation of 15d-PGJ2 was examined. As shown in Fig.6 A, 15d-PGJ2 was detectable by the ELISA assay within 1 h after initiating the incubation. The concentration of 15d-PGJ2 increased almost linearly from 0 to 8 h and reached a maximum concentration at 24 h. The amount corresponded to the 8% PGD2 that disappeared during incubation. The maximum levels were maintained for the duration of the experiment. Serum albumin has been identified as the plasma protein that can catalyze the in vitro transformation of PGD2into the J2 derivatives of PGs in aqueous buffer (7Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, to examine whether serum albumin contained in the medium functioned as a catalyst in the conversion of PGD2 to 15d-PGJ2, 1 mm PGD2 was incubated in PBS containing 10 mg/ml human serum albumin. As expected, PGD2 was similarly converted to 15d-PGJ2 in PBS containing serum albumin (Fig. 6 B). However, to our surprise, the conversion was dramatically accelerated in the absence of albumin. These data suggest that serum albumin may be rather inhibitory toward the production of 15d-PGJ2 from PGD2. The data (Fig. 6 B) contradict the mechanism of PGD2metabolism (Fig. 1), in which PGD2 is sequentially converted to PGJ2, Δ12-PGJ2, and 15d-PGJ2 and the route of conversion leading from PGJ2 to Δ12-PGJ2 is catalyzed by serum albumin, therefore, suggesting the presence of an albumin-independent mechanism for production of 15d-PGJ2. To establish a mechanism of transformation of PGD2 into the cyclopentenone-type PGJ2 derivatives, we developed a chiral HPLC method for separation of PGD2 metabolites and investigated the conventional PGD2 metabolic pathway in detail. When PGD2 (1 mm) was incubated in PBS for 24 h, three products (a, b, andc) were mainly detected (Fig.7 A, peaks a,b, and c, respectively). Over the course of the 24-h period of incubation, no additional abundant products were formed and there were only minor changes in the product pattern (data not shown). The UV spectra of these products were almost indistinguishable. Based on the identical retention time and cochromatography with authentic PGs, the products a,b, and c were suggested to be PGJ2, 15d-PGD2, and 15d-PGJ2, respectively. The identification of the products was finally done by LC-MS analysis of the products, which showed molecular ion peaks atm/z 316.4 (M − H2O)+ (a), 334.6 (M)+(b), and 316.9 (M)+ (c). It is striking to note that Δ12-PGJ2, which was reported to be an immediate metabolite of PGJ2 in the transformation of PGD2 (21Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1992; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was not detected in the incubation of PGD2 alone in PBS. Both PGJ2 and 15d-PGD2 were estimated to be generated through dehydration reactions at C9 and C15 of PGD2, respectively, and to be further dehydrated to 15d-PGJ2. Hence, to identify the direct precursor of 15d-PGJ2, PGJ2 and 15d-PGD2 were individually incubated in PBS at 37 °C and the products were analyzed by chiral-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 7 (B andC), PGJ2 was stoichiometrically converted to 15d-PGJ2, whereas no further conversion of 15d-PGD2 was observed (data not shown). In addition, we were unable to detect Δ12-PGJ2 upon incubation of PGJ2 and 15d-PGD2, suggesting that Δ12-PGJ2 was not involved in the spontaneous conversion of PGD2 to the PGJ2derivatives. These data indicate that the PGD2 is primarily converted to three products, including PGJ2, 15d-PGD2, and 15d-PGJ2, among which PGJ2 is a direct precursor of 15d-PGJ2. Serum albumin has been previously identified as the endogenous catalyst of PGD2 metabolism (7Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kikawa Y. Narumiya S. Fukushima M. Wakatsuka H. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these workers have identified Δ12-PGJ2 as the major product in the albumin-catalyzed PGD2 metabolism. Hence, to characterize the albumin-dependent PGD2metabolic pathway, PGD2 was incubated in PBS containing human serum albumin (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C, and the products were analyzed by chiral-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig.8 A (upper chromatogram), incubation of PGD2 with human serum albumin yielded, not only the same products (15d-PGD2, PGJ2, and 15d-PGJ2) as those detected in the spontaneous conversion of PGD2 in albumin-free solution (Fig. 7 A) but also a major product which cochromatographed on HPLC with Δ12-PGJ2. The LC-MS analysis of the product showed molecular ion (M)+ peak atm/z 334.8, which coincided with the theoretical molecular weight of Δ12-PGJ2. Thus, the product was determined to be Δ12-PGJ2. It was observed that PGJ2 was converted to both 15d-PGJ2 and Δ12-PGJ2 in the presence of human serum albumin (Fig. 8 A,middle). Moreover, no further conversion of Δ12-PGJ2 was observed (Fig. 8 A,bottom), indicating that Δ12-PGJ2represents one of the terminal product of PGD2 metabolism. Isomerization of PGJ2 to Δ12-PGJ2was dependent on the incubation time and the concentration of human serum albumin: When human serum albumin was present in excess, PGJ2 was almost stoichiometrically converted to Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig. 8 B). Boiling of serum albumin markedly decreased the formation of Δ12-PGJ2 from PGJ2 but did not affect the formation of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 8 C), suggesting that Δ12-PGJ2 is formed by the enzymatic action of albumin while 15d-PGJ2 is a nonenzymatically formed product. Taken together, these data suggest that PGD2 is sequentially converted to PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 in an albumin-independent manner and serum albumin is involved only in the process leading from PGJ2 to Δ12-PGJ2 (Fig.9). Immunochemical detection is a powerful tool that can be used to evaluate the presence of a desired target and its subcellular localization. The major advantages of this technique over other biochemical approaches are the evaluation of small numbers of cells or archival tissues that may otherwise not be subject to analysis. In this study, we obtained a murine monoclonal antibody, mAb11G2, that clearly distinguished the 15d-PGJ2-protein conjugate from the native protein. Characterization of the antibody revealed that the monoclonal antibody was directed almost exclusively against free 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 2). It was expected that mAb11G2 would be useful in assessing the endogenous production of 15d-PGJ2in response to inflammatory stimuli. In vivo detection of 15d-PGJ2 using mAb11G2 was first attempted in the tissue samples from the patients with atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is considered to be a form of chronic inflammation resulting from interaction between modified lipoproteins, monocyte-derived macrophages, T cells, and the normal cellular elements of the arterial wall. This inflammatory process can ultimately lead to the development of complex lesions, or plaques, that protrude into the arterial lumen. In the present study, we confirmed that atheromatous lesions indeed contained high levels of COX-2, colocalizing mainly with foamy macrophages (Fig. 3 C). In addition, 15d-PGJ2 was also found to localize predominantly with the lesional macrophages (Fig. 3 D). These observations raise the possibility that 15d-PGJ2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammation-related disorders, such as atherosclerosis. Activation of the host immune system by Gram-negative bacteria can be reproduced in vitro by incubation of cells with LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Macrophages participate actively in the onset of inflammation and immune system activation by releasing cytokines that amplify the initial inflammatory stimulat"

The molecular mechanism of JNK-mediated apoptosis was investigated in adult rat cardiac myocytes in culture as a model system that is sensitive to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress caused JNK activation, cytochromec release, and apoptosis without new protein synthesis. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was abrogated by dominant negative stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 (SEK1)-mediated inhibition of the JNK pathway, whereas activation of the JNK pathway by constitutively active SEK1 was sufficient to cause apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-9, an apical caspase in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, suppressed oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of caspase-8 had no effect, indicating that both the JNK pathway and the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery are central to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Both JNK and SEK1 localized on mitochondria where JNK was activated by oxidative stress. Furthermore, active JNK caused the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria in a cell-free assay.

In addition, cells injured by environmental stress undergo apoptosis in pathophysiological conditions. The ordered process in apoptosis is exemplified by Fas-mediated activation of the caspase cascade (for review, see Ref. 1Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Ligand-mediated aggregation of Fas receptor generates the center of “death signaling,” which activates caspase-8 that cleaves and activates downstream caspases such as caspase-3. Recent progress unraveled the fact that mitochondria are central to death signaling (for review, see Ref. 2Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). In certain situations, death stimuli induce an increase in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane that releases apoptosis inducers such as cytochrome c (3Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)1 (4Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I.

Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Cytochromec activates caspase-9 to initiate the activation and amplification of death signaling. Despite the advance in understanding the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis, it remains unclear how environmental stress activates apoptosis machinery. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)) is one of the leading candidate signal transduction mechanisms that transmits and converts stress signaling into apoptosis signaling in various cell types (for review, see Ref 5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Thus, the JNK pathway is activated by various apoptosis-inducing environmental stresses that cause apoptosis. Inhibition of the JNK pathway abrogates apoptosis induced by these stresses, whereas activation of the JNK pathway is often sufficient to induce apoptosis. The JNK pathway was reported to activate receptor-mediated apoptosis by induction of the Fas ligand in T lymphocyte (6Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been proposed that the JNK pathway is necessary for UV irradiation-induced activation of mitochondrial death machinery in embryonic fibroblast (7Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). However, the molecular linkage between the JNK pathway and apoptosis pathway is still missing. Recent evidence indicates that apoptosis plays an important role in the loss of cardiac myocytes in pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia (8Bialik S. Geenen D.L. Sasson I.E. Cheng R. Horner J.W. Evans S.M. Lord E.M. Koch C.J. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and ischemia/reperfusion (for review, see Ref. 9Das D.K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We previously reported that hypoxia and reoxygenation of adult cardiac myocytes in culture induces activation of mitochondrial death machinery by oxidative stress (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The current study was designed to elucidate the role of JNK in environmental stress-induced apoptosis and the mechanism of JNK-mediated apoptosis in adult cardiac myocytes in culture as a model system. Apoptosis was induced by oxidative stress as an environmental stress relevant to this cell type experienced in pathophysiological conditions including ischemic heart disease. Our results indicate that JNK resides on mitochondria in cardiac myocytes where oxidative stress causes sustained activation of JNK. Activation of JNK is crucial for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, activated JNK phosphorylates several mitochondrial proteins and causes the release of cytochrome c and AIF by selective permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane in the absence other cellular components. Culture of adult rat cardiac ventricular myocytes was performed as described previously (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Experiments were started 24 h after plating with the exception of adenovirus infection, which was carried out on the day of the plating. Adult rat ventricular myocytes were treated with 0.1 mmH2O2 and 0.1 mm FeSO4as a superoxide-generating system for 1 h (11von Harsdorf R. Li P.F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Myocytes were then cultured in fresh media for the indicated period. DNA fragmentation and cell viability assays by trypan blue staining were performed as described previously (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For quantification of apoptotic cells, myocytes were stained with annexin V (AnV) and propidium iodide (PI) at the end of the experiments as described previously (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This method has been shown to correlate well with terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For specific inhibition of caspases, myocyte cultures were treated with 20 μm z-IETD-fmk or z-LEHD-fmk (Calbiochem) for 30 min before, during and after oxidative stress or adenoviral infection. These conditions have been reported to specifically inhibit caspase-8 (z-IETD-fmk) (12Feldenberg L.R. Thevananther S. del Rio M. de Leon M. Devarajan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F837-F846PubMed Google Scholar) or caspase-9 (z-LEHD-fmk) (13Xiao Y. He J. Gilbert R.D. Zhang L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar) and apoptosis mediated by these caspases in various cell systems including cardiac myocytes. Adenoviral vectors for FLAG-tagged dominant negative (Ad/dnSEK1) and constitutively active (Ad/caSEK1) stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 (SEK1; also known as MKK4) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and adenovirus recombination system (courtesy of Dr. S. Hardy) as described previously (14Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In control experiments, an adenoviral vector encoding nuclear localizing β-galactosidase (Ad/LacZ) was used at the same multiplicity of infection. Cardiac myocytes were stained with MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) and anti-SEK1 (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-JNK1 antibody and observed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC1024). Transmission electron microscopy of the mitochondrial fraction was performed as described previously (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recombinant constitutively active SEK1 (rSEK1 ED) and kinase-inactive SEK1 (rSEK1 KR) were produced as hexahistidine-tagged proteins and purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen). Wild type (rJNK WT) and kinase-inactive JNK (rJNK KR) were produced as GST fusion proteins (courtesy of Dr. J. Kyriakis). Recombinant rJNK WT and rJNK KR were phosphorylated by rSEK1 ED in the presence of 100 μm ATP and purified by glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Subcellular fractionation was performed using a previously published method (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), with further purification of the mitochondria by Percoll density gradient (15Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were incubated with or without rSEK ED, rSEK KR, or in vitrophosphorylated rJNK WT or rJNK KR. After centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C) to remove mitochondria, the supernatant and mitochondrial pellets were analyzed for various mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential was assessed by a mitochondrial voltage-sensitive dye JC-1 (Molecular Probes) and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). Western blotting and in vitro immune complex kinase assay of mitogen-activated protein kinases were performed as described previously (16Aoki H. Richmond M. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The post-test comparison was performed by the method of Bonferroni.P values of <0.05 were accepted to be significant. Transient oxidative stress (0.1 mmH2O2 and 0.1 mm FeSO4) caused prolonged activation of JNK in adult ventricular myocytes in culture as demonstrated by in vitro immune complex kinase assay during and after oxidative stress (Fig.1 A). To elucidate the role of the JNK pathway in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of adult cardiac myocytes, we utilized SEK1 (also known as MKK4), which specifically regulates JNK activity without affecting other mitogen-activated protein kinases (17Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The JNK activities in adult cardiac myocytes were effectively manipulated by adenoviral vectors encoding a dominant negative (Ad/dnSEK1) or a constitutively active mutant (Ad/caSEK1) of SEK1. Expression of dnSEK1 suppressed oxidative stress-induced JNK1 activation by 58.9 ± 10.9% (p < 0.05 compared with oxidative stress alone), whereas expression of caSEK1 resulted in 42.6 ± 9.3% of JNK activity (n = 4,p < 0.05 compared with control) without oxidative stress. Adenoviral expression of SEK1 mutants did not affect ERK or p38 activity (data not shown). The involvement of the SEK1/JNK pathway in cardiac myocyte apoptosis was demonstrated using the DNA fragmentation assay. As shown in Fig.1 B, oxidative stress increased DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 B, lane 2), indicating an increase in apoptosis. Expression of dnSEK1 suppressed oxidative stress-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), whereas expression of caSEK1 resulted in an increase in fragmented DNA at base line (Fig. 1 B, lane 5), which was further increased by oxidative stress (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). Quantitative analysis of apoptosis was performed 6 h after oxidative stress by staining cultured cardiac myocytes with AnV and PI, as shown in Fig. 1 C. Cells with AnV staining but without nuclear PI staining were counted as apoptotic cells (Fig.1 C, inset, arrow). AnV stained plasma membranes with an irregular shape, suggesting that these cells are undergoing the process of plasma membrane blebbing (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the control culture, oxidative stress caused a significant increase in apoptosis (Fig. 1 C, 8.7 ± 0.4 to 48.4 ± 8.6%, p < 0.001, n = 5). In myocyte cultures expressing dnSEK1, the percentage of basal apoptotic cells did not change significantly (Fig. 1 C, 13.4 ± 3.8%, not significant compared with control without oxidative stress,n = 5), but oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was significantly suppressed (Fig. 1 C, 29.3 ± 3.2%,p < 0.05 compared with control with oxidative stress,n = 5). The expression of caSEK1 caused an increase in basal apoptosis (Fig. 1 C, 27.0 ± 3.2%,p < 0.05 compared with control without oxidative stress, n = 5), which was further increased upon oxidative stress (Fig. 1 C, 55.8 ± 3.2%,p < 0.001 compared with caSEK1 without oxidative stress). As shown in Fig. 1 D, oxidative stress caused a significant decrease in cell viability (93.0 ± 0.5 versus36.9 ± 15.9%, p < 0.001, n = 5), which was partially blocked by dnSEK1 (63.6 ± 7.5%,p < 0.05 compared with Ad/LacZ with oxidative stress,n = 5). On the other hand, caSEK1 alone caused a decrease in cell viability at base line (65.8 ± 7.3%,p < 0.05 compared with Ad/LacZ alone,n = 5), which was further decreased by oxidative stress (38.7 ± 8.9%, not significant compared with Ad/LacZ plus oxidative stress, p < 0.001 compared with Ad/LacZ). These results indicate that inhibition of the JNK pathway by dnSEK1 suppresses oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and cell death, whereas activation of the JNK pathway results in an increase in apoptosis and cell death. One of the proposed mechanisms of JNK-mediated apoptosis is the phosphorylation of c-Jun and transactivation of c-Jun target genes, which may include c-Jun itself and pro-apoptotic molecules such as Fas ligand (18Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5414-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore this possibility in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes, the effect of protein synthesis inhibition was examined by treating adult myocytes with cycloheximide. Oxidative stress caused a 2.4-fold induction of c-Jun protein, a well characterized target of the JNK pathway, which was inhibited by 20 μm cycloheximide, indicating that oxidative stress-induced new protein synthesis was effectively blocked (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of adult cardiac myocytes with cycloheximide did not affect the basal or oxidative stress-induced activity of JNK1 (9.4 ± 1.7-versus 9.1 ± 1.3-fold without or with cycloheximide, respectively, n = 3) (Fig. 2 B) as reported in T lymphoma cells (19Ofir R. Zhang L.C. Adams J.M. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although this kinase was initially identified by virtue of cycloheximide-induced activation (20Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17355-17363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of protein synthesis did not affect basal (8.7 ± 1.6versus 9.3 ± 0.8%, control versuscycloheximide, n = 4) or oxidative stress-induced (34.9 ± 5.2 versus 43.2 ± 7.8%, controlversus cycloheximide, n = 4) apoptosis in adult myocytes (Fig. 2 C). Cycloheximide did not affect cell viability either in the culture without (94.0 ± 5.0versus 92.6 ± 2.3%, control versuscycloheximide, n = 4) or with oxidative stress (63.7 ± 9.9 versus 50.4 ± 7.9%, controlversus cycloheximide, n = 4) (Fig.2 D). These results indicate that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis or cell death is largely independent of new protein synthesis. In addition, suppression of protein synthesis does not cause or enhance apoptosis in this condition. To further elucidate the mechanism of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, we examined the role of caspase-9, a regulatory caspase in the mitochondrial pathway. Adult cardiac myocyte cultures were treated with z-LEHD-fmk (20 μm), a specific caspase-9 inhibitor, 30 min before, during, and after oxidative stress. When adult myocytes were treated with z-LEHD-fmk, oxidative stress-induced activation of JNK or base-line apoptosis was not affected (data not shown). However, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was markedly attenuated from 46.6 ± 4.4 to 17.2 ± 2.0% by z-LEHD-fmk (Fig.3 A, hatched column,p < 0.001 compared with oxidative stress alone,n = 4, 6 h after stimulation). This was in sharp contrast to the inhibition of caspase-8 by another peptide inhibitor, z-IETD-fmk, which had no effect on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis at 20 μm (Fig. 3 A, cross-hatched column) or 50 μm (data not shown). These results indicate that oxidative stress activates caspase-9-dependent, but not caspase-8-dependent apoptotic machinery, most likely involving the mitochondrial pathway. To investigate the molecular order of the SEK1/JNK pathway and caspase-9, the effect of caspase-9 inhibition was examined in adult cardiac myocytes infected with Ad/caSEK1. As shown in Fig.3 B, treatment of myocytes with z-LEHD-fmk attenuated apoptosis from 29.1 ± 2.7% (Ad/caSEK1) to 16.9 ± 2.2% (z-LEHD-fmk plus Ad/caSEK1, p < 0.01 compared with Ad/caSEK1, n = 4). This result indicates that SEK1/JNK induces apoptosis mostly in a caspase-9-dependent manner in adult cardiac myocytes, making a hierarchical signaling pathway. The activation of mitochondrial death machinery in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was further supported by the observation that oxidative stress caused an increase in cytosolic cytochrome c content in cardiac myocyte cultures (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that oxidative stress activates SEK1/JNK pathway, which in turn activates mitochondrial death machinery to cause cytochromec release. Because our results suggest the involvement of mitochondrial death machinery in oxidative stress-induced SEK1/JNK-dependent apoptosis, subcellular localization of endogenous SEK1 and JNK1 was examined using immunofluorescence staining and laser-scanning confocal microscopy. JNK1 staining showed a lattice-like pattern of extranuclear staining, which partly colocalized with mitochondria (Fig. 4 A,d–f, arrowheads) in addition to nuclei (Fig.4 A, b and c, arrows) and Z-band (Fig. 4 A, e and f). SEK1 staining showed only extranuclear staining, which revealed an overlapping pattern with mitochondrial staining (Fig. 4 A,g–l, arrowheads). Localization of SEK1 and JNK1 on mitochondria was also examined by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting. The purity of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was verified by Western blotting for cytochrome c, a mitochondrial protein, and Rho-GDI, a cytosolic protein (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 B, SEK1 and JNK1 were detected in both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. The subcellular distribution of JNK1 (Fig.4 C) or SEK1 (data not shown) did not change significantly upon oxidative stress, as determined by subcellular fractionation. However, when myocytes were exposed to oxidative stress, JNK on mitochondria was phosphorylated and, hence, activated, whereas cytosolic JNK remained non-phosphorylated (Fig. 4 C) as determined by Western blotting for phosphorylated (active) JNK. Therefore, both SEK1 and JNK1 colocalize with mitochondria in part, and JNK on mitochondria is preferentially activated in response to oxidative stress. These findings raise the possibility for the interaction of the SEK1/JNK pathway with mitochondrial death machinery. The effect of active JNK on mitochondrial death machinery was examined in the cell-free assay. Mitochondria were isolated from rat heart by differential centrifugation (10Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and purified by Percoll density gradient (15Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The purity of mitochondria was verified by electron microscopy (Fig. 5 A) and Western blotting for mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and cytosolic proteins (cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, troponin T, and Rho-GDI, respectively, data not shown). Both recombinant wild type JNK (rJNK WT) and catalytically inactive JNK (rJNK KR) were phosphorylated in vitro by rSEK1 ED and purified using glutathione beads. The activity of the in vitro activated rJNK was verified byin vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate (Fig. 5 B). Purified mitochondria were incubated with in vitrophosphorylated rJNK WT or rJNK KR in the presence of ATP. After removing mitochondria by centrifugation, proteins in the supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting using a panel of antibodies for mitochondrial proteins. As shown in Fig.6 A, active rJNK WT caused the release of cytochrome c from purified mitochondria. In contrast, rJNK KR, which was phosphorylated by rSEK1 ED but lacking catalytic activity, did not cause cytochrome c release, indicating that the catalytic activity of JNK is essential for cytochrome c release. Other intermembranous proteins, namely AIF (4Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) and adenylate kinase 2 (21Kohler C. Gahm A. Noma T. Nakazawa A. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), were also found to be released from mitochondria by rJNK WT (Fig. 6 A). The addition of the cytosolic fraction to the reaction did not affect JNK-induced cytochrome c release (data not shown), suggesting that cytosolic factors may not be involved in JNK-induced cytochromec release. When the supernatant was analyzed for inner membrane proteins (cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, prohibitin, and ATP synthase subunit α) or a mitochondrial matrix protein, mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70), only a trace amount was detected (Fig.6 A). In addition, the amount of these proteins did not differ among control, rJNK WT, and rJNK KR. These data indicate that active JNK causes permeabilization of the outer membrane but not the inner membrane of mitochondria. Because endogenous JNK was found to localize on mitochondria (Fig. 4), we also examined whether recombinant constitutively active SEK1 (rSEK1 ED), which activates JNK, can activate mitochondrial death machinery. Incubation of isolated mitochondria with rSEK1 ED also resulted in the release of intermembranous proteins into the supernatant (Fig.6 A). In contrast, the inactive form of SEK1 (rSEK1 KR) did not cause significant cytochrome c release (Fig.6 A). We examined whether JNK treatment of mitochondria induced a change in the amount of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Fig.6 B). When the mitochondrial fraction was analyzed by Western blotting, the amount of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL was not changed by JNK. We did not detect Bid in the mitochondrial fraction (data not shown), probably because Bid resides in the cytosol under basal conditions. In addition, we did not detect the migration shift of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, suggesting that the phosphorylation status of these anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins may not significantly change under this condition. Treatment of purified mitochondria with recombinant active JNK or catalytically inactive JNK did not cause detectable mitochondrial depolarization, as determined by a mitochondrial voltage sensitive dye JC-1 and flow cytometry (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, treatment of mitochondria with 500 μm Ca2+ (data not shown) or 1 μm valinomycin in the presence of K+ caused a marked decrease in the intensity of JC-1 fluorescence incorporated into mitochondria (Fig. 6 C), indicating the depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Therefore, JNK seems to cause a selective permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane without the loss of mitochondrial potential, as reported in Bid- and Bax-induced cytochrome c release (22von Ahsen O. Renken C. Perkins G. Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway has been implicated in apoptosis signaling. Although recent report showed the linkage of the JNK pathway and mitochondrial death machinery (7Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar), whether the linkage is direct or indirect remained to be elucidated. Our current study indicates that JNK induces the release of pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochromec and AIF from mitochondria in the absence of other cellular factors in a cell-free assay by selective permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane. Although the amount of the released cytochromec and AIF seems to be moderate (∼5% of the total amount in the purified mitochondria, see Fig. 6 A), it may have a significant impact in cardiac myocytes considering the exceptionally high amount of mitochondria and relatively small cytosolic space of cardiac myocytes compared with other cell types. Several mechanisms have been proposed for JNK-mediated apoptosis in various cell systems. One potential mechanism is the activation of c-Jun transcriptional activity by phosphorylation reported in neuronal cells (23Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and T lymphocytes (18Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5414-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), where Fas ligand is up-regulated in a MEKK1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1)- and c-Jun-dependent manner. However, Fas/Fas ligand may not be sufficient to activate cell death signaling in cardiac myocytes (25Nelson D.P. Setser E. Hall D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hewitt T. Klevitsky R. Osinska H. Bellgrau D. Duke R.C. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes does not require new protein synthesis, similar to UV-induced apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (7Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). Therefore, JNK-mediated gene expression of pro-apoptotic molecules does not seem to be a major mechanism for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, inhibition of protein synthesis did not induce or enhance apoptosis, suggesting that suppression of anti-apoptotic protein expression does not explain SEK1/JNK-mediated cell death. Our data indicate that oxidative stress-induced SEK1/JNK-mediated apoptosis requires caspase-9, the regulatory caspase in the mitochondrial pathway (Ref. 26Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Ellerby L.M. Welsh K. Xie Z. Deveraux Q.L. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Rosenthal R.E. Fiskum G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar), but not caspase-8, the regulatory caspase in receptor-mediated apoptosis signaling. Interestingly, recent reports showed that JNK is anti-apoptotic in cardiac myocytes derived from neonatal rat (27Andreka P. Zang J. Dougherty C. Slepak T.I. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or from in vitro differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (28Minamino T. Yujiri T. Papst P.J. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15127-15132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The opposite effect of JNK on apoptosis in these studies and ours may be explained by the difference in the cell culture system, i.e. neonatal versus adult cardiac myocytes, because numerous studies indicate that JNK can be either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic, depending on the cell type (for review, see Ref. 5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). Notably, anti-apoptotic JNK function in embryonic stem-derived cardiac myocytes, which resemble fetal or neonatal cardiac myocytes, depends on transcriptional control (28Minamino T. Yujiri T. Papst P.J. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15127-15132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas pro-apoptotic effect of JNK does not in our study and others (7Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar), suggesting that different molecular mechanisms underlie the opposite effects of JNK in cardiac myocytes. Our results indicate that post-translational modification of preexisting molecules in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway plays a major role in oxidative stress-induced, JNK-mediated apoptosis in adult cardiac myocytes. Recently, a novel mechanism of JNK-mediated apoptosis has been proposed. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, namely Bcl-2 (29Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) and Bcl-xL (30Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.M. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), were found to be phosphorylated by JNK, which inactivates these anti-apoptotic proteins. Because one of the major anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 family proteins is to suppress the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (31Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 32Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar), Bcl-2 family members are attractive candidates as potential JNK targets in cardiac myocyte apoptosis by oxidative stress. However, another group showed an anti-apoptotic role of Bcl-2 phosphorylation by JNK on the same Ser-70 (33Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, the biological consequence of Bcl-2 phosphorylation by JNK remains to be elucidated (for review, see Ref.5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). In addition, we could not detect Bcl-2 family phosphorylation, as determined by migration shift on SDS-PAGE. Very recently, the critical role of JNK in UV-induced apoptosis was shown usingJnk1−/− Jnk2−/− double null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (7Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is necessary for UV-induced Bid translocation, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. These findings and ours are consistent in that the JNK pathway activates mitochondrial apoptotic signaling, which does not require new synthesis of pro-apoptotic proteins. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins was not detected in the double null embryonic fibroblasts (7Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar) and in our system, suggesting the presence of as yet unidentified JNK targets in the mitochondrial pathway (for review, see Ref. 5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c and AIF in the cell-free assay occurs in the absence of other cellular factors, indicating that JNK targets must be on the mitochondria. The JNK target seems to be its substrate, as catalytic activity of JNK is essential. Therefore, JNK is likely to phosphorylate and activate its target on mitochondria, which is directly or indirectly linked to the release mechanism of the apoptosis inducers. Both JNK and its target are readily accessible from outside the mitochondria and are likely to be exposed on the outer surface of mitochondria because exogenously added JNK and SEK1 cause the release of apoptosis inducers. In fact, exogenously added active JNK caused phosphorylation of several mitochondrial proteins. 2H. Aoki, K. Yoshimura, P. M. Kang, J. Hampe, T. Noma, M. Matsuzaki, and S. Izumo, unpublished observation. The nature of the phosphorylated proteins and whether these proteins are direct substrates of JNK remains to be investigated. Although it is well established that the release of apoptosis inducers such as cytochrome c and AIF is a critical step in the execution of apoptosis, the signal transduction from cellular stress to this step and the molecular mechanism of its regulation have been unclear (for review, see Ref. 2Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). The identification of JNK pathway as a direct activator of mitochondrial death machinery provides the direct linkage from cellular stress to the mitochondrial death machinery. Further characterization and identification of the JNK substrate(s) on mitochondria should uncover the molecular mechanism of the release of the apoptosis inducers from mitochondria. We thank Drs. L.

In addition, each member contains a domain of either WD-40 repeats (Apaf1) or leucine-rich repeats (LRR; CARD4, CARD7, Nod2, and CARD12) that likely function as binding sites for upstream regulators. The NBS/LRR domain structure of CARD4, CARD7, Nod2, and CARD12 is strikingly similar to the plant NBS/LRR family of signaling proteins that induce gene expression and cell death in response to pathogen infection. However, plant NBS/LRR proteins contain either a leucine zipper motif or a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology region in place of a CARD domain (12.Dixon M.S. Golstein C. Thomas C.M.

Bertin, unpublished data. 2J. Bertin, unpublished data. We report here that PYPAF1 (PYRIN-containing Apaf1-like protein 1) is a novel PYRIN-containing NBS/LRR family member that interacts selectively with the PYRIN domain of ASC. When coexpressed in cells, PYPAF1 and ASC colocalize to distinct cytoplasmic loci and signal the activation of NF-κB. These findings identify PYPAF1 and ASC as NF-κB activators of a novel inflammatory signaling pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression PlasmidsPlasmids expressing either full-length PYPAF1 (PYPAF1-FL, residues 1–1034, accession number AF420469) or a PYPAF1 truncation mutant lacking the PYRIN domain (PYPAF1ΔPYRIN, residues 90–1034) with a C-terminal FLAG epitope were constructed using pCMV-Tag 4a (Stratagene). Plasmids expressing either a PYPAF1 truncation mutant lacking the LRR domain (PYPAF1ΔLRR, residues 1–739) with a C-terminal FLAG epitope or ASC with a C-terminal HA epitope were constructed using pCI (Promega). For mammalian two-hybrid assays, pCMV-PYRIN/AD plasmids were constructed by inserting individual PYRIN domains into pCMV/AD (Stratagene): ASC (residues 1–110), CARD7 (residues 2–112), PYPAF1 (residues 1–116), NBS1 (residue 1–115), and POP1 (residues 1–89, accession number AF454669). Similarly, pCMV-PYPAF1-PYRIN/BD and pCMV-ASC-CARD/AD plasmids were constructed by inserting the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 (residues 1–116) and the CARD domain of ASC (residues 92–195) into pCMV-BD and pCMV-AD, respectively. The plasmid expressing dominant negative FLAG epitope-tagged IKKγ (residues 1–250) was constructed using pCMV2 (Stratagene). Myc-tagged CARD9 expression plasmid was described previously (24.Bertin J.

In brief, an oligonucleotide probe (5′-TCTCACCCAGACGGGCATTCCTGT-3′) was designed to anneal to PYPAF1 between two PCR primers (forward: 5′-AGAAGCAGATTCCAGTGCATTG-3′ and reverse: 5′-AGCGTTTGTTGAGGCTCACA-3′). The probe was then fluorescently labeled with FAM (reporter dye) on the 5′ end and TAMRA (quencher dye) on the 3′ end. Probe and PCR primers were also designed for β2 microglobulin (probe: 5′-TGTGCTCGCGCTACT-3′, forward: 5′-GTCTCGCTCCGTGGCCTTA-3′ and reverse: 5′-TGAATCTTTGGAGTACGCTGGATA-3′). The probe for β2 microglobulin incorporated VIC as the reporter dye. PCR reactions were performed on cDNAs from various cell types using primers and probes for both PYPAF1 and β2 microglobulin genes. Fluorescent emissions generated during PCR reaction was measured by Sequence Detector 7700. The expression level of PYPAF1 was normalized to the expression of β2 microglobulin for each sample.Reporter Gene AssaysNF-κB and mammalian two-hybrid assays were described previously (25.Wang L.

We found a 3.8-kilobase cDNA that encodes a PYRIN-containing protein of 1034 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 118 kDa (Fig. 1A). A BLAST search of the protein data base indicated that the protein was comprised of an N-terminal PYRIN domain linked to an NBS domain and multiple C-terminal LRRs. Because of its structural similarity to several CED4/Apaf1 family members, we designated this protein PYPAF1 for PYRIN-containing Apaf1-like protein 1. The PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 (residues 1–90) shares significant sequence similarity with the PYRIN domains of other PYRIN-containing proteins, including pyrin (33% identity), CARD7 (24% identity), ASC (25% identity), NBS1 (24% identity), and POP1 (PYRIN-only protein 1, 28% identity) (Fig. 1B). The NBS domain (residues 219–434) belongs to the NACHT subfamily of NTPases and contains all seven signature motifs, including the P-loop and the Mg2+-binding site (Fig. 1A) (27.Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 223-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (residues 740–991) contains at least nine LRRs predicted to function as protein-protein interaction motifs (28.Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Thus, PYPAF1 is a novel member of the PYRIN-containing family of signal transduction proteins (Fig. 1C). Northern blot analysis showed PYPAF1 to be highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) as a single 3.8-kilobase transcript (Fig. 2A). Further analysis using a multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) also showed high expression in PBLs (data not shown). However, little or no PYPAF1 expression was detected in 75 other tissues and cancer cell lines indicating a role for this protein in inflammatory signaling. To determine the cells that express PYPAF1, PBLs were fractionated into distinct cell populations. Real time-PCR analysis showed PYPAF1 to be predominantly expressed in monocytes, with some expression in granulocytes and T-cells (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Expression of PYPAF1 mRNA.

To identify PYRIN domains that interact with the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid analysis and screened for binding to the PYRIN domains of other family members, including CARD7, ASC, NBS1, and POP1 (Fig. 3A). The PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 interacted with the PYRIN domain of ASC, resulting in a 16-fold increase in relative luciferase activity. However, PYPAF1-PYRIN failed to bind to the PYRIN domain of other family members (CARD7, NBS1, and POP1) indicating that the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 interacts selectively with the PYRIN domain of ASC. Furthermore, the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 failed to interact with the CARD domain of ASC (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these findings identify ASC as a putative signaling partner of PYPAF1 and demonstrate that PYRIN-PYRIN interactions between family members can be highly selective.Figure 3The PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 selectively interacts with the PYRIN of ASC by mammalian two-hybrid analysis.293T cells were transfected with the mammalian two-hybrid reporter construct pFR-Luc (Stratagene). After 24 h, cells were collected and assayed for relative luciferase activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. A, the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 was screened against the PYRIN domains of either ASC, CARD7, PYPAF1, NBS1, or POP1 fused to the activation domain of murine NF-κB. B, the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 was also screened against either the PYRIN or CARD domains of ASC fused to the activation domain of murine NF-κB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our finding that the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 binds to the PYRIN domain of ASC prompted us to further examine the interactions between these two proteins when overexpressed in 293T embryonic kidney cells. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged PYPAF1 failed to coprecipitate HA-tagged ASC (data not shown). We speculate that our inability to detect an interaction by immunoprecipitation analysis is due to the relative insolubility of PYPAF1·ASC complexes that form in the cell when both proteins are overexpressed (see below). A similar difficulty in immunoprecipitating ASC-containing complexes has been reported by others (20.Richards N. Schaner P. Diaz A. Stuckey J. Shelden E. Wadhwa A. Gumucio D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39320-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We therefore performed cellular colocalization studies to further examine the interactions between these two PYRIN-containing proteins. We expressed FLAG-tagged PYPAF1 and HA-tagged ASC in cells and detected the proteins using a mixture of anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. When expressed alone, the two proteins exhibited a distinct pattern of cellular localization. Whereas ASC localizes to cytoplasmic punctate structures (Ref. 22.Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar and data not shown), full-length PYPAF1 (PYPAF1-FL) showed a broad cytoplasmic distribution that excluded the nucleus (Fig. 4A). However, when the two proteins were coexpressed, PYPAF1-FL was found to colocalize with ASC (Fig. 4, B, C, and D). To determine the regions within PYPAF1 necessary for colocalization, we examined the ability of PYPAF1 mutants lacking either the N-terminal PYRIN domain (PYPAF1ΔPYRIN) or C-terminal LRRs (PYPAF1ΔLRR) to be recruited to the ASC punctate structures. When expressed alone, PYPAF1ΔPYRIN showed a broad cytoplasmic distribution similar to PYPAF1-FL (Fig. 4E). However, PYPAF1ΔPYRIN failed to associate with the ASC punctate structures, demonstrating that the PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 is necessary for recruitment (Fig. 4, F, G, and H). In contrast, PYPAF1ΔLRR colocalized with ASC indicating that the C-terminal LRRs of PYPAF1 are dispensable for recruitment (Fig. 4, I, J, K, and L). Taken together, these findings provide additional evidence that the N-terminal PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 mediates the assembly of a PYPAF1·ASC complex.Figure 4PYPAF1 is recruited to ASC punctate structures. HA-tagged ASC (blue staining) and FLAG-tagged PYPAF1 proteins (red staining) were expressed in 293T cells. A, E and I show PYPAF1-FL, PYPAF1ΔPYRIN and PYPAFΔLRR when expressed alone. B-D, F-H and J-L show the immunostaining patterns observed when each protein was coexpressed with ASC. Note the colocalization of PYPAF1-FL (B-D) and PYPAF1ΔLRR (J-L), and the lack of colocalization of PYPAF1ΔPYRIN (F-H) to the ASC punctate structures (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NBS/LRR proteins CARD4 and Nod2 function as upstream regulators of NF-κB signaling (2.Bertin J.

We therefore determined whether PYPAF1 and ASC also function to regulate the activation of NF-κB using a luciferase reporter plasmid. When expressed at high protein levels in 293T cells, ASC induced NF-κB activity 40–50-fold (Fig. 5A). In contrast, PYPAF1 failed to induce the activation of NF-κB at all protein levels examined (Fig. 5B, lane 3 and data not shown). Because PYPAF1 interacts with ASC, we next examined whether PYPAF1 synergizes with ASC to activate NF-κB. When ASC was expressed at low protein levels that did not activate NF-κB, coexpression with PYPAF1 resulted in a 30-fold increase in NF-κB activity (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Immunoblot analysis revealed that ASC protein levels were not increased when coexpressed with PYPAF1, demonstrating that the activation of NF-κB was not due to increased levels of ASC (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 2 and 4). NF-κB signaling occurred through the IKK complex because dominant negative versions of IKK-γ and IKK-2 blocked the ability of PYPAF1 to synergistically activate NF-κB (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4). The N-terminal PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 was essential for NF-κB signaling, since deletion of this domain (PYPAF1ΔPYRIN) eliminated the synergistic induction of NF-κB activity (Fig. 5B, lane 6). Immunoblot analysis revealed that PYPAF1ΔPYRIN was expressed at levels similar to that of PYPAF1 (Fig. 5B, upper panel), indicating that loss of function was not due to reduced protein levels. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal domain resulted in a 2-fold increase in the synergistic activation of NF-κB relative to full-length protein suggesting that the LRRs may function as a negative regulator of PYPAF1 activity (Fig. 5B, lane 8). To confirm that the synergistic effect was specific for PYPAF1, we also coexpressed ASC with CARD9, a CARD-containing NF-κB activator (24.Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L. Merriam S. Du M.Q. Dyer M.J. Robison K.E. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41082-41086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). When expressed alone, CARD9 induced NF-κB activity 15–20-fold compared with empty vector (Fig. 5B, lane 9). However, when CARD9 and ASC were coexpressed, CARD9 failed to synergistically activate ASC-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 5B, lane 10). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PYPAF1 functions as an activator of ASC activity and is an upstream regulator of NF-κB signaling.Figure 5PYPAF1 augments ASC-induced NF-κB activity. A, activation of NF-κB activity by ASC. Plasmids expressing ASC were transfected into 293T cells, and relative luciferase activities were determined to measure induction of NF-κB activity. B, PYPAF1 synergizes with ASC to induce NF-κB. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing PYPAF1-FL, PYPAF1ΔPYRIN, PYPAF1ΔLRR, or CARD9 (500 ng) with or without ASC (32 ng). The amount of DNAs in each transfection was kept constant by addition of empty vectors. Relative luciferase activities were then determined as a measure of NF-κB activity (lower panel). Immunoblot analysis reveals expression of PYPAF1 or CARD9 (upper panel) and ASC (middle panel). C, PYPAF1 and ASC activate NF-κB through the IKK complex. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing 32 ng of ASC and 500 ng of PYPAF1 with either 500 ng of empty vector or dominant negative mutants of IKKγ (IKKγ-DN) or IKK2 (IKK2-DN). Immunoblot analysis reveals expression of PYPAF1 (upper panel) and ASC (middle panel). Relative luciferase activities were measured as described before.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In conclusion, we have identified PYPAF1 as a novel NBS/LRR family member with an N-terminal PYRIN domain. Our finding that PYPAF1 interacts with ASC through a PYRIN-PYRIN interaction suggests that these two proteins assemble together into a complex that mediates signal transduction. PYPAF1 may function in a manner analogous to other NBS/LRR family members and transmit upstream signals to the activation of ASC and other molecules recruited to the signaling complex. Activation of ASC by PYPAF1 may occur through an induced-proximity mechanism analogous to the activation of caspase-9 by Apaf1 (29.Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The restricted expression of PYPAF1 to monocytes indicates a role for this protein and its binding-partners in inflammatory signaling. Indeed, our findings suggest that ASC links PYPAF1 to the activation of NF-κB. The presence of a C-terminal CARD domain in ASC suggests that a CARD-containing protein is also recruited to the PYPAF1·ASC signaling complex. Preliminary studies indicate that ASC also interacts with the CARD-containing protein caspase-1, suggesting that PYPAF1 might also coordinate signaling pathways that regulate the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines (data not shown). ASC has been recently identified as a signaling partner of pyrin, a protein involved in the rare inflammatory disorder known as familial Mediterranean fever (20.Richards N. Schaner P. Diaz A.

Our findings on PYPAF1·ASC signaling suggest that pyrin may also engage NF-κB through its binding to ASC. In a search of the HTG genomic data base, we identified a single BAC clone, RP11–433K2, containing the partial genomic sequence of PYPAF1. This BAC clone maps to chromosome 1 at q44. Intriguingly, 1q44 is a locus that is associated with Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold urticaria, two genetically determined auto-inflammatory disorders that are similar to Mediterranean fever (31.Cuisset L.

We used combined 230Th and 231Pa dating to determine that they grew 135.8 +/- 0.8 thousand years ago, indicating that sea level was 18 +/- 3 meters below present sea level at the time. This suggests that sea level had risen to within 20% of its peak last-interglacial value by 136 thousand years ago, in conflict with Milankovitch theory predictions. Orbital forcing may have played a role in the deglaciation, as may have isostatic adjustments due to large ice sheets. Other corals in the same outcrop grew during oxygen isotope (delta18O) substage 6e, indicating that sea level was 38 +/- 5 meters below present sea level, about 168.0 thousand years ago. When compared to the delta18O signal in the benthic V19-30/V19-28 record at that time, the coral data extend to the previous glacial cycle the conclusion that deep-water temperatures were colder during glacial periods."

Targeted replacement of Cx50 with Cx46 by genetic knock-in corrected defects in cellular differentiation and prevented cataracts, but did not restore normal growth.

Data on the function of the full-length PC1 is currently limited to its facilitation of PC2 translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in Chinese hamster ovary cells (15.Hanaoka K.

Studies of the short cytoplasmic tail of PC1 suggested a potential regulatory role of PC1 in G-protein signaling through stabilizing the regulator of G-protein signaling protein, RGS7 (20.Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hitherto, the only reported potential ligand binding capacity of PC1 is that the 229-amino acid C-type lectin domain binds to carbohydrates and collagens I, II, and IV in vitro (22.Weston B.S. Bagneris C. Price R.G. Stirling J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1536: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One major obstacle hampering investigation of full-length PC1 function is the lack of an efficient expression system for its large size transcript (14 kb) and a read-out for its function(s). Here, we have used rat sympathetic neurons as a novel expression system (23.Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 24.Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Milligan G.

(Lond.). 1998; 506: 319-329Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to study the function(s) of the PC1 proteins. RT-PCR assays indicated that these cells do not normally express PC1 mRNA and hence provide a “tabula rasa” for assessing effects of heterologously expressed PC1. Well characterized Ca2+ and K+ channels (26.Schneider T. Igelmund P. Hescheler J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 8-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) serve as specific read-outs for activated intracellular pathways. Our data demonstrate for the first time a biochemical function of full-length PC1. PC1 acts as a constitutive activator of Gi/o but not Gq G-proteins, independently from RGS protein activity. In addition, we show that the G-protein activating property of PC1 can be inhibited by the cation channel PC2 via interactions of their C termini. Taken together, our data indicate that mutations in PC1 or PC2 may have a “dosage effect” such that mutations perturbing but not necessarily abrogating the polycystin complex initiate abnormal G-protein signaling pathways in cells that naturally co-express both PC1 and PC2. The human PKD1 expression construct was assembled from cDNA clones KG8, RT-PCR product puK3139, and a fragment of cDNA clone FK7 in pcDNA3.1/His-C (Invitrogen) through various digestion and ligation procedures. The final construct contains a partial 8428-bp cDNA of human PKD1, encoding the C-terminal 2492 amino acids of polycystin-1, with an “Xpress tag” at its N terminus. The full-length mouse PKD1 construct was assembled from cloned cDNA and RT-PCR products, sequence-verified for an open reading frame, and cloned into pcDNA3.1 at NotI site. The final construct encodes the entire mouse polycystin-1 (4303 amino acids). mPKD1-Myc tagged construct (pcDNA-PKD1-Myc) was generated by PCR-directed mutation of in-frame stop codons from pcDNA-PKD1. The mPC1 mutant was generated by a deletion of the last 193 amino acids of mouse polycystin-1. The C-terminal-deleted region includes a binding domain for heterotrimeric G-proteins, a G-protein activation peptide (21.Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Rankin C.A. Smine A. Okamoto T. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and putative interaction site with PC2. The mPC2 mutant was generated as described (40.Chen X-Z. Segal Y. Basora N. Guo L. Peng J.B. Babakhanlou H. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 by standard procedures. This mutant lacks the C-terminal 226-amino acids of PC2, which includes the EF-hand and the putative PC1 interaction domain. Sympathetic neurons were dissociated from superior cervical ganglia of 15- to 19-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured on laminin-coated glass coverslips as described (25.Delmas P. Brown D.A. Dayrell M. Abogadie F.C. Caulfield M.P. Buckley N.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 319-329Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Plasmids were diluted in Ca2+-free Krebs solution (290 mosmol l−1, pH 7.3) containing 0.5% FITC-dextran (70 kDa, Molecular Probes) to a final concentration of 100 μg ml−1 (Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 cDNAs), 200 μg ml−1 (hPKD1, mPKD1, mPKD2, GABABR1b, GABABR2, Gβ1, Gγ2, and Gα-transducin cDNAs) or 40 μg ml−1 (G-protein α mutants). Plasmids were pressure-injected into the nucleus of sympathetic neurons with sharp micropipettes (50–60 MΩ) using manual impalement (24.Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Milligan G. Buckley N.J. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 23-36Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or automated microinjection (37.Haley J.E. Abogadie F.C. Delmas P. Dayrell M. Vallis Y. Milligan G. Caulfield M.P. Brown D.A.

Neurons were maintained in culture for a further 2 days prior to recording or immunostaining. cDNAs for bovine β1 and γ2 G-protein subunits, retinal Gα transducin, Kir3.1/3.2 and GABABR1b/R2 subunits were described previously (25.Delmas P.

PTX- and RGS-insensitive G-protein αoA/i1 subunits were generated by point mutation of Cys-351→Ile and Gly-183/184→Ser as detailed (39.Lan K-L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. Mackenzie R.G. DiBello P.R.

All constructs were subcloned in cytomegalovirus promoter vectors and verified by automated DNA sequencing. Cells expressing GαoA-G184S showed a >10-fold slower recovery from Ca2+ current inhibition by noradrenaline, confirming that GαoA mutants are resistant to the action of endogenous RGS proteins. Myc-tagged mPC1 and untagged mPC1 were transiently transfected into 5454 cells and Hek293 cells, respectively. Precleared cell lysates were incubated with an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz) or the anti-PC1 antibody 7e12 (27.Ong A.C. Harris P.C. Davies D.R. Pritchard L. Rossetti S. Biddolph S. Vaux D.J. Migone N. Ward C.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1324-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 12 h. Immunocomplexes were then captured with protein A beads for 2 h. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Western blots were probed with an anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or 7e12 prior to their incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody. Immobilized antibodies were detected by ECL. Neurons were recorded using the whole cell variants (patch-ruptured or perforated patch) of the patch clamp technique. For recording of Ca2+ currents and leak and M-type K+ currents, the external solution was (mm): NaCl, 110; NaHCO3, 23; KCl, 3; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 2.5; Hepes, 5; glucose, 11; tetrodotoxin, 0.0005 (bubbled with a 95% O2-5% CO2 mixture, pH 7.4). GIRK1/2 currents were recorded using the same external solution, except that [K+]o was 12 mm (isosmotically compensated for Na+). Ca2+ and GIRK1/2 currents were obtained using patch-ruptured whole-cell recording. Pipettes were coated with Sylgard and had resistance of 2–3.5 MΩ. Internal solution for ICa was (mm): 120 NMDG, 14 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 11 EGTA, 0.5–1 CaCl2, 0.1 phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP and 0.2 Na3GTP (pH 7.3). Currents were measured with an Axopatch 200A amplifier, filtered at 1–5 kHz, and leak-subtracted using the leak subtraction procedure (P/6) of the pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Cell membrane capacitance and series resistance compensations were applied (75–85%). In experiments where GDP-β-S (3 mm) was added to the pipette solution, GTP was omitted. Ca2+ currents were evoked using a triple-pulse voltage protocol, and facilitation was calculated as the ratio (P2/P1) of Ca2+ current amplitude (see Fig. 3). The intracellular solution for GIRK1/2current consisted of (mm): KCl, 60; potassium acetate, 60; MgCl2, 2.5; Hepes, 30; BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), 10; Na2ATP, 2; and Na3GTP, 0.1 (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH and 290 mosmol l−1). Currents were recorded with an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (discontinuous mode), low-pass filtered at 1 kHz, and sampled at 6.67 kHz. GIRK1/2 currents were typically evoked by 700 ms voltage ramps from −140 to −40 mV. The amplitude of GIRK1/2 currents was measured as the Ba2+-sensitive current (100 μm) averaged between −125 and −130 mV. Leak currents were not subtracted. Recording of passive membrane properties (Fig. 2) and M-current was made using the perforated patch clamp technique to avoid run-down (37.Haley J.E. Abogadie F.C. Delmas P. Dayrell M. Vallis Y. Milligan G. Caulfield M.P. Brown D.A. Buckley N.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4521-4531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were filled by dipping the tip for 40 s into filtered internal solution that comprised (mm): K+ acetate, 80; KCl, 30; Hepes, 40; MgCl2, 3 (pH 7.35). Pipettes were then back-filled with the same internal solution containing 0.09 mg/ml amphotericin-B. After permeabilization, access resistances were 10–15 MΩ. Leak currents were not subtracted, otherwise mentioned (e.g. Fig. 2). Experiments were performed at 30–32 °C, and drugs were applied by using a gravity-fed perfusion system (10 ml min−1). NEM (N-ethylmaleimide) was applied at 50 μm for at least 2 min, and PTX was incubated 12–24 h at 1 μg ml−1. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t tests or two-way analysis of variance as appropriate. Myc-tagged mPC1:cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20–25 min at room temperature followed by 5 min treatment with Triton (0.1%) to permeabilize membranes. After incubation with bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, neurons were incubated with anti-Myc antibody for 1 h, washed, and then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1/100) for 35 min. Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). The anti-human PC1 polyclonal antibodies MR3 (12.Geng L. Segal Y. Peissel B. Deng N. Pei Y. Carone F. Rennke H.G. Glucksman-Kuis A.M. Schneider M.C. Ericsson M. Reeders S.T. Zhou J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2674-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were used to examine the expression of the human PKD1 construct. After fixation with acetone for 5 min, cells were incubated for 2–3 h at room temperature with MR3 polyclonal antibodies (1:50). Polyclonal anti-α1B subunit antibodies (ACC-002, Alomone) were used at 1/200. Bound antibodies were then detected using FITC- or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/100–200) (DAKO A/S, Denmark). Images were collected with an Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) or a confocal microscope. Immunostaining was performed 2 days post-injection. Cultured sympathetic neurons were microinjected intranuclearly with cDNAs encoding full-length mPC1 or N-terminal-truncated hPC1 lacking the Ig-like repeat (Fig. 1, A and B), and somatic recordings were made 48 h later using the perforated patch clamp technique. Neurons so injected efficiently expressed PC1 in their outer membrane (Fig. 1, C and D). Immunostaining using an anti-hPC1 polyclonal antibody (MR3) (12.Geng L. Segal Y. Peissel B. Deng N. Pei Y. Carone F. Rennke H.G. Glucksman-Kuis A.M. Schneider M.C. Ericsson M. Reeders S.T. Zhou J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2674-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) revealed immunoreactivity concentrated at the cell periphery in 78% of cells microinjected with hPKD1 cDNA (n = 26) (Fig. 1C). Further, Myc-tagged mPC1 was co-immunolabeled with the α1B Ca2+ channel subunit, a typical plasma membrane protein. Confocal sections showed that Myc-tagged mPC1 co-localized with Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane and was not retained intracellularly (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis from mammalian cell lines transfected with DNA constructs for full-length mPC1 and Myc-tagged mPC1 revealed proteins of ∼460 kDa, which is similar to the predicted size of PC1 encoded by the longest open-reading frame of PC1 (460 kDa) (Fig. 1E). Electrophysiological recording in neurons revealed that, unlike PC2 (16.Vassilev P.M. Guo L. Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Peng J.B. Basora N. Babakhanlou H. Cruger G. Kanazirska M. Ye C.P. Brown E.M.

Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar); nor do they up-regulate endogenous cation-permeable channels in these cells, as recently reported for an expressed PC1 C-terminal fragment (PC1C1–226) in oocytes (29.Vandorpe D.H.

To assess the role of PC1 in signal transduction, we looked at the activity of N-type Ca2+ channels and inwardly rectifying GIRK1/2 K+ channels (Kir3.1,3.2 subunits), well known to be regulated by G-protein-coupled receptors (26.Schneider T. Igelmund P. Hescheler J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 8-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30.Hille B.

Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar) through direct gating by Gβγ subunits (23.Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 32.Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 33.De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the effects of hPC1 and mPC1 on the N-type Ca2+ channels present in these cells (34.Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Buckley N.J. Brown D.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression of PC1 produced a strong inhibition of their activity. In effect, hPC1 and mPC1 were as effective as over-expressing Gβ1γ2, reducing Ca2+ current density at 0 mV from 33 ± 3 pA/pF in control neurons to 19 ± 4, 22 ± 3, and 17 ± 2 pA/pF, respectively (n = 10–14). A typical trademark of Gβγ-mediated modulation of Ca2+ channels is the relief of inhibition by depolarizing voltages, a phenomenon termed facilitation (23.Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) that results from the voltage-dependent dissociation of Gβγ from the Ca2+ channel (Fig. 3B). Like the action of Gβγ, mPC1 or hPC1 mimicked the voltage-dependent facilitation of Ca2+ channels and produced a depolarizing shift of the I-V curves for Ca 2+ channel activation (Fig. 3, C–E). The results obtained on recording Ca2+ currents were qualitatively replicated using GIRK1/2 channels as biosensors for G-protein activation. GIRK1/2 channels were expressed heterologously in sympathetic neurons (35.Fernández-Fernández J.M. Wanaverbecq N. Halley P. Caulfield M.P. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 631-637Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the presence of 12 mm external K+, these channels generate inwardly rectifying currents (Fig. 4). In cells expressing GIRK1/2 channels, both hPC1 and mPC1 significantly increased basal GIRK1/2 current from 10 ± 1 pA/pF in control neurons to 22 ± 2 and 27 ± 4 pA/pF, respectively (Fig. 4, D, E, and G). Here again, PC1 activation of GIRK1/2 currents was quantitatively comparable with that caused by Gβ1γ2 (23 ± 4 pA/pF) (Fig. 4, C and G). Taken together, these results indicate that PC1-mediated effects were phenomenologically identical to those produced by Gβγ. To test whether PC1 was releasing Gβγ from endogenous G-protein heterotrimers or simply mimicking the action of Gβγ on ion channels, we expressed the Gβγ-sequestering agent Gα transducin (24.Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Milligan G. Buckley N.J. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 23-36Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25.Delmas P. Brown D.A. Dayrell M. Abogadie F.C. Caulfield M.P. Buckley N.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 319-329Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34.Delmas P. Abogadie F.C. Buckley N.J. Brown D.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) together with PC1. Gα transducin fully abolished the action of hPC1 on both Ca2+ channels (Fig. 3, F and H) and GIRK1/2 channels (Fig. 4, F and G), indicating that PC1 mediates its effects by releasing Gβγ complexes from their association with Gα subunits. By analogy with G-protein-coupled 7TM receptors, we hypothesized that PC1 directly activates G-proteins and catalyzes GTP binding to the Gα subunit (21.Parnell S.C. Magenheimer B.S. Maser R.L. Rankin C.A. Smine A. Okamoto T. Calvet J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We tested this by intracellularly dialyzing the non-hydrolyzable GDP analogue, GDP-β-S, in mPC1-expressing neurons. GDP-β-S (3 mm) reversed the effects of mPC1 on Ca2+ channels by 74 ± 5% (n = 5) within 15–20 min of intracellular diffusion (Fig. 3, G and H). The properties of Ca2+ channel inhibition by PC1 as well as the modulation of GIRK1/2 channels suggested that PC1 couples to Gi/o-type G-proteins, since similar receptor-mediated effects result from activation of this family of G-proteins (30.Hille B. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 531-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 31.Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of PC1 were therefore assessed after pre-treatment with agents (Pertussis toxin and NEM, see “Materials and Methods”) that are known to prevent receptor/Gi/o-protein interaction. After these treatments, mPC1 and hPC1 no longer modulated either Ca2+ (Fig. 3, C, E, and H) or GIRK1/2(Fig. 4, D, E, and G) channels. We confirmed that neither PTX nor NEM altered Gβγ interaction with ion channels (Figs. 3B and 4C). In an additional set of experiments, we tested whether PC1 could activate Gq-type G-proteins by testing its ability to inhibit M-type K+ channels (36.Brown D.A. Adams P.R. Nature. 1980; 283: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) (KCNQ channel family), which are selectively modulated via Gq-type G-proteins in rat-sympathetic neurons (37.Haley J.E.

Here we demonstrate thatArabidopsis thaliana contains six functional AtE2F genes that are all expressed in cell suspension culture but show different patterns of expression during cell cycle progression.

In contrast, the AtE2Fs of the second group can bind specifically the E2F site without interacting with DP partners but cannot activate gene expression and, instead, are able to inhibit E2F-dependent activation of gene expression in Arabidopsis cells.

These findings suggest distinctive roles for the plant E2F proteins and point to a complex concerted regulation of E2F-dependent gene expression in plant cells. retinoblastoma protein glutathione S-transferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay α-naphthaleneacetic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid β-glucuronidase cauliflower mosaic virus nuclear localization signal reverse transcription Recent studies have shown that the basic regulatory circuits governing cell cycle progression in animal cells are remarkably conserved in higher plants. In particular, plant cells possess all the key components of the cyclin D/retinoblastoma/E2F pathway, which in animal cells is a major regulator of cell proliferation and is part of a critical checkpoint controlling the progression from G1to S phase of the cell cycle (1Stals H.

The cyclin D-cdk2 or cyclin D-cdk4 complexes regulate the activity of the pRB1 tumor suppressor protein and the related p107/p130 pocket proteins, which in their hypophosphorylated state bind to the E2F family of transcription factors and block their transactivating potential (2Black A.R.

Furthermore, the pocket proteins have been shown to recruit to the E2Fs chromatin remodeling activities, such as histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferase, or SWI·SNF complexes, which once tethered to the DNA can actively repress the transcription of E2F-regulated genes by blocking the access of other transcription factors in the proximity of the E2F binding sites (5Luo R.X.

It is now widely believed that in quiescent cell or during the early G1 phase of the cell cycle the E2Fs are mainly involved in the repression of several cell cycle-regulated promoters, whereas during the transition from G1 to S phase the release of transcriptionally active E2Fs, resulting from the phosphorylation of the pocket proteins, leads to an E2F-dependent activation of several genes coding for regulatory proteins and for enzymes involved in nucleotide and DNA synthesis. This dual function of the E2F complexes clearly explains why these transcription factors, depending on the cellular and developmental context, can be either positive or negative regulators of cell proliferation and can act as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors (2Black A.R.

Moreover, highlighting the remarkable functional complexity of animal E2Fs, in Drosophila the DmE2F1 protein has been shown to affect directly the localization and the DNA-replicating activity of the origin replication complex (10Bosco G. Du W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Nat.

Indeed, according to the broad range of mammalian genes, which change their expression in response to the activation of some of the E2Fs, these transcription factors have been shown to be involved in the control of differentiation, development, proliferation, and apoptosis (11Muller H.

In mammalian cells some E2Fs have been actually shown to induce apoptosis through the regulation of p53 activity as well as in a p53-independent pathway (3Harbour J.W. Dean D.C.

So far, six E2Fs and two DPs have been found in human cells, and, according to a comparative analysis of the genome ofArabidopsis thaliana, at least six putative E2F genes and two DP genes appear to be present in Arabidopsis cells as well. Plant E2F genes have been described in carrot, tobacco, and wheat (12Albani D. Mariconti L. Ricagno S. Pitto L. Moroni C. Helin K. Cella R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murray J.A. Plant Mol.

All the E2F proteins described so far possess a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, forming a winged helix motif, which is flanked toward the C-terminal side by a DP dimerization domain containing a leucine heptad repeat. Next to the dimerization domain, all the E2Fs possess another conserved region called marked box, which in human cells is recognized by the adenovirus E4 protein and may be involved in heterodimerization and DNA bending (18Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on their primary structures and on their functional features, the six mammalian E2Fs can be divided into three groups. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, which belong to the first group, possess a conserved cyclin A-binding domain in their N-terminal region and a transactivating domain, overlapping a conserved pRB-binding region, at their C-terminal end. These three E2Fs are believed to be direct activators of S phase genes; accordingly, their expression is not detectable in quiescent cells but it is strongly up-regulated during G1/S transition. In contrast, E2F4 and E2F5, the members of the second group, are expressed in quiescent cells as well as throughout the cell cycle and lack the cyclin-A-binding domains but possess pRB-binding and transactivating C-terminal regions. E2F6, the last known member of the mammalian E2F family, lacks the N-terminal cyclin-A binding domain as well as the transactivating C-terminal region and it has been shown to bind directly polycomb group proteins and to act as a repressor of E2F-dependent transcriptional activation (20Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Wen J. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The plant E2Fs described so far, do not possess evident cyclin A-binding domains in the N-terminal region but show a conserved pRB-binding domain in their C-terminal region. In this respect, wheat, tobacco, and Arabidopsis E2Fs have been shown to interact with plant pRBR proteins (13Ramirez-Parra E. Xie Q. Boniotti M.B. Gutierrez C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Sekine M. Ito M. Uemukai K. Maeda Y. Nakagami H. Shinmyo A.

Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the carrot E2F factor has been shown to be a transcriptional activator that, heterodimerizing with a DP partner, can bind a consensus E2Fcis-element and can transactivate a synthetic E2F-responsive promoter in both plant and animal cells (12Albani D. Mariconti L. Ricagno S. Pitto L. Moroni C. Helin K. Cella R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19258-19267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this work we report on the isolation and functional characterization of the cDNA clones of all six E2Fs of A. thaliana. Although the previously described AtE2F sequences show the typical features of other plant and animal E2F proteins, the three remaining clones reveal unique structural features and possess duplicated conserved DNA-binding domains but lack any of the additional regions which are conserved in other plant and animal E2Fs. These Arabidopsis E2F genes are all expressed in cell suspension culture but show different patterns of expression during cell cycle progression. Furthermore, DNA binding assays and transactivation experiments suggest distinctive roles for these plant E2F proteins pointing to a complex concerted regulation of E2F-dependent gene expression in plant cells.DISCUSSIONThe discovery of at least six E2F genes in A. thaliana, all of which are differentially expressed during cell cycle progression, suggests that, in plant cells, like in mammalian cells, the activity of the pRB/E2F pathway relies on the concerted regulation of several E2F members. Furthermore, according to their structural and functional characteristics, these six AtE2Fs can be divided into two distinctive groups. The AtE2Fa, AtE2Fb, and AtE2Fc proteins possess all the typical regions that are conserved in other plant E2Fs and are able to bind efficiently to a E2F site forming heterodimers with AtDP proteins. Additionally, as previously described for carrot DcE2F (12Albani D. Mariconti L. Ricagno S. Pitto L. Moroni C. Helin K. Cella R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19258-19267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), these three AtE2Fs can transactivate a synthetic E2F-responsive promoter in plant cells, confirming their ability to act as positive regulators of gene expression. However, these studies have shown that the three members of the first group possess different transactivating capabilities. Even though AtE2Fa is able to bind canonical DNA target sites interacting in vitro with either AtDPa or AtDPb, it can transactivate slightly the E2F-responsive reporter gene only when it is coexpressed with AtDPa. In this respect, it is known that in human cells the activity of E2F4 and E2F5, which lack NLS sequences, is regulated at the level of subcellular localization. Coexpression of E2F4 together with human DP2, which possess a functional NLS, but not with DP1, has been shown to enable its nuclear translocation (27Magae J. Wu C.L. Illenye S. Harlow E. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28de la Luna S. Burden M.J. Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2443-2452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its transactivation of a E2F-responsive reporter construct (29Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,30Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Concerning the Arabidopsis E2F·DP complexes, it is not known whether the activity of the various AtE2F and AtDP proteins is regulated at the level of their subcellular localization but it is interesting to note that whereas AtE2Fa possesses a putative nuclear localization signal in its N terminus, this sequence is only partially conserved in the AtE2Fb and AtE2Fc proteins. It remains to be confirmed whether this region is actually involved in the nuclear targeting of these proteins.In this study we have also demonstrated that Arabidopsiscells possess three novel and remarkable E2F members, called AtE2Fd, AtE2Fe, and AtE2Ff, that contain duplicated DNA-binding domains. This feature enables these proteins to recognize a consensus E2F site independently of a DP partner, and their DNA binding specificity proves that these factors are actual components of the ArabidopsispRB/E2F pathway. However, although they are likely to be targeted to the nucleus, these AtE2Fs cannot activate gene expression; instead, they appear to be able to interfere with the activity of the other AtE2F members, possibly by competing for the same DNA target sites. This effect is particularly clear with the AtE2Fd effector and is less pronounced with AtE2Ff. The latter factor, however, lacks part of the second DNA-binding domain, and EMSA analyses indicated that it binds less efficiently to the canonical E2F site. Furthermore, AtE2Ff lacks also the putative NLS sequence, which is located near the C terminus of both AtE2Fd and AtE2Fe, and its translocation to the nucleus could occur differently.In mammalian cells, depending on their interaction with pocket proteins, the various E2Fs can behave as activators or as repressors of gene transcription. The remarkably different pattern of expression of the various AtE2F genes during the passage from the G1 to the G2 phase of cell cycle indicates that also inArabidopsis cells at least some of the E2F activities are likely to be involved in both activation or repression of S phase-specific gene expression. This possibility has been already suggested for the carrot DcE2F protein, which is expressed ubiquitously in all plant tissues (12Albani D. Mariconti L. Ricagno S. Pitto L. Moroni C. Helin K. Cella R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19258-19267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A dual function of the plant E2F activities has also been suggested by the recent studies of two plant E2F-regulated promoters. In both the tobacco RNR2 promoter and the Nicotiana benthamiana PCNApromoter, two distinct E2F binding sites have been identified, and in both promoters the functional disruption of the downstream site has been shown to increase the transcriptional activity in either cycling cells or in mature leaves, respectively (31Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).The three AtE2Fs of the first group are good candidates for pocket protein-mediated control of E2F activity because they possess a conserved pRBR-binding region in their C terminus. In this context, AtE2Fa and AtE2Fb have been recently shown to interact with pRBR proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system (16de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murray J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additionally, wheat TmE2F and tobacco NtE2F have been shown to bind plant pocket proteins and, in the case of the wheat factor, this interaction is strictly dependent on the presence of the conserved C-terminal region (13Ramirez-Parra E. Xie Q. Boniotti M.B. Gutierrez C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3527-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Sekine M. Ito M. Uemukai K. Maeda Y. Nakagami H. Shinmyo A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings contribute to link the activity of the plant E2Fs to the mode of action of plant DNA viruses, which encode proteins that interact with pRBR proteins (33Gutierrez C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 763-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the AtE2Fd, AtE2Fe, and AtE2Ff proteins lack the pRBR-binding domain and therefore are unlikely to be subjected to a control by pocket proteins. A similar situation is seen with the mammalian E2F6 protein, which is also not regulated by pocket proteins. However, unlike the three AtE2Fs of the second group, E2F6 binds a DP partner and requires this interaction to recognize efficiently E2F consensus sites. Moreover, E2F6 has been shown to actively repress gene expression by interacting directly with polycomb group proteins, which recognize specifically its marked box region (20Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Wen J. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The AtE2Fd, AtE2Fe, and AtE2Ff proteins do not contain a marked box region, and, although the first two members of this group possess discrete C-terminal regions that could potentially harbor unknown functional domains, the AtE2Ff protein is truncated in the second DNA-binding domain and does not appear to possess other discrete regions outside those potentially involved in DNA recognition. Hence, the AtE2Ff protein and possibly the other AtE2Fs of the second group might not be able to recruit repressing activities to the E2F-regulated promoters, as in the case of human E2F6, but could act as dominant inhibitors of E2F-dependent gene activation by simply blocking the access of other AtE2Fs to shared DNA target sites.Although the distribution of the various AtE2F proteins inArabidopsis cells remains to be verified, considering their functional features and in view of the expression pattern of their transcripts, we can envision a cascade of events that could contribute to the regulation of the pRB/E2F pathway during the cell cycle in plants. More specifically, the peak of accumulation of the AtE2Fb transcripts at the G1/S transition and their constitutive distribution during cell cycle progression suggest that this factor, similarly to the mammalian E2F4 and E2F5 proteins, could be a key target of the pRBR proteins in early G1. Its eventual release, following the phosphorylation of the pocket proteins, could lead to the subsequent activation of the AtE2Fa gene, which is maximally expressed in early S phase. On the other hand, we speculate that AtE2Fa, like the mammalian E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 factors, could be a direct and specific activator of S phase genes, whereas AtE2Fc could have important regulatory functions during both the S phase and the following G2 phase. Finally, the AtE2F members of the second group are clearly adding a new level of complexity to the control of E2F-dependent gene expression by possibly inhibiting, in different phases of the plant cell cycle, the DNA binding capacity of the first group of AtE2Fs. In this respect, it is worth noting that in mammalian cells overexpression of a partial E2F protein containing only the DNA-binding domain or introduction of peptides that antagonize E2F DNA binding have been shown to trigger apoptosis in a p53-independent manner (34Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 35Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H.

Whether or not any of the AtE2F members is involved in the control of apoptosis in plants, it is evident, from the data obtained so far, that they are likely to be complex regulators of the plant cell cycle. Future investigations will help to verify the proposed model of AtE2F activity and will reveal whether in plants, like in animals, these transcription factors are involved in the control of other cellular processes and/or can regulate unique plant developmental programs. Recent studies have shown that the basic regulatory circuits governing cell cycle progression in animal cells are remarkably conserved in higher plants. In particular, plant cells possess all the key components of the cyclin D/retinoblastoma/E2F pathway, which in animal cells is a major regulator of cell proliferation and is part of a critical checkpoint controlling the progression from G1to S phase of the cell cycle (1Stals H.

The cyclin D-cdk2 or cyclin D-cdk4 complexes regulate the activity of the pRB1 tumor suppressor protein and the related p107/p130 pocket proteins, which in their hypophosphorylated state bind to the E2F family of transcription factors and block their transactivating potential (2Black A.R.

https://openalex.org/W2064457100,Differences in the two-dimensional packing arrangements of racemic and enantiomeric crystalline self-assemblies on the water surface of amphiphilic activated analogs of lysine and glutamic acid have been used to prepare oligopeptides of homochiral sequence and oligopeptides of single handedness from chiral nonracemic mixtures. The crystalline structures on the water surface were determined by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction and the diastereomeric composition of the oligopeptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry with enantio-labeling. These results suggest that reactivity of ordered clusters at interfaces might have played a role in the generation of early homochiral biopolymers.

We have identified a novel 80-kDa protein that interacts specifically with the GTP-bound conformation of Rab4, and subsequent work has shown that it also interacts strongly with Rab11. We name this protein Rab coupling protein (RCP). RCP is predominantly membrane-bound and is expressed in all cell lines and tissues tested. It colocalizes with early endosomal markers including Rab4 and Rab11 as well as with the transferrin receptor. Overexpression of the carboxyl-terminal region of RCP, which contains the Rab4- and Rab11-interacting domain, results in a dramatic tubulation of the transferrin compartment. Furthermore, expression of this mutant causes a significant reduction in endosomal recycling without affecting ligand uptake or degradation in quantitative assays. RCP is a homologue of Rip11 and therefore belongs to the recently described Rab11-FIP family. Rab4 and Rab11 are small GTPases belonging to the Ras superfamily.

The large number of Rab proteins identified in mammalian cell lines and their localization to specific compartments within the cell suggest that they each play a crucial and specific role in the transport process. Rabs cycle between a membrane-bound state and a cytosolic state. This cycling is guanine nucleotide-dependent and is regulated by various accessory factors. Several Rab proteins including Rab4, -5, -7, -9, and -11 are known to be involved in the process of endocytosis (1.Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab5 is important in the homotypic fusion between early endosomes as well as in the transport to the early endosomal compartment (2.Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J.

Several such proteins have already been identified, including rabaptin 5, a 100-kDA protein with two pairs of coiled-coil regions, which was initially found in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify effectors of Rab5 (19.Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been shown to also interact with Rab4 (20.Vitale G. Rybin V.

Here, we report the identification of a novel, ∼80-kDa protein that interacts with Rab4 and Rab11. We localize the endogenous protein to the early endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) and show that overexpression of a deletion mutant of this protein perturbs the morphology of this compartment and strongly inhibits endosomal recycling. Because of its interaction with two Rabs that function in endosomal recycling, its localization to the early endosomal recycling compartment, and its functional effects on the recycling process, we propose to name this the Rab coupling protein (RCP). Interestingly, this protein is related to the Rab11-interacting protein (Rip11) (27.Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and, therefore, belongs to the recently reported Rab11-FIP protein family (29.Hales C.M. Griner R.

Commun. 2001; 281: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). pLex-Rab5, pLex-Rab5Q79L, and pLex-Rab5S34N were kind gifts from M. Zerial (19.Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and pLexA-rasG12V and pLexA-laminC were from A. Votjek (37.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). pLex-Rab6 constructs have been previously described (38.Janoueix-Lerosey I. Jollivet F. Camonis J. Marche P.N. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14801-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and pLex-Rab11 constructs were made by subcloning the canine Rab11 WT, S25N, and Q70L cDNA as an 855-base pair BamHI-PstI fragment from the previously described pGEMRab11 constructs (10.Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). pLexRab11Q70L/I44E was generated by two-step site-directed mutagenesis as follows/ pLex-Rab11Q70L was used as the template in the first step with SeqF (5′-CTTCGTCAGCAGAGCTTC-3′) and the I44E primer (5′-TGCAAACTCTACTCCCTCGGTGCTCTT-3′). The first-round product from this reaction was used as the primer in a second-step PCR with the BonR reverse primer (5′-AATTCGCCCGGAATTAGC-3′). The resulting second-round PCR product was subcloned into pVJL10 (pLex). pTrcHisC-H13 and pcDNA3.1/HisB-H13 were obtained by subcloning the 1-kilobase H13 cDNA fragment from pGADGH into the EcoRI site of pTrcHisC (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3.1/HisB (Invitrogen), respectively. pTrcHisA-Rab4Q67L was generated by subcloning the BamHI fragment from pBlueBacHis-Rab4Q67L (Invitrogen) into the BamHI site of pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). δRCP was amplified from a placental cDNA library (MARATHON, CLONTECH) using the upstream primer, GSP1 (5′-CGGGATCCCGCAGAAGACGCATGGTATAAG-3′), and downstream primer, GSP6 (5′-CGGGATCCGCCCTGGATCTAAGCAGAAGGTATT −3′). The product was digested with BamHI and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/HisB, pGADGH, and pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Full-length RCP was subcloned from EST 3956619. The 2.3-kilobase EcoRI restriction fragment that contained the full RCP open reading frame was subcloned into the pGEM1 vector. All constructs were verified by double strand sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (39.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar).Two-hybrid ScreeningThe yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as previously described (40.Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast reporter strain L40 (37.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) (MATa trp1 leu2 his3::lexA-His3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was transformed with pVJL10-Rab4Q67L-CXC and grown on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan. This transformant was then transformed with an oligo-dT-primed HeLa cDNA library (MATCHMAKER, CLONTECH) (37.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) in pGADGH. The transformants were grown for 8 h in medium lacking tryptophan and leucine and then plated onto medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Colonies were picked 4.5 days after plating and tested for β-galactosidase activity. Library plasmids were rescued into Escherichia coli HB101 cells plated on leucine-free medium. To quantify protein-protein interactions, β-galactosidase was assayed using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactosidase as substrate.Gene Expression Panel1 μl of first strand cDNA from each tissue of a Rapid Scan Gene Expression Panel (Origene) was used as template in a 40-cycle PCR reaction with the RCP gene-specific primers GSP-1 (5′-GAAAATTGGAGGTCTCGGTTCA-3′) and GSP-2 (5′-GCTTCCACCAAGGACTCCTTGA-3′). The primers were designed to amplify the region of RCP corresponding to amino acids 384–529, yielding a product of 435 base pairs. An annealing temperature of 60 °C and an elongation time of 1 min were used. Clone H13 cDNA was used as template in the positive control reaction, and the negative control contained 1 μl of distilled H2O instead of template.Recombinant ProteinsThe H13 polypeptide and Rab4Q67L protein were purified as follows. BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells were transformed with either pTrcHisA-Rab4Q67L or pTrcHisC-H13. Transformants were grown to an OD600 = 0.4 and induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. The proteins were purified with Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen) according to a native purification protocol (QIAexpressionist, Qiagen). Purified His-H13 polypeptide was injected into rabbits for antibody generation.AntibodiesAntibodies used included mouse monoclonal β Actin (Sigma), monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody (TfnR) (B3/25, Boehringer Mannheim), sheep anti-TGN46 (Serotec), and anti-Xpress (Invitrogen). Anti-Xpress was used to detect H13 and δRCP expressed as fusion proteins in the pcDNA3.1/HisB vector. Monoclonal anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid was a kind gift from J. Gruenberg. The affinity-purified polyclonal Rab11 antibody has been described elsewhere (10.Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Anti-H13 rabbit affinity-purified antibody was generated as follows. Serum from a H13-inoculated rabbit was affinity-purified on nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) as previously described (41.Goud B. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Saraste J. Nature. 1990; 345: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified anti-H13 antibody was utilized at a dilution of 1/50 for immunofluorescence and 1/500 for immunoblot detection of the endogenous RCP.In Vitro InteractionPurified H13 polypeptide was transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) and incubated overnight in renaturation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3% Tween 20). 7 μg of the purified wild-type Rab protein was incubated in exchange buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 4 mm EDTA) with 2 μl of [α-32P]GTP (10 μCi/μl) for 1 h at 37 °C. After the nucleotide exchange the Mg2+ concentration was raised to 10 mm, and the radiolabeled Rab protein was added to 10 ml of binding buffer (12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 75 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.05% CHAPS), which was incubated with the nitrocellulose for 1 h 15 min at room temperature. The nitrocellulose strips were washed twice for 10 min with wash buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100) and then exposed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Cell Lines and TransfectionHeLa and HeLa Rab4GFP cells were maintained in culture as previously described (24.Bielli A. Thörnqvist P.O. Hendrick A.G. Finn R. Fitzgerald K. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). BHK cells were cultured in Glasgow's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. For overexpression studies, HeLa cells were infected for 45 min with either the attenuated MVA T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus (a kind gift from G. Sutter) or the vT7 vaccinia virus and then transfected with the appropriate plasmids using either DOSPER or DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For colocalization with Rab11, δRCP was transfected into HeLa cells using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Six hours after the addition of the DNA/Effectene complex, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy.Immunofluorescence MicroscopyCells on 11-mm round glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.05% saponin and incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in 5% fetal bovine serum, phosphate-buffered saline. The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-mouse conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Texas Red or donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (Jackson Immunoresearch). The coverslips were mounted onto slides with Mowiol (Sigma). Immunofluorescence images were recorded on a LeicaTCS confocal microscope as previously described (42.Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Goud B. Science. 1998; 279: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) or by conventional epifluorescence microscopy using a NIKON E-600 microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu chilled CCD C5985 camera. All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator software.Ligand InternalizationSix hours post-transfection, serum-starved cells grown on glass coverslips were allowed to internalize FITC-coupled iron-saturated holotransferrin (33 μg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then briefly rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed as previously described. For the uptake/chase experiments FITC-Tfn was internalized at 18 °C for 45 min and then chased at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed.Subcellular Fractionation and Membrane WashingHeLa cells were resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 90 mm KCl plus protease inhibitors, lysed by freeze-thawing twice and passing through a 26-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. Membrane (pellet) and cytosol (supernatant) fractions were obtained by centrifuging the lysate at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman L8–55 ultracentrifuge. Membrane extractions were performed as described (43.Matern H. Yang X. Andrulis E. Sternglanz R. Trepte H.H. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4485-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); briefly, the postnuclear supernatant was incubated with 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, or 0.1 mNa2CO3 (pH 11) for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in the same volume as supernatant, and equal volumes of either fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Estimation of 125I-Tfn RecyclingThe recycling assays were performed as previously described (8.Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells infected with the MVA T7 recombinant vaccinia virus were co-transfected with the indicated construct and the human TfnR. 125I-Tfn was bound to the cell surface on ice for 1 h. Unbound ligand was washed off, and the cells were allowed to internalize and recycle the125I-Tfn at 37 °C. At the indicated time points the amount of recycled Tfn in the culture medium was quantitated. To analyze the rate of recycling from the recycling compartment, the transfected BHK cells were pulsed with 125I-Tfn for 5 min, excess ligand was washed off, and the cells were chased at 37 °C for 30 min. After the chase, the amount of 125I-Tfn in the culture medium was measured. In all cases the amount of125I-Tfn is indicated as a percent of the total Tfn, i.e. Tfn associated with the cell plus Tfn in the culture medium. Control cells were transfected with the human TfnR alone.RESULTSIsolation of Rab4-interacting Clones Using the Yeast Two-hybrid SystemWe utilized the yeast two-hybrid technique to identify proteins that interact with Rab4. A GTPase-deficient, therefore constitutively active, mutant of Rab4 (Rab4Q67L) was used as “bait” to screen an oligo-dT-primed HeLa cDNA library. Approximately 3 × 106 transformants were screened, of which 44 grew on selective medium lacking histidine and activated the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Fourteen of these displayed a specific, nucleotide-dependent interaction with Rab4. By hybridization and sequencing analysis, five of the clones were determined to be rabaptin 5, a Rab5 effector that also interacts with Rab4 (20.Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Four clones, represented by clone H13, expressed an identical 1.9-kilobase cDNA. The remaining five clones from the screen have yet to be characterized. Clone H13 was chosen for this study, and we demonstrate here that it interacts strongly with Rab4Q67L and Rab4WT, but weakly with the GDP-locked mutant (Rab4S22N) (Fig. 1). No interaction was observed with a mutant that is GTP-locked but has an amino acid change in the putative effector domain (Rab4Q67L/I41E), suggesting that the interaction is mediated through this domain. No reporter gene activation was observed with the GTPase-deficient forms of Rab3, Rab5, Rab6, or Rab7 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, there was also a strong interaction with all Rab11 constructs (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that clone H13 encodes a polypeptide that interacts with two early endosomal Rab GTPases that have been shown to overlap in their localization (11.Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S.

Commun. 2001; 281: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we isolated a mouse clone named M25 that comprises the extreme carboxy-terminal 65 amino acids of H13 and retains the ability to interact with Rab4 and Rab11. 2A. J. Lindsay, A. G. Hendrick, and M. W. McCaffrey, unpublished data. Thus, we have been able to localize the Rab4/Rab11-interacting motif of this polypeptide to 65 amino acids.Identification of Full-length Rab Coupling ProteinClone H13 contains an open reading frame of 270 amino acids. While our work was in progress, the full-length mouse homologue of clone H13 was submitted to the data bases (GenBankTM accession number AK014696) (31.Kawai J. Shinagawa A. Shibata K. Nature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Using the mouse cDNA to search the human genome sequence, we identified the genomic sequence of clone H13, consisting of five exons on the short arm of chromosome 8. We identified an EST (IMAGE 3956619) that contained the full-length human RCP, and we report here its predicted 649 primary amino acid sequence (Fig. 2A). Primary sequence analysis indicates that RCP is a predominantly hydrophilic protein with a putative C2-phospholipid binding domain at its amino terminus and two putative coiled-coil domains (Fig. 2, C and D). Homology searches of the GenBankTM data base identified KIAA0857 (Rip11/pp75), KIAA0941 (Rab11-FIP2/nRip11), and KIAA0665 (Rab11-FIP3/Eferin) as homologues of RCP. While our work was in progress, descriptions of these three homologues as well as a further family member (Rab11-FIP1) appeared in press (27.Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol.

To avoid confusion in the nomenclature, the published names are indicated in parentheses after the GenBankTM reference name in each case above. An alignment of RCP with its four related proteins is shown (Fig. 2B). Over their entire lengths, RCP shares 36, 28, 35, and 21% identity with Rip11/pp75, Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2/nRip11, and Rab11-FIP3/Eferin, respectively. However, the greatest degree of homology between these proteins exists toward their termini (Fig. 2B). Four of these proteins (all except Rab11-FIP1) contain either a C2 or an EF domain in their amino-terminal half, and all five contain a Rab binding domain/predicted coiled-coil domain near their carboxy termini.Figure 2Primary structure of RCP.

This study is aimed at identifying the signaling pathways involved in these events. Treatment of porcine VSMCs with 12(S)-HETE led to the activation of Ras and p38 MAPK. It also stimulated phosphorylation, DNA-binding activity, and transactivation of the transcription factor cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein. In addition, 12(S)-HETE induced transcription from a fibronectin promoter containing multiple CREs. AngII also induced transactivation of CRE-binding protein and transcription from the fibronectin promoter. A specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190) as well as a dominant-negative Ras mutant (Ras-N17) blocked both 12(S)-HETE and AngII effects. In addition, inhibitors of lipoxygenase also blocked AngII effects. Both 12(S)-HETE and AngII increased cellular hypertrophy with similar potency, and this was significantly blocked by SB202190. Stable overexpression of murine leukocyte-type 12/15-lipoxygenase in VSMCs increased the levels of cell-associated 12(S)-HETE as well as basal activity of both ERK and p38 MAPKs. Furthermore, these 12-lipoxygenase-overexpressing cells displayed significantly greater cellular hypertrophy relative to mock-transfected cells. These results show for the first time that oxidized lipids such as 12(S)-HETE can induce VSMC growth and matrix gene expression and mediate growth factor effects via activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway and key target transcription factors.

Growth factors such as angiotensin II (AngII)1 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activate intracellular phospholipases, leading to the formation of arachidonic acid, which can be further metabolized by cyclooxygenases, cytochrome P-450 oxygenases, and lipoxygenases (1Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Lipoxygenase (LO) action leads to the formation of oxidized lipids such as 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE). LOs and their products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolism have been shown to mediate growth factor effects in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) as well as responses to vascular injury. Lipoxygenases are classified as 5-, 8-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenases based on their ability to insert molecular oxygen at the corresponding carbon atom of arachidonic acid. Three major isoforms of 12-LO have been cloned. They are platelet-type 12-LO, leukocyte-type 12-LO, and epidermis-type 12-LO. These proteins are products of distinct genes and vary in tissue distribution (2Kuhn H. Thiele B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, expression of 12-LO protein and mRNA is markedly increased in neointima of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, and pretreatment with LO inhibitors reduces the rate of neointimal thickening in this model (16Natarajan R.

We have demonstrated that treatment with a chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeted to cleave rat leukocyte-type 12-LO mRNA significantly reduces neointimal thickening in balloon-injured rat arteries (18Gu J.L.

We have also recently shown that infection of porcine VSMCs (PVSMCs) with a recombinant adenovirus expressing a 12-LO ribozyme reduces PDGF-induced migration and glucose-induced fibronectin expression, thus providing further support for a functional role of 12-LO in growth factor-induced responses (19Patricia M.K.

The role of 12-LO in the pathology of atherosclerosis was further established when it was demonstrated that crossbreeding of apoE knockout mice with 12-LO knockout mice produces offspring with reduced rates of atherosclerosis (20Cyrus T.

Sumners C. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 84: 2494-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have also shown that 12(S)-HETE exhibits direct growth-promoting effects and increases levels of the key extracellular matrix protein fibronectin in PVSMCs (27Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Lanting L. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1994; 23: I142-I147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it also mediates the hypertrophic effects of AngII and the chemotactic effects of PDGF in the same model (13Natarajan R. Bai W. Rangarajan V. Gonzales N. Gu J.L. Lanting L. Nadler J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Lanting L. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1994; 23: I142-I147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 12(S)-HETE may be involved in multiple events related to the development of hypertension and atherosclerosis. These diverse biological effects of 12(S)-HETE suggest that it can act as a distinct signaling molecule. However, signaling pathways and gene regulation mechanisms that mediate 12(S)-HETE-induced responses in VSMCs are not clear. In this study, we report that 12(S)-HETE activates the Ras-MAPK pathway, which is essential for the activation of multiple transcription factors, including cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Furthermore, 12(S)-HETE could also induce transcription from a fibronectin promoter containing CRE-binding sites. The effects of 12(S)-HETE were similar to those of AngII, and LO activation could also mediate AngII effects. In addition, we report that stable overexpression of 12-LO in VSMCs increases activation of MAPKs and cellular hypertrophy. 12(S)-Hydroxyeicosa-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-tetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE), 12(R)-hydroxyeicosa-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-tetraenoic acid (12(R)-HETE), and the LO inhibitor cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate (CDC) were purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.

At the end of the incubation periods, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and processed for whole cell lysates or nuclear protein extraction as described below. In some experiments, PVSMCs were pretreated with inhibitors as indicated. The rat VSMC line A10 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. PVSMCs were plated on chamber slides and serum-depleted for 16–18 h in the absence or presence of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FPT III, 10 μm). The cells were then treated with vehicle (0.1% ethanol), 12(S)-HETE (0.1 μm), or the stereoisomer 12(R)-HETE (0.1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were stained with anti-Ras antibody followed by Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Staining was visualized using a confocal microscope as described (28Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Fatima S. Harper J. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (29Yerneni K.K. Bai W. Khan B.V. Medford R.M. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the stimulation with 12(S)-HETE, cells were washed, scraped into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and spun down at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and protease inhibitors) and then lysed in nuclear extraction buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). After a 30-min incubation on ice, they were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as nuclear extract. DNA binding of nuclear proteins was performed as described previously (29Yerneni K.K. Bai W. Khan B.V. Medford R.M. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides containing consensus DNA-binding sequences for transcription factors CREB and SP1 were used as probes in gel shift assays. Gels were dried, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized on a PhosphorImager. Quantitation of radioactivity in each complex was carried out using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoblotting of the cell lysates was performed as described before (11Kang S.W. Adler S.G. Nast C.C. LaPage J. Gu J.L. Nadler J.L. Natarajan R.

Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Protein bands on Western blots were visualized using Supersignal chemiluminescence reagent. Immunoblots were scanned using a Model GS-800 densitometer, and protein bands were quantified with Quantitation One software (Bio-Rad). PVSMCs were split 24 h prior to transfection to obtain 70% confluence in 12-well plates and transfected with Lipotaxi for 6 h in serum-free medium as described by the manufacturer. Cells were allowed to recover overnight in 0.5% serum and stimulated with 12(S)-HETE or AngII (0.1 μm each) for 6 h. Then, the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer, and luciferase assays were performed as described by the manufacturer. Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB202190, 1–5 μm), ERK1/2 (PD98059, 10–50 μm), and 12-LO (CDC, 10 μm) for 30 min prior to 12(S)-HETE addition. Rat VSMCs (A10 cell line) were cotransfected with an expression vector for mouse leukocyte-type 12-LO (m12-LO) or the empty expression vector pcDNA3.1 using Lipotaxi. Transfected cells were grown in the presence of Geneticin (G418) at a concentration of 400 μg/ml until resistant colonies formed. These colonies were cloned using cloning cylinders, and then individual colonies were tested for 12-LO expression by immunoblotting with anti-12-LO antibody. Clones expressing high amounts of 12-LO were used in further experiments. Serum-depleted VSMCs were incubated overnight with [3H]leucine and 12(S)-HETE or AngII at the indicated concentrations, and radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid-insoluble protein precipitates was determined as described previously (14Natarajan R. Rosdahl J. Gonzales N. Bai W. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rat VSMCs (A10 cell line) transfected with m12-LO or pcDNA3.1 were serum-depleted, and cell pellets were hydrolyzed to release esterified cell-associated HETEs as described previously (6Natarajan R. Gu J.L. Rossi J. Gonzales N. Lanting L. Xu L. Nadler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 12(S)-HETE was then extracted, and levels were quantitated using a specific radioimmunoassay as described previously (6Natarajan R. Gu J.L. Rossi J. Gonzales N. Lanting L. Xu L. Nadler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Nadler J.L. Natarajan R. Stern N. J. Clin.

Paired Student's t tests were used to compare two groups, and analysis of variance with Dunnet's post-test was used for multiple groups using PRISM software (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was detected at p < 0.05 level. To evaluate the signaling responses of 12(S)-HETE in PVSMCs, we examined the activation of key MAPKs. Serum-depleted VSMCs were treated with 12(S)-HETE (0.1 μm) for 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, and MAPK activation was determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies that recognize only the activated kinase. As shown in Fig. 1 A, p38 MAPK activation could be seen within 5 min after stimulation with 12(S)-HETE and remained elevated until 30 min as detected by increases in the levels of the phospho-p38 MAPK band. When the same blot was stripped and probed with an antibody to non-phosphorylated p38 MAPK, the results showed that an equal amount of p38 MAPK was present in all the lanes (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK antibodies showed that 12(S)-HETE did not significantly activate ERK1/2 (Fig. 1 C). 12(S)-HETE also did not activate a third MAPK, JNK (data not shown). These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE is a potent activator of p38 MAPK (but not ERK1/2 or JNK) in VSMCs. We next examined whether 12(S)-HETE can activate the small GTP-binding protein Ras, a key common upstream activator of MAPKs. Quiescent VSMCs were left untreated or were pretreated with an inhibitor of Ras farnesylation (FPT III, 10 μm) and then stimulated for 10 min either with vehicle alone or with 0.1 μm 12(S)-HETE or 12(R)-HETE, which is not a lipoxygenase product. Cells were then stained with anti-Ras antibody followed by Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody, and Ras translocation to the plasma membrane was examined in a confocal microscope. There was a marked increase in the translocation of Ras to the plasma membrane in cells stimulated with 12(S)-HETE (Fig.2 C) compared with those treated with vehicle (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, 12(R)-HETE had no effect on Ras translocation (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, 12(S)-HETE-induced Ras translocation to the plasma membrane was abolished by pretreatment with FPT III (Fig. 2 F). These results demonstrate that, in PVSMCs, 12(S)-HETE induces translocation of Ras to the membrane, a process that can result in the activation of Ras. We next examined whether 12(S)-HETE can activate the transcription factor CREB, a key downstream target of the MAPK pathway, particularly p38 MAPK (32Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In addition, CREB is a key player in transcription of the matrix protein fibronectin (33Dean D.C. Blakeley M.S.

Serum-depleted PVSMCs were treated for 5, 10, 30, and 60 min with 12(S)-HETE (0.1 μm). The cell lysates were then immunoblotted with anti-phospho-CREB antibody that recognizes only CREB protein phosphorylated at Ser133 in the transactivation domain. As shown in Fig.3 A, phosphorylation of CREB was increased at 5 min and remained elevated for 30 min. In contrast, the levels of non-phosphorylated CREB remained unchanged, as shown in Fig. 3 B. These results demonstrate that 12(S)-HETE stimulates CREB phosphorylation in PVSMCs. To test the specificity of 12(S)-HETE signaling, VSMCs were stimulated with either 12(S)-HETE or 12(R)-HETE for 5 min. The cell lysates were then analyzed for the activation of p38 MAPK and CREB by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. 12(S)-HETE stimulated activation of both p38 MAPK (Fig.4 A, second lane) and CREB (C, second lane) compared with controls (A and C, lanes 1). In contrast, 12(R)-HETE had no effect on the activation of either p38 MAPK (Fig. 4 A, third lane) or CREB (C,third lane). Subsequently, the same blots were stripped and probed with anti-p38 MAPK or anti-CREB antibody recognizing both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. The results show that 12(S)-HETE did not alter the p38 MAPK (Fig. 4 B) and CREB (Fig. 4 D) protein levels, indicating that equal amounts of proteins were loaded in all lanes. Thus, 12(S)-HETE (but not 12(R)-HETE) was able to stimulate p38 MAPK and CREB in VSMCs; and hence, the effects are specific to the LO product. To investigate the upstream kinase(s) involved in the phosphorylation of CREB and to determine whether CREB is a target of 12(S)-HETE-induced p38 MAPK activation, we tested the effect of MAPK inhibitors on CREB phosphorylation. PVSMCs were pretreated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (1–5 μm) or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10–50 μm) for 30 min prior to stimulation with 12(S)-HETE for 5 min. The cell lysates were then immunoblotted with anti-phospho-CREB antibodies, and the results are shown in Fig. 5 (Aand C). Phosphorylation of CREB was inhibited by SB202190 at as low as 1 μm. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on CREB phosphorylation even at 50 μm. The blot was then stripped and probed with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 B, 1 μm SB202190 blocked p38 MAPK activation, in contrast to PD98059, which had no effect on p38 MAPK activation even at 50 μm. These results demonstrate that p38 MAPK mediates 12(S)-HETE-induced phosphorylation of CREB in PVSMCs. Serum-depleted PVSMCs were stimulated with 12(S)-HETE for 15 min to 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear extracts were analyzed for DNA-binding activity by gel shift assay using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing consensus DNA-binding sequences for the transcription factor CREB (Fig. 6 A) and the constitutively active transcription factor SP1 (Fig. 6 B). Radioactivity in the DNA-protein complexes was determined using a PhosphorImager and is shown as -fold over control in Fig.6 C. The DNA-binding activity of CREB was increased by 12(S)-HETE within 15 min, peaked at 30 min, and continued to remain elevated until 120"

The resulting increases in left ventricular (LV)1 wall thickness serve to normalize wall stress and diminish myocardial oxygen consumption. Salutary effects on energy metabolism, however, are counterbalanced by heightened risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (1Brown D.W. Giles W.R. Croft J.B. Am. Heart J. 2000; 14: 848-856Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Prominent among these is increased risk of heart failure. Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated cytoplasmic protein phosphatase (PP2B) that transduces hypertrophic stimuli to regulate transcriptional control of myocyte transformation (2Molkentin J.D. Dorn G.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). A number of groups have investigated the importance of calcineurin signaling in models of in vivo hypertrophy (reviewed in Ref.2Molkentin J.D. Dorn G.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although results have been varied, most reports relied on pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin using either cyclosporin A (CsA) or FK-506. Although CsA is a specific inhibitor of calcineurin, CsA has multiple effects on cellular signaling, including altered expression of the cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (3Wang Z. Nolan B. Kutschke W. Hill J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17706-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and increased concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ (4Fatkin D. McConnell B.K.

Calcineurin is a ubiquitous protein, and systemic CsA has effects on other, noncardiac organ systems. MCIP1 (myocyte-enriched calcineurin-interacting protein) is a recently described (5Rothermel B.

MCIP1 binding to CnA inhibits activating effects on the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) or myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), proteins that transduce calcineurin-generated signals to downstream targets (5Rothermel B.

Expression of the exon 4 isoform of MCIP1 is induced by calcineurin activation (7Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ.

However, no previous studies have determined whether MCIP1 impacts the hypertrophic response to pressure overloadin vivo. Further, effects of cardiomyocyte-specific calcineurin suppression on hypertrophic activation of fetal gene expression is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that hypertrophy is not required for maintenance of systolic performance under all conditions of hemodynamic stress. Mice subjected to surgical banding of the thoracic aorta (TAB) maintain normal systolic performance despite elimination of hypertrophy by calcineurin inhibition with CsA (9Hill J.A. Karimi M.

It is of interest to examine the short and long term necessity of hypertrophy in maintenance of LV systolic performance using a cardiomyocyte-specific means of calcineurin inhibition. Transgenic (TG) mice were engineered to overexpress a human cDNA encoding the calcineurin-binding protein hMCIP1 under the control of the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter (8Rothermel B. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B. Nicol R.L. Mammen P. Yang J. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3328-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mice were genotyped following sacrifice to ensure blinded surgical intervention and postoperative evaluations. Male offspring (6–8 weeks old) of heterozygous matings were subjected to pressure overload by TAB (10Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Proximal aortic pressures were measured in anesthetized mice as described (9Hill J.A.

Hearts were perfusion-fixed in zinc-formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (7 μm) between the papillary muscles and the atrioventricular groove, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin or picrosirius red. Short axis cuts of LV were scanned (four to five 50× sections), and the degree of fibrotic change was quantified as red pixels divided by total pixels, as determined by image analysis software. Total RNA from TAB and sham-operated hearts (2-μg dot blots, 20-μg Northern blots) was transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA fragments or antisense oligonucleotides. Signal intensity was detected on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified using IMAGEQUANT (version 1.2). Transthoracic echocardiograms were recorded in conscious sedated mice as described (9Hill J.A. Karimi M. Kutschke W. Davisson R.L. Zimmerman K. Wang Z. Kerber R.E. Weiss R.M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). LV internal diameters and wall thicknesses were measured (at least three cardiac cycles) at end systole and end diastole from two-dimensionally targeted M-mode cross-sectional views at the level of the chordae tendineae. Heart rate was determined from mitral inflow Doppler envelopes. Averaged data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was analyzed using a Student's unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's method for post hoc pair-wise multiple comparisons. As reported previously (8Rothermel B. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B. Nicol R.L. Mammen P. Yang J. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3328-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), MCIP1 transgenic mice developed normally and did not exhibit overt signs of circulatory compromise. Pressure overload, induced by surgical banding of the thoracic aorta, was tolerated equally well in transgenic mice and in wild type littermates. There were no detectable clinical differences (lethargy, tachypnea, impaired mobility, edema), and the mice did not exhibit signs of cardiovascular compromise (effusions, ascites, hepatic congestion). Body mass continued to increase normally in both groups (data not shown). Perioperative (<5%) and 3-week mortalities (<10%) were similar. At 3 weeks, a point where the hypertrophic response is near steady state (9Hill J.A. Karimi M. Kutschke W. Davisson R.L. Zimmerman K. Wang Z. Kerber R.E. Weiss R.M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), hearts were dissected and weighed, and mice were tested for the presence of the MCIP1 transgene. Integrity of aortic banding was confirmed by inspection of the surgical constriction and by visualization of marked differences in caliber of the right and left carotid arteries. Heart mass in wild type (WT) mice increased 65% from 115 ± 2 to 190 ± 10 mg (p < 0.05) (Fig.1). Heart mass normalized to tibia length (HW/T) increased 63% (p < 0.05) from 6.8 ± 0.1 to 11.1 ± 0.6 mg/mm (Fig. 1 B). Heart mass normalized to body mass (HW/BW) increased 70% (p < 0.05) from 4.6 ± 0.1 (n = 5) to 7.8 ± 0.4 mg/g (n = 23). In both WT and transgenic animals, heart mass was similar in sham-operated and unoperated controls. In contrast, increases in heart mass in MCIP1 transgenic mice were significantly attenuated, increasing from 105 ± 4 (n = 7) to 158 ± 8 mg (n = 23). HW/T increased 46% from 6.3 ± 0.2 to 9.2 ± 0.4 mg/mm (p < 0.05 versus unoperated MCIP1;p < 0.05 versus WT TAB) (Fig.1 B). HW/BW increased 40% from 4.8 ± 0.1 to 6.7 ± 0.3 mg/g (p < 0.05 versus unoperated MCIP1; p < 0.05 versus WT TAB). Thus, MCIP1 overexpression was associated with a significant reduction in pressure overload-induced increases in HW/T (decreased 27%, p< 0.01) and HW/BW (decreased 43%, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in either HW/T or HW/BW in unoperated MCIP1 transgenic mice and WT littermate controls. Whereas pharmacologic inhibition of calcineurin blunts the hypertrophic response to pressure stress, long term (≥2–3 months) cyclosporin treatment is not well tolerated in mice. 2W. Kutschke and J. A. Hill, unpublished observations. To determine the longevity of the attenuated hypertrophic response stemming from calcineurin suppression, a group of mice was followed out to 3 months. Whereas heart mass at 3 months was significantly increased (p < 0.01) in both WT and MCIP1 mice, the hypertrophic response in MCIP1 mice (HW/T 7.9 ± 0.6 mg/mm, n = 5) was attenuated relative to WT (HW/T 10.1 ± 0.3 mg/mm,n = 5) to an extent similar to that observed at 3 weeks (Fig. 1 B). Short axis sections through the heart at the level of the papillary muscles (Fig. 2 A) revealed thickening of the left ventricular wall in WT hearts following TAB at 3 weeks, whereas wall thickening was attenuated in hearts from banded MCIP1 mice. Quantification of fibrotic change revealed a trend (p = NS) toward decreased perivascular and subendocardial fibrosis (Fig. 2 B) in banded MCIP1 hearts (2.5 ± 0.8%, n = 4) compared with banded WT (3.8 ± 0.8%, n = 9). The human MCIP1 gene expresses four variant mRNAs leading to unique 5′ termini of the expressed transcripts (11Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In mouse, expression of the exon 4 isoform is regulated by calcineurin activity (7Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 87: e61-e68Google Scholar). To determine whether MCIP1 expression increases under conditions of pressure-overload stress, we measured transcript levels of MCIP1 (exon 1 and exon 4 variants) and MCIP2 by Northern blotting (Fig.3) and normalized the results to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript levels. MCIP2 transcript levels were not increased by TAB in both WT (average -fold change 1.5, n = 5, p = NS) and TG (average -fold change 1.3, n = 3, p = NS) animals. A similar insensitivity to pressure stress was observed for the exon 1 variant of MCIP1 (data not shown). In contrast, steady-state levels of the exon 4 isoform of the MCIP1 transcript were significantly increased by TAB in both WT (average -fold change 16,n = 5, p < 0.05) and TG animals (average -fold change 6, n = 3, p < 0.05). The degree of exon 4 up-regulation varied over wide ranges in both WT (3–47-fold) and TG (2–13-fold) mice. Preliminary data suggest that the magnitude of exon 4 expression was proportional to the degree of myocardial hypertrophy elicited by the pressure stress. Hypertrophic transformation involves myocyte dedifferentiation and activation of a fetal gene program. However, the role of calcineurin signaling therein is not known. Analysis of total heart RNA revealed elevation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and α-skeletal actin transcript levels in both WT and MCIP1 TAB hearts (Fig. 4 A). Remarkably, ANF expression was more robust in the MCIP1 TAB hearts compared with WT TAB. Within each genotype, over a wide range of hypertrophy, there was a linear relationship between ANF expression and LV mass (Fig. 4 B), although the slope of this relationship was steeper in the MCIP1 TAB animals compared with WT TAB. Expression of brain natriuretic peptide was similar to that of ANF,i.e. elevated in MCIP1 TAB hearts relative to WT TAB (Fig.4 C). β-myosin heavy chain transcript levels were modestly increased to similar extents in both genotypes (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the expression of α-skeletal actin was reduced in MCIP1 TAB hearts compared with WT TAB hearts (Fig. 4, A andC). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that systolic performance can be preserved in this model at 3 weeks despite abolition of the structural hypertrophic response (9Hill J.A. Karimi M. Kutschke W. Davisson R.L. Zimmerman K. Wang Z. Kerber R.E. Weiss R.M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To explore this using an endogenous negative regulator of calcineurin, we evaluated LV size and function by echocardiography. Under these recording conditions, there were no significant differences in heart rate (MCIP1 TAB, 600 ± 19 bpm, n = 5; WT TAB, 625 ± 30 bpm, n = 6; unoperated MCIP1, 616 ± 20 bpm, n = 6; unoperated WT, 610 ± 29 bpm,n = 7). Proximal aortic pressures were similar (p = NS) in transgenic (171/81 ± 17/5, n = 4) and WT (166/69 ± 12/5, n = 4) mice, suggesting similarity in the cardiac responses to the surgical stenosis. Echocardiographically determined LV wall thicknesses increased significantly in banded WT (34%, p < 0.01) and banded TG (21%,p < 0.05) mice, but the increase was significantly (p < 0.05) blunted in MCIP1 mice (TableI). Systolic performance, measured as percent fractional shortening (FS) in M-mode tracings (Fig.5 A), was similar in unoperated MCIP1 transgenic mice (52 ± 5, n = 9) compared with WT littermates (56 ± 8, n = 11) (p = NS). Echocardiograms recorded 3 weeks post-banding revealed preservation of systolic function in both hypertrophied WT mice (FS = 57 ± 10, n = 6) and in MCIP1 transgenics (FS = 56 ± 8, n = 5), despite the blunted hypertrophic response in the latter group (Fig.5 B). Measurements of left ventricular end diastolic dimension were similar (p = NS) in all four groups (WT, 2.0 ± 0.2 mm, n = 11; MCIP1, 2.0 ± 0.1,n = 9; WT TAB, 1.7 ± 0.4, n = 6; MCIP1 TAB, 1.8 ± 0.1, n = 5), ruling out significant ventricular dilatation as a contributor to cardiac output.Table IEchocardiographically-determined LV wall thicknessWTMCIP1 TGIVSLVPWIVSLVPWSham,Systole1.6 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.11.57 ± 0.05n = 11n = 11n = 9n = 9Diastole1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1n = 11n = 11n = 9n = 9TAB,Systole2.2 ± 0.11-ap < 0.01versus Sham.1-bp < 0.05 versusTG.2.2 ± 0.11-ap < 0.01versus Sham.1-bp < 0.05 versusTG.2.0 ± 0.11-cp < 0.05 versusSham.2.0 ± 0.11-cp < 0.05 versusSham.n = 6n = 6n = 5n = 5Diastole1.3 ± 0.11-cp < 0.05 versusSham.1-bp < 0.05 versusTG.1.3 ± 0.11-cp < 0.05 versusSham.1-bp < 0.05 versusTG.1.11 ± 0.021.23 ± 0.04n = 6n = 6n = 5n = 51-a p < 0.01versus Sham.1-b p < 0.05 versusTG.1-c p < 0.05 versusSham. Open table in a new tab To test the longevity of preserved systolic performance, a group of MCIP1 animals (n = 9) was followed out to 3 months post-TAB. There were no clinical signs of circulatory compromise, and mortality was not increased at 3 months. Necropsy analysis failed to reveal evidence of heart failure. Echocardiograms confirmed the preservation of systolic performance with percent fractional shortening measured at 51 ± 9 (n = 9) (Fig. 5 B) and heart rate measured at 627 ± 18 bpm. The LV cavity was not dilated (end diastolic dimension 2.4 ± 0.3 mm). Involvement of the calcineurin-NFAT/MEF2 pathway in hypertrophic signaling has been demonstrated using a variety of approaches that include both cell culture and intact animal models (reviewed in Ref.2Molkentin J.D. Dorn G.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Controversy over the importance of calcineurin signaling in medically relevant forms of hypertrophy persists, but the concept recently has gained increasing acceptance (12Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2947-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Dorn G.W. Circulation. 2001; 104: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). By inhibiting calcineurin selectively within the myocardium, we demonstrate that inhibition of hypertrophy is cell autonomous and not because of noncardiac (e.g. neural) effects of calcineurin suppression. Similar results were recently reported using other transgenic approaches (14De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Delling U. Braz J.C. Glascock B.J. Kimball T.F. del Monte F. Hajjar R. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3322-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 15Zou Y. Hiroi Y. Uozumi H. Takimoto E. Toko H. Zhu H. Kudoh S. Mizukami M. Shimoyama M. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MCIP1 is present at high levels in normal myocardium, and its expression is regulated by calcineurin activity (7Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 87: e61-e68Google Scholar). MCIP1 overexpression inhibited the hypertrophic response to aortic banding (this study) or hormonal stress (8Rothermel B. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B. Nicol R.L. Mammen P. Yang J. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3328-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and clinical and echocardiographic measures of cardiac performance under basal conditions were preserved. We report that the exon 4 variant of MCIP1 is up-regulated by TAB, and preliminary evidence suggests that the extent of exon 4 up-regulation is proportional to the degree of myocardial hypertrophy. Together, these data suggest that MCIP1 may be an endogenous regulator of hypertrophic signaling in the heart that does not prevent normal heart growth and development. Thus, MCIP1 up-regulation may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in patients with heart disease. Increases in ANF expression were greater in the MCIP1 TAB hearts compared with WT. This unexpected finding suggests that activation of ANF expression is not directly dependent on calcineurin activity but rather occurs prior to or in parallel with calcineurin signaling. It is possible that inhibition of compensatory hypertrophy by the MCIP1 transgene may accentuate signaling through other pathways involved in hypertrophy development. Recently, two groups reported attenuation of hypertrophy in transgenic mice that express noncardiac calcineurin inhibitory proteins. Zouet al. (15Zou Y. Hiroi Y. Uozumi H. Takimoto E. Toko H. Zhu H. Kudoh S. Mizukami M. Shimoyama M. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) overexpressed a dominant negative form of calcineurin that acts, in part, by competing with endogenous calcineurin for calmodulin. Whereas increased expression ofc-jun was similar in WT and TG mice, they report that calcineurin suppression attenuated pressure overload-induced up-regulation of ANF and brain natriuretic peptide (15Zou Y. Hiroi Y. Uozumi H. Takimoto E. Toko H. Zhu H. Kudoh S. Mizukami M. Shimoyama M. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). De Windt et al. (14De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Delling U. Braz J.C. Glascock B.J. Kimball T.F. del Monte F. Hajjar R. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3322-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) expressed calcineurin inhibitory domains from two different proteins and observed significant attenuation of hypertrophic marker changes. At this point, we do not know why fetal gene expression is different in the MCIP1 TAB mice compared with these other models, even though attenuation of hypertrophy was similar. It is possible that differential inhibition of other calmodulin-dependent enzymes such as CaMKIV (16Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) may occur in these models. We speculate that the endogenous calcineurin inhibitory protein MCIP1 may exhibit some degree of specificity, inhibiting dephosphorylation of a narrower range of targets. More experiments are required to ascertain the relative contribution of calcineurin and other hypertrophic signaling pathways in the induction of the fetal gene program. We observed preservation of circulatory performance in MCIP1 mice at 3 weeks and at 3 months post-banding. The finding that ventricular decompensation does not occur in the setting of ≈50 mm Hg systolic pressure overload despite attenuation of the hypertrophic response is supported by four independent lines of evidence. First, there was no clinical or actuarial evidence of heart failure in banded transgenic mice. Second, post-mortem gross anatomy demonstrated no signs of cardiac dilatation or evidence of heart failure (e.g.effusions, ascites, edema). Third, we observed a trend toward diminished fibrosis in 3-week banded MCIP1 hearts. Finally, echocardiography consistently demonstrated maintenance of normal systolic size and function in banded transgenic mice. Hypertrophy occurring as a consequence of pressure overload is termed “compensatory” on the premise that it facilitates ejection performance by normalizing systolic and diastolic wall stress. We and others have shown recently that cardiac hypertrophy is not required in the short term to maintain systolic function in the face of pressure overload (9Hill J.A. Karimi M. Kutschke W.

Maintenance of cardiac output in the face of increased afterload but without change in end diastolic or end systolic volumes (homeometric autoregulation) was first described in 1912 and has been reported subsequently in a variety of working heart models (9Hill J.A.

Although the molecular mechanism underlying homeometric autoregulation remains unknown, the findings reported here are consistent with a sustained Anrep effect.

However, no protein acting like Rho and Rab dissociation inhibitor (GDI) that regulate the membrane association of Rho and Rab GTPases has been described for Ras and closely related proteins. We report here that the δ subunit of retinal rod phosphodiesterase (PDEδ) is able to interact with prenylated Ras and Rap proteins, and to solubilize them from membranes, independently of their nucleotide-bound (GDP or GTP) state. We show that PDEδ exhibits striking structural similarities with RhoGDI, namely conservation of the Ig-like fold and presence of a series of hydrophobic residues which could act as in RhoGDI to sequester the prenyl group of its target proteins, thereby providing structural support for the biochemical activity of PDEδ. We observe that the overexpression of PDEδ interferes with Ras trafficking and propose that it may play a role in the process that delivers prenylated proteins from endomembranes, once they have undergone proteolysis and carboxymethylation, to the structures that ensure trafficking to their respective resident compartments.

GTPases of the Ras superfamily, including the Ras, Rho/Rac/Cdc42, and Rab families, play a central role in the control of numerous essential biological functions such as proliferation, differentiation, cell morphology, movement, intracellular trafficking, and gene expression (1.Hall A.

Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As it was shown for Ras many years ago, the association of these proteins with membranes is essential for their biological activity (6.Willumsen B.M. Norris K. Papageorge A.G. Hubbert N.L. Lowy D.R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2581-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Proteins of the Ras and Rho/Rac/Cdc42 families contain a CAAXsequence (where C is a Cys, A an aliphatic residue, andX any amino acid) at their COOH-terminal extremity that targets them for their post-translational modifications. The first step consists in prenylation in the cytosol of the Cys of the CAAX motif by a C-15 farnesyl moiety, in the case of Ras and Rap2A, or by a C-20 geranylgeranyl group for most other GTPases (7.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Prenylation addresses these proteins to endomembrane compartments (the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) (8.Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), which correspond to the intracellular localization of the prenyl CAAX protease that removes the three COOH-terminal AAX residues, and the carboxymethyl transferase that modifies the now COOH-terminal prenyl-cysteine (9.Hancock J.F.

A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Other cellular proteins that carry a COOH-terminal CAAX sequence are processed by the same mechanisms; this group comprises proteins of the nuclear envelope (lamins A and B), the γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, as well as several proteins involved in phototransduction such as rhodopsin kinase, the α subunit of transducin and both α and β catalytic subunits of the cGMP phosphodiesterase from retinal rods and cones (7.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Upstream of the CAAX motif, farnesylated GTPases such as Ras carry a second signal consisting of a stretch of basic residues (as is the case for the K-Ras(4B) protein) or additional cysteines serving as palmitoylation sites (one for N-Ras or two for Ha-Ras) that are necessary for the association of these proteins with the plasma membrane (13.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrates that these signals also play a role in the trafficking of newly synthesized Ras proteins to the plasma membrane, as well as in their targeting to membrane subdomains. Palmitoylation addresses Ha- and N-Ras proteins to cholesterol-rich rafts via the exocytotic pathway, whereas K-Ras(4B) proceeds to the non-raft plasma membrane via a yet uncharacterized route (8.Choy E.

Despite these new advances, the question of how the newly prenylated, and therefore hydrophobic yet still cytosolic, proteins transit in the cytosol to reach membranes remains open. Newly synthesized Rab proteins are escorted to their cognate membrane compartment, after prenylation by Rab-geranylgeranyltransferase, by Rab Escort Protein, a subunit of the enzyme specifically dedicated to this task (16.Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Rho- and RabGDIs, respectively, enable Rho and Rab GTPases to shuttle between membrane compartments through the cytosol due to their the ability to solubilize processed proteins from membranes and to maintain them in the cytosol by burying the hydrophobic prenyl groups in a hydrophobic pocket (17.Wu S.K. Zeng K. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 472-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,18.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A.

To date, no such activity has been described for GTPases of the Ras subfamily (Ras, Rap, Ral, R-Ras, TC-21). In this study, we show that a protein that was originally identified as the δ subunit of the cGMP phosphodiesterase from retinal rod cells, or PDEδ (19.Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), is also able to interact with Ras and Rap proteins, and to regulate their association with membranes, similarly to Rho- and RabGDIs. Full-length human PDEδ cDNA was obtained by screening a Jurkat T cell cDNA library in the yeast two hybrid system with the entire coding sequence of Rap2B as a bait; yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed as described with GTPase baits fused to the COOH terminus of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and preys (PDEδ and effector controls) expressed from pGAD vectors (20.Nancy V.

After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated for 1 h with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen); the resin was washed with PBS containing 20 mmimidazole, and PDEδ was eluted with PBS containing 200 mmimidazole. The protein was concentrated in a Centricon YM-10 (Millipore) and further purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column. Fractions containing PDEδ were pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE; they were concentrated as above, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of pRK5-HRas vector and further cultured for 36 h; membranes were prepared from transfected and untransfected HeLa cells as follows. Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors by 100 strokes of the tight-fitted pestle of a Dounce homogeneizer. The post-nuclear supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C was submitted to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA 45 rotor; the membrane pellet was washed once in the same buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. Membranes were loaded with GDP or Gpp(NH)p for 15 min at 30 °C in an exchange buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA in the presence of 0.1 mm GDP or Gpp(NH)p and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes (400 μg of protein) were resuspended and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a solubilization buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm GDP or Gpp(NH)p in the presence of 1 μg of (His)6-PDEδ protein purified from insect cells. Solubilized proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and detected by Western blotting using rabbit affinity purified anti-Rap1 (22.Béranger F. Goud B.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against Ras, and rabbit polyclonal anti-RalB antibodies, were from Transduction Laboratories. 3 × 107 HEK293 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of pRK5myc-PDEδ or empty pRK5 vectors. 36 h later, cells were lysed, and membranes were prepared as above. 75 μg of protein from the cytosol and membranes were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit affinity-purified anti-Rap1 (22.Béranger F.

When indicated, the cytosol was adjusted to 1% Triton X-114, and the detergent-enriched phase was recovered by centrifugation as described below. Protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and detected by Western blotting. HeLa cells were electroporated as above with 4 μg of pEXV-Hras and 6 μg of pRK5-mycPDEδ or pRK5myc vectors. 15 h later, they were incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine supplemented with 5% of fetal calf serum and pulse-labeled for 20 min with 0.1 mCi/ml35S-labeled Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the same medium. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and chased for various amounts of time in complete culture medium. At the indicated times, they were lysed by a 10-min incubation on ice in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-114. After a 2-min centrifugation at 1000 × g to eliminate large debris, the supernatants were warmed for 2 min at 37 °C and centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 × g at room temperature to separate the aqueous phase from the detergent-enriched phase. The aqueous phase was then adjusted to 1% Triton X-114 and Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated from both phases by an overnight incubation with rat anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13-238 at 4 °C. Complexes were recovered with goat anti-rat antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose, extensively washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. HeLa cells that had been plated on glass coverslips were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) with pRK5-PDEδ or empty pRK5, together with pGFP-Nras, pGFP-NrasC181S, pGFP-KKas4B, pGFP-HrasCt, or pGFP-HRasCtC181SC184S plasmids; 0.5 μg of pRK5-PDEδ and 0.25 μg of pGFP plasmids were used to transfect cells in a 35-mm dish. 13 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.08% glutaraldehyde, treated with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 20 min, washed, and incubated with rabbit anti-PDEδ serum (1:100 dilution) and mouse monoclonal anti-PDI antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) when indicated for 1 h. PDEδ was detected with TRITC-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1/400) and PDI with AMCA-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (dilution 1/150) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were washed in PBS, mounted in Mowiol, and observed with a Zeiss microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Searches within nonredundant data base (NR) were performed using PSI-BLAST at NCBI (25.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

We had previously isolated PDEδ in yeast two-hybrid screens with several GTPases of the Ras superfamily as baits (20.Nancy V. Wolthuis R.M. de Tand M.F. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Bos J.L. de Gunzburg J. J.

As depicted in Table I, PDEδ interacted with Ras and Rap proteins, but not with Ral (neither RalA nor RalB), and it also interacted with Rho family members RhoA, RhoB, and Rnd1. Analysis of various mutants of these GTPases revealed that PDEδ interacted as efficiently with full-length wild type, activated (Ras Val12, Rnd1 Val12, and RhoA Val14) or dominant negative (Rap1A Asn17, Rap2B Asn17, and Ras Ala15) forms of the GTPases. In contrast, PDEδ only interacted with those proteins containing an intact COOH terminus, irrespective of other mutations that may also affect their nucleotide binding properties: Table I shows that it neither interacted with proteins carrying a COOH-terminal truncation, nor with the Ras mutant Val12→Ser186 where the Cys target of farnesylation has been replaced by a Ser.Table IInteraction of the PDEδ protein with GTPases of the Ras superfamilyDNA binding domain fusionActivation domain fusionPDEδRal-GDSpGADHa-Ras wt fl++−Ha-Ras Ala15 fl+−−Ha-Ras Val12fl++−Ha-Ras Val12 Ser186fl−+−Rap2B wt fl++−Rap2B wt tr−+−Rap2B Asn17fl+−−Rap2A wt tr−+−Rap2A Val12 tr−+−Rap1A wt fl++−Rap1A Asn17 fl+−−Ra1A wt fl−−−Ra1B wt fl−ND−Ra1B Val23 fl−ND−RhoA Val14 fl+ND−RhoB wt fl+ND−Rnd1 wt fl+ND−Rnd1 Val12 fl+ND−pVJL10−−−Hf7c yeast expressing Ras superfamily proteins fused to the COOH terminus of the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 were mated with Y187 yeast expressing potential partners fused to the COOH terminus of the activation domain of GAL4.

Previous reports had shown that purified PDEδ protein was able to solubilize the two α and β catalytic subunits of retinal rod cell cGMP phosphodiesterase, as well as the Rab13 GTPase from membranes in vitro (19.Florio S.K.

Indeed, Fig. 1 shows that recombinant PDEδ, purified from a baculovirus/insect cell expression system, extracted a significant proportion of endogenous Rap1 and Rap2, as well as ectopically expressed Ha-Ras proteins from the membranes of HeLa cells. Its activity was not dependent on the nucleotide (GDP- or GTP-bound) state of the GTPases, consistently with the interaction properties depicted in Table I. However, membrane extraction by PDEδ was selective among GTPases, since it neither affected the Ras family GTPase RalB (Fig. 3), nor the more distantly related Rab6 protein (Ref.21.Marzesco A.M.

Cells were then chased for indicated times with non radioactive methionine, lysed in Triton X-114, and fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ras GTPases contained in each fraction were immunoprecipitated, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. Lanes a, aqueous fraction; lanes d, detergent fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Numerous previous studies in mammalian cells have established that at steady state, nearly all of the endogenous Ras and Rap proteins are membrane-bound. We investigated whether the overexpression of PDEδ would affect the membrane association of Ras family proteins in vivo. Fig. 2 A shows that the ectopic overexpression of PDEδ in HEK293 cells indeed created a sizeable cytosolic pool of Rap1, Rap2 proteins; a similar effect, albeit to a lesser extent, was also observed with Ras. Since our results show that the overexpression of PDEδ affected Rap and Ras localization at steady state, one possibility is that this could have resulted from an interference with the post-translational processing of Ras family GTPases, resulting in the cytosolic accumulation of immature proteins. We evaluated processing by the ability of prenylated Ras and Rap proteins to partition into the detergent-rich phase of the detergent Triton X-114, as well as to migrate faster by SDS-PAGE (9.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar,23.Béranger F. Tavitian A. deGunzburg J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1835-1842PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that the overexpression of PDEδ resulted in the appearance in the cytosol of a form of Rap1 that partitioned in the detergent-rich phase of Triton X-114; moreover, the electrophoretic mobility of cytosolic Rap and Ras proteins was the same as for the membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 2 A). In addition, we investigated the effects of PDEδ overexpression on the kinetics of Ha-Ras processing in a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 3). As expected, newly synthesized Ha-Ras protein was hydrophilic, and by 3 h of chase the vast majority of the protein was processed; overexpression of PDEδ did not alter in any significant way the extent or kinetics of Ha-Ras processing. We next investigated whether PDEδ might play a role in the trafficking process that leads newly synthesized cytosolic Ras proteins to their final destination, the plasma membrane, by following the subcellular localization of ectopically expressed GFP-Ras fusion proteins; to this end, we used full-length N- and K-Ras(4B) proteins (GFP-NRas and GFP-Kras, respectively), as well as the COOH-terminal region of Ha-Ras fused to the COOH terminus of GFP (GFP-HRasCt). As described previously (8.Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R.

At this step, Ras proteins have undergone farnesylation, proteolytic removal of the three COOH-terminal residues, and carboxymethylation of the COOH-terminal farnesylcysteine (8.Choy E. Chiu V.K.

After 13 h of expression, GFP-Ras proteins still labeled endomembrane compartments, and staining of the plasma membrane became clearly visible in control cells (Fig. 4,b, f, and j).

Recent evidence indicates that plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs) participate in the control of local Ca2+ fluxes, but the mechanism of multiprotein complex formation of specific PMCAs is poorly understood. Using the PMCA2b COOH-terminal tail as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the PSD-95, Dlg,ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing Na+/H+exchanger regulatory factor-2 (NHERF2) as an interacting partner. Protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments using recombinant PMCA2b and PMCA4b as well as NHERF1 and NHERF2 showed that the interaction of PMCA2b with NHERF2 was specific and selective. PMCA4b did not interact with either of the NHERFs, and PMCA2b selectively preferred NHERF2 over NHERF1. Green fluorescent protein-tagged PMCA2b was expressed at the apical membrane in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, where it colocalized with apically targeted NHERF2. Our study identifies NHERF2 as the first specific PDZ partner for PMCA2b not shared with PMCA4b, and demonstrates that PMCA splice forms differing only minimally in their COOH-terminal residues interact with unique PDZ proteins. NHERFs have been implicated in the targeting, retention and regulation of membrane proteins including the β2-adrenergic receptor, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and Trp4 Ca2+channel, and NHERF2 is now shown to also interact with PMCA2b.

Whereas substantial progress has been made over the last several years in elucidating the molecular properties, regulation, and membrane targeting of calcium channels (6Blackstone C. Sheng M. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), our knowledge concerning the spatial organization of Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms is still limited. Plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and Ca2+ATPases are the main systems for Ca2+ removal from the cell. Although their molecular characterization has advanced rapidly over the last few years (reviewed in Refs. 7Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 8Carafoli E. Brini M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Strehler E.E.

The plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs) are essential for the maintenance of low resting-state [Ca2+]i but may also be involved in dynamic events such as the regulation of Ca2+ spikes and local Ca2+ signaling (reviewed in Refs. 10Monteith G.R. Roufogalis B.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr.

Four nonallelic genes code for the mammalian PMCAs 1, 2, 3, and 4, with additional isoform diversity arising from alternative mRNA splicing (9Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The four PMCAs are very similar in their predicted overall tertiary structure, but there are substantial differences in their regulation by kinases, proteases, and the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (8Carafoli E. Brini M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In addition, the major PMCA variants “a” and “b” generated by alternative splicing differ markedly in their regulatory properties, e.g. their calmodulin sensitivity (11Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. Bittar E.E. Ion Pumps. 23B. JAI Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1998: 249-274Google Scholar). The alternative splice affects the protein sequence after the last transmembrane span and creates different COOH-terminal tails for the a and b variants because of a change in the translational reading frame. The last few residues of all PMCA b splice variants are highly conserved, and the final four residues match the minimal consensus sequence (E-(T/S)-X-(V/L)*, whereX stands for any amino acid and the asterisk indicates the COOH-terminal residue) of protein ligands for type I PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) domains (15Kim E.

PDZ protein-protein interaction domains are present in a growing list of proteins such as the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like proteins (MAGUKs) and various other scaffolding and signaling proteins (16Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Ponting C.P.

Springer Verlag, Berlin1998: 209-233Google Scholar). Indeed, we previously showed that PMCA4b interacts with high affinity with the PDZ domains of several MAGUKs, and that this interaction is dependent on the presence of the E-T-S-V* COOH-terminal sequence (15Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1591-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). More recently, we found that PMCA4b as well as PMCA2b (which ends with the COOH-terminal sequence E-T-S-L*) bind promiscuously to several synapse-associated protein members of the MAGUK family, but that there is also selectivity in the interaction of PMCA2b versus PMCA4b toward some synapse-associated proteins (19DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because PDZ domain-containing proteins are often multimodular, they display a diverse array of functions, acting as signaling protein scaffolds (20Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 21Tsunoda S. Zuker C.S. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and cytoskeletal anchoring proteins (22Sheng M. Pak D.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 755-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and playing roles in targeting and retention of transmembrane proteins (23Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For any given PDZ domain containing protein, it is difficult to predict the specific target(s) of its individual domains. On the other hand, even conservative changes in the PDZ interaction domain of the ligand proteins can greatly influence target recognition by the PDZ domain. Because the PMCA b splice forms carry COOH-terminal sequences that can bind to PDZ domains, yet PMCA2b differs from PMCA4b in its COOH-terminal residue (Leu versus Val), it may well be that these two isoforms of the PMCA recognize different subsets of PDZ proteins. Here, we used the COOH-terminal sequence of PMCA2b as bait in a two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library and isolated two identical clones coding for the COOH-terminal half of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2), including its second PDZ domain. The interaction is specific for PMCA2b, as PMCA4b does not interact appreciably with NHERF2. Similarly, PMCA2b prefers NHERF2 as a binding partner, as the related NHERF1 binds with much lower affinity. We further show that NHERF2 and a GFP-tagged PMCA2b colocalize at the apical domain in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. These results suggest a new mechanism of PMCA regulation, specifically of PMCA2b, through a PDZ domain interaction with NHERF2. Codons for the final 72 or 71 amino acids of human PMCA2b and PMCA4b, respectively, were cloned asEcoRI-BamHI fragments into pAS2–1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to produce the DNA binding fusions (pDB-CT2b and pDB-CT4b) for yeast two-hybrid screens and assays. The same codons were inserted into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to produce GST fusions (GST-2b and GST-4b). Plasmids pMM2-PMCA4b and pMM2-PMCA2b for expression of full-length human PMCA4b and PMCA2b in mammalian cells have been described previously (19DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Adamo H.P. Verma A.K. Sanders M.A. Heim R. Salisbury J.L. Wieben E.D. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To produce the GFP-PMCA2b plasmid, the coding sequence of hPMCA2b from Met-4 to the COOH-terminal Leu-1212 was amplified with Expand High FidelityTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and using pMM2-PMCA2b as template. The primers for amplification contained HindIII restriction sites, and the entire amplified product was inserted as aHindIII/HindIII fragment into the pEGFP-C1 expression vector (CLONTECH) containing additional HA and His6 tags (25Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing in the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. Mammalian expression constructs for HA-tagged NHERF1 and NHERF2 were kind gifts from Drs. Robert Lefkowitz and Randy Hall (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University (Durham, NC) and Emory University (Atlanta, GA)) and have been described (26Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 27Hall R.A.

Codons for amino acids 259–312 of human NHERF2 were amplified with the following primers: forward: 5′-ggatcc acc agc cct gcc cag ctc aat-3′; reverse: 5′-tca agc ctt ctc ctt ggc ctc ggc cgc-3′ (underlined nucleotides indicate an artificially introduced BamHI site in the forward primer, and an introduced stop codon in the reverse primer). The amplified product was cloned into the TOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and, after sequencing, released as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment and ligated into the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) with bait plasmid pDB-CT2b was performed according to the instructions for the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 2 (CLONTECH) and as described (19DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 106 independent cDNA clones were screened, and initial positives were selected after 7 days of growth of the transformed yeast (strain CG1945) on SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His agar plates containing 5 mm3-aminotriazole (Sigma). Plasmid inserts from positive yeast clones were rescued after picking 3-day-old yeast colonies into TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.25 units/μl lyticase (Sigma). Following 30 min at 37 °C, the yeast were subjected to one round of freeze-thaw followed by alkaline lysis and phenol/chloroform extraction (28Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The aqueous fraction was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3, and 0.7 volume of isopropanol; the nucleic acid pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. One percent of the dissolved DNA was used as template for PCR with pACT2-specific primers (Matchmaker AD Screening Amplimers, CLONTECH). The PCR product was either sequenced directly using Matchmaker 5′ AD Screening Amplimer (CLONTECH), or library plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α by electroporation, and sequenced with the same primer following bacterial plasmid preparation (Qiagen). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed as described (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar) in E. coliBL21(DE3) upon induction with 0.7 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) plus protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm EDTA) and 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by the addition of sarkosyl (Curtis-Matheson Scientific, Houston, TX) to a final concentration of 1.5%. After 15 min on ice, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and supplemented by the addition of Triton X-100 to 2%. This lysate was then bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed with TBST (TBS + 0.1% Tween) and TBS. The quantity of bound fusion protein was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels of known amounts of fusion protein-containing glutathione-Sepharose beads. For pull-down assays, all fusion proteins were adjusted to ∼0.5 mg/ml. A GST fusion protein including amino acids 259–312 from human NHERF2 (see Fig.1 C) was expressed and purified as described above. The GST fusion protein was eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies at Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). After exsanguination, rabbit sera were heat-inactivated and anti-GST antibodies were removed by three rounds of affinity chromatography on GST-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Anti-NHERF2 antibodies (Ab720) in the GST-Sepharose flow-through were then purified using a GST-NHERF2 fusion protein affinity column following established procedures (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The following antibodies were obtained from the indicated source and used at the indicated dilution for immunoblotting: Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-NHERF2 antibody (Ab720, see above) was used at 0.5 μg/ml; anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5) was from Roche and was used at 0.5 μg/ml; polyclonal anti-PMCA2 (affinity-purified and concentrated antibody NR2) and monoclonal anti-PMCA4 antibody JA3 were obtained from Dr. John Penniston and Aida Filoteo (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and used at a dilution of 1:5000 and 1:600, respectively. Secondary goat-anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma and used at 1:5000 dilution. COS-1 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence on six-well plates (Costar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (all cell culture reagents from Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with 2 μg of total DNA using LipofectAMINE™ according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). After ∼48 h, the cells were rinsed, lysed, and the lysates collected as described (19DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21594-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of lysate from COS-1 cells expressing HA-NHERF1 or HA-NHERF2 (expressed at equivalent levels) were incubated with Sepharose-bound GST, GST-2b, or GST-4b. Beads and lysate were rocked for 90 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed four times in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl plus 1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted with 1.5× SDS sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose following standard Western blotting procedures (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in TBST + 5% milk before detection of HA-NHERF1 and HA-NHERF2 using anti-HA antibodies. COS-1 cells were grown on 35-mm dishes (Costar) and transfected as described above except that 4 μg of total DNA were used for each transfection. After ∼48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed as described above. An aliquot (30 μl) of the total lysate (300 μl) was set aside as “input,” and the remainder was used for immunoprecipitation by adding 2–3 μl of antibody (anti-PMCA monoclonal 5F10 (a gift from Dr. John Penniston and Aida Filoteo) or anti-GST polyclonal antibody (obtained during the first step of the purification of anti-NHERF2 antibodies, see above)). After 4 h of rocking at 4 °C, 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Sigma) was added to each mixture and rocking continued overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose was pelleted at 4000 × gfor 30 s and quickly washed twice in cold TBST. Bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). All of the bound protein and 10% of the starting lysate (input) were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose for Western blotting as described above. Type I MDCK epithelial cells (ATCC no. CCL-34, Manassas, VA) were grown to confluence on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture. Cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of GFP-PMCA2b and HA-NHERF2 plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis, Rockville, MD) diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline + Ca2+/Mg2+ (DPBS+CM, Invitrogen). After five brief washes in DPBS+CM, coverslips were further fixed and permeabilized in pre-chilled methanol for 15 min at −20 °C. The cells were blocked in DPBS+CM containing 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer), and were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with affinity-purified anti-PMCA2 antibody NR2 (0.8 μg/ml) or anti-NHERF2 antibody Ab720 (0.5 μg/ml). After washing three times for 5 min each time in DPBS+CM, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:800. All antibodies for immunofluorescence were diluted in blocking buffer. After final washing, coverslips were mounted in Prolong mounting media (Molecular Probes). Confocal micrographs were taken on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope using an Apochromat 63× objective, and captured using LSM510 software (Zeiss). Images were imported and edited using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. MDCK cells were grown as a monolayer on glass coverslips. After transfection with GFP-PMCA2b plasmid DNA as above, cells were washed three times in cold DPBS+CM and kept on ice. Cells were incubated twice for 20 min in 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in triethanolamine, pH 8.6, 150 mm NaCl. After surface labeling, cells were washed with DPBS+CM, and excess biotin was quenched for 15 min on ice in DPBS+CM containing 100 mmglycine. For fluorescent images, the cells were fixed for 20 min in methanol at −20 °C. After extensive washing in DPBS+CM, coverslips were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (see above) and biotin label was detected with 3 μg/ml avidin-Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer. Even conservative amino acid substitutions in the PDZ domain binding motif of a protein can strongly influence its PDZ domain selectivity (30Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M.

A sequence alignment of the extreme COOH termini of the PMCA b splice forms suggested that PMCA1b, 2b, and 3b would bind the same PDZ domains (Fig.1 A), whereas PMCA4b might show a somewhat different PDZ domain preference. To identify proteins that interact with the COOH-terminal sequence of PMCA1b/2b/3b, we therefore used a protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to the final 72 amino acids of hPMCA2b (Fig. 1 B) as a “representative” bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library. Approximately 30 HIS3- and β-galactosidase-positive clones were obtained from a screen of ∼5 × 106 clones, and after exclusion of false positives, sequencing of the cDNA inserts revealed that five clones specified proteins containing at least one PDZ domain. Of these, two strong interactors (as determined by β-galactosidase assay; data not shown) encoded the second PDZ domain and carboxyl-terminal tail of NHERF2 (Fig. 1 C). NHERF2 belongs to a subfamily of type 1 PDZ domain proteins, comprising NHERF1 (also called EBP50) and NHERF2 (also called E3KARP, TKA-1, and SIP-1), which share ∼52% sequence identity (33Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 34Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J.

A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that the PDZ domains of both NHERF1 and NHERF2 recognize D-(S/T)-X-L motifs (whereX stands for any amino acid) at the COOH terminus of target proteins (27Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 36Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Birrane G. Webster G. Ladias J.A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PMCA 1b, 2b, and 3b all contain the sequence E-T-S-L at their COOH termini, whereas PMCA4b ends with E-T-S-V. We wondered whether such a conservative amino acid substitution could affect the PMCA-NHERF2 interaction. We used GST fusion proteins in “pull-down” experiments to confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, and to test the specificity of the interaction. Eukaryotic expression vectors for HA-tagged NHERF1 and NHERF2 were transfected into COS-1 cells, and the resulting lysate from these cells was presented to GST fusion proteins of PMCA2b (CT2b) and PMCA4b (CT4b) (Fig. 1 B) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Interestingly, only CT2b and NHERF2 demonstrated a significant interaction (Fig.2 B). By contrast, we saw little binding of NHERF1 to CT2b (Fig. 2 A), and essentially no interaction of NHERF1 or NHERF2 with CT4b even though equal amounts of starting material were used in all experiments (Fig.2 C). To test the ability and selectivity of full-length PMCA2b to bind NHERF2 when expressed in a cellular environment, we transiently cotransfected COS-1 cells with plasmid constructs encoding HA-NHERF1 or HA-NHERF2 and full-length human PMCA2b or full-length human PMCA4b. In agreement with the pull-down assays, NHERF2 was only coprecipitated by anti-PMCA antibodies when coexpressed with full-length PMCA2b (Fig.3 B). By contrast, NHERF1 did not coprecipitate to any significant extent with PMCA2b (Fig.3 A), nor did either of the NHERFs co-precipitate with PMCA4b in these assays (Fig. 3). These results confirm that NHERF2 selectively interacts with the intact PMCA2b (but not PMCA4b) in a cellular environment, whereas the related NHERF1 interacts only weakly, if at all, with these PMCAs. PMCA2 has recently been reported to be present in the apical plasma membrane of some specialized epithelial cells (e.g. in the lactating mammary gland (Ref. 37Reinhardt T.A. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Horst R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1595-C1602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and in hair cells of the inner ear (38Street V.A. McKee-Johnson J.W. Fonseca R.C. Tempel B.L. Noben-Trauth K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 39Dumont R.A. Lins U. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Kachar B. Gillespie P.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5066-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because PMCA2 is not abundantly expressed outside of the nervous system, we expressed recombinant GFP-tagged PMCA2b (GFP2b) in a monolayer of polarized MDCK cells. GFP2b was detected in the apical membrane domain in these cells (Fig. 4 A), which was confirmed by nonspecifically biotinylating the apical side of a GFP2b-transfected MDCK cell monolayer. In this assay, apical membrane proteins were identified using a fluorescent avidin conjugate and the cells were imaged in the x-z plane to differentiate apical from basolateral staining. Nearly all of the GFP2b fluorescence overlapped with the biotin-avidin label, indicating that the recombinant GFP-PMCA2b fusion protein does in fact target apically in these cells (Fig. 4 B). Cotransfections with recombinant NHERF2 demonstrated that both proteins are found in the apical domain of MDCK cells (Fig. 4 C). The apical localization of NHERF2 is consistent with previous reports on the membrane localization of NHERF1/2 in apical microvilli of kidney, intestinal, and airway epithelial cells (34Reczek D.

Our results demonstrate that IL-13Rα2 is largely an intracellular molecule, which is rapidly mobilized from intracellular stores following treatment with interferon (IFN)-γ. Up-regulation of IL-13Rα2 surface expression in response to IFN-γ was rapid, did not require protein synthesis, and resulted in diminished IL-13 signaling.

Genomics. 1997; 42: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). IL-13Rα1 binds IL-13 with low affinity by itself, but, when paired with IL-4Rα, it binds IL-13 with high affinity and forms a functional IL-13 receptor which signals (12Miloux B. Laurent P. Bonnin O. Lupker J. Caput D. Vita N. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In cells lacking the common γ chain, this receptor complex also serves as an alternative receptor for IL-4. Consistent with the fact that IL-4 and IL-13 share common subunits, they also share common signaling pathways. Studies in Stat6-deficient mice have revealed that IL-13 signaling utilizes the JAK-Stat pathway and specifically Stat6 (15Takeda K. Kamanaka M. Tanaka T. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3220-3222PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Signaling through IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 is thought to occur via IL-4Rα, because both IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation of the complex results in activation of signaling intermediates characteristic of IL-4 responses, including phosphorylation of IL-4Rα, insulin-receptor substrate-2, JAK1, and Tyk2 (2Wills-Karp M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 17Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12286-12296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, the precise roles of IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 in IL-13 signaling and responses are not clear. Expression of IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα together is sufficient to render cells responsive to IL-13, although both subunits must be derived from the same species (18Andrews R.P. Rosa L.R. Daines M.O. Khurana Hershey G.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-13Rα2 is not required for IL-13 function. Expression of IL-13Rα2 in vitro was insufficient to render cells responsive to IL-13, despite the presence of IL-4Rα (19Donaldson D.D. Whitters M.J. Fitz L.J. Yee Neben T.Y. Finnerty H. Henderson S.L. O'Hara J.R.M. Beier D.R. Turner K.J. Wood C.R. Collins M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2317-2324PubMed Google Scholar). IL-13Rα2 has a short cytoplasmic tail (17 amino acids in the human), which contains no box 1 or box 2 signaling motifs, supporting that it has no signaling function. The inability of IL-13Rα2 expression to confer IL-13 responsiveness despite high affinity binding, along with the finding of soluble IL-13Rα2 in vivo (13Zhang J. Hilton D.J. Willson T.A. McFarlane C. Roberts B.A. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9474-9480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), has led to the speculation that IL-13Rα2 acts as a decoy receptor. IL-13Rα2 transcripts have been found in the spleen, liver, lung, thymus, and brain (14Guo J. Apiou F. Mellerin M. Lebeau B. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. Genomics. 1997; 42: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Donaldson D.D. Whitters M.J. Fitz L.J. Yee Neben T.Y. Finnerty H. Henderson S.L. O'Hara J.R.M. Beier D.R. Turner K.J. Wood C.R. Collins M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2317-2324PubMed Google Scholar); however, very little is known about its expression or regulation. IL-13 receptors are expressed on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle; however, functional IL-13 receptors have not been demonstrated on human or mouse T cells. Thus, unlike IL-4, IL-13 does not appear to be important in the initial differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th2 type cells, but rather appears to be important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation. This is further supported by many observations in vivo, including the following; administration of IL-13 resulted in allergic inflammation (7Grunig G. Warnock M. Wakil A.E. Venkayya R. Brombacher F.

Invest. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), IL-13 blockade abolished allergic inflammation independently of IL-4 (7Grunig G. Warnock M. Wakil A.E. Venkayya R.

Mattes J. Foster P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Given the importance of IL-13 as an effector molecule, regulation of the expression level of it receptors at the cell surface may be an important mechanism of modulating IL-13 responses. In this report, we examine the cellular localization of IL-13Rα2 and investigate the regulation of its surface expression. U937 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD). A549 cells, a gift from Dr. James Stark (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whittaker) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human nasal epithelial cells were obtained as described previously (22Black H.R. Yankaskas J.R. Johnson L.G. Noah T.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells harvested from normal human volunteers by gently scraping the inferior nasal turbinate with a sterile cytobrush. The material collected was treated with Sputolysin (Caldon Biotech, Carlsbad, CA) for 5 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 600 ×g, resuspended in bronchial epithelial growth medium (Bio-Whittaker), and transferred to collagen-coated tissue culture flasks. Once grown to 80–90% confluence, cells were liberated from the flasks with trypsin and passed to additional flasks or coverslips for confocal microscopy. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), ATP (Sigma-Aldrich), or human interferon γ, a gift from Dr. Thomas Shanley (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). Elutriated human monocytes, prepared as described previously (23Karp C.L. Wysocka M. Wahl L.M. Ahearn J.M. Cuomo P.J. Sherry B. Trinchieri G. Griffin D.E. Science. 1996; 273: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Karp (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. U937 cells were washed with cold PBS with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-human IL-13Rα2 monoclonal antibody (Diaclone, Besançon Cedex, France) or a FITC-conjugated murine IgG1 isotype control (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). A549 and primary human nasal epithelial cells were liberated from their flasks using Versene (Invitrogen), washed in cold PBS with 1% FBS, and then stained for IL-13Rα2. To assess intracellular IL-13Rα2, cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% FBS and 0.2% saponin. Saponin (0.2%) was also added to the antibody and wash solutions. Following the final wash, cells were resuspended in PBS with 1% FBS and analyzed in a FACScan or FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For the cycloheximide treatment of U937 cells, U937 cells were cultured overnight (18 h) in the presence and absence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide in RPMI with 5% FBS. Under these conditions, greater than 85% of protein synthesis was inhibited by [35S]methionine incorporation and over 85% viability is maintained at 48 h by trypan blue exclusion. IFN-γ was then added to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml for the indicated times. Cells were then washed and stained for surface expression of IL-13Rα2 as described above. U937 cells in culture or human nasal epithelia cells or A549 cells grown on tissue culture-coated coverslips were washed in cold PBS with 1% FBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-human IL-13Rα2 antibody or the FITC-conjugated isotype matched control in a solution containing PBS, 1% FBS, and 3% cold fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich). In the case of permeabilized cells, 0.2% saponin was added to the antibody solution and to all subsequent washes. After the final wash, the U937 cells were resuspended in a minimal volume of Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), placed on a slide, covered with a coverslip, and the edges sealed with nail polish. Alternatively, the cells on coverslips were inverted onto a slide with a small drop of Vectashield and the edges sealed with nail polish. Cells were observed on a Leica DM IRBC confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). EMSA analyses were performed as previously described (18Andrews R.P. Rosa L.R. Daines M.O. Khurana Hershey G.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Andrews R.P. Burrell L. Rosa-Rosa L. Cunningham C.M. Brzezinski J.L. Bernstein J.A. Khurana Hershey G.K. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 100: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel for 100 min. Bands were visualized by autoradiography, and densitometry performed to quantify the Stat6 activity in the samples. IL-13 treatment of U937 cells results in rapid Stat6 activation and increased CD23 expression (data not shown); thus, U937 cells express functional IL-13 receptors. Although it is known that a functional IL-13 complex requires both IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1, the function of the IL-13Rα2 is not well understood. We investigated whether U937 cells expressed IL-13Rα2 and determined the relative amount of IL-13Rα2 on the cell surface relative to the intracellular compartment. Intact and permeabilized U937 cells were stained with antibodies specific for IL-13Rα2 and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig.1 A). Intact cells expressed modest levels of IL-13Rα2. Strikingly, staining of permeabilized cells was nearly 20 times more intense than the intact cells (Fig.1 B), demonstrating that IL-13Rα2 is a predominantly intracellular rather than a membrane protein in U937 cells. To further investigate the cellular location of IL-13Rα2, confocal microscopy was performed on intact or permeabilized U937 cells (Fig.1 C). Intact cells demonstrated rim staining with the IL-13Rα2 antibody consistent with a low level of surface expression. In contrast, permeabilized cells showed bright intracellular staining, confirming the predominant intracellular location of IL-13Rα2. There was no significant staining with the isotype control in intact or permeabilized cells. Having established that IL-13Rα2 is present mostly intracellularly in U937, we next wanted to determine whether this intracellular pool or receptors could be mobilized to the surface. IL-13 has been shown to modulate the IL-13Rα1 expression in several cell types (25Graber P. Gretener D. Herren S. Aubry J.P. Elson G. Poudrier J. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Alouani S. Losberger C. Bonnefoy J.Y. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Gauchat J.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4286-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), so we first examined whether IL-13 had similar effects on IL-13Rα2 expression. However, IL-13 did not modulate IL-13Rα2 expression in U937 or A549 cells (data not shown). We next examined whether nonspecific activation of cells with PMA would alter IL-13Rα2 expression. As shown in Fig.2 A, PMA treatment of U937 cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase in IL-13Rα2 surface expression. IFN-γ acts as a counter-regulator of IL-13 in many systems and down-regulates IL-13 responses (26Li Y. Simons F.E. HayGlass K.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 7007-7014PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dickensheets H.L. Donnelly R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6226-6233PubMed Google Scholar), although the mechanism for this modulation is not well understood. One possible mechanism is that IFN-γ modulates IL-13 receptor expression. If IL-13Rα2 is a decoy receptor as has been postulated, then we reasoned that IFN-γ may up-regulate this receptor to counteract the IL-13 response. IFN-γ treatment of U937 cells resulted in increased surface expression of IL-13Rα2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 B). Maximal up-regulation following stimulation with IFN-γ was seen with physiologic doses of 20 ng/ml. Thus, IFN-γ stimulation leads to up-regulation of surface IL-13Rα2 in U937 cells. We next examined the kinetics of IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of surface IL-13Rα2 (Fig.2 C). IFN-γ treatment resulted in a rapid increase in the surface expression of IL-13Rα2. The increase was detectable at 4 h and reached maximum levels at 24 h. Longer incubation periods revealed that IL-13Rα2 surface expression returned to near base-line levels after ∼8 days (data not shown). There was interexperimental variation noted in the magnitude of enhanced IL-13Rα2 surface expression induced by IFN-γ with a range of 60–250% maximal increase in IL-13Rα2 surface expression. We investigated whether IFN-γ-dependent IL-13Rα2 cell surface trafficking was accelerated by stimulating rapid calcium-dependent exocytic mechanisms in U937 cells. Cells were treated with ATP, a known agonist for G-protein-coupled calcium mobilization on U937 cells (28Maudsley D.J. Morris A.G. Immunology. 1987; 61: 189-194PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. Treatment with ATP had no effect on the kinetics or magnitude of IL-13Rα2 mobilization (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with a calcium ionophore (data not shown). Although the IFN-γ effect on IL-13Rα2 surface expression was rapid, it remained possible that the observed IFN-γ-dependent increase in IL-13Rα2 surface expression was not because of mobilization of preformed molecules in intracellular compartments, but rather because of novel protein synthesis. To address this, we utilized the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Cycloheximide had no effect on the magnitude (Fig. 4 A) or kinetics (Fig.4 B) of IFN-γ-dependent up-regulation of surface IL-13Rα2. Thus, IFN-γ results in mobilization of preformed IL-13Rα2 molecules and does not require protein synthesis. We next examined what effect IL-13Rα2 trafficking to the cell surface had on IL-13 signaling. Cells were treated with IFN-γ for 24 h to achieve maximum cell surface trafficking of IL-13Rα2, and then cells were stimulated with IL-13 for 20 min and assayed for Stat6 activation (Fig. 5). Cells pre-treated with IFN-γ displayed markedly diminished Stat6 activation and decreased sensitivity to IL-13 when compared with IL-13-treated cells that had not received IFN-γ. Thus, increased surface IL-13Rα2 expression correlates with decreased magnitude and sensitivity of IL-13 signaling. We next investigated whether the predominance of IL-13Rα2 in intracellular compartments was unique to the U937 cell line by investigating the cellular localization of IL-13Rα2 in another cell line, A549. IL-13 has been shown to have effects on epithelial cells (2Wills-Karp M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 29Doucet C. Brouty-Boye D. Pottin-Clemenceau C. Canonica G.W. Jasmin C. Azzarone B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and, in atopic disease, epithelial cells are the target of some its critical effector functions, such as up-regulation of chemokine expression (30Li L. Nguyen A. Hon Lai Y. Feng L. Mosmann T. Lo D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2477-2487PubMed Google Scholar). A549 cells are derived from human bronchial epithelium. We investigated the relative amount of IL-13Rα2 on the cell surface relative to the intracellular compartment (Fig.6 A). Staining of permeabilized cells was ∼8-fold more intense compared with intact cells, demonstrating that the receptor is a predominantly intracellular rather than cell surface protein in A549 cells, similar to our findings in U937 cells. Confocal microscopy of intact or permeabilized A549 confirmed its localization in intracellular compartments (Fig.6 C). The intact cells demonstrated no significant staining in response to either the IL-13Rα2 antibody or its isotype-matched control, consistent with the low surface expression detected by flow cytometry. In contrast, permeabilized cells showed bright intracellular staining with the IL-13Rα2 antibody, but no significant staining with the isotype control. Because both U937 and A549 cells are immortalized cell lines, it remained a possibility that our observations demonstrating that IL-13Rα2 is a largely intracellular molecule were peculiar to immortalized cell lines. To directly address this, we examined primary human nasal epithelial cells for the presence of IL-13Rα2 by confocal microscopy (Fig. 6). The results were identical to those observed in A549 and U937 cells. Intact human nasal epithelial cells demonstrated no significant staining for IL-13Rα2. However, permeabilized primary human nasal epithelial cells revealed bright intracellular staining. No significant staining was seen with the isotype control. We next wanted to examine whether IFN-γ treatment resulted in cell surface trafficking of IL-13Rα2 receptors in primary cells. For these studies we chose human monocytes because we had seen an effect in U937 monocytic cells. We obtained fresh elutriated primary monocytes and stained permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells for IL-13Rα2 expression following treatment with media alone or media containing IFN-γ (Fig. 7 A). Primary monocytes contained a large intracellular pool of IL-13Rα2 and IFN-γ up-regulated IL-13Rα2 on the surface of these cells. Although U937 cells subjected to IFN-γ stimulation demonstrated approximately a 2-fold increase in surface IL-13Rα2 in response to IFN-γ, the primary human monocytes showed a nearly 6-fold induction in surface expression (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, there was no significant change in IL-13Rα2 staining in the permeabilized cells treated with IFN-γ. This supports that IFN-γ mobilizes the intracellular pool of IL-13Rα2 because further up-regulation was not observed in cells stained for both the surface and intracellular fractions by permeabilization. This demonstrates that the IFN-γ induced up-regulation of IL-13Rα2 observed in U937 cells also occurs in primary human cells. Furthermore, in primary cells, the magnitude of receptor up-regulation is much greater than in immortalized cell lines, further highlighting its biologic relevance. In this report, we provide the first evidence that the IL-13Rα2 is predominantly an intracellular molecule and that IFN-γ leads to increased surface expression of IL-13Rα2 by mobilization of preformed IL-13Rα2. Furthermore, this observed IFN-γ-dependent up-regulation of IL-13Rα2 was associated with diminished IL-13 signaling supporting the hypothesis that IL-13Rα2 acts as a decoy receptor that can regulate IL-13 responses. This represents a novel mechanism by which IFN-γ can regulate IL-13 responses. Large pools of IL-13Rα2 were found intracellularly in cultured monocytes, respiratory epithelial cells, primary respiratory epithelium, and primary human monocytes, supporting that this observation is not restricted to a given cell type, but rather appears to be widespread. In primary monocytes, IFN-γ resulted in a 6-fold increase in surface IL-13Rα2 expression. Although confocal microscopy is not sufficient to determine the subcellular localization of the intracellular IL-13Rα2, it is interesting to note that, in the primary human nasal epithelial cells, along with the diffuse cytoplasmic staining, there was some bright localized staining that may represent distinct vesicles containing IL-13Rα2. Further studies are under way to address this possibility. The inability of IL-13Rα2 expression to confer IL-13 responsiveness despite high affinity binding, along with the finding of soluble IL-13Rα2 in vivo (13Zhang J. Hilton D.J. Willson T.A. McFarlane C. Roberts B.A. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9474-9480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), has led to the hypothesis that IL-13Rα2 acts as a decoy receptor, and our data support this. Modulation of IL-13Rα2 expression would allow a mechanism for fine-tuning of IL-13 responses. Analogous observations have been made in the IL-1 receptor system. IL-1 has two cognate receptors, IL-1R and IL-1RII (31Martin M.U. Falk W. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 5-17PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1R binds IL-1 and results in a functional signal. In contrast, IL-1RII has a short cytoplasmic domain of only 29 amino acids and has no signaling role (32Colotta F. Re F. Muzio M. Bertini R. Polentarutti N. Sironi M. Giri J.G. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Mantovani A. Science. 1993; 261: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IL-1RII on cell surfaces was shown to impair IL-1 responses (33Bossu P. Visconti U. Ruggiero P. Macchia G. Muda M. Bertini R. Bizzarri C. Colagrande A. Sabbatini V. Maurizi G. Del Grosso E. Tagliabne A. Boraschi D. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1852-1861PubMed Google Scholar, 34Re F. Mengozzi M. Muzio M. Dinarello C.A. Mantovani A. Colotta F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-13 has been shown to modulate the expression of the IL-1RII decoy receptor (35Colotta F. Re F. Muzio M. Polentarutti N. Minty A. Caput D. Ferrara P. Mantovani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12403-12406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another receptor system, which utilizes a decoy receptor, is the T lymphocyte receptors for CD80 and CD86, CD28 and CTLA-4. CTLA-4 is an important negative regulator of T cell activation. It is not required for ligand induced cellular activation, but acts as a decoy receptor for the B7 molecules. CTLA-4 exists in intracellular pools, which are rapidly mobilized upon activation resulting in an ∼100% increase over baseline surface staining for CTLA-4 (36Linsley P.S. Bradshaw J. Greene J. Peach R. Bennett K.L. Mittler R.S. Immunity. 1996; 4: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This magnitude of change in the surface expression of a decoy receptor was sufficient to alter cellular responsiveness. In our experiments, IL-13Rα2 surface expression was increased by IFN-γ treatment of cells. The effect was evident within hours and did not require protein synthesis, confirming that it resulted from the mobilization of preformed IL-13Rα2 stores. By confocal microscopy it appeared that there was a large excess of intracellular IL-13Rα2 versuson the cell surface, and permeabilized U937 cells had nearly 20-fold more IL-13Rα2 staining compared with intact cells by flow cytometry. However, the magnitude of IL-13Rα2 mobilization by IFN-γ resulted in only a 60–250% increase over the basal level in U937 cells. Although this approximates the changes seen in other systems, such as CTLA-4, it appears that the mobilization of IL-13Rα2 represents a small portion of the total available intracellular IL-13Rα2 in some cells. In contrast, in primary monocytes, IFN-γ treatment resulted in a nearly 6-fold induction in surface expression. This appeared to represent the majority (approximately two-thirds) of the intracellular IL-13Rα2 pool because increased staining was not noted in the permeabilized IFN-γ-treated cells relative to the IFN-γ-treated non-permeabilized cells. These differences may represent cellular differences between primary and immortalized cells. In addition, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry are different readouts, and the data obtained by these two different methods cannot be compared quantitatively. Considerable effort is taking place to understand the biologic role of IL-13, but, thus far, little is known about the regulation of IL-13 responses. IL-13 and IL-4 share many structural and functional characteristics; however, they each have distinct biologic functions. IL-4 directly promotes the differentiation of naive T cells to Th2 cells (37Kopf M. Le Gros G. Bachman M. Lamers M.C. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1993; 362: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 38Le Gros G. Ben-Sasson S.Z. Seder R. Finkelman F.D. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and, thus, plays a well recognized role in Th2 development. In contrast, IL-13 receptors have not been found on T cells (3Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar); consequently, IL-13 does not support the proliferation of mouse or human T cells. In mouse models, specific blockade of IL-13 using a soluble IL-13Rα2 resulted in a reversal of airway hyperresponsiveness (8Wills-Karp M. Luyimbazi J. Xu X. Schofield B. Neben T.Y. Karp C.L. Donaldson D.D. Science. 1998; 282: 2258-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of IL-13 independent of IL-4. Furthermore, overexpression of IL-13 in the lungs of mice resulted in several characteristics of the asthmatic phenotype (20Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that IL-4 is more important for Th2 deviation and the induction of the allergic response, whereas IL-13 may be more important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation (2Wills-Karp M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this case, regulation of IL-4 may be more critical at the transcriptional or production level, whereas regulation of IL-13 may be more important in later phases of the immune response. IFN-γ-dependent up-regulation of IL-13Rα2 and subsequent dampening of IL-13 signaling described herein provide one mechanism for rapid fine-tuning of the IL-13 response during the later phases of the allergic cascade. Alternatively, modulation of IL-13Rα2 expression may provide a mechanism whereby the IL-4 and IL-13 response can be differentially regulated. Because IL-13Rα2 binds IL-13 with high affinity, but it does not bind IL-4, increased expression of IL-13Rα2 would lead to increased binding of available IL-13. Thus, less IL-13 would be available for binding to the functional IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα complex, which could then be available for IL-4 binding. Consequently, modulation of IL-13Rα2 expression would likely regulate both IL-4 and IL-13, and in opposite directions. Differential IL-13Rα2 expression during different phases of the allergic immune response may account for some of the distinct effects of IL-4 and IL-13. The biologic roles of the two known IL-13-binding proteins, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2, are still not clear. IL-13Rα1 is part of the type II IL-4/IL-13 receptor complex that signals via the JAK/Stat pathway. However, it is unclear whether IL-13Rα1 itself has any signaling role, positive or negative. The cytoplasmic domain of IL-13Rα1 has been shown to be required for IL-13 signaling, suggesting that IL-13Rα1 may signal through a distinct pathway (39Orchansky P.L. Kwan R. Lee F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20818-20825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This could provide an alternative mechanism for differential effects between IL-4 and IL-13. IL-13Rα2 has a very short cytoplasmic domain (17 amino acids in the human) with no known signaling motifs, supporting that it has no signaling function. However, this remains to be strictly proven, and it is possible that IL-13Rα2 has a distinct and unique signaling capacity. The generation and characterization of gene-targeted mice for IL-13Rα1 and/or IL-13Rα2 will be critical to understand the roles of these receptors in IL-13 and IL-4 responses.

These docking domains are found in a range of substrates, including the transcription factors myocyte enhancer factor-2A and SAP-1. However, the sequences of these motifs differ, as does their targeting preferences by MAPKs, with SAP-1 being targeted by both the ERK and p38 isoforms, whereas myocyte enhancer factor-2A is targeted only by certain members of the p38 subfamily. Here, we have investigated the specificity determinants within these motifs and generated a model for how specificity is generated. We demonstrate that residues throughout the docking domains play important roles in the recognition process. However, residues located at different positions are important for discriminating between ERK and p38 MAPKs. Furthermore, the docking domains can be further subdivided into submotifs, which are differentially required for phosphorylation by ERK or p38 MAPKs. We have used loss- and gain-of-function mutagenesis to identify residues that discriminate between ERK and p38 MAPKs, residues that act to promote suboptimal interactions, and regions that are differentially required depending on the kinase involved.

Several parallel pathways exist in mammals, with the best studied pathways being the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar and2Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The MAPK pathways are regulated at multiple levels to ensure the fidelity and specificity of their action (reviewed in Ref. 3Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One critical aspect to this regulation is the recognition and subsequent phosphorylation of the correct substrates for the terminal MAPKs. A rapidly emerging paradigm is that a large part of the recognition process involves the binding of MAPKs to docking sites in their substrates (reviewed in Refs. 4Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 5Sharrocks A.D. Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These docking sites act to enhance the efficiency of phosphorylation, but also impart specificity, as each docking site is recognized by only a subset of MAPKs. The docking sites found in transcription factors (referred to here as D-domains) are typically <20 amino acids long and show limited sequence similarity, but are characterized by a region rich in basic amino acids, followed by an LXL motif and/or a triplet of hydrophobic amino acids. In addition, the D-domains are highly portable and in many cases are sufficient to confer signaling specificity on a heterologous protein toward a particular pathway. In the case of the ETS domain proteins Elk-1 and SAP-1, these docking domains specify targeting and substrate phosphorylation by two different classes of MAPKs. A single D-domain is responsible for targeting of two different kinases to Elk-1 and SAP-1. Elk-1 is targeted by the ERK and JNK kinases (6Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 7Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas ERK and p38 kinases are targeted to SAP-1 (8Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, two different D-domains target the JNK and ERK MAPKs to the related protein SAP-2 (9Ducret C. Maira S.M. Lutz Y. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5063-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, the MADS box transcription factor MEF2A is targeted through its D-domain by just one class of MAPK, the p38 kinases p38α and p38β2 (10Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In some substrates, an additional motif known as the FXF motif functionally cooperates with the docking domains to specify phosphorylation by members of the ERK and p38 subfamilies (8Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Fantz D.A. Jacobs D. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Recently, two regions have been identified on the surfaces of MAPKs that act as reciprocal docking sites for several substrates (13Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 14Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Both these regions are centered on negatively charged clusters of residues, named the CD and ED motifs. The first of these motifs (CD) is conserved among all MAPKs, whereas the second (ED) is specific to the p38 subclass and is thought to specify the recognition of the highly basic docking domains found in its substrates. However, it is currently unknown whether one or both of these motifs are important in determining transcription factor substrate recognition. It is currently unclear how specificity is generated in the docking domains for particular subsets of MAPKs. In this study, we have focused on the docking domains found in the transcription factors MEF2A, SAP-1, and Elk-1. The differing responses of these proteins to alternative MAPK cascades and similarities in their docking domain sequences make these ideal model systems. We demonstrate that the docking domains consist of a series of submotifs that are differentially important for phosphorylation by individual MAPKs. Significantly, we identify critical positions within the domains that confer changes in specificity and also the strength of binding and hence phosphorylation efficiency.

PhosphorImager data from kinase assays were quantified either using Tina software (Version 2.08e, Fuji) or Quantity One (Bio-Rad). MEF2A is specifically phosphorylated by a subset of p38 MAPKs and does not represent an ERK target (10Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 21Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V. Kato Y. Di Gram H. Padova F. Olson E. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A docking domain consisting of residues 266–282 in MEF2A has previously been identified and shown to specify substrate phosphorylation by p38α and p38β2. Three sets of double alanine mutations were generated in this domain, and all caused a decrease in the proficiency of MEF2A as a p38α and p38β2 substrate (10Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To investigate the contributions of individual residues within the MEF2A docking domain to targeting by p38 MAPKs, a series of single alanine mutations were introduced at each position in the docking domain (Fig. 1 A). These mutant proteins were first tested as substrates for phosphorylation in vitro by p38α (Fig. 1 B) and p38β2 (Fig.1 C) MAPKs. The effects of individual mutations on phosphorylation by p38α and p38β2 were virtually identical (Fig. 1, compare B and C). None of the mutations caused reductions as severe as deleting the whole docking domain. However, decreases in the proficiency of phosphorylation were apparent at all positions, except Ser268 and Asp272, which exhibited >90% of wild-type levels. Interestingly, the D272A mutant was a consistently better substrate for p38β2 than the wild-type protein. Moderate decreases were observed upon mutations of basic residues toward the N-terminal end of the domain (Arg269 and Lys270), and more severe reductions were observed in two residues in a hydrophobic triplet located toward the C-terminal end of the domain (Val275 and Ile277). Reduced phosphorylation was also observed upon mutation of residues in the intervening region (Leu273 and Arg274). Thus, although both the basic and hydrophobic clusters are important for p38-mediated phosphorylation of MEF2A, other residues are clearly also important. Next, we investigated the functional consequences of introducing mutations into the MEF2A D-domain by testing the response of GAL4 fusions with the MEF2A transcriptional activation domain to activation of the p38β2 pathway in vivo (Fig.2, A and B). Little difference was observed in the expression levels of each of the GAL-MEF2A fusion proteins (Fig. 2 C). In the presence of active p38β2, a 14-fold stimulation of wild-type MEF2A was observed, whereas deletion of the docking domain reduced this stimulation to <3-fold. The effect of individual alanine mutations on p38β2-mediated transcriptional activation closely mirrored that observed in in vitro phosphorylation reactions (compare Figs. 2 B and 1 C). Again, the D272A mutant exhibited enhanced inducibility. The rest of the mutations, including residues from the basic and hydrophobic clusters and the intervening region, resulted in decreases in p38β2-mediated activation. It appears, however, that these mutations are generally more severe in vivo, with inducibility being reduced to around the level of complete D-domain deletion (e.g. Lys270, Leu273, Val275, and Ile277). Consistent with thein vitro data, Val275 and Ile277showed the largest decreases in response to p38β2. Collectively, these data point to residues throughout the MEF2A D-domain as being important for p38 MAPK targeting in vitroand in vivo. Particularly important residues appear to be located within a hydrophobic triplet at the C-terminal end of the domain. SAP-1 is specifically phosphorylated by a subset of p38 MAPKs and, in contrast to MEF2A, also represents an ERK target (8Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A docking domain consisting of residues 316–334 in SAP-1 has previously been identified and shown to specify substrate phosphorylation by ERK2, p38α, and p38β2 (8Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, differences between the docking domains of MEF2A and SAP-1 must determine that MEF2A is not an ERK substrate or confer extra properties on SAP-1 that permit it to be an ERK substrate. To investigate the contributions of individual residues within the SAP-1 docking domain to targeting by p38 and ERK MAPKs, a series of single alanine mutations were introduced at each position in the docking domain (Fig. 3 A). These mutant proteins were then tested as substrates for phosphorylation in vitro by p38β2 (Fig.3 B) and ERK2 (Fig. 3 C) MAPKs. The effects of individual mutations on phosphorylation by p38β2 and ERK2 were very similar (Fig. 3, compare B and C). For example, phosphorylation of mutants of Leu325 and Leu327, which constitute the LXL motif, and Val332 and Ile333 in the hydrophobic region was severely abrogated. Similarly, phosphorylation of the intervening residues Pro329 and Thr330 was severely affected. Moderate effects on phosphorylation by p38β2and ERK2 were observed upon mutation of most of the basic residues. Ser319, Gly324, Gly326, and Thr334 showed consistently low (or zero) decreases in phosphorylation by both kinases. However, there were a couple of key differences observed; in comparison with other basic residues, R318A was more severely affected in response to ERK2 phosphorylation, whereas L331A did not affect phosphorylation by ERK2, but severely affected phosphorylation by p38β2. The latter residue constitutes part of the hydrophobic triplet. In summary, residues throughout the SAP-1 docking domain play important roles in directing phosphorylation by both the p38 and ERK2 MAPKs. Particularly important contributions come from the LXL motif and the hydrophobic triplet. However, a few key residues are clearly more important for attracting p38β2 compared with ERK2. Alignment of the MEF2A and SAP-1 D-domains shows several conserved blocks of residues and recognizable submotifs (Fig.4 A). These include the basic region, LXL motif, and hydrophobic triplet and have been recognized in more extensive alignments of MAPK substrates (5Sharrocks A.D. Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 12Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Here, our mutagenic analysis has demonstrated the importance of these submotifs in differentially directing ERK and p38 MAPKs to MEF2A and SAP-1. A simple model can be derived from our observations for how the docking domains are organized to specify recognition by these MAPKs (Fig. 4 B). In the case of p38α/β2substrates, two types of domains are used that contain both a basic region and a hydrophobic triplet, but that differ in that an intervening LXL motif is either required (as in SAP-1) or dispensable (as in MEF2A). In contrast, ERK substrates appear to require contributions from all three submotifs, although the hydrophobic triplet appears less important. The latter conclusion is supported by our mutagenic studies on SAP-1 (Fig. 3 C) and also by the observation that this region is poorly conserved in the related transcription factor Elk-1 and that double mutations that affect this region in Elk-1 do not affect targeting by ERK2 (6Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 7Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To extend this model, further tests of specificity determinants are required. This is particularly important in substrates like SAP-1, which are phosphorylated by two different kinases, where, in comparison with MEF2A, compensatory mutations in different residues are likely to occur to retain phosphorylation by p38 kinases and to introduce specificity for ERK2. For example, the model predicts that the acquisition of an LXL motif is likely to be one such determinant. Several features of the model can also be tested to validate it. First, it would be predicted that residues could be introduced between the basic and hydrophobic regions of MEF2 without affecting its efficacy as a p38 substrate. Furthermore, it is predicted that, by strengthening the hydrophobic triplet in poor p38 substrates (e.g. Elk-1 and MEF2D), they will become better substrates. It has been previously shown that two acidic regions on the surface of p38 MAPKs likely represent substrate-binding regions (13Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 14Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, by enhancing the basic region in the substrates to promote binding to the acidic regions on the kinases, it is predicted that enhanced binding and substrate phosphorylation should ensue. Alanine scanning mutagenesis indicated that residues throughout the SAP-1 D-domain act to specify phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 3 B). However, this domain is partially conserved in the related transcription factor Elk-1 (Fig.5 A), which does not appear to be targeted by p38 MAPKs (6Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, changes within this docking site likely determine this differential substrate specificity for p38β2. To identify the locations of such determinants, a series of chimeric proteins were made in which either the wild-type D-domains of SAP-1 or Elk-1 or composite D-domains were fused to the transcriptional activation domain of MEF2A (Fig. 5 C,left). The MEF2 domain used (amino acids 283–413) contains the phosphorylation sites of p38, but lacks its natural docking domain. The composite domains contained residues from either the N-terminal (containing the basic and LXL motifs) or the C-terminal (containing the hydrophobic triplet) end of the docking site of each protein. Each of the mutant proteins was subsequently tested as a p38β2 substrate. Initially, we tested phosphorylation of chimeric proteins containing the wild-type D-domains of SAP-1 or Elk-1 by p38β2 over a time course (Fig. 5 B). Phosphorylation of SAPD-MEF2A was readily detectable after 15 min and subsequently increased over a 60-min period (lanes 1–4). In contrast, levels of ElkD-MEF2A phosphorylation were lower at all time points analyzed (lanes 5–8). Thus, differences in the D-domains of SAP-1 and Elk-1 are responsible for dictating differential phosphorylation by p38β2. Next, we compared the phosphorylation of the SAPD-MEF2A and ElkD-MEF2A chimeric proteins with that observed with chimeras containing composite SAP-1 and Elk-1 D-domains (Fig. 5 C). The level of SAPD-MEF2A phosphorylation was ∼50% of that observed with wild-type MEF2A, indicating that, although representing an efficient p38β2docking motif, the SAP-1 D-domain is weaker than the D-domain observed in MEF2A. In contrast, ElkD-MEF2A phosphorylation was reduced to a level similar to that of MEF2AΔD, which lacks a docking site, thereby confirming the absence of p38β2 targeting by the Elk-1 D-domain. The composite D-domains gave rise to intermediate levels of substrate phosphorylation, with ESD-MEF2A showing more phosphorylation by p38β2 than SED-MEF2A. As ESD-MEF2A contains the hydrophobic triplet from SAP-1, this further underscores the importance of this motif in targeting of p38β2. However, the increased phosphorylation of the SED-MEF2A chimera by p38β2 clearly supports a role for the N-terminal half of the SAP-1 docking site in p38β2 targeting. Thus, residues from both the N- and C-terminal ends of the docking domains of SAP-1 and Elk-1 are important in specifying their differential phosphorylation by p38β2. To further probe the roles of the different submotifs in the docking domains of SAP-1 and Elk-1, we analyzed the effect of point mutations in the Elk-1 D-domain in its natural context. In this case, mutations were introduced to alter the Elk-1 D-domain to resemble the analogous domain in SAP-1 in either the LXL motif (Elk-1(D318G/E320G)) or the hydrophobic triplet (Elk-1(G329I)) (Fig.6 A). Mutation of the hydrophobic triplet had little effect on Elk-1 phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 6 B) or ERK2 (Fig. 6 C), indicating that the increases observed in ESD-MEF2A (Fig.5 C) were not solely due to altering this motif. However, in contrast, alterations in the LXL motif led to increases in Elk-1 phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 6 B) and reciprocal decreases in the efficiency of phosphorylation by ERK2 (Fig.6 C). Thus, in Elk-1, the local context of the LXL motif plays a major role in blocking p38β2 targeting while promoting ERK2 targeting. Collectively, our data demonstrate that multiple motifs in the docking domains contribute to the specificity of MAPK targeting to Elk-1 and SAP-1. However, the local context LXL motif has been shown to have an important role in dictating their differential responses to p38β2 and ERK2. In contrast to SAP-1, MEF2A is phosphorylated by p38α/β2, but not ERK2. Alanine scanning indicated that Asp272, located downstream of the basic region, plays an important role in inhibiting phosphorylation by p38β2. Furthermore, the presence of negatively charged residues downstream of the basic region in Elk-1 caused inhibition of its phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 6). Thus, one potential role for amino acids in this position might be to limit the potency of p38β2targeting. Recently, acidic patches on p38 MAPKs have been shown to be important for targeting of substrates, thereby implying the importance of the basic regions in docking domains (13Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 14Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To study the importance of basic residues in the docking domain, we introduced two basic residues into the MEF2A docking site (Fig.7 A). The introduction of basic residues led to a large increase in MEF2A phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 7 A). Binding of p38 MAPKs to MEF2A is difficult to detect. However, the MEF2A mutant MEF2A(N267R/D272K) exhibited a large increase in recruitment of p38β2 in kinase binding assays (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the strengthening of the basic region clearly enhances targeting by p38β2. Another key difference between SAP-1 and MEF2A is the absence of an LXL motif in MEF2A. This has important implications for the spacing requirements of the basic and hydrophobic regions, and it is predicted that the introduction of an LXL motif into MEF2A should not affect phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 4). Indeed, such a mutation in MEF2A, MEF2A(+GL), had little effect on MEF2A phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 7 A), demonstrating that the spacing between these two motifs is indeed flexible. The weak phosphorylation of MEF2A by ERK2 was not enhanced by the introduction of an LXL motif, indicating that additional determinants are required to confer this property on the MEF2A D-domain (data not shown) Unlike MEF2A, MEF2D is not phosphorylated efficiently by p38 MAPKs (21Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V. Kato Y. Di Gram H. Padova F. Olson E. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Inspection of the region corresponding to the p38 docking domain suggests that one reason for this might be that the hydrophobic triplet is poorly conserved in MEF2D (Fig. 7 C). We therefore tested this by introducing reciprocal mutations of residues in this region between MEF2A and MEF2D (Fig. 7 C). The MEF2A mutant MEF2A(I277T/P278S) exhibited greatly reduced phosphorylation by p38β2 to levels observed with MEF2D. Conversely, the MEF2D mutant MEF2D(T274I/S275P) exhibited greatly enhanced phosphorylation by p38β2 to levels above those observed with MEF2A. The introduction of the single mutation T275I within the hydrophobic triplet led to an intermediate level of phosphorylation, equivalent to that obtained with MEF2A (data not shown). These results therefore confirm the critical role of the hydrophobic region in the MEF2A docking site in specifying phosphorylation by p38 MAPKs. However, as predicted from the alanine scanning experiments, residues C-terminal to this motif also contribute to MAPK targeting. Docking domains play a major role in dictating the specificity of substrate phosphorylation by MAPKs (reviewed in Refs. 4Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 5Sharrocks A.D. Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These docking domains are typically short peptides (<20 amino acids) that specify phosphorylation by one MAPK or a subset of MAPKs. Here, we have studied the structure of these domains and how targeting specificity is generated in the transcription factors Elk-1, SAP-1, and MEF2A. Alignments of MAPK docking domains found in substrates such as transcription factors and downstream kinases reveal the existence of clusters of conserved residues. These clusters are characterized regarding residue type rather than sequence identity. For example, in SAP-1, three distinct submotifs can be identified, including a basic region, an LXL motif, and a hydrophobic triplet (see Fig.4 A). However, different MAPK substrates such as Rsk1 are rich in basic residues, but lack the other two features (5Sharrocks A.D. Galanis A. Yang S.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Other transcription factors like MEF2A retain the basic and hydrophobic regions, but lack the intervening LXL motif (Fig.4 A). Based on our mutational analysis of SAP-1 and MEF2A, several conclusions can be drawn about the roles of the individual submotifs. The basic region is clearly an important targeting determinant. Mutations of basic residues reduced the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation by both the ERK and p38 MAPKs (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Furthermore, an increase of net positive charge in this region in Elk-1 (Figs. 5 and 6) and MEF2A (Figs. 1 and 7) led to enhanced phosphorylation by p38β2. Reductions in positive charge led to decreases in SAP-1 phosphorylation by ERK and p38 MAPKs, although among basic residues, Arg318 is more important for SAP-1 phosphorylation by p38β2. However, MEF2A lacks an extensive basic region (Fig. 4 A), and introduction of additional basic residues resulted in enhanced binding and phosphorylation by p38 MAPKs (Fig. 7). This result suggests that MEF2A has evolved a targeting domain that is suboptimal for targeting of p38 MAPKs, thereby promoting the temporary interactions that are required for transient responses. On the other hand, SAP-1 has a very strong basic region (Fig. 4 A), which presumably compensates for the required reductions elsewhere in the D-domain to permit ERK2 binding. The LXL motif in SAP-1 is clearly important for targeting by both the ERK and p38 MAPKs (Fig. 3). However, as this region is lacking in MEF2A, it is not absolutely required for p38 targeting. Consistent with this view is that the reintroduction of the LXL motif into MEF2A did not affect its phosphorylation by p38β2 (Fig. 7), indicating that the spacing between the basic region and hydrophobic triplet is relatively unimportant. However, conversely, in substrates like SAP-1, where a spacer is present, residues in this spacer play essential roles (Fig. 3). The introduction of charged residues next to and within the LXL motif of SAP-1/Elk-1 also affected targeting specificity (Figs. 5 and 6), demonstrating the importance of the local context of this motif. However, in the context of the MEF2A docking domain, the introduction of the LXL motif is not sufficient to enhance the weak ERK-mediated phosphorylation of this protein. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed an important role for the hydrophobic triplet in SAP-1 and MEF2A in phosphorylation by both the ERK and p38 MAPKs. However, in SAP-1, Leu331 within this motif is clearly not important for ERK-mediated phosphorylation. Similarly, alanine insertions at the equivalent position in Elk-1 do not affect ERK-mediated phosphorylation (6Yang S.-H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, residues in the hydrophobic motif play an important role in specificity determination and are particularly important for the phosphorylation of p38 substrates. This is underlined by the observation that MEF2D can be converted into an efficient p38 substrate by strengthening its hydrophobic region (Fig. 7). Several proline residues are present within the docking domains of SAP-1 and MEF2A, suggesting that these domains are unlikely to fold into defined secondary structure elements. However, the majority of these residues play important roles in MAPK targeting (Figs. 1, 3, and 7). One attractive role for these residues would be structural, to direct the docking domain peptides in the correct trajectory to interact with the surface of the kinase. Such a critical role would explain the importance of prolines such as Pro329 in SAP-1, the mutation of which has the most severe consequences. An alternative but not mutually exclusive role would be that these residues make specific contacts with the kinases. Finally, it is important to emphasize that, although the contributions of individual submotifs can be recognized, the interplay between these motifs is of critical importance. Residues from outside these motifs can play important roles, and changes in one submotif can be compensated for by alterations elsewhere in the docking domain. This is particularly important when considering how dual targeting specificity is generated in substrates, as observed in SAP-1. It has previously been demonstrated that it is possible to predict the existence of MAPK docking domains (12Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, although this is possible, subsequent predictions of the specificity of targeting dictated by these domains is difficult. The results of this study highlight these inherent difficulties, as residues throughout the motifs differentially contribute to MAPK targeting. However, the model we have generated should aid in the prediction of targeting specificity. Another implication of our results is that, although docking domains might be identified (such as in MEF2D), these domains might be nonfunctional. In the case of MEF2D, residues have been introduced that block p38 targeting and presumably have regulatory consequences. For example, MEF2D might become phosphorylated by p38 MAPKs only as a heterodimer with MEF2A or MEF2C, which will contribute a docking domain. A similar scenario has been demonstrated for Jun family members (26Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The model proposed for the structure of the docking domains found on transcription factor substrates (Fig. 4 B) has important implications for the cognate surfaces found on the kinases. For example, p38 MAPKs must have three different motifs that recognize the basic region, LXL motif, and hydrophobic triplet. In an alternative recognition mode, the p38 MAPKs would use only two such regions for recognizing substrates such as MEF2A that lack the LXL motif. This also suggests that the three motifs are not located on a linear epitope across the surface of the kinase and that the basic domain and hydrophobic recognition motifs must be located quite close together on the kinase. A further prediction is that the three binding motifs on the kinase will be acidic, partially hydrophobic, and hydrophobic to accommodate the three submotifs found in the docking domains. Attractive candidate motifs for binding to the basic regions are the previously identified acidic patches (CD and DE domains) (13Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 14Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The first of these is proposed to be important in all MAPK-substrate interactions (presumably via the basic domain), whereas the DE motif is specifically involved in recognizing p38 substrates. However, although SAP-1 contains an extensive basic region, the reduced basic region in MEF2A suggests that these acidic regions on the p38 MAPKs might not be important for interaction with its docking domain. Collectively, our data provide a compelling model for the structure of MAPK docking domains and the specificity determinants embedded within these domains. These results should therefore be of wide significance for studies on other MAPK-substrate interactions."

The actin cytoskeleton provides both the protrusive and contractile forces required for cell migration via a combination of actin polymerization and depolymerization, actin filament cross-linking, and the interaction of myosin-based motors with actin filaments (1Lauffenburger D.A.

The complexity of cell motility and the fact that it is regulated by many hormones, cytokines, and growth factors, including growth hormone (GH)1 (2Wiedermann C.J. Reinisch N. Braunsteiner H.

Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), suggest that multiple signaling mechanisms exist to regulate this process. Multiple signaling proteins have been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular motility. Prominent among these are members of the Rho small GTPase family of proteins (4Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3744) Google Scholar). Activated Cdc42 has been implicated in the formation of filopodia, long thin extensions containing actin bundles. Activated Rac has been implicated in the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, broader, weblike extensions. Activated Rho is thought to mediate the formation of stress fibers, elongated actin bundles that traverse the cells and promote cell attachment to the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions. A number of other proteins have been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, including Rho family effector (e.g. PAK, N-WASP (neural Wiskott- Aldrich syndrome protein), ROCK (Rho-associated kinase)) and regulatory proteins (e.g. GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factor(s), GTPase-activating proteins, and GDP dissociation inhibitor(s)), adapter or scaffolding proteins (e.g. Nck, Crk, Grb2), and cytoskeleton-regulating/binding proteins (e.g. WASP family, Arp2/3 complex, profilin, ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor)/cofilin, gelsolin) (6Yin H.L.

However, how all these molecules work together to enable cells to precisely regulate their actin cytoskeleton in response to specific stimuli remains poorly understood. Recently, our laboratory implicated the SH2 domain-containing protein SH2-Bβ in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by GH and PDGF (9Herrington J. Diakonova M. Rui L. Gunter D.R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13126-13133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced morphological differentiation of PC12 cells into neuronal-like cells (10Rui L. Herrington J.B. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that SH2-Bβ co-localizes with actin in membrane ruffles. Furthermore, introduction into cells of mutant SH2-Bβ lacking a functional SH2 domain inhibited GH- and PDGF-dependent membrane ruffling and pinocytosis and blocked NGF-induced morphological differentiation of PC12 cells. SH2-Bβ is a 670-amino acid, widely expressed, SH2 domain-containing protein that was originally identified by our laboratory in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 (11Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JAK2 binds to multiple members of the cytokine family of receptors, including the GH receptor, and is activated in response to ligand binding to those receptors. This activation of JAK2 is thought to be the initiating step in cytokine receptor signaling (12Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M.

SH2-Bβ and/or other isoforms (α, γ) of SH2-B have also been shown to bind, via their SH2 domain, to the activated form of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including the receptors for PDGF, NGF (TrkA), insulin, and insulin-like growth factor (11Rui L.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that SH2-Bβ may play a fundamental role in cell function. SH2-Bβ lacks a known enzymatic domain, but contains multiple protein and/or lipid interacting domains, including a pleckstrin homology domain and three proline-rich regions in addition to its SH2 domain (Fig. 1). This domain structure suggests that SH2-B isoforms may serve as adapter or scaffolding proteins that recruit proteins to activated membrane receptor complexes. Consistent with this, SH2-B isoforms are also phosphorylated on tyrosines in response to GH, PDGF, and NGF (10Rui L. Herrington J.B. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

Cowburn D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 259-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). SH2-Bβ has been shown to activate JAK2 (13Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and TrkA (20Qian X. Ginty D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, some SH2-Bβ mutants that act as dominant negatives for membrane ruffling and neuronal differentiation do not appear to block kinase activity, suggesting that SH2-Bβ serves a function in cytokine and growth factor signaling in addition to regulation of kinase activity. Taken together, these observations suggest that SH2-Bβ may regulate the actin cytoskeleton by serving as a scaffolding or adapter protein that recruits to activated receptor kinases molecules that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. In this work, we extend our initial findings implicating SH2-Bβ in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by providing strong evidence that SH2-Bβ is required for maximal cell motility using time-lapse video microscopy and two motility assays (phagokinetic and wounding). GH is shown to stimulate cell motility, and two regions of SH2-Bβ (the SH2 domain and an N-terminal proline-rich domain (amino acids 85–106)) are implicated in the effect of SH2-Bβ on GH-stimulated cell motility. GH is shown to activate the small GTPase Rac, and Rac is shown to bind to SH2-Bβ; the binding requires amino acids 85–106 of SH2-Bβ. Overexpression of dominant negative mutants of SH2-Bβ block the ability of constitutively active Rac to promote membrane ruffling, consistent with intact SH2-Bβ being required for Rac promotion of membrane ruffling. These results suggest that SH2-Bβ acts as an adapter or scaffolding protein that recruits Rac and potentially Rac-regulating proteins, Rac effector proteins, and/or other actin-regulating proteins to membrane cytokine and growth factor receptors.

Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). 3T3-F442A and 293T cells were cultured as described (18Rui L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21239-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3T3-F442A cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with 2.5 μg (total) of cDNA using Transfast (Promega). 293T cells plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of cDNA using calcium phosphate precipitation. 36 h after transfection, 3T3-F442A cells on coverslips were incubated in serum-free medium overnight. Cells were observed by phase-contrast optics in a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope with shutter-controlled illumination (Uniblitz, Rochester, NY). Cells were recorded for 2 min, treated with GH as indicated, and recorded further. Images were collected using a cooled, digital CCD camera (Quantix, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and were recorded (1 frame/15 s) and stored using MetaMorph 2.0 image analysis software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). To quantify lamellipodia extension and retraction, individual transfected cells were located with a FITC filter set. Binary images of the cell profile were generated from the video frames using MetaMorph. Subtracting a binary image from the subsequent one produced a binary image of areas of extension, and subtracting the second binary image from the first produced a binary image of areas of retraction (23Bershadsky A.D. Vaisberg E.A. Vasiliev J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 19: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The area of extension (retraction) was normalized to the cross-sectional area of the cell. Six cells expressing GFP alone or GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E), five cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ, and three cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ(1–555) (data not shown) were videotaped and analyzed. For the phagokinetic assay (24Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), cells were plated on colloid gold-covered coverslips 48 h after transfection. After 2 or 24 h, the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and mounted on slides. Individual transfected cells expressing GFP-tagged forms of SH2-Bβ were located with a FITC filter set using a Nikon TE200 microscope. Phase-contrast images were collected and analyzed by NIH Image software. The particle-free area indicating where cells moved was measured for 10 cells each in three (3T3-F442A cells) or four (293T cells) independent experiments. The phagokinetic index was calculated as a ratio of the particle-free area to the cross-sectional area of the cell. Migration of cells into a wound was assessed as described (25Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding epitope-tagged forms of SH2-Bβ, GFP, or Myc-tagged Lin-7, with or without cDNA encoding rat GH receptor. Cells were re-plated at both high (5 × 105 cells/dish) and low (1.5 × 105 cells/dish) density onto 100-mm diameter dishes. After 2 days, when cells in the high density dish reached a monolayer, a plastic pipette tip was drawn across the center of some of the plate several times to produce a clean 1-mm-wide wound area of some of the culture (Fig. 5). After an additional 24-h incubation to permit migration of cells into the empty area, migration of the cells was examined using a phase-contrast microscope and the GFP-tagged cells visualized by fluorescence microscopy. In other cells (70–80% confluent) (Fig. 6), cultures were serum-deprived for 24 h before being wounded. Those cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.5% calf serum with GH as indicated. After another 24-h incubation to permit migration of cells into the empty area, migration of the cells was examined using a phase-contrast microscope with a calibrated eyepiece. The distance between the leading edge of the migrating cells from the edge of the wound was measured. The number of tag-positive and tag-negative cells in the wound area were counted (100 cells total/wound). The number of tag-positive and negative cells (100 cells total) were also counted in the low density, non-wounded plate. For Myc-tagged plasmids, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and stained with αMyc. To take into account the efficiency of transfection, a motility index was calculated as a ratio of percentage of tag-positive cells migrating into the wound area to the percentage of tag-positive cells in the low density dish. To confirm that differences in the number of cells present in the wound were the result of differences in motility rather than in cell proliferation, serum-deprived, wounded, and GH-treated (500 ng/ml GH) cells expressing GFP alone, GFP-SH2-Bβ, and GFP-SH2-Bβ(R555E) were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Elite, ESP) in parallel with non-wounded but serum-deprived and GH-treated cells. The percentage of GFP positive cells was similar for wounded, GH-treated plates and non-wounded, non-hormone-treated plates. Furthermore, the majority (60–70%) of the cells in all plates were stopped in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (data not shown) in contrast to cells maintained in serum, in which >60% of the cells were in S phase as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of DNA stained cells (propidium iodide, Hoechst, or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Ten wounds were sampled for each type of transfection. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results.Figure 6Maximal GH-dependent migration of cells into wound requires the SH2 domain and a proline-rich region of SH2-Bβ. 293T cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the indicated forms of epitope-tagged SH2-Bβ.A, cell movement into a wound was assessed as an average migration distance of the leading edge. B, a motility index was calculated as a ratio of % transfected cells migrating into the wound to the % transfected cells.

Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Cells were lysed and solubilized proteins incubated with GST-PBD and glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Bound proteins were immunoblotted with αRac (1:1 000 dilution) and analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Constitutively active Rac L61 expressed in 293T cells was used as a positive control (data not shown). For experiments investigating interaction between forms of GFP-SH2-Bβ and Myc-Rac N17, Myc-Rac V12, or Myc-Rac L61, Rac was immunoprecipitated with αMyc using rabbit anti-mouse and protein A-agarose. SH2-Bβ was visualized by immunoblotting with αGFP. 3T3-F442A cells on coverslips were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding different forms of GFP-tagged SH2-Bβ and Myc-tagged Rac. 48 h later, cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in intracellular buffer consisting of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 33 mm potassium acetate, 5% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.02% NaN3. Cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in intracellular buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min (28Swanson J.A. Johnson M.T. Beningo K. Post P. Mooseker M. Araki N. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips were incubated with αMyc followed by goat anti-mouse-Cy5. F-actin was stained with Texas Red-phalloidin. Confocal imaging was performed with a Noran Oz laser scanning confocal microscope (Morphology and Image Analysis Core of the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center). The images presented in the figures are representative of at least three separate experiments. Data from at least three separate transfections were pooled and analyzed using a two-tailed unpairedt test. When individual experiments were analyzed, the results were indistinguishable from those obtained from the pooled data. Differences were considered to be statistically significant atp < 0.05. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. In all imaging experiments, measurements were taken before determining the identity of the cells on the plate/coverslip. To examine the role of SH2-Bβ in cell motility, we first made a time-lapse recording of 3T3-F442A fibroblasts overexpressing GFP-tagged wild-type SH2-Bβ or an SH2 domain-deficient version of this protein (SH2-Bβ(R555E)). 3T3-F442A cells are highly responsive to GH (29Nixon T. Green H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,30Carter-Su C. Smit L.S. Recent Prog. Hormone Res. 1997; 53: 61-83Google Scholar). In SH2-Bβ(R555E), the critical Arg (R) within the FLVR motif of the SH2 domain is mutated to Glu (E). This mutant exhibits substantially reduced binding to JAK2 and fails to serve as a substrate of JAK2 (13Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium. GFP-positive cells were located using a FITC filter set. Recording was initiated, and then GH was added. Because these cells did not show directional movement during the time of observation, our study assessed lamellipodia activity. The term “lamellipodia” is used here to refer to dynamic actin-rich extensions at the periphery of the cell (31Small J.V. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1988; 1: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Lamellipodia activity was quantified by measuring the percentage of cell retraction and extension. Addition of 500 ng/ml GH resulted within 10 min in high lamellipodia activity of untransfected cells (Fig.2 A, top two rows) and cells overexpressing GFP (Fig.2 A, top row) or GFP-SH2-Bβ (data not shown) (transfected cells are indicated in the leftmost panels). Lamellipodia activity was often accompanied by the appearance and centripetal movement of ruffles. In contrast, cells expressing SH2-Bβ(R555E) (Fig. 2 A, second row panels) exhibited very little lamellipodia activity. When cells were treated with 25 ng/ml GH (Fig. 2 A,bottom two rows), a concentration of GH reported previously to cause minimal ruffling in untransfected cells and cells overexpressing GFP (Ref. 9Herrington J. Diakonova M. Rui L. Gunter D.R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13126-13133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), only minimal lamellipodia activity was detected in untransfected cells or cells overexpressing GFP (Fig. 2 A, bottom rows). In contrast, substantial lamellipodia activity was detected in cells overexpressing full-length SH2-Bβ (Fig. 2 A,bottom row). A plot of lamellipodia activity over time is shown (Fig. 2 B) for single representative cells treated with the higher concentration of GH (500 ng/ml). GH stimulated similar levels of lamellipodia activity in cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 2 B,top panel) or GFP-SH2-Bβ (Fig. 2 B,middle panel); activity was maximal 10 min after GH addition. In contrast, GH stimulated only minimal lamellipodia activity in cells expressing SH2-Bβ(R555E) (Fig. 2 B,bottom panel). The data in Fig. 2 (Aand B) show that overexpressing SH2-Bβ enhances and overexpressing SH2-Bβ(R555Ε) inhibits GH-induced lamellipodia activity, suggesting that SH2-Bβ with an intact SH2 domain is required for maximal GH-induced lamellipodia activity. To examine further the effect of SH2-Bβ on cell motility, we performed a gold particle motility (or phagokinetic) assay. This assay measures the disappearance of gold particles from a coverslip, a process requiring both phagocytosis and locomotion. Cells transfected with the desired cDNA were plated on coverslips coated with colloidal gold particles and incubated at 37 °C for either 2 h (Fig.3, A–H) or 24 h (Figs.3 I and 4). Cells remove particles while they move, thereby producing areas that are free of colloidal gold. These areas were quantified using NIH Image analysis software.Figure 4Epithelial derived cells, like fibroblasts, exhibit phagokinesis. A–D, 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (A), COS cells (B), CHO (C), and 293T cells (D) were tested for their ability to phagocytose colloid gold.

Fibroblasts are known to be very motile (32Varani J. Orr W. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1978; 90: 159-171PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-F442A fibroblasts expressing GFP alone (Fig. 3 A) or GFP-SH2-Bβ (Fig.3 C), and identified as GFP-positive cells using a FITC filter set, removed gold particles from a portion of the coverslip during 2 h. Cells expressing GFP-SH2-Bβ(1–555) lacking a functional SH2 domain removed gold particles from a substantially smaller area (Fig. 3 E), as predicted from the video microscopy experiments. Like the SH2 domain-deficient mutants of SH2-Bβ, the C terminus of SH2-Bβ (SH2-Bβ(504–670)) was shown previously to inhibit GH-induced membrane ruffling (9Herrington J. Diakonova M. Rui L. Gunter D.R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13126-13133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The difference in phagokinetic properties between cells transfected with SH2-Bβ(504–670) and nontransfected cells is clearly seen in Fig.3 G, which contains both a transfected and nontransfected cell. The GFP-positive cell (right side) removed very few gold particles whereas the nontransfected cell (left side) produced clear gold-free areas. The area lacking gold particles after 24 h was quantified and normalized for multiple cells. The phagokinetic index was calculated and plotted in Fig. 3 I. Cells expressing either GFP-SH2-Bβ(1–555) or GFP-SH2-Bβ(504–670) demonstrated reduced phagokinesis. To determine whether SH2-Bβ is important for cell motility in non-fibroblast cells, we tested cultured human embryonic kidney (293T) cells, monkey embryonic kidney (COS) cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for their ability to phagocytose colloid gold during 24 h (Fig. 4). These three cell lines are all epithelial cell-derived and are more amenable to transfection than 3T3-F442A cells. Although phagokinesis of these three cell types was significantly less than that observed for 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (Fig.4 E), all formed visible areas that could be measured (Fig.4, A–D).

The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) appears to be, by far, the primary substrate for polysialylation because the absence of NCAM expression results in the almost complete loss of PSA immunoreactivity (12Cremer H. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Wille W. Nature. 1994; 367: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). NCAM is a major cell adhesion molecule in the central nervous system and is thought to operate by promoting cell-cell interactions via homophilic binding of NCAM molecules on apposing membranes (13Yang P. Major D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation of NCAM by PSA significantly reduces the ability of NCAM molecules to interact and as a result enhances cell migration (14Doherty P. Cohen J. Walsh F.S.

During central nervous system development, the majority of NCAM is highly polysialylated and has a major role in axon pathfinding, target innervation, and fasciculation. In the adult, polysialylation is restricted to only those regions of the central nervous system that remain plastic and is involved in processes underlying memory formation (12Cremer H. Lange R.

In addition to its normal occurrence, PSA-NCAM has been associated with an increasing number of cancers, including the small cell lung carcinoma, neuroblastomas, and Wilm's tumor (5Tanaka F. Otake Y.

Springall D. van Zandwijk N. Koopman J. Hilkens J. Mooi W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 8: 34-37Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The role that polysialylation of NCAM has in altering neuronal behavior is not fully understood. One approach to studying the effect of glycosylation on protein function and cell behavior involves the use of unnatural saccharide derivatives that can substitute for the native sugar in glycosides (22Goon S. Bertozzi C.R. Wang P.G. Bertozzi C.R. Glycochemistry: Principles, Synthesis and Applications. Marcel Dekker, New York2000: 641-674Google Scholar). The sialic acid biosynthesis pathway is particularly amenable because it is permissive for replacement of the natural precursor N-acetylmannosamine with synthetic derivatives that contain modifications at the N-acyl side chain (23Keppler O.T.

This approach has been used to study the effects of unnatural sialic acid derivatives on viral binding, glial cell proliferation, and myelin-associated glycoprotein binding to neural cells (27Keppler O.T.

Polysialyltransferases catalyze a significantly different reaction from other types of sialyltransferases, namely the formation of polymeric α2,8-linked sialic acids. Because sialic acids serve as both glycosyl donor and acceptor for these enzymes, we considered that unnatural sialic acids might dramatically affect their efficiency. We previously demonstrated that cultured human neurons were capable of incorporating low levels of N-levulinoyl sialic acid into PSA-NCAM, which indicated that polysialyltransferases were able to accept unnatural sialic acids in the synthesis of PSA (30Charter N.W. Mahal L.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells appear to readily utilize N-propanoyl sialic acid in PSA synthesis, resulting in the incorporation of SiaProp sialosides in PSA on NCAM (31Liu T. Guo Z. Yang Q. Sad S. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32832-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The expression of poly(SiaProp) on NCAM results in altered antigenicity compared with natural polysialic acid. However, our studies also demonstrated that N-butanoylmannosamine, which possesses an additional methylene group at the N-acyl domain, is an effective inhibitor of PSA synthesis in mammalian cells (32Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given the wide range of roles that PSA-NCAM plays in both the central nervous system and disease, we sought to examine the effect that unnatural sialic acid analogs can have on cell behavior that is regulated by PSA expression. Here we compare how unnatural poly(SiaProp) (generated by N-propanoylmannosamine treatment) and PSA synthesis inhibition (as a result ofN-butanoylmannosamine treatment) affect the ability of neurons to project neurites.

The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 and 400 μg/ml hygromycin (HeLa-NCAM/STX and HeLa-NCAM/PST only). Detailed methods for the culture of NT2 cells and differentiation into terminally differentiated neurons have been described previously (30Charter N.W. Mahal L.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R.

Purified NT2 neurons were seeded onto poly-d-lysine- and Matrigel-coated 12-well cultures plates. PSA expression was quantified using modified whole cell ELISA (36Parnas D. Linial M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1998; 2: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HeLa-NCAM/STX and HeLa-NCAM/PST cells, seeded on 96-well culture plates (Corning), were incubated for 3 days with various concentrations of mannosamine derivatives. The cells were washed and fixed for 20 min with MeOH at −20 °C. Following fixation, the cells were rehydrated for 10 min with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-X) and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer containing 2.5% normal rabbit serum in PBS-X. Cells were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rat anti-PSA monoclonal antibody (12F8, BD PharMingen) in blocking buffer for 1 h. The plates were washed twice with PBS-X, treated with ImmunoPure peroxidase suppressor (Pierce) to suppress endogenous peroxidase activity, and washed another two times with PBS-X. The cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-rat IgM-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in blocking buffer. After washing with PBS-X, the cells were incubated with Turbo-TMB substrate buffer (Pierce) for 15 min, and the reaction was quenched with 1 nH2SO4. Anti-PSA labeling was measured using a SpectroMax 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at an absorbance of 450 nm. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the data with SoftMax Pro (Molecular Devices) using the equation E = ((E0 - Emax )/(1 + (L/IC50)n)) +Emax, where E0 is the level of PSA expression in the absence of sugar,Emax is the level of PSA expression in the presence of maximally effective concentration of sugar, L is the concentration of the sugar, IC50 is the concentration at which a half-maximal effect is produced, and n is the Hill coefficient. Detailed methods for the detection of PSA and NCAM by Western analysis using the anti-PSA mAbs 735 and the anti-NCAM mAb OB11 (Sigma) have been described previously (30Charter N.W. Mahal L.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were generated from HeLa-NCAM/STX and HeLa-NCAM/PST cells following incubation for 3 days with various concentrations of mannosamine derivatives. Purified NT2 neurons were seeded onto poly-d-lysine- and Matrigel-coated culture plates and incubated for 5 days with varying concentrations of mannosamine derivatives prior to lysis for Western analysis. PSA expression was found to be highly unstable in NCAM- and PST-transfected HeLa cells resulting in heterogeneous cultures that expressed either NCAM only or PSA-NCAM. Therefore, the effect of PSA expression on neurite growth was only examined using HeLa substratum cells that stably expressed NCAM and STX. Sensory neurons from the dorsal root ganglia were isolated from 10-day-old chick embryos, dissociated with 0.5% trypsin, and seeded onto confluent cultures of HeLa monolayer in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor (7Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The neuron/HeLa co-cultures were grown for 15 h, fixed using 4% formaldehyde in PBS, stained with antineurofilament mAb RM0270 (37Lee V.M. Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3474-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and visualized by immunofluorescence. Neurite length analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). The mean neurite lengths per neuron were compared among the different substrate conditions using one-way ANOVA analysis. Comparisons between individual assays were made after normalizing neurite outgrowth to that on HeLa-NCAM cells. To compare the effect of unnatural N-acyl mannosamine derivatives on the biosynthesis of PSA mediated by the polysialyltransferases PST and STX separately, HeLa cells expressing NCAM and either STX or PST were incubated with N-propanoylmannosamine (ManProp),N-butanoylmannosamine (ManBut), orN-pentanoylmannosamine (ManPent). These derivatives possess an additional one, two, or three methylene groups, respectively, at theN-acyl domain when compared with the natural precursor in sialic acid biosynthesis N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). PSA expression was examined with a whole cell ELISA using the PSA-specific antibody 12F8 (Fig. 1). Both ManBut and ManPent treatment resulted in a dose-dependent loss of anti-PSA staining that was complete at 10 mm for ManBut and 30 mm for ManPent. Therefore, ManBut appeared to be the more potent of the two unnatural derivatives for blocking PSA staining, with an IC50 of 2.7 mm for HeLa-NCAM/STX and 2.0 mm for HeLa-NCAM/PST cells. ManPent inhibited anti-PSA labeling with slightly higher IC50 of 4.1 mmfor HeLa-NCAM/STX and 5.9 mm for HeLa-NCAM/PST cells. In contrast, ManProp gave complex results, which will be discussed in greater detail later in this section. Because the whole cell ELISA measures anti-PSA labeling, the loss of labeling observed may be due to the inability of the anti-PSA antibody 12F8 to recognize PSA containing unnatural sialosides. To determine whether the loss of PSA labeling was due to the inhibition of PSA synthesis or to the incorporation of SiaBut residues in PSA, total protein from ManBut-treated HeLa-NCAM/STX was analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies specific to PSA (mAb 735) or NCAM (mAb OB11) (Fig.2). Loss of PSA labeling and a concomitant reduction in the apparent molecular mass of NCAM consistent with a lack of polysialylation were observed at 3 mmManBut. Therefore the primary effect of ManBut treatment appears to be the inhibition of PSA synthesis, and the measured IC50value of 2.7 mm appears to be accurate. Western analysis of PSA synthesis by PST was complicated by the fact that its expression or activity was highly unstable in HeLa-NCAM/PST cells. As a result, two populations of cells were present, one expressing NCAM-PSA and the second expressing only NCAM (Fig. 2). A number of attempts were made to generate a single population of NCAM-PSA-expressing cells, but in each case the cultures quickly reverted to a mixed population of PSA- and non-PSA-expressing cells. Because ManBut readily inhibited PSA synthesis in HeLa-NCAM/STX cells, these cells were used as a substrate for neuronal cell growth to determine the effect of ManBut treatment on neurite outgrowth. ManProp treatment of either HeLa-NCAM/STX or HeLa-NCAM/PST cells resulted in a dose-dependent reduction but not a complete loss of anti-PSA labeling by ELISA (Fig. 1). At concentrations up to 30 mm ManProp, anti-PSA labeling using the mAb 12F8 could still be detected in HeLa-NCAM/STX or HeLa-NCAM/PST cells, whereas comparable doses of ManBut and ManPent had resulted in a complete loss of anti-PSA staining by ELISA. Analysis of whole cell lysates from ManProp-treated HeLa-NCAM/STX cells revealed a dose-dependent loss in PSA staining when the anti-PSA-specific antibody 735 was used (Fig. 2). In contrast to the effect observed with ManBut, the loss of anti-PSA labeling as a result of ManProp treatment was not associated with a concomitant reduction in molecular mass of NCAM to non-polysialylated levels. Rather, NCAM migrated with an apparent molecular mass in excess of 200 kDa, which was indicative of a high degree of polysialylation. Incubation with ManProp treatment has previously been shown to generate SiaProp-containing PSA in tumor and neuronal cells and to result in the loss of mAb 735 immunoreactivity (31Liu T. Guo Z. Yang Q. Sad S. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32832-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the anti-PSA antibody 12F8 appears to tolerate the inclusion of unnatural SiaProp sialosides in PSA. Although a decrease in labeling of PSA by 12F8 was observed in ManProp-treated cells (Fig. 1), there was a corresponding dose-dependent reduction in the molecular mass of NCAM by Western analysis (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data indicate that in HeLa-NCAM/STX cells, ManProp treatment results in a reduction of the degree of polymerization of PSA. Hence, 12F8 immunoreactivity does not appear to be affected by the inclusion of SiaProp sialosides in PSA. Despite the observation that ManProp reduces polymer length of PSA in HeLa-NCAM/STX cells, the data presented here demonstrate that treatment of these cells with ManProp results in the expression of SiaProp-containing PSA. Therefore, these cells can be used as substrate on which to examine the effect of poly(SiaProp) on PSA-mediated neurite outgrowth. All of the mannosamine derivatives used in this and previous studies have poor membrane permeability, demanding millimolar concentrations to observe metabolic effects. Therefore, we synthesized more lipophilic, acetylated derivatives that can diffuse passively through the plasma membrane. Once inside the cell, these acetyl groups are hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases (38Jacobs C.L. Yarema K.J. Mahal L.K. Nauman D.A. Charter N.W. Bertozzi C.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 260-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We examined whether the acetylated forms of ManProp (Ac4ManProp), ManBut (Ac4ManBut), and ManPent (Ac4ManPent) derivatives were able to inhibit PSA synthesis at lower concentrations than the non-acetylated counterparts without having any detrimental side effects on cell survival. Human NT2 neurons were treated for 5 days with varying concentrations of acetylated N-acyl mannosamine derivatives, and whole cell lysates were examined by Western analysis for PSA and NCAM expression. Ac4ManBut or Ac4ManPent treatment resulted in a dose-dependent loss in anti-PSA labeling that was apparent at 10 μm and complete at 30 μm (Fig.3). PSA inhibition in NT2 neurons with 30 μm of the acetylated derivatives was comparable with 1 mm of the non-acetylated counterparts and indicated that acetylation increased inhibitory potency by at least 30-fold (32Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The loss of PSA immunoreactivity was associated with a concomitant reduction in the molecular mass of NCAM to less than 200 kDa, indicative of the inhibition of PSA synthesis (Fig. 2 C). Treatment of NT2 neurons with Ac4ManProp had a similar effect as unprotected ManProp in reducing PSA immunoreactivity without affecting the polysialylation of NCAM. Loss of PSA immunoreactivity was apparent at 30 μm Ac4ManProp, similar to the effect of 3 mm ManProp on NT2 neurons in earlier studies (32Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, as with the acetylated forms of ManBut and ManPent, Ac4ManProp possessed similar properties to ManProp in altering the composition of polysialic acid but at significantly lower doses. In performing these experiments, we observed that incubation of NT2 neurons with higher concentrations of the acetylated N-acyl mannosamine derivatives (100 μm or above) appeared to be toxic to the cells. The toxicity did not appear to be due to the modified N-acyl domain itself because acetylated ManNAc had a similar effect. We were concerned that because HeLa-NCAM/STX cells typically require a 3-fold higher dose of N-acyl mannosamine derivatives to produce similar alterations in PSA synthesis compared with NT2 neurons, it was likely such doses may have a significant effect on cell viability. Therefore, despite the observation that acetylated N-acyl mannosamine derivatives are effective at significantly lower dosages than the free sugars, the possible effect of acetylated mannosamine derivatives on cell viability led us to conduct our studies on modifying neurite outgrowth with the non-acetylated forms that exhibit no apparent toxicity. The expression of polysialic acid on neural cells has a significant effect on cell migration and axon outgrowth (8Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,14Doherty P. Cohen J. Walsh F.S.

We examined the effects of ManBut, a PSA synthesis inhibitor, on the neurite outgrowth of chick dorsal root ganglia neurons when cultured on a substratum of HeLa-NCAM/STX cells. Consistent with earlier studies, we found that neurite outgrowth was promoted by the polysialylation of NCAM on HeLa cell substrata (7Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In one such experiment, summarized in Fig.4, neurons cultured on HeLa cells expressing NCAM alone exhibited modest outgrowth (137.8 ± 7.5 μm, n = 58), whereas those grown on HeLa cells expressing NCAM and the polysialyltransferase STX produced significantly longer neurites (182.2 ± 7.4 μm,n = 70; p < 0.001). Similar behavior was observed in other experiments, and a high degree of correlation was observed between experiments after normalizing neurite outgrowth to that observed on NCAM (Fig.5 B). Typically, polysialylation of NCAM on substrate cells was found to promote neurite outgrowth by over 35% (STX: 138.2 ± 2.5%, compared with normalized outgrowth on NCAM of 100%, in five independent experiments).Figure 5Comparison of the effects of ManBut on neurite outgrowth between individual experiments and on the distribution of neurite lengths. HeLa cells expressing either NCAM-140 alone or NCAM and STX were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 mm ManBut. Sensory neurons from embryonic chick dorsal root ganglia were seeded onto the resulting monolayers.A, the correlation between individual assays was determined by normalizing average neurite length (per neuron) to that on HeLa-NCAM substrate cells. Each data point represents the average neurite length from five independent assays ± S.E. Significant differences shown between data points were calculated by one-way ANOVA.

The percentage of neurites that were identical to or longer than a given size for each substrate was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As illustrated in Fig. 3, a 3-day treatment with 10 mmManBut is sufficient to completely inhibit PSA synthesis in HeLa-NCAM/STX cells. Therefore we compared neurite outgrowth on ManBut-treated HeLa-NCAM/STX cells and observed a significant reduction in the length of neurites compared with untreated HeLa-NCAM/STX cells (STX+ManBut: 142.4 ± 6.9 μm, n = 68versus STX: 182.2 ± 7.4 μm, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4). Neurite outgrowth on HeLa-NCAM/STX cells was reduced by ManBut treatment to the extent that there was no significant difference with outgrowth observed on HeLa-NCAM substrate cells that lack STX. Overall, in five independent experiments, the inhibition of PSA synthesis by ManBut resulted in a 38% decrease in neurite outgrowth (STX+ManBut: 100.9 ± 4.0% versus STX: 138.2 ± 2.5%) (Fig. 5 A). This suggested that the loss of enhanced neurite outgrowth as a result of ManBut treatment was because of the loss of PSA expression. However, in addition to inhibiting PSA synthesis, ManBut treatment will also result in the incorporation of SiaBut residues into other cell-surface sialoglycoconjugates (26Keppler O.T. Horstkorte R.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 11R-18RCrossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and could possibly affect the ability of the HeLa cells to act as a suitable substrate for neurite outgrowth. To address this, we treated HeLa-NCAM cells with ManBut and did not observe any effect on neurite length compared with untreated HeLa-NCAM cells, indicating that the presence of SiaBut-containing glycoconjugates did not alter neurite outgrowth (NCAM+ManBut: 143.6 ± 6.9 μm, n = 41versus NCAM: 137.8 ± 7.5 μm, n = 58, not significant). Therefore, ManBut treatment exerted its influence on neurite outgrowth solely through the inhibition of PSA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5 B, polysialylation of NCAM has a profound effect in promoting outgrowth throughout the population of neurites (40Franceschini I. Angata K. Ong E. Hong A. Doherty P. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PSA synthesis by ManBut resulted in a distribution of neurite lengths that was comparable with that observed on non-polysialylated NCAM. The inverse experiment, namely inhibiting PSA synthesis in chick neurons rather than their substratum, was not attempted because of the extreme difficulty in blocking PSA synthesis prior to seeding onto the substratum cells. In addition, the effectiveness of ManBut treatment on the inhibition of PSA synthesis by avian polysialyltransferases has not yet been determined. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of ManBut on PSA synthesis, the derivative ManProp, which possesses one less methylene group in the N-acyl group, is readily utilized by mammalian cells in the synthesis of SiaProp-containing polysialic acid. A consequence of the expression of poly(SiaProp) in PSA is altered immunoreactivity (31Liu T. Guo Z. Yang Q. Sad S. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32832-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 41Baumann H. Brisson J.R. Michon F. Pon R. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4007-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Changes in epitope structure of PSA as a result of the inclusion of SiaProp residues clearly can have a profound effect on antibody recognition. We were curious whether the subtle alterations in the structure of PSA as a consequence of the additional methylene group at the N-acyl domain of SiaProp was significant enough to alter the antiadhesive properties of PSA. Therefore, we compared the ability of neurons to project neurites on substrate cells expressing poly(SiaProp) with outgrowth on naturally occurring PSA. The results summarized in Fig. 6 clearly demonstrate that treatment of HeLa-NCAM/STX cells with 10 mm ManProp did not have any apparent effect on the neurite outgrowth. In one such experiment (Fig. 6 A), neurite outgrowth on ManProp-treated HeLa-NCAM/STX cells was not significantly different from outgrowth on untreated HeLa-NCAM/STX cells (STX+ManProp: 171.6 ± 6.2 μm, n = 105 versus STX: 171.5 ± 6.3 μm, n = 97). In contrast, outgrowth on substrate cells expressing non-polysialylated NCAM was significantly lower than on HeLa-NCAM/STX substrates, irrespective of whether the cells were treated with ManProp (NCAM: 132.5 ± 7.0 μm,n = 89, p < 0.001). Incubation of HeLa-NCAM/STX cells with ManProp will also result in the incorporation of SiaProp residues into other cell surface sialoglycoconjugates, which conceivably could affect neurite outgrowth independently of NCAM and PSA expression. However, no significant difference was observed in the neurite lengths on HeLa-NCAM substrate cells in the presence or absence of ManProp treatment (NCAM+ManProp: 133.4 ± 8.1 μm, n = 71). Similar data obtained from a total of three independent experiments showed a high degree of correlation after normalizing the results to outgrowth on HeLa-NCAM cells (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, incorporation of SiaProp residues had no apparent effect on the distribution of neurite lengths on substrates expressing polysialylated NCAM (Fig. 6 C). Neurite outgrowth on ManProp-treated HeLa-NCAM/STX cells was promoted to a similar degree to those on a substrate of natural polysialic acid. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that ManProp can be used to readily incorporate unnatural SiaProp into polysialic acid without altering the antiadhesive properties of PSA. Several studies have illustrated that the sialic acid biosynthesis machinery is permissive for a variety of N-acyl mannosamine precursors (26Keppler O.T. Horstkorte R. Pawlita M. Schmidts C. Reutter W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 11R-18RCrossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and that the resulting N-acyl sialic acids are accepted by the majority of sialyltransferases (27Keppler O.T. Herrmann M. von der Lieth C.W. Stehling P. Reutter W. Pawlita M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated that, although it has no effect on sialylation in general, ManBut is a metabolic inhibitor of PSA synthesis in vivo (32Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we show that ManPent is also effective in blocking PSA synthesis. Therefore, these observations indicate that ManBut and ManPent are converted to downstream metabolites that interfere with polysialyltransferase activity. We have previously demonstrated that CMP-SiaBut can act as a substrate for polysialyltransferases in the synthesis of PSA in vitro, albeit at reduced efficiency compared with CMP-sialic acid (32Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, NT2 neurons are able to incorporate low levels of N-levulinoyl sialic acid into PSA-NCAM (30Charter N.W. Mahal L.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ability of N-acyl mannosamine derivatives to act as inhibitors of PSA biosynthesis may be a consequence of poor substrate activity of the corresponding CMP-sialic acids and poor recognition of the growing PSA chain once a few residues of unnatural sialic acid have been installed. Given that polysialylation in vivo occurs during the passage of NCAM through the Golgi apparatus, a reduction in polysialyltransferase activity in the presence of CMP-SiaBut could result in little or no PSA biosynthesis on NCAM prior to the export of the glycoprotein to the cell surface. Polysialylation has a significant impact on the ability of NCAM to promote cell-cell interactions and is important in such processes as cell migration, axon outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity. Previous studies have demonstrated that polysialylation of NCAM in substratum cells promotes the growth of neurites of chick sensory neurons (7Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that ManBut can block PSA synthesis in substratum cells expressing NCAM and the polysialyltransferase STX and significantly reduce the ability of neurons to project neurites. This effect was comparable with the effect observed with the enzymatic removal of PSA using the PSA-specific endoneuraminadase Endo NE (8Angata K. Nakayama J. Fredette B. Chong K. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7182-7190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As a result, neurite outgrowth was substantially reduced to such an extent that it was similar to outgrowth on a substrate of non-polysialylated NCAM. Because ManBut treatment will result not only in the inhibition of PSA synthesis but also in the expression of SiaBut residues on other cell surface glycoconjugates, it is possible that the presence of unnatural sialic acids impeded neurite outgrowth, irrespective of PSA expression. However, ManBut treatment of substratum cells expressing NCAM alone had no significant effect on neurite outgrowth, indicating that the presence of SiaBut residues on sialoglycoconjugates was not inhibitory to neurite development. Therefore, we conclude that ManBut, as a specific inhibitor of PSA biosynthesis, can be used to modulate PSA-mediated cell behavior. The ability to inhibit PSA synthesis is restricted to mannosamine derivatives that possess at least two additional methylene groups at the N-acyl domain, compared with the natural saccharide. ManProp, which possesses one less methylene unit than the PSA biosynthesis inhibitor ManBut, does not block synthesis of PSA. Instead, SiaProp readily replaces sialic acid in the synthesis of PSA. As a consequence of the inclusion of SiaProp sialosides, the resulting polysaccharide exhibits altered antigenic properties (31Liu T. Guo Z. Yang Q. Sad S. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32832-32836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Evidence that CMP-SiaProp is not as good a substrate for polysialyltransferases as CMP-sialic acid is provided by the reduced activity in vitro and a lower degree of polymerization in vivo with HeLa-NCAM/STX (32Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Despite this, sufficient SiaProp-containing polysialic acid is generated on NCAM to promote neurite outgrowth of chick dorsal root ganglia neurons. Furthermore, the presence of an additional methylene group in the N-acyl group did not affect the ability of PSA to modulate NCAM-dependent neurite extension. This evidence indicates that replacement of sialic acid with SiaProp in PSA does not hinder the ability of the polymer to perform its antiadhesive function. In summary, ManBut, as a PSA biosynthesis inhibitor, can modulate cell-cell interactions that are normally affected by polysialylation of NCAM. ManBut is the first example of a small molecule inhibitor of PSA biosynthesis, and here we have illustrated its potential for use in studying the role of PSA in modifying neuronal behavior important in development and plasticity. Because PSA-NCAM expression in tumor cells has been associated with metastasis and poor patient prognosis (5Tanaka F. Otake Y. Nakagawa T. Kawano Y. Miyahara R. Li M. Yanagihara K. Nakayama J. Fujimoto I. Ikenaka K. Wada H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3072-3080PubMed Google Scholar), the ability to block PSA synthesis using a small molecule inhibitor such as ManBut could significantly reduce the probability of cell migration and growth of PSA-expressing tumors (20Hildebrandt H. Becker C. Glüer S. Rösner H. Gerardy-Schahn R. Rahmann H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SiaProp is readily incorporated into polysialic acid without altering its antiadhesive properties. The combination of incorporation of SiaProp in PSA without loss of function and the altered immunoreactivity of poly(SiaProp) provides a means to readily label and identify de novoexpression of PSA.

The receptors release their ligands into the acidic environment of the late endosome and then return to the trans-Golgi network to repeat the process. However, the mechanism that facilitates ligand binding and dissociation upon changes in pH is not known. We report the crystal structure of the extracytoplasmic domain of the homodimeric cation-dependent MPR in a ligand-free form at pH 6.5. A comparison of the ligand-bound and ligand-free structures reveals a significant change in quaternary structure as well as a reorganization of the binding pocket, with the most prominent change being the relocation of a loop (residues Glu134–Cys141). The movements involved in the bound-to-free transition of the cation-dependent MPR are reminiscent of those of the oxy-to-deoxy hemoglobin transition. These results allow us to propose a mechanism by which the receptor regulates its ligand binding upon changes in pH; the pK a of Glu133appears to be responsible for ligand release in the acidic environment of the late endosomal compartment, and the pK avalues of the sugar phosphate and His105 are accountable for its inability to bind ligand at the cell surface where the pH is about 7.4.

A well characterized function of this receptor family is its ability to target newly synthesized acid hydrolases to the lysosome. During their transport through the Golgi complex, acid hydrolases acquire a mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)1recognition marker on their N-linked oligosaccharides that serves as a high affinity ligand for the receptors. The resulting receptor-acid hydrolase complex is transported to late endosomal compartments. Upon encountering the lower pH of this prelysosomal compartment, the complex dissociates. The hydrolytic enzymes are then packaged into lysosomes, and the uncomplexed receptors move back to the Golgi where the process is repeated numerous times for a single receptor (1Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 2Munier-Lehmann H. Mauxion F. Bauer U. Lobel P. Hoflack B. J. Biol.

The 46-kDa cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) and the 300-kDa insulin-like growth factor II/cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGFII/CI-MPR) are the two known members of the P-type lectin family, both of which are type I membrane glycoproteins. Carbohydrate-binding proteins have historically been divided into two subgroups. The group I carbohydrate-binding proteins, which include periplasmic transport proteins and some enzymes, typically envelop their ligands in deep pockets. In contrast, group II carbohydrate-binding proteins, which include lectins, typically bind their ligands in shallow clefts on the protein surface (4Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Our recent crystallographic studies of the CD-MPR in complex with ligands containing phosphomannosyl residues reveal that this P-type lectin is unusual with respect to the architecture of its carbohydrate-binding pocket when compared with the majority of animal and plant lectins; the CD-MPR has a relatively deep binding pocket, which essentially buries the terminal sugar ring and phosphate group (5Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the CD-MPR displays similarities with the group I, but not the group II, carbohydrate-binding proteins. Another feature commonly observed among both animal and plant lectins is the lack of any conformational change evoked upon binding ligand. To determine whether the conformation of the CD-MPR is dependent upon the presence of bound carbohydrate, we have solved the structure of the extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR in a ligand-free state at pH 6.5. Our results demonstrate that, unlike other lectins, the CD-MPR undergoes a dramatic change both in its quaternary structure and in the positioning of a loop (residues Glu134–Cys141) upon carbohydrate binding. The glycosylation-deficient extracytoplasmic domain (Asn81/STOP155) of the bovine CD-MPR was generated as described previously (7Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was grown inTrichoplusia ni 5B1–4 (High Five) insect cells and purified to near homogeneity by pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (8Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Protein was dialyzed extensively against buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 50 mm imidizole, pH 6.5, to remove the Man-6-P present from the purification procedure. Crystallization was carried out at 19 °C by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method (9McPherson A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) by mixing equal volumes of the purified protein solution (10 mg/ml) with the precipitating solution (25% (w/v) polyethyleneglycol 5000 monomethylether, 0.2 m ammonium acetate in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5). The crystal was mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary tube, and diffraction data were collected at 4 °C on an R-AXIS IIC image plate detector system with a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA with a graphite monochromator. The crystal belongs to the I4 space group with unit cell parameters a = 108.7 Å and c = 72.6 Å.

One data set was collected, the crystal was then translated, and another data set was collected from the same crystal. The two data sets were then merged to yield a final set at 2.2Å resolution.

This 154-residue soluble, glycosylation-deficient form of the receptor (Asn81/Stop155), which lacks both the 25-residue transmembrane and 67-residue carboxyl-terminal domains and contains substitutions (Asn replaced with Gln) at four (residues 31, 57, 68, and 87) of the five potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1 b), has previously been shown to bind the lysosomal enzyme β-glucuronidase with an affinity identical to that of the full-length receptor (8Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We now report the structure of Asn81/STOP155 in the absence of ligand at pH 6.5, which has been refined to 2.2 Å resolution with good geometry (Fig. 2 a). Electron densities of all but the first two amino acid residues are clearly defined. Only one N-acetylglucosamine residue of the oligosaccharide chain is visible on Asn81, suggesting that the remainder of the oligosaccharide is flexible. The overall topology of the monomer polypeptide fold (Fig. 2 a) is the same as that of the ligand-bound form (Fig. 1 a); it consists of a flattened β-barrel made of nine strands and a short α-helix located at the amino terminus. As in the structure of the ligand-bound forms of the CD-MPR, crystals of the ligand-free receptor also contain one dimer per asymmetric unit. A comparison of the two-monomer peptide chains reveals them to be essentially identical with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.15 Å for 151 Cα atoms. However, in the absence of ligand the individual monomer peptide chain shows a significant difference from that of the pentamannosyl phosphate-bound structure (Protein Data Bank code 1C39), having an r.m.s. deviation of 2.6 Å for 151 Cα atoms, with the main differences occurring in the positioning of loops A, C, and D (Fig.2 b). In the absence of ligand, loop A and loop C move away from the dimer interface. Ser41 on loop A is displaced by 4.1 Å from its position in the pentamannosyl phosphate-bound structure whereas His105 on loop C is relocated by 2.9 Å. However, by far the most dramatic change is observed in the position of loop D. In the absence of ligand, residues Glu134–Cys141 of loop D along with Glu133 of β-strand 8 and Phe142 of β-strand 9 comprise a flap that flips toward the binding pocket in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2, b and c), with Val138 displaying the largest displacement (Cα–Cα distance of 16.4 Å).Figure 2a, crystal structure of Asn81/STOP155 in the absence of ligand.b, Superposition of the monomer structures of Asn81/Stop155 and ligand-bound (purple) and unbound (gray) structures.

Loop D is labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This transition of loop D from the “open” conformation in the bound state to the “closed” conformation in the ligand-free state has intriguing consequences for the binding site. Previous mutagenesis studies have shown that residues Gln66, Arg111, Glu133, and Tyr143 are essential for binding to pentamannosyl phosphate, whereas mutation of residues Tyr45, His105, or Arg135 results in only partial inhibition of carbohydrate binding (16Olson L.J. Hancock M.K. Dix D. Kim J.-J.P. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36905-36911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the bound state, these seven residues are all within hydrogen-bonding distance of the terminal sugar moiety (Fig.3 a). If the CD-MPR followed the precedent set by the other lectins, one would expect these essential residues to be within hydrogen-bonding distance to water molecules, which occupy the binding pocket in the ligand-free structure (17Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). However, this is not the case. There are four detectable water molecules in the binding pocket of the ligand-free form of the receptor (Fig. 3 c). Of the four seen, one (W1) is also present in the pentamannosyl phosphate-bound CD-MPR (Fig. 3 a). Of the remaining three water molecules, W2 contacts Asn104, W3 bridges Glu134 to Gly136 (main chain carbonyl oxygen), and W4 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Tyr45. However, none of these three water molecules (W2, W3, W4) are in the same position otherwise held by a hydroxyl group of the sugar in the ligand-bound structure. This is due to relocation of residues in loop A (containing Tyr45), loop C (containing Asn104), and loop D (containing Glu134 and Gly136) when the receptor releases its ligand. The CD-MPR appears to use a series of hydrogen bonds among residues in and near the binding pocket to maintain the integrity of the site in the absence of ligand. Residues of loop D are in position to form essential hydrogen bonds in this network because of the reorientation of this loop (Fig. 3, a–c). In the ligand-free conformation (Fig. 3 c), the carboxyl group of Glu133 bridges between the guanidinium group of Arg135 and the hydroxyl of Tyr47 (β-strand 2). The carboxyl group of Glu134 of loop D is able to hydrogen bond to both the backbone nitrogen of Cys141 as well as the δ nitrogen of the imidazole ring of His105. Meanwhile the backbone carbonyl of Glu134 is in position to form hydrogen bonds to both the hydroxyl of Tyr143 and the γ-amide group of Gln66. In both the bound and unbound forms the hydroxyl of Tyr143 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the ε nitrogen of Arg111. These results demonstrate that the side chains of three (Gln66, Arg111, and Tyr143) of the four residues that are critical for carbohydrate recognition are held in nearly identical positions in both the absence and presence of the ligand. In the ligand-free state, this balance is accomplished by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds, with important roles being played by Glu133 (the fourth critical residue for carbohydrate recognition), Glu134, and Arg135.

Although many lectins exist in a dimeric or higher oligomeric state, none have been shown to date to undergo significant changes in their quaternary structure upon the binding or release of ligand. Surprisingly we found that the association of the two individual polypeptide chains of the CD-MPR dimer differs dramatically in the ligand-bound versus ligand-free state, with an r.m.s. deviation of 4.1 Å for the 302 Cα atoms of the two dimers (Fig. 4, a andb). A careful comparison of the two structures reveals that the “free-to-bound” transition requires an ∼30° scissor motion (15°/blade) with respect to the 2-fold axis (Z axis) on the XZ plane (Fig. 4 a) and an ∼12° twist along the Z axis pivoting at the center of the dimer molecule (Fig. 4 b). The quaternary structural change resulting from this scissoring and twisting motion preserves the exact molecular 2-fold symmetry of the dimeric molecule. This is very reminiscent of the quaternary structural change observed in the deoxy-to-oxy transition of hemoglobin (20Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar, 21Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The more closed structure of the ligand-free CD-MPR is analogous to theT-state of deoxy hemoglobin, and the open structure of the ligand-bound receptor compares to the R-state of oxy-hemoglobin. However, it is not known at the present time whether there is any allosteric effect in the ligand binding mechanism of CD-MPR. The open/close effect of the dimer interface is also illustrated by the change in the distance between the individual ligand binding sites; the Cα atoms of His105 located at the tip of loop C are 26.6 and 34.3 Å apart, respectively, in the absence and presence of ligand (Fig. 4, a andb). The scissoring and twisting motion the monomers undergo relative to each other also causes a change in the size of the interface area (Fig.5, a and b). In the presence of ligand, either Man-6-P or pentamannosyl phosphate, the CD-MPR has a buried surface at the interface of ∼2000 Å2/dimer and corresponds to a total of 30 residues being solvent-inaccessible (Fig. 1 b). In the absence of ligand, the dimer interface decreases by ∼500 to 1536 Å2 and corresponds to a total of 24 residues being solvent-inaccessible (Fig.1 b). The changes in the interface area are also reflected in changes to the overall shape of the interface. In the presence of ligand, the inaccessible molecular surface may be described as “Y”-shaped with the two “arms” positioned ∼45° apart on a central circular region (Fig. 5 a). In the absence of ligand, the interface loses both arms and condenses down to an oval-shaped region (Fig. 5 b). Two regions are responsible for the major changes observed in the solvent accessibility status of the ligand-bound versus ligand-free forms of the receptor; residues Val9, Gly10, Ser16, and Lys18 located within/near the amino-terminal loop and residues Glu133, Glu134, Gly136, Lys137, and Val138 located within/near loop D become solvent-accessible in the absence of ligand (Figs. 1 band 5, a and b). In addition to the changes observed in the solvent accessibility of a number of residues, the nature of the amino acids comprising the interface of this receptor differ depending on whether the protein is in a ligand-bound or ligand-free state. The CD-MPR as a whole is composed of 43% nonpolar residues (Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Met, Tyr, Trp, and Pro), 28% polar residues (Ser, Cys, Thr, Asn, and Gln), and the remaining 29% charged residues (His, Lys, Arg, Asp, and Glu). The buried interface in the presence of ligand is very similar in composition to that of the whole protein: 43% nonpolar, 27% polar, and 30% charged. In the absence of ligand, the interface becomes less nonpolar (38%) and contains more polar (29%) and charged (33%) residues, reflecting the change in solvent accessibility of the residues of the amino-terminal loop and loop D. Therefore, the release of ligand increases the hydrophilicity of the buried interface, which may increase the propensity of the two polypeptide chains in the dimer to move relative to each other depending on the pH and ionic strength of the environment. Currently, there are more than 100 lectin structures available in the Protein Data Bank representing a wide range of lectin family members. Of the structures we have examined in which there are both a ligand-bound and ligand-free structure available, none show substantial alterations in their tertiary/quaternary structure upon carbohydrate binding.

L. ochrusisolectin I shows a slight displacement of residues 208–211 in the presence of ligand, but this movement varies with the packing environment, and the r.m.s. deviation is less than 0.4 Å for backbone atoms of the two dimers (22Bourne Y. Roussel A. Frey M. Rouge P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Proteins. 1990; 8: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The pea lectin complex has been reported to experience a 1.1 Å shift of a loop (residues 216–218) toward the carbohydrate (23Rini J.M. Hardman K.D. Einspahr H. Suddath F.L. Carver J.P. J. Biol.

Animal lectins follow the same trend set by the plant lectins of little to no change in structure upon ligand binding, as evidenced by the structures of the mannose-binding protein (33Ng K.K.

The structure of Asn81/STOP155 solved in the absence of ligand provides insights into the functioning of the receptor. Unlike other lectins we have examined, this receptor appears to be unique in several structural aspects. In the absence of ligand, the receptor dimer closes to change a number of the intermonomer contacts. This raises the intriguing possibility that changes in the quaternary structure of the extracytoplasmic ligand-binding domains may be translated to the cytosolic region in the full-length receptor. This conformational change may in turn be relayed to an accessory adaptor protein(s), which could affect intracellular trafficking. Sandholzeret al. (36Sandholzer U. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14132-14138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have recently reported the results of a series of studies using chimeric receptors in which the cytoplasmic and/or transmembrane domains of the CD-MPR and IGFII/CI-MPR were exchanged. Analysis of the ability of the resulting chimeric receptors to internalize Man-6-P-containing ligands and to efficiently sort lysosomal enzymes provided evidence that MPR trafficking is influenced by the ligand binding region of the protein. Another structurally significant difference between the CD-MPR and other lectins resides in the large movement of residues within a loop. In the presence of ligand, loop D forms a side of the binding pocket, and residues Glu133 and Arg135 interact with the ligand. In the absence of ligand, the loop swings into a position which allows Glu133, Glu134, and Arg135 to interact with residues of the binding pocket to form a hydrogen bond network that may serve to stabilize the pocket and keep the side chains of critical residues poised to bind ligand. However, the interaction of residues of loop D with the binding pocket does not appear to be a case of peptide mimicry as has been reported for concanavalin A (37Jain D. Kaur K.J. Goel M. Salunke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or peanut lectin (28Ravishankar R. Thomas C.J. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Proteins. 2001; 43: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), because the residues of loop D do not substitute for the mannose ring. In contrast, other lectins utilize tightly bound water molecules to serve as “place-holders” for the sugar hydroxyl groups (17Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Although the definitive analysis of the structural basis for the pH dependence of ligand binding must await a more complete structural analysis of the CD-MPR at various pH values, it is now possible to propose a plausible mechanism that facilitates ligand binding and unloading upon pH changes. The ligand binding affinity of the CD-MPR displays inflections at both high and low pH with a maximum at approximately pH 6.4 (38Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7970-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Distler J.J. Patel R. Jourdian G.W. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Watanabe H. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8036-8040Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The apparent pK a of the acidic side of the maximum (i.e. the low pH inflection point) is at pH ∼5.2. Among the residues that are responsible for sugar binding is Glu133, which makes hydrogen bonds to both 2′-OH and 3′-OH of the terminal sugar moiety of the bound ligand. Glu133 also makes a hydrogen bond with Tyr143, which in turn makes a hydrogen bond with Arg111, both of which are also essential residues for ligand binding. Although the pK a of the γ-carboxylate of glutamic acid is normally about 4.1, it is not unusual for the pK avalue to shift by up to 3 pH units depending on its microenvironment (41Nandy A. Kieweg V. Krautle F.G. Vock P. Kuchler B. Bross P. Kim J.J. Rasched I. Ghisla S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12402-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the pH dependence of ligand binding at the acidic side of the pH maximum is at least partially attributable to Glu133. On the other hand, the apparent pK a of the basic side of the binding maximum is about 7.0. This corresponds to the pK a2 (6.4) for the acid dissociation of the sugar phosphate moiety (42Westcott K.R. Searles R.P. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6101-6107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This value is also close to the pK a of a histidine residue. Thus, it is not unreasonable to assume that His105, the only residue in which a side chain is involved in the binding of the phosphate moiety of the ligand, is accountable for the basic side of the maximum of the pH dependence. It is interesting to note that residues 102–105 (Tyr-Asp-Asn-His) are missing in the sequences of the two Man-6-P recognition sites of the IGF-II/CI-MPR (5Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which, unlike the CD-MPR, binds the Man-6-P ligand at the cell surface where the pH is around 7.4 (38Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7970-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Watanabe H. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8036-8040Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The combination of the two pH effects are responsible for the optimal binding of the CD-MPR to Man-6-P at a pH value around 6.5. Overall, the CD-MPR appears to be structurally dynamic. It is possible that the structure we observe at pH 6.5 in the absence of ligand is an intermediate along the pathway taken by the receptor as it moves from the trans-Golgi network to the acidic late endosomal compartment. Therefore, future studies will be aimed at structural analyses of the receptor at various pH conditions. These additional structures, along with biochemical approaches, will confirm the above proposed mechanism by which the CD-MPR: 1) is able to bind lysosomal enzymes optimally in the Golgi (i.e. ∼pH 6.5); 2) is able to release its ligand in the acidic environment (i.e. pH < 6.0) of late endosomal compartments; and 3) is unable to interact with lysosomal enzymes at the cell surface (i.e. pH 7.4). Furthermore, these structures will enable us to define a plausible sequence of structural changes during the transformation of the receptor molecule from the ligand-bound to ligand-free state (and vice versa) involving tertiary and quaternary structural changes such as loop flippings and changes at the receptor's dimer interface."

Tryptophan-activated TRAP negatively regulates expression by binding to specific mRNA sequences and either promoting transcription termination or blocking translation initiation. Conversely, the accumulation of uncharged tRNATrp induces synthesis of an anti-TRAP protein (AT), which forms a complex with TRAP and inhibits its activity. In this report, we investigate the structural features of TRAP required for AT recognition. A collection of TRAP mutant proteins was examined that were known to be partially or completely defective in tryptophan binding and/or RNA binding. Analyses of AT interactions with these proteins were performed using in vitro transcription termination assays and cross-linking experiments. We observed that TRAP mutant proteins that had lost the ability to bind RNA were no longer recognized by AT. Our findings suggest that AT acts by competing with messenger RNA for the RNA binding domain of TRAP. B. subtilis AT was also shown to interact with TRAP proteins fromBacillus halodurans and Bacillus stearothermophilus, implying that the structural elements required for AT recognition are conserved in the TRAP proteins of these species.

Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Six of the seven trpbiosynthetic genes are clustered in the trpECDFBA operon, whereas the seventh, trpG, is located in the folate operon (2Gollnick P. Babitzke P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2001: 233-244Google Scholar). TRAP also regulates expression of yhaG (3Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2329-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a gene specifying a protein presumably involved in tryptophan transport, and possibly another gene, of unknown function, ycbK (4Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which tryptophan-activated TRAP regulates expression of all of these target genes depend on its ability to bind a specific RNA sequence, designated a TRAP binding site. The site is composed of multiple (G/U)AG repeats, generally separated by 2 nucleotides (5Babitzke P. Bear D.G. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By binding to this site in trp leader RNA, tryptophan-activated TRAP promotes formation of a terminator structure, as opposed to the alternative antiterminator structure (6Shimotsu H. Kuroda M.I. Yanofsky C. Henner D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 461-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This causes transcription termination in the leader region upstream of the trp operon structural genes (7Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TRAP binding has a second effect ontrp operon expression; when bound to the leader segment of the trp operon read-through transcript, it stabilizes an RNA hairpin structure that sequesters the trpE Shine-Dalgarno sequence, reducing trpE translation (8Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Du H. Babitzke P. J. Biol.

This may influence expression of the entire operon, via translational coupling and transcriptional polarity (10Yakhnin H. Babiarz J.E. Yakhnin A.V. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5918-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Regulation of trpG, and presumably yhaG and ycbK, also occurs at the translational level. In the translation initiation segments of these coding regions, the TRAP binding site overlaps the Shine-Dalgarno sequence; thus, TRAP binding would directly impede ribosome binding (3Sarsero J.P.

TRAP is composed of 11 identical subunits arranged as a doughnut-shaped molecule. Eleven tryptophan binding sites are formed by segments of adjacent TRAP subunits. Tryptophan binds to these 11 sites cooperatively. Tryptophan is believed to induce a conformational change on TRAP's surface, enabling it to bind cooperatively to specific sequences in TRAP RNA binding sites and wrap the messenger RNA around its periphery.In many bacterial species, both the level of free tryptophan and the extent of charging of tRNATrp are sensed as regulatory signals (22Yanofsky C. Miles E. Bauerle R. Kirschner K. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 2676-2689Google Scholar). B. subtilis also senses both of these signals (23Steinberg W. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the accumulation of uncharged tRNATrp leading to the synthesis of the anti-TRAP protein, AT (24Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), via the T-box transcription antitermination mechanism (4Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When present, AT forms a complex with tryptophan-activated TRAP, inhibiting TRAP's RNA binding ability and thereby abolishing TRAP regulation of gene expression.To identify the structural features of TRAP necessary for AT binding, we examined mutant TRAPs known to have reduced ability to bind tryptophan and/or RNA (19Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Yakhnin A.V. Trimble J.J. Chiaro C.R. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also examined one mutant TRAP that does not require tryptophan for RNA binding (20Yakhnin A.V. Trimble J.J. Chiaro C.R. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each mutant protein was initially tested for residual transcription termination activity, and was classified as lacking or retaining termination activity. These two classes of mutant TRAPs were then analyzed for their ability to interact with AT, using in vitro transcription assays and cross-linking analyses. The findings obtained indicate that AT competes with RNA for the same TRAP surface; therefore, AT binding to TRAP appears to be dependent on TRAP forming its tryptophan-induced RNA binding domain. We also observed that the TRAP features required for AT interaction are conserved in the TRAP proteins from other bacilli. In addition, B. subtilis AT efficiently inhibited B. stearothermophilus TRAP at 60 °C.DISCUSSIONCross-linking experiments performed previously with the wild type AT and TRAP proteins of B. subtilis suggested that AT recognizes a structural feature of TRAP that is formed when this protein binds tryptophan (24Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended this finding by examining a group of well characterized B. subtilis TRAP mutant proteins that are altered in tryptophan binding and/or RNA binding (19Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Yakhnin A.V. Trimble J.J. Chiaro C.R. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, we examined TRAP proteins from two other bacilli, B. halodurans and B. stearothermophilus (14Chen X. Antson A.A. Yang M. Li P. Baumann C. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This collection of mutant and wild type TRAP proteins has alterations scattered throughout the TRAP polypeptide chain (Fig. 1 A). We analyzed the interaction of each of these proteins with B. subtilis AT in an effort to define more precisely the residues within the TRAP protein that are essential for AT binding and AT inhibition.We confirmed that AT can distinguish between the inactive and tryptophan-activated conformations of TRAP and that it recognizes the latter exclusively. With only two exceptions, all of the mutant and wild type TRAP proteins examined were incapable of interacting with AT in the absence of tryptophan. The two exceptions were the tryptophan-independent mutant protein T30V and B. stearothermophilus TRAP when tested at 30 °C. The proteins T25A, T30A, and T49A, known to be completely impaired in tryptophan binding, did not interact with AT, even in the presence of tryptophan. The structure of the tryptophan-independent T30V TRAP was hypothesized to have valine-induced changes that allow this mutant protein to undergo a conformational activation comparable with that normally attained in the presence of tryptophan (20Yakhnin A.V. Trimble J.J. Chiaro C.R. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). AT did indeed recognize the activated form mimicked by the T30V protein in the absence of tryptophan. Nonetheless, the affinity of T30V TRAP for AT was lower compared with the affinity of tryptophan-activated wild type TRAP (this is also true for RNA affinity). Tryptophan addition improved AT recognition, suggesting that the T30V mutant protein only partially mimics tryptophan-activated TRAP, and that tryptophan can still bind and stabilize a more active conformation.We demonstrated that AT recognizes the tryptophan-induced RNA binding domain of TRAP. TRAP mutant proteins carrying the substitution K37A, K56A, or R58A bind tryptophan as well as wild type TRAP does. However, since one of the residues of the KKR RNA binding motif is altered, the conformational change induced by bound tryptophan does not allow strong RNA binding. In fact, the K37A/R58A double mutant protein does not bind RNA at all. Similarly, AT could still recognize the K37A, K56A, and R58A single mutant proteins but did not interact with the double mutant protein. The K37A and R58A proteins did not cross-link to AT as well as K56A did, suggesting that the residues altered in these two mutant proteins are especially crucial for AT recognition. Interactions between the K37A, K56A, and R58A mutant proteins and AT were observed in cross-linking analyses but not in in vitro transcription assays. This may indicate that the interactions are transient and are not stable enough to sequester AT and prevent its action on wild type TRAP in the in vitro transcription experiments. Band shift analyses with wild type TRAP and trp leader RNA provided independent evidence establishing that AT and RNA compete for the same surface of TRAP. Thus, it appears that AT is designed to recognize and bind to the tryptophan-activated RNA binding domain of TRAP and thereby prevent TRAP from binding to RNA.In agreement with these observations, we found that the structural features recognized by AT are conserved in the TRAP proteins fromB. halodurans and B. stearothermophilus: AT efficiently inhibited both proteins. The structure of B. stearothermophilus TRAP is known (14Chen X. Antson A.A. Yang M. Li P. Baumann C. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it was postulated that its RNA binding surface is very similar to the comparable surface ofB. subtilis TRAP (14Chen X. Antson A.A. Yang M. Li P. Baumann C. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of TRAP bound to RNA was in fact solved using B. stearothermophilus TRAP (15Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). From our results, it also appears that residues in the variable regions of TRAP, at its amino and carboxyl-terminal ends, are not crucial for AT recognition, since they are not for RNA binding (14Chen X. Antson A.A. Yang M. Li P. Baumann C. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We tested AT action at 60 °C with the thermostable B. stearothermophilus TRAP and observed that AT was active at this temperature. The trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP)1 of Bacillus subtilis coordinately regulates expression of the genes of tryptophan metabolism in response to the intracellular level of freel-tryptophan (1Babitzke P. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Six of the seven trpbiosynthetic genes are clustered in the trpECDFBA operon, whereas the seventh, trpG, is located in the folate operon (2Gollnick P. Babitzke P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2001: 233-244Google Scholar). TRAP also regulates expression of yhaG (3Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2329-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a gene specifying a protein presumably involved in tryptophan transport, and possibly another gene, of unknown function, ycbK (4Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which tryptophan-activated TRAP regulates expression of all of these target genes depend on its ability to bind a specific RNA sequence, designated a TRAP binding site. The site is composed of multiple (G/U)AG repeats, generally separated by 2 nucleotides (5Babitzke P. Bear D.G. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By binding to this site in trp leader RNA, tryptophan-activated TRAP promotes formation of a terminator structure, as opposed to the alternative antiterminator structure (6Shimotsu H. Kuroda M.I. Yanofsky C. Henner D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 461-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This causes transcription termination in the leader region upstream of the trp operon structural genes (7Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TRAP binding has a second effect ontrp operon expression; when bound to the leader segment of the trp operon read-through transcript, it stabilizes an RNA hairpin structure that sequesters the trpE Shine-Dalgarno sequence, reducing trpE translation (8Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Du H. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20494-20503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This may influence expression of the entire operon, via translational coupling and transcriptional polarity (10Yakhnin H. Babiarz J.E. Yakhnin A.V. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5918-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Regulation of trpG, and presumably yhaG and ycbK, also occurs at the translational level. In the translation initiation segments of these coding regions, the TRAP binding site overlaps the Shine-Dalgarno sequence; thus, TRAP binding would directly impede ribosome binding (3Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2329-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,4Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TRAP is composed of 11 identical subunits arranged as a doughnut-shaped molecule. Eleven tryptophan binding sites are formed by segments of adjacent TRAP subunits. Tryptophan binds to these 11 sites cooperatively. Tryptophan is believed to induce a conformational change on TRAP's surface, enabling it to bind cooperatively to specific sequences in TRAP RNA binding sites and wrap the messenger RNA around its periphery. In many bacterial species, both the level of free tryptophan and the extent of charging of tRNATrp are sensed as regulatory signals (22Yanofsky C. Miles E. Bauerle R. Kirschner K. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 2676-2689Google Scholar). B. subtilis also senses both of these signals (23Steinberg W. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the accumulation of uncharged tRNATrp leading to the synthesis of the anti-TRAP protein, AT (24Valbuzzi A. Yanofsky C. Science. 2001; 293: 2057-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), via the T-box transcription antitermination mechanism (4Sarsero J.P. Merino E. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When present, AT forms a complex with tryptophan-activated TRAP, inhibiting TRAP's RNA binding ability and thereby abolishing TRAP regulation of gene expression. To identify the structural features of TRAP necessary for AT binding, we examined mutant TRAPs known to have reduced ability to bind tryptophan and/or RNA (19Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Yakhnin A.V. Trimble J.J. Chiaro C.R. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also examined one mutant TRAP that does not require tryptophan for RNA binding (20Yakhnin A.V. Trimble J.J. Chiaro C.R. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

Point mutations in the C-terminal domain of SNAP-25 (K201E and L203E) produced a marked inhibition of secretion, whereas single (Q174K, Q53K) and double mutants (Q174K/Q53K) of amino acids from the so-called zero layer only produced a moderate alteration in secretion. The importance of the SNAP-25 C-terminal domain in exocytosis was also confirmed by the similar effect on secretion of mutations in analogous residues of synaptobrevin (A82D, L84E). The effects on the initial rate and magnitude of secretion correlated with the alteration of single vesicle fusion kinetics since the amperometric spikes from cells expressing SNAP-25 L203E and K201E and synaptobrevin A82D and L84E mutants had lower amplitudes and larger half-width values than the ones from controls, suggesting slower neurotransmitter release kinetics than that found in cells expressing the wild-type proteins or zero layer mutants of SNAP-25. We conclude that a small domain of the SNAP-25 C terminus and its counterpart in synaptobrevin play an essential role in the final membrane fusion step of exocytosis.

Point mutations in the C-terminal domain of SNAP-25 (K201E and L203E) produced a marked inhibition of secretion, whereas single (Q174K, Q53K) and double mutants (Q174K/Q53K) of amino acids from the so-called zero layer only produced a moderate alteration in secretion. The importance of the SNAP-25 C-terminal domain in exocytosis was also confirmed by the similar effect on secretion of mutations in analogous residues of synaptobrevin (A82D, L84E). The effects on the initial rate and magnitude of secretion correlated with the alteration of single vesicle fusion kinetics since the amperometric spikes from cells expressing SNAP-25 L203E and K201E and synaptobrevin A82D and L84E mutants had lower amplitudes and larger half-width values than the ones from controls, suggesting slower neurotransmitter release kinetics than that found in cells expressing the wild-type proteins or zero layer mutants of SNAP-25. We conclude that a small domain of the SNAP-25 C terminus and its counterpart in synaptobrevin play an essential role in the final membrane fusion step of exocytosis. soluble NSF attachment protein N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein soluble NSF attachment protein receptor green fluorescent protein Herpes simplex virus synaptobrevin The SNAP1 (soluble NSF attachment protein) receptor (SNARE) hypothesis (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) has been crucial to our understanding of the molecular machinery responsible for exocytosis. The molecular events taking place during the exocytotic fusion of cellular and vesicular membranes should provide fundamental information about the mechanism of membrane fusion common to different membrane trafficking processes (2Bennett M. Scheller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 0: 2559-2563Crossref Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The assembly of a ternary complex formed by the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin (3Bennett M.K.

A. 1988; 5: 4538-4542Crossref Scopus (451) Google Scholar) is considered to be one of the molecular events driving vesicle priming, involving maturation steps needed to promote the apposition and final fusion of membranes (6Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 75: 645-653Crossref Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). A heptad repeat structural motif typical of coiled-coils forming proteins is present and could be the basis for the formation of the core complex. This was confirmed by the observed increase in α-helix content following assembly of the complex (7Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 8Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brunger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In recent years, precise structural studies on the nature of the complex (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 10Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) have shown that single fragments of 60–70 residues of syntaxin and synaptobrevin together with two segments of SNAP-25 form helices in a four-stranded coil. Although most of the interactions between these helices are hydrophobic, there is a polar layer embedded in the middle of this rod-shaped structure formed by three glutamines and one arginine (zero layer), which is believed to be critical for SNARE complex formation. In addition, functional studies using specific neurotoxins (11Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), antibodies against critical domains (12Xu T. Rammer B. Margittal M. Artalejo A. Neher E. Jahn R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have revealed important details about the participation of SNAREs in the exocytotic process. These and other studies suggest that SNARE interaction results in a tighter structure reducing the repulsive energy barrier between vesicular and plasma membranes. Assembly of the complex may proceed from the distal N-terminal domains of SNAREs assembled in parallel and, in “zipper-like” fashion, end with the interaction of C-terminal domains relatively close to the fusion pore. Even though there is not direct evidence for this model, a number of authors suggest that SNAREs assembly is directly linked to membrane fusion (16Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar, 17Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.J. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We have overexpressed several mutants of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin critical domains in adrenal chromaffin cells and studied their effect on catecholamine secretion. Our results indicate that specific residues at the SNAP-25 C-terminal domain and the equivalent synaptobrevin domain influence vesicle fusion kinetics, suggesting a role in the very last events of the exocytotic process. By contrast, zero layer amino acid mutants, despite their ability to negatively affect the formation and stability of SNAREs complexes assembled in vitro, did not produce strong alterations. To produce an in-frame fusion of SNAP-25 to the C terminus of GFP, the cDNA corresponding to the SNAP-25a isoform (18Bark I.C. Wilson M.C. Gene. 1994; 139: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was cloned into the expression vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (14Criado M. Gil A. Viniegra S. Gutiérrez L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7256-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The generation of the nine amino acids C-terminal deletion (Δ9) and the point mutation L203E has also been described (14Criado M. Gil A. Viniegra S. Gutiérrez L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7256-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The strategy for generating the other C-terminal mutants was based in the presence of a TaiI site at the 5′-end of the region containing the nucleotides to be mutated and a BamHI site at the 3′-end. Complementary oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations and the mentioned restriction sites were annealed and cloned into the corresponding construct in place of the original sequence. The point mutation Q53K was generated by PCR of a fragment corresponding to the N terminus of SNAP-25 using the GFP-SNAP-25 construct as template, a sense primer (5′-CGGCATGGACGAGCTGTACA-3′) corresponding to the C terminus of GFP and close to the junction between GFP and SNAP-25 and an antisense primer, which included the sequence to be mutated (indicated in lower characters) (5′-CGACACGATCGAGTTGTTCTCCtttTTCAT-CCAACATAACC-3′). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and PvuI and used to replace the equivalent fragment into the GFP-SNAP-25 construct, which had been digested with the same enzymes. The point mutation Q174K was generated by PCR of a fragment corresponding to the C terminus of SNAP-25 with a sense primer containing the sequence to be mutated (5′-CAATGAGATCGATACAaAGAATCGCCAGATCG-3′) and an antisense primer downstream of the C terminus of SNAP-25 (5′-CTACAAATGTGGTATGGCTG-3′). The amplified DNA carried an internal ClaI site, close to the 5′-end, and a BamHI site at the 3′-end. These enzymes were used to substitute the original SNAP-25 sequence by the modified one in the GFP-SNAP-25 construct. The double mutant Q53K/Q174K was obtained by combining the single ones through enzyme restriction and ligation reactions. To produce an in-frame fusion of synaptobrevin to the N terminus of GFP, the coding region corresponding to synaptobrevin II (19Archer B.T. Ozcelik T. Jahn R. Franke U. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-GCCGAATTCCCGCCATGTCGGCTACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCGGATCCGAGC-TGAAGTAAACGATGATG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the same sites of the expression vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The strategy for generating the synaptobrevin mutants (A81D, A82D and L84E) was based in the presence of an SpeI site at the 5′-end of the region containing the nucleotides to be mutated and the previously mentionedBamHI site at the 3′-end. Adequate sense primers carrying the desired mutations and the SpeI site as well as the above antisense primer with the BamHI site were used in PCR amplifications. The corresponding products were used to substitute the original synaptobrevin sequence. All the introduced cassettes were sequenced to check that only the desired mutations have been produced. Chromaffin cells were prepared from bovine adrenal glands by collagenase digestion and further separated from debris and erythrocytes by centrifugation on Percoll gradients as described elsewhere (13Gutiérrez L.M. Viniegra S. Rueda J. Ferrer-Montiel A.-V. Cànaves J. Montal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in monolayer cultures using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside, 10 μm5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 in 35-mm Petri dishes. Primary cultures of chromaffin cells were infected with a Herpes Simplex virus (HSV-1) amplicon containing the constructs described above. For this purpose they were transferred from the pEGFP-C3 or pEGFP-N1 vectors to the pHSVpUC vector (20Geller A.I. During M.J. Haycock J.W. Freese A. Neve R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 7603-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The packaging of the different helper viruses (HSV-1 IE2 deletion mutant 5dl 1.2) was carried out as previously described (21Lim F. Hartley D. Starr P. Lang P. Song S. Yu L. Wang Y. Geller A.I. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Efficiency of virus infection was determined by fluorescent microscopy, using serial dilutions of purified virus. The dilution producing 15–20% infection efficiency (usually 30–40 μl virus per 35-mm plate containing 1 ml of medium) was chosen in further experiments. GFP fluorescence was observed 1 day after infection and persisted, at least, during the two following days. Amperometric measurements were carried out during this time. To study secretory activity from control non-infected and fluorescence-emitting cells expressing the different constructs, culture media was replaced by Krebs/HEPES basal solution with the following composition (in mm): NaCl 134, KCl 4.7, KH2PO4 1.2, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 2.5, Glucose 11, ascorbic acid 0.56, and Hepes 15, and the pH value was adjusted to 7.4 using a NaOH solution. Carbon-fiber electrodes insulated with polypropylene and with 11-μm diameter tips were used to monitor catecholamine release from individual chromaffin granules in cells under superfusion (22Gil A. Viniegra S. Gutiérrez L.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Electrodes were carefully positioned in close apposition to the cell surface using high precision hydraulic micromanipulation and assessing cell membrane deformation with an Axiovert 135 inverted-stage microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) mounting Hoffman optics (Modulation Optics, Greenvale, NY). Electrical connection was accomplished with mercury. An amperometric potential of +650 mVversus an Ag/AgCl bath reference electrode was applied using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Current product of the catecholamine oxidation was digitized with an analogical/digital converter (ITC-16, Instrutech Corp., Great Neck, NY) and recorded at 200 μs/point using the program PulseControl (23Herrington J. Bookman R.J. Pulse Control V4.3: IGOR XOPs for Patch Clamp Data Acquisition and Capacitance Measurements. University of Miami Press, Miami, FL1994Google Scholar) running on top of the graphical software Igor Pro (Wavematrics, Lake Oswego, OR) in a PowerMac 7100 computer. Experiments were performed in cells stimulated by superfusion with depolarizing 59 mm high potassium (obtained by replacing isosmotically NaCl by KCl) and applied through a valve-controlled puffer tip commanded by the acquisition software and located near the studied cells. Individual spike characteristics were studied using Igor-Pro macros called “Spike” versus 1.0 (24Segura F. Brioso M.A. Gomez J.F. Machado D. Borges R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 103: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) supplied by Dr. Ricardo Borges (Unidad de Farmacologı́a, Universidad de la Laguna, Tenerife, Spain), allowing for peak detection, integration, and kinetic parameter calculations. Oxidized current was filtered at a corner frequency of 400 Hz using an 8-poles low-pass Bessel filter and acquired at 0.2 ms/point. Only well defined narrow peaks with amplitude higher than 5 pA and the width at the half-height (half-width) lower than 75 ms were taken to build event histograms. Electrode to electrode variations were alleviated by using the same electrodes for measurements in control (non-infected) and infected cells (electrode tip was frequently cleaned with isobutanol). Controls were taken before and after (post-control) performing measurements in infected cells, and peak analysis included experiments performed in 23–66 cells in each condition. After obtaining the mean spike parameters for each individual cell, they were average for the number (n) of cells analyzed in each experimental condition (25Colliver T.L. Hess E.J. Pothos E.N. Sulzer D. Ewing A.G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1086-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The analysis of variance test implemented in the program Graphpad Instat was used for statistical analysis comparing SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin control and post-control parameters with the values obtained for the different mutants. All data was expressed as mean ± S.E. from experiments performed in a number (n) of individual cells. Data represent experiments performed with cells from at least three different cultures. Briefly, cells overexpressing GFP-synaptobrevin constructs were fixed using a 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline solution during 20 min. Then cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution and mounted in 80% glycerol in the same solution. Fluorescence was investigated using a Laser Scanning confocal TCS Leika microscope. Usually, eight confocal layers covering the total cell volume were obtained (1.25-μm thickness (z)), and individual layers or projections were used to study fluorescence distribution. GST fusion proteins encoding SNAP-25, syntaxin, and synaptobrevin were produced by cloning their respective cDNAs in the pGEX-KG vector (26Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The different SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin mutants were transferred to pGEX-KG either through the NcoI site present in the initial methionine of SNAP-25 or using an EcoRI site preceding the coding region of synaptobrevin, thus ensuring the proper reading frame in the GST fusions. Recombinant proteins were purified from expressing bacteria (Escherichia coli BL21 strain for SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin and C43 strain for syntaxin) after expression induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside during 5 h at 37 °C. The constructs were bound to affinity columns of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in overnight incubations, and after extensive washing the proteins were eluted by proteolysis with thrombin, followed by inactivation of this protein with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Formation of ternary complexes by the purified proteins at a 4-μm concentration and room temperature was assessed in buffer: 100 mm NaCl, 0.005% octylglucoside, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm HEPES,pH 7.5. After incubation periods comprised between 10 s and 60 min, 10-μl aliquots were removed, and complex formation was stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE buffer (0.1% SDS, 10% (v/v), glycerol, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue in 0.062m Tris, pH 6.8). Complex thermostability was assayed by forming complexes during 1-h incubations in the conditions described above and heating samples during 3 min at temperatures ranging from 40 to 90 °C after addition of electrophoresis buffer. Complex dissociation was stopped by cooling the samples to 4 °C before complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Overexpression of native and mutant forms of SNAP-25 in chromaffin cells is a valuable tool when studying its role in neurosecretion (14Criado M. Gil A. Viniegra S. Gutiérrez L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7256-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Wei S. Xu T. Ashery U. Kollewe A. Matti U. Antonin W. Rettig J. Neher E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In initial studies we used calcium phosphate and electroporation transfection methods, resulting in low levels of transfection (less than 1%). We therefore decided to use amplicons, modified HSV (27Spaete R.R. Frenkel N. Cell. 1982; 30: 285-304Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Viral infection produced a greater proportion (15–30%) of cells expressing high amounts of GFP-SNAP-25 constructs, as indicated by their brilliant green fluorescence. We used single cell amperometry (11 micron carbon fiber electrodes) to test the ability of these cells to secrete catecholamines in response to a depolarizing stimulus. Upon stimulation, characteristic spikes depicting single fusion events were obtained for a number of individual cells (Fig.1 A). The secretory profile was obtained by the integration and averaging of amperograms from 22 to 60 cells under each experimental condition (Fig. 1 B). HSV-infected cells incorporating the GFP-SNAP-25 construct and cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 1, A and B) produced about 50% of the secretory activity normally found in uninfected cells (not shown). The close match of GFP and GFP-SNAP-25 secretory rates when normalized, indicates that secretory kinetics were unaffected by expression of the GFP-SNAP-25 construct and that the reduction in the number of released vesicles observed in infected cells was due to the viral infection itself rather than to a possible inhibition of the secretory machinery by overexpression of SNAP-25. Validity of the HSV amplicon system for testing SNAP-25 function was further confirmed by the catecholamine release in cells overexpressing a GFP-SNAP-25 construct incorporating the mutation of leucine 203 to glutamic acid (L203E) that had previously been shown to greatly affect secretion kinetics (14Criado M. Gil A. Viniegra S. Gutiérrez L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7256-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The expression of this construct partially abrogated the overall extent of the secretory response (Fig. 1 A shows a 70% reduction in the sustained response compared with the control GFP-SNAP-25 construct), and initial rate of release (Fig.1 B, about 0.2 vesicles/s, 32% of the rate found for the GFP-SNAP-25 construct). These results are consistent with those obtained by conventional transfection methods (14Criado M. Gil A. Viniegra S. Gutiérrez L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7256-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similar results (Fig. 1 B) were observed using a construct lacking the last nine C-terminal residues of this SNARE (GFP-SNAP-25 Δ9) and therefore equivalent to the proteolyzed form produced by the action of botulinum toxin A (28Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E. Binz T. De Yamasaki S. Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 29Schiavo G. Santucci A. Dasgupta B.R. Mehta P.P. Jontes J. Benfenati F. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the amino acid L203, which is absent in this construct as well as in the SNAP-25 polypeptide cleaved by botulinum neurotoxin A, is critical for exocytosis. The amplicon system was further used to examine the secretory response of cells expressing SNAP-25 proteins mutated at amino acids located in critical areas. It has been suggested that amino acid residues in the zero layer (Gln-53 and Gln-174 of SNAP-25) are critical for SNARE complex formation (9Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 30Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The single mutation in Q174K showed a relatively small effect on secretion when compared with the L203E mutant (both magnitude and initial rate of catecholamine release were reduced 35% in comparison to control values, see Fig. 1, Aand B). A slight effect was also observed with the Q53K mutation (also present in the zero layer but forming part of the SNAP-25 N-terminal domain), which released 15+2 vesicles (n = 20) during prolonged depolarization (52% inhibition, data not shown) Double mutations in the previously mentioned glutamines (Q53K/Q174K) produced lower inhibition (50% in extent and initial rate of secretion, Fig. 1 B) than that obtained with L203E. Although these data imply a role for the zero layer in secretion, it appears to be less important than the part played by Leu-203 at the SNAP-25 C terminus. To assess the importance of regions flanking Leu-203 in molecular events leading to membrane fusion we studied the possible role of residues at the SNAP-25 C-terminal domain in this process. To this end we mutated Ala-199 and Met-202, which have been, respectively, assigned to the seventh and eighth hydrophobic layers of the four-helix bundle in the synaptic fusion complex (30Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), as well as Lys-201, which is located in between these two. The secretory behavior of cells expressing mutants A199E and M202E was slightly affected with only the initial rate of vesicle release being slower in the M202E mutant (Fig.2). Mutant K201E had a greater inhibitory effect on the total number of vesicles secreted during cell depolarization, and the initial rate of vesicle release was also retarded (Fig. 2). These results suggest that hydrophobic amino acids in the C-terminal domain of SNAP-25, such as Leu-203 and to a lesser extent Met-202, play a relevant role in membrane fusion events leading to exocytosis and that electrostatic interactions through residue Lys-201 could also be involved in this process. Current structural data suggest that several hydrophobic synaptobrevin amino acids such as Ala-81, Ala-82, and Leu-84 could interact with Leu-203 of SNAP-25. We therefore decided to mutate these synaptobrevin residues in GFP constructs linked to the synaptobrevin II C-terminal domain, which were also overexpressed following amplicon infection of bovine chromaffin cells (Fig.3). Constructs with wild-type synaptobrevin (Fig. 3 A) as well as the A81D (Fig.3 B), A82D (Fig. 3 C), and L84E (Fig.3 D) mutants, were expressed at similar levels in a punctate pattern suggesting their location in chromaffin vesicles. The secretory activity of cells expressing these constructs was studied using depolarizing stimuli. Cells expressing wild-type synaptobrevin coupled to GFP (SV WT) had an exocytotic behavior resembling that observed in cells expressing GFP and the GFP construct coupled to wild-type SNAP-25 (Fig. 4) in that neither the kinetics nor the level of secretion obtained after 1 min of continuous depolarization was modified. Expression of mutant A81D had a relatively low impact on the release of catecholamines, which showed a 35% inhibition in both overall extent and initial rate of release (Fig. 4). Mutants A82D and L84E had a more pronounced effect on secretory behavior, reaching levels close to 70% inhibition (Fig. 4) similar to that observed in the mutant L203E of SNAP-25. These data strengthen the notion that these synaptobrevin and SNAP-25 hydrophobic residues have a marked and perhaps related influence on secretory behavior.Figure 4Depolarization-evoked secretion in chromaffin cells overexpressing different GFP-synaptobrevin constructs.Secretion was monitored by amperometry as described in previous figures. After building of event cumulative responses for individual cells, the average secretion was obtained from control GFP-synaptobrevin wild-type; SV WT, (n = 42 cells), SV A81D (n = 26), SV A82D(n = 27), and SV L84E (n = 26).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The study of individual fusion kinetics could be potentially useful in elucidating the mechanisms behind the differential effects of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin mutants. This is possible by analyzing the shape of single amperometric events (31Schroeder T.J. Borges R. Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Amatore C. Wightman R.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) occurring in the proximity of the carbon fiber electrode. A semi-automatic analysis was performed using software (24Segura F. Brioso M.A. Gomez J.F. Machado D. Borges R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 103: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that measured spike amplitude, half-width, and event charge and selecting well separated spikes with amplitudes over 5 pA and half-width values lower than 75 ms. The collected data were binned to generate distribution histograms for means obtained from individual cell analysis in which parameters were obtained for each individual cell and later averaged, similar to the ones shown for the entire event population in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table I. Non infected cells and cells expressing GFP-SNAP-25 or GFP-synaptobrevin were characterized by very similar distributions, showing means taken from averaged individual cell amplitudes of 70, 59, and 50 pA, respectively (Table I). Amplitudes were also similar in cells expressing single (Q174K, Fig.5 D and Table I; Q53K, Table I) and double (Q174K/Q53K, TableI) mutants of the zero layer as well as A199E and M202E mutants of the SNAP-25 C terminus (Table I). However, the mean amplitudes obtained with L203E (Fig. 5 G and Table I) and K201E mutants (Table I) were clearly reduced to almost half of the control value. Moreover, amplitudes over 75 pA, which were relatively abundant in control cells were less frequent in these cases. These results are in good agreement with those reported for C-terminal deletions in transfected chromaffin cells (14Criado M. Gil A. Viniegra S. Gutiérrez L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The biosynthetic origin of C12-C15 and the two methoxy groups at C13 and C15 has been unclear. It was previously shown that acetate is not incorporated into C12-C15 of the macrolactone ring. Here, the acyl transferase (AT) of domain 8 in the ascomycin polyketide synthase was replaced with heterologous ATs by double homologous recombination. When AT8 was replaced with methylmalonyl-CoA-specific AT domains, the strains produced 13-methyl-13-desmethoxyascomycin, whereas when AT8 was replaced with a malonyl-specific domain, the strains produced 13-desmethoxyascomycin. These data show that ascomycin AT8 does not use malonyl- or methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate in its native context. Therefore, AT8 must be specific for a substrate bearing oxygen on the α carbon. Feeding experiments showed that [13C]glycerol is incorporated into C12-C15 of ascomycin, indicating that both modules 7 and 8 of the polyketide synthase use an extender unit that can be derived from glycerol. When AT6 of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase gene was replaced with ascomycin AT8 and the engineered gene was expressed in Streptomyces lividans, the strain produced 6-deoxyerythronolide B and 2-demethyl-6-deoxyerythronolide B. Therefore, although neither malonyl-CoA nor methylmalonyl-CoA is a substrate for ascomycin AT8 in its native context, both are substrates in the foreign context of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase. Thus, we have demonstrated a new specificity for an AT domain in the ascomycin polyketide synthase and present evidence that specificity can be affected by context.

Because these analogues could not be obtained by current chemical methods, we sought the desired analogues of ascomycin modified at C13 (Fig. 1) using PKS1 engineering (6McDaniel R. Thamchaipenet A.

The macrolactone precursor of ascomycin is biosynthesized by a large PKS complex consisting of a loading module for a shikimate-derived starter unit; 10 modules for malonyl, methylmalonyl, or other PKS extender units; and a peptide synthetase module for addition of pipecolate (8Byrne K.M.

FK520 and FK506 have methoxy groups at C13 and C15, which could be derived by post-PKS hydroxylation followed byO-methylation or by direct incorporation of an extender unit with an oxygen at the α carbon. Feeding of [13C2]acetate was reported to label C8-C9 and C20-C23 of the macrolactone ring, as expected, but not C12-C15 in either FK520 or FK506 (8Byrne K.M. Shafiee A. Nielson J. Arison B.

In the flanking regions of the FK520 cluster, additional genes were found with proposed roles in synthesis of precursors, including a putative methoxymalonyl-ACP precursor for the 13- and 15-methoxy groups of FK520 (14Wu K.

Comparison of methylmalonyl-CoA- and malonyl-CoA-specific AT domain sequences shows that they cluster into two groups with sequence motifs that diverge according to the specificity of the domain (15Haydock S.F.

More recently, AT domains specific for ethylmalonyl units have been identified, and they are most closely related to the methylmalonyl-specific domains (18Kakavas S.J. Katz L. Stassi D. J.

In addition, there is circumstantial evidence that some domains are specific for an extender unit with oxygen on the α carbon (19Haber A. Johnson R.D. Rinehart K.L.J. J. Am. Chem.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the structural basis for AT domain substrate specificity has not been established. Here we describe replacement of the ascomycin AT8 domain with AT domains specific for malonyl or methylmalonyl extender units, resulting in the production of analogues modified at C13 and showing that ascomycin AT8 is specific for an extender unit bearing oxygen on the α carbon. Precursor labeling experiments showed that ascomycin PKS modules 7 and 8 use an extender unit that can be derived from glycerol. In addition, we show that the specificity of this AT domain can be altered by placing it into a foreign PKS context. The ascomycin-producing strain, S. hygroscopicus ATCC 14891, was plated on SY medium (10 g of soluble starch, 2 g of yeast extract, and 20 g of agar per liter) to prepare spore stocks and grown in TSBGM (tryptic soy broth supplemented with 50 mm TES buffer, pH 7, and 1% glucose) for production of ascomycin or its analogues. Growth and transformation ofStreptomyces lividans K4-114 has been described previously (28Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). Use of the phage vector KC515 followed established procedures (28Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). PKS module 8 was isolated as a 4.6-kb SphI fragment from cosmid pKOS65-C31 (14Wu K. Chung L. Revill W.P. Katz L. Reeves C.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 251: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and cloned into Litmus28 (New England Biolabs), and the orientation with a unique SacI site proximal to theSpeI site of the polylinker was used (pKOS60-21). A synthetic linker was ligated between the SpeI andSacI sites and then subsequently ligated between theSphI and AflII sites to give pKOS60-29, which was used as a template to isolate regions flanking AT8 by PCR. The PCR mixtures for all reactions described herein contained (50 μl, total volume) 1 μl of template (either diluted plasmid DNA, undiluted genomic DNA, or high-titer phage stock), 10× Pfu buffer, 10× z-deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (200 μm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate except 100 μm dGTP and 100 μm 7-deaza-dGTP; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10% Me2SO, 400 nm of each primer, and 1 μl of cloned Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Reactions were cycled 25–30 times at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. To amplify the 5′-flanking region, the forward primer was 5′-CGACTCACTAGTGGGCAGATCTGGC-3′, and one of two reverse primers was used: 1) 5′-CACGCCTAGGCCGGTCGGTCTCGGGCCAC-3′, which introduced an AvrII site near the 3′ end of the ketoacyl synthase domain, or 2) 5′-GCGGCTAGCTGCTCGCCCATCGCGGGATGC-3′, which introduced an NheI site near the 5′ end of the AT boundary. These PCR products were cloned as SpeI to AvrII and SpeI to NheI fragments into Litmus28 and Litmus38, respectively, to give pKOS60-37-4 and pKOS60-37-2. The 3′-flanking region was isolated using a forward primer (5′-GATGTACAGCTCGAGTCGGCACGCCCGGCCGCATC-3′) that introduced anXhoI site at the AT/dehydratase boundary plus aBsrGI site to facilitate the construction; the reverse primer was 5′-CGACTCACTTAAGCCATGCATCC-3′. This PCR product was isolated as a BsrGI to AflII fragment and ligated into pKOS60-37-4 cut with Acc65I and AflII or pKOS60-37-2 cut with BsrGI and AflII, giving pKOS60-39-13 and pKOSS60-39-1, respectively. Heterologous AT domains were obtained by PCR using primers that introduced AvrII and XhoI or NheI andXhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Each heterologous AT was cloned into pKOS60-39-13 (AvrII-XhoI) or pKOS60-39-1 (NheI-XhoI) to create a series of AT replacement cassettes. Each replacement cassette was isolated as a BglII to NsiI fragment and ligated to KC515 DNA cut withBamHI and PstI, and the ligation mixture was introduced into S. lividans TK24 by transfection. The resulting plaques were purified, and high-titer phage stocks were prepared as described previously (28Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). Recombinant phage preparations were checked by PCR using a pair of primers annealing within the dehydratase/keto reductase-flanking sequence. Spores of S. hygroscopicus (107) were suspended in Difco nutrient broth, heat-shocked at 50 °C for 10 min, and mixed with an equal number of plaque-forming units of recombinant phage in Difco nutrient broth. The mixture was spread on R2YE plates (28Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar), and after an overnight incubation at 30 °C, plates were overlaid with 1.25 mg of thiostrepton suspended in 1 ml of H2O. After 7–10 days, sporulating colonies were streaked on SY agar containing 50 μg/ml thiostrepton. Colonies were picked from these plates after about 5 days and macerated in 200 μl of H2O using a microfuge pestle. Half the suspension was inoculated into a 25 × 150-mm tube with two 4-mm glass beads and 5 ml of TSBGM; the other half was inoculated into the same medium with 50 μg/ml thiostrepton. After 2–3 days, a 1.5-ml sample of each thiostrepton-containing culture was harvested for total DNA isolation, and a 0.75-ml sample was prepared for LC-MS analysis by adding an equal volume of MeCN and clarifying by centrifugation. DNA was isolated by the SDS, proteinase K, phenol method (28Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar) and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using the digoxigenin labeling and detection kits supplied by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Each culture grown without thiostrepton was spread on an SY agar plate to obtain spores to screen for the second recombination event. Selected spore preparations from the nonselective propagation plates above were titered and spread on several plates at about 100–200 colonies/plate. When colonies were sufficiently sporulated, they were replica-plated onto SY agar plates containing 50 μg/ml thiostrepton. After 4–5 days, putative thioS recombinants were identified and clonally isolated. These were grown in 5-ml TSBGM tube cultures for 3 days, and the broth was extracted as described above for LC-MS analysis (see below). Strains producing 13-DMA or 13-MDMA were designated KOS45-170 and KOS60-135, respectively. [13C2]Glycine and [13C3]glycerol were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. [13C2]Glycolate, a mixture of ethyl [13C2]bromoacetate (Aldrich; 98% 13C; 1.0 g), sodium acetate (1.0 g), and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (15 ml), was stirred at 80 °C for 3 h. Water was added, and the mixture was extracted three times with Et2O. The combined organic layers were washed twice with H2O, washed once with brine, and dried over Na2SO4. After removal of solvent, a clear oil (0.45 g) was obtained. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 4.59 (2H, dd, J = 149, 4.8 Hz), 4.23 (2H, qd, J = 7.2, 3.2 Hz), 2.16 (3H, s), 1.29 (3H, t, J = 7.2 Hz). The acetate was dissolved in MeOH (15 ml), 0.5 m LiOH (15 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After neutralization with 2n HCl, the mixture was extracted twice with ether. The aqueous layer was dried under high vacuum to give [13C2]lithium glycolate (508 mg; containing some sodium acetate and NaCl). 1H NMR (D2O): δ 3.88 (2H, dd, J = 143.6, 4.4 Hz). 13C NMR (D2O): δ 179.1 (d, J = 55 Hz), 60.3 (d, J = 55 Hz). [methyl-13C]Methoxyacetic acid:ethyl diazoacetate (1.8 ml) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of Rh2(OAc)4 (10 mg) in [13C]methanol (Isotec; 99 atom% 13C; 1.0 g). After 4 h, the mixture was diluted with 10 ml of hexanes and filtered through a 1 cm plug of silica gel. The silica was washed with 3:1 hexanes/ether, and the eluates were combined and concentrated to give 1.35 g of ethyl [methyl-13C]methoxyacetate as a colorless liquid. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 4.24 (2H, q,J = 7.2 Hz), 4.03 (2H, d, J CH = 4.8 Hz), 3.45 (3H, d, J CH = 142 Hz), 1.31 (3H, t, J = 7.2 Hz). The ester was dissolved in 2 ml of MeOH and treated with 10 ml of 6 n NaOH for 12 h. The mixture was extracted three times with CH2Cl2, and then the aqueous phase was acidified to below pH 2 using concentrated HCl and diluted with 100 ml of saturated aqueous NaCl before continuous extraction with ether for 24 h. The ether extract was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to yield 1.5 g of an oil. Bulb-to-bulb distillation under reduced pressure yielded clean [methyl-13C]methoxyacetic acid (0.70 g).1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 4.09 (2H, d,J CH = 4.8 Hz), 3.48 (3H, d,J CH = 142 Hz). [methyl-13C]Methoxymalonic acid:5-diazo-Meldrum's acid (2 g), [13C]methanol (2 g), Rh2(OAc)4 (250 mg), and toluene (25 ml) were mixed in an Ace pressure tube. The capped tube was heated at 140 °C for 2 h, the reaction was filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was dissolved in H2O and extracted three times with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to yield an oil (1.3 g), which was identified as a mixture of dimethyl methoxymalonate and monomethyl methoxymalonate. The oil was dissolved in MeOH (5 ml), 6n NaOH (10 ml) was added, and the mixture was left overnight at room temperature. After cooling on ice, the mixture was acidified to pH < 1 with HCl and filtered. The filtrate was dried under high vacuum to yield a yellow solid (1 g). To remove the inorganic salt, the solid was extracted three times with acetone; the acetone extracts were evaporated to give methoxymalonic acid as a solid (0.65 g). 1H NMR (acetone-d6): δ 4.47 (1H, d,J = 4 Hz), 3.46 (3H, d, J = 143 Hz).13C NMR (acetone-d6): δ 167.0, 79.9, 57.5 (enriched). Cultures grown in TSBGM were harvested at 24 h, washed twice, and resuspended in 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1% glucose to the original culture volume. The resting cell suspension was shaken in baffled flasks at 30 °C and 175 rpm. The 13C-labeled precursors were added in three equal portions at 24, 36, and 48 h to obtain 0.5 g/liter final concentration. Resting cell cultures were harvested at 56 h by adding half the volume of the culture of MeOH. The resulting broth/extract was clarified by centrifugation and loaded at 25 ml/min onto a column of Diaion HP-20ss pre-equilibrated in MeOH-H2O (2:1). The column volume was 120 the volume of the broth/extract. The column was eluted at 8 ml/min with MeOH-H2O at ratios of 1:2 (2 column volumes), 1:1 (4 column volumes), 7:3 (4 column volumes), and 9:1 (4 column volumes). The 9:1 eluent was concentrated to give crude ascomycin, which was chromatographed over Bond-Elut ODS solid phase extraction cartridges by eluting with MeOH-H2O (9:1). This material was suitable for NMR analysis. TheStreptomyces expression vector pKAO127 containing the SCP2* replicon and the DEBS genes expressed via the actI promoter and actII-ORF4 transcription activator were described previously (29Kao C.M. Katz L. Khosla C. Science. 1994; 265: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Constructs with SpeI and PstI sites engineered at the eryAT6 boundaries have also been described previously (6McDaniel R. Thamchaipenet A. Gustafsson C. Fu H. Betlach M. Ashley G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The ascomycin AT8 was isolated by PCR with primers that introduced a SpeI site at the 5′ boundary and anNsiI site at the 3′ boundary. The PCR product was cloned into Litmus28 to give pKOS38-178, which was checked by sequencing, and subsequently inserted between the engineered SpeI andPstI sites flanking DEBS AT6. This was assembled into the DEBS expression construct pKOS38-187. The construct was introduced intoS. lividans K4-114 by standard protoplast transformation (28Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar), and the transformants were cultured in R5 medium for production of the 6-DEB analogue. Samples were analyzed by on-line extraction by LC-MS using a system comprised of a 10 port, 2 position switching valve/injector, Beckman System Gold HPLC, an Alltech evaporative light scattering detector, and a PE SCIEX API100 LC-mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source. For ascomycin analogue analyses, whole cultures were extracted by adding 1 volume of MeCN and clarified by centrifugation. Sample (250 μl) was loaded onto an Upchurch 4.3 × 10 mm ODS guard column that had been pre-equilibrated for 1 min with 0.1% acetic acid at 1 ml/min, with the eluate being diverted to waste. At 30 s postinjection a linear gradient to 1:1 MeCN-H2O (0.1% acetic acid) over 1 min was started, with the eluate still diverted to waste. At 2 min, the direction of flow through the guard column was reversed, and the eluent was diverted onto a Metachem Inertsil ODS-3 column (5 μm; 4.6 × 150 mm) at 50 °C pre-equilibrated with 1:1 MeCN-H2O (0.1% acetic acid). A linear gradient from 50% to 100% MeCN (0.1% acetic acid) at 1 ml/min over 5 min and then 100% MeCN (0.1% acetic acid) for 4 min was monitored by evaporative light scattering and mass spectrometry. For 6-DEB and 2-demethyl-6-DEB, 100 μl of clarified whole broth was loaded onto the guard column after a 1 min pre-equilibration with H2O at 1 ml/min. At 30 s postinjection, a linear gradient to 15% MeCN over 1 min was initiated. At 2 min, the direction of flow through the guard column was reversed, and the eluent was diverted onto a Metachem Inertsil ODS-3 column (5 μm; 4.6 × 150 mm) pre-equilibrated with 15% MeCN. A linear gradient from 15% to 100% MeCN at 1 ml/min over 6 min and then 100% MeCN for 3 min was monitored by evaporative light scattering and mass spectrometry. We previously hypothesized that AT8 of the ascomycin PKS selects the unusual precursor methoxymalonyl-ACP leading to direct incorporation of the methoxy group at C13 (14Wu K. Chung L. Revill W.P. Katz L. Reeves C.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 251: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To explore this, ascomycin AT8 was replaced with heterologous ATs of known specificity by double homologous recombination using the phage vector KC515 as shown in Fig.2. Between 10 and 100 thiostrepton-resistant colonies were obtained after infection with recombinant phages, whereas KC515 alone gave no thiostrepton-resistant colonies. Ten isolates each of lysogens from the rapamycin AT3 or erythromycin AT2 construct were analyzed in detail. None produced detectable ascomycin or related products, consistent with insertion of the phage into a gene essential for ascomycin production. Southern blot hybridization experiments (using XhoI or Acc65I digestion of genomic DNA) showed that of the erythromycin AT2 lysogens, seven arose by recombination at the ketoacyl synthase 8 sequence, and three arose by recombination at the dehydratase 8/keto reductase 8 sequence, whereas of the rapamycin AT3 lysogens, eight recombined at the dehydratase 8/keto reductase 8 sequence, one recombined at the ketoacyl synthase 8, and one apparently recombined at the dehydratase 1/keto reductase 1 sequence, which is 98% identical over 1 kb with keto reductase 8/dehydratase 8. Three lysogens from the malonyl-specific rapamycin AT12 construct also did not produce FK520, and the expected first crossover event was verified using PCR. After growth in the absence of selection, thioS colonies appeared at a frequency of about 0.3%, half of which produced ascomycin and had therefore reverted to wild-type. With the exception of one thioS recombinant that produced no ascomycin-related compound, the remaining thioS recombinants produced a compound with an LC retention time and atomic mass consistent with either 13-DMA (for the rapamycin AT12 replacement) or 13-MDMA (for the rapamycin AT3 and erythromycin AT2 replacements). The overall statistics indicated little bias for recombination via one flanking sequence over the other. After growing selected strains in laboratory-scale stirred-tank fermenters and purifying the ascomycin analogues, structures were verified by mass spectrometry and NMR analyses. 2J. Carney, R. Arslanian, E. Woo, and G. Ashley, manuscript in preparation. For the rapamycin AT3 replacement strain, only 13-MDMA was produced, and the relative stereochemistry of the 13-methyl group was the same as that of the 13-methoxy group of ascomycin. Thus, the α-methyl epimerization activity that occurs in rapamycin module 3 does not appear to reside on the AT domain, consistent with previous work (23Khosla C. Gokhale R.S. Jacobsen J.R. Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The 13-DMA and 13-MDMA analogues were produced at levels about 5% of parental ascomycin titers (50 mg/liter), which is better than most PKS engineering results (6McDaniel R. Thamchaipenet A. Gustafsson C. Fu H. Betlach M. Ashley G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). For the rapamycin AT12 replacement strain, 13-DMA was the predominant product, but a small amount (∼5% of the total) of ascomycin was also observed, even after two rounds of clonal isolation. A summary of the products identified in cultures of the engineered strains is presented in TableI.Table ISummary of results from replacement of AT8 in the ascomycin PKSStrainReplacementAscomycin-related products detected (approximate titer)ATCC14891Wild-typeAscomycin (50 mg/liter), 21-methyl congener (trace)KOS60–135Rapamycin AT313-MDMA (2 mg/liter)KOS45–170Rapamycin AT1213-DMA (2 mg/liter), ascomycin (0.1 mg/liter) Open table in a new tab It was reported previously that [1,2-13C]acetate can be incorporated into the macrolactone ring carbons C8, C9, and C20-C23 but not C12-C15 in either ascomycin or FK506 (8Byrne K.M.

In this study we have characterized the Stat2-IFNaR2 interaction and examined its role in IFNα signaling. Stat2 binds the major IFNaR2 protein but not a variant containing a shorter cytoplasmic domain. The interaction does not require a STAT SH2 domain.

The short and long transmembrane forms are referred to as IFNaR2-1 and IFNaR2-2, respectively. IFNaR2-1 is usually expressed at lower levels than IFNaR2-2 and may exert a dominant negative effect on IFNα signaling, although its precise role is unclear (6Pfeffer L.M. Basu L. Pfeffer S.R.

IFNα receptor subunits lack intrinsic enzymatic activity, instead relying on members of the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) family to transduce signals. Genetic complementation experiments have linked two JAKs, Tyk2 and Jak1, to IFNα signaling (7Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pelligrini S.

Latent STATs were initially believed to exist as monomers in the cytoplasm, but recent studies indicate that they exist primarily in high molecular weight complexes (23Ndubuisi M.I. Guo G.G.

In this regard, constitutive association of Stat2 with IFNaR2 has been reported, and termed “pre-docking” (25Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that this interaction facilitates the subsequent SH2 domain-dependent Stat2 recruitment, the biological significance of this association remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to delineate the Stat2 interaction domain on IFNaR2 and investigate its role in IFNα signaling. We have found that the minimal Stat2 binding region is between residues 418 and 444 of IFNaR2, although a larger domain (residues 340–462) is required for maximal binding. Mutation of conserved acidic amino acids corresponding to residues 435–438 disrupts IFNaR2 binding to Stat2. Importantly, expression of these mutated IFNaR2 constructs in two separate cell systems demonstrates that ISRE-driven reporter gene activity is increased relative to cells expressing the wild-type receptor. Thus, this interaction is dispensable for effective IFNα signaling and instead might function in the negative regulation of such signaling.

Stark, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation), were all maintained as adherent cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Fragments of the IFNaR2 cytoplasmic domain were generated by PCR and were cloned, sequenced, and transferred into an appropriate pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) to encode GST-IFNaR2 fusion proteins. To create site-specific mutants the overlapping PCR technique (28Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) was used to generate DNA fragments (spanning residues 376–462) with alanine substitutions at positions 435–438 (mutant 1, DDED to AAAA), and 440–443 (mutant 2, DDLE to AAAA) of IFNaR2, respectively. The full-length IFNaR2 cDNA and the corresponding 435–438 mutant were cloned into pMT2T for expression in human cells (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A DNA fragment flanked by XhoI sites, encoding amino acids 136–702 of Stat2, was PCR-amplified usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene), cloned, sequenced, and then transferred into pET15b (Novagen) for expression in bacteria. Truncated Stat2 constructs (corresponding to residues 1–293, 1–323, and 123–517, respectively) were generated using convenient restriction sites and cloned into pMT2T. The eukaryotic expression construct encoding a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase gene has been previously described (30Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The luciferase gene construct is under the control of an ISRE from the ISG-15 gene (31Improta T. Pine R. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α, containing the appropriate pGEX-IFNaR2 construct, was grown at 37 °C to log phase and induced at 30 °C with 0.1 mmisothiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3–4 h. Pelleted bacteria, resuspended in STE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 150 μg/ml of lysozyme and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, were sonicated. Inclusion bodies were pelleted and solubilized in Sarkosyl (32Grieco F. Hay J.M. Hull R. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 856-857PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C in STE containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sarcosyl, 10% glycerol. Purification of His-tagged Stat2-(136–702) will be described in detail. 2A. Z. Saleh and J. J. Krolewski, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, E. coli BL21 (λDE3) expressing His-tagged Stat2 protein were grown at 37 °C and induced at 30 °C with IPTG. Following cell lysis and centrifugation, the protein was purified by chromatography on hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) and nickel resin (Invitrogen). Stat2 was prepared from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells 48 h post-infection or from calcium phosphate transfected 293T cells 48 h post-transfection, by lysing cells in TBES/1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) followed by centrifugation to remove nuclei and debris. GST-IFNaR2 fusions, immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), were washed with STE, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Sarkosyl, and incubated with recombinant Stat2. Following washes in TBES/1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, complexes were eluted in sample buffer and immunoblotted as described below. Transient transfection of subconfluent 293T cells (∼8 × 106 cells on 15-cm dishes), U2OS cells (∼1 × 106 cells on 10-cm dishes), stable U5A derivatives created as described below (∼8 × 105 cells on 10-cm dishes), or 2fTGH cells (∼8 × 105 cells on 10-cm dishes) was performed using calcium-phosphate precipitates and the indicated amount(s) of plasmid DNA. In some experiments, 10-cm dishes of 293T cells (∼3 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected with 20 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA employing LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, transiently transfected cultures were subjected to immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting or reporter gene analysis, as described below. Stable transfectants of U5A cells were created by co-transfecting 10-cm dishes (∼8 × 105 cells) with 10 μg of HA-tagged pMT2T-IFNaR2 expression constructs and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1(+), which carries a neomycin resistance gene. Forty-eight hours post-transfection cells were diluted into medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Individual clones were propagated and screened by immunoblotting cytoplasmic lysates with an anti-HA antibody to identify lines expressing IFNaR2 proteins. Stable derivative cell lines were periodically cultured in the presence of G418 and monitored by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies to ensure the continued expression of the exogenous IFNaR2 constructs. Nearly confluent cultures were lysed in TBES/1% Nonidet P-40 plus 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei, debris, and cell membranes were removed by centrifugation to yield a mainly cytoplasmic protein extract. In some cases portions of these crude extracts were mixed with sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Osmonics), blocked in either 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin, and sequentially probed with an appropriate primary antibody, followed by a secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce Super Signal Substrate). In other cases proteins were first immunoprecipitated by incubating the cytoplasmic lysates with appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The antibody-protein complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed, eluted by boiling in sample buffer, and immunoblotted as described above. The primary antibody dilutions used for immunoblotting were: 1:3000 for 4G10, 1:10,000 for SC805, H15, SC-138, and AC-15, and 1:20,000 for the anti-Stat2 polyclonal antibody. To monitor protein loading on some immunoblots, membranes were stripped, washed, and reprobed with appropriate antibodies. In the case of U2OS cells, duplicate 10-cm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of a β-galactosidase construct, 10 μg of an ISRE-luciferase construct, and 30 μg of the appropriate expression construct. Three to four sets of duplicate dishes were used for each expression construct in a single experiment, which were performed on four separate occasions (n = 13). Thirty-four hours post-transfection, one dish was treated with 300 units of IFNa2/ml for 14 h, whereas the other dish was left untreated. Cells were washed, lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and frozen on dry ice. After thawing, debris were removed by centrifugation, and a portion of each lysate was assayed for luciferase activity using firefly luciferase assay substrate (Promega) in an auto-injecting luminometer (Turner Design). The remainder of each lysate was assayed for β-galactosidase activity using a previously described protocol (17Krishnan K. Singh B. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19495-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) adapted for microtiter plates. Fold-induction is calculated by dividing luciferase activity in IFNα-treated cultures by the activity in companion untreated cultures after normalizing each luciferase value with the appropriate β-galactosidase value. Reporter gene assays on stable transfectants of U5A cells or on 2fTGH cells were performed similarly on 10-cm dishes using 5 μg of the β-galactosidase construct and 10 μg of the ISRE-luciferase construct. IFNα treatment (1000 units/ml) was for 6 h. Data from the luciferase reporter gene assays were analyzed by an unpaired Student's t test employing Statview software (Abacus Concepts). Non-saturating exposures of immunoblot autoradiograms were scanned in Photoshop version 6.0 (Adobe Systems) and pixel density quantitated using NIH Image version 1.62 software. Background pixel density was sampled in multiple spots, and the average background density was subtracted to obtain a corrected pixel density for each scanned band. Relative Stat2 protein levels were determined by dividing the corrected Stat2 pixel density by the corresponding corrected β-actin pixel density. IFNaR2-1 and IFNaR2-2 (3Domanski P. Witte M.

To determine whether Stat2 interacts specifically with IFNaR2-2, immobilized GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domain of IFNaR2-2, IFNaR2-1, or IFNaR1 were incubated with a human Stat2-containing Sf9 cell extract, and complexes were immunoblotted with anti-Stat2 antiserum. A strong interaction was detected with GST-IFNaR2-2 (Fig.1 A, lane 5), but not with GST, GST-IFNaR1, or GST-IFNaR2-1 (Fig. 1 A,lanes 2–4), essentially as previously observed (25Li X. Leung S.

We did not observe consistent binding of baculovirus-produced Stat1 and GST-IFNaR2-2 (data not shown). Next, to investigate whether phosphorylated Stat2 can bind IFNaR2-2, we coinfected Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding Jak1 and Stat2. Under these conditions Stat2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in a manner similar to that seen following IFNα treatment (10Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewski J.J. Schindler C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Employing the same in vitro binding assay, we observed a strong association between phosphorylated Stat2 and IFNaR2-2 (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Docking of Stat2 to IFNaR1 requires phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 466 on IFNaR1 as well as an intact Stat2 SH2 domain (10Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because it is unlikely that the bacterially expressed GST fusions employed in Fig. 1are tyrosine-phosphorylated, it is similarly unlikely that IFNaR2 phosphorylation is required for the interaction with Stat2. Thus, we anticipated that the Stat2 SH2 domain would also be superfluous for the Stat2-IFNaR2-2 interaction. As expected, a strong signal was observed (Fig. 1 C, lane 3) when the in vitrobinding assay was performed with lysate from cells infected with a Stat2 baculovirus bearing an inactivating SH2 domain mutation (R601K) (10Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreiber R.D. Schindler C.W. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fig. 1indicates that Stat2 specifically interacts with IFNaR2-2. Therefore, we employed the IFNaR2-2 subunit, referred to hereafter as IFNaR2 for the remainder of our studies. To delineate the Stat2 binding domain on IFNaR2, a panel of GST fusion proteins encoding portions of the cytoplasmic domain was used in similar in vitro binding assays (Fig. 2 A). Truncation of IFNaR2 from the carboxyl terminus to residue 444 (Fig.2 B, lane 4), or from the amino terminus to residue 340 (Fig. 2 B, lane 7) did not affect binding. However, a doubly truncated construct (340–444) displayed some reduction in binding (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and 3). Further truncation from the amino terminus revealed that a 25-amino acid fragment (418–444) of IFNaR2 bound Stat2, albeit at reduced efficiency (Fig. 2 B,lane 11). These data suggest that residues in this small region are critical for the interaction. Alignment of human and murine IFNaR2 revealed substantial homology, including a block (435–438; DDED) containing four acidic residues (Fig. 3 A). To test the role of these acidic residues two mutants were created by substituting alanine for either these four amino acids (designated mutant 1), or for another, non-conserved block of mainly acidic amino acids (mutant 2). Stat2 binding to IFNaR2 was diminished when alanine substitution was made at positions 435–438 (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 7 and 6) but not when similar changes were made at the non-conserved residues (Fig. 3 B, lane 8).Figure 3Conserved acidic IFNaR2 residues are required for Stat2 binding.

Residues that were converted to alanine in mutants 1 and 2 are underlined. B, mutation of acidic IFNaR2 residues disrupt Stat2 binding in vitro. In vitrobinding was performed as described in Figs. 1 and 2. The lower half of each immunoblot was probed with anti-GST antibody to verify equal loading (data not shown). The molecular masses (in kDa) of co-migrated standards are indicated on the left. The diffuse bands inlanes 5 and 6 are apparently artifacts, as they were not observed in replicate experiments (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The in vitro binding data prompted us to examine if mutation of residues 435–438 also decreased binding in vivo. Constructs encoding Stat2 and HA-tagged wild-type (wt) or mutant 1 (m1) IFNaR2 proteins were transfected alone or in combination into 293T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation of Stat2 and IFNaR2 was significantly reduced in cells expressing m1 IFNaR2 (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 5and 6), indicating that acidic residues at positions 435–438 of IFNaR2 are critical for association both in vitro and in vivo. As seen in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, the Stat2-IFNaR2 association appears to be constitutive and therefore ligand-independent. However, to investigate the effect of IFNα treatment on the interaction, transfected cells overexpressing Stat2 and HA-tagged wt or m1 IFNaR2 were treated with IFNα. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that Stat2 association with wt IFNaR2 increases following ligand binding (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 4and 3). However, in other experiments we observed little or no increase (Fig. 5 E, compare lanes 3 and4), suggesting that IFNα treatment has a slight effect on the amount of Stat2 bound to IFNaR2. Stat2 binding to the m1 IFNaR2 construct was minimally detectable following IFNα treatment (Fig.5 A, lane 6) but, as seen in Fig. 4, was greatly reduced compared with wt IFNaR2 (Fig. 5 A, comparelanes 4 and 6). Both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Stat2 bound GST-IFNaR2in vitro (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether this occurs in vivo cells transien"

The degradation rate was halved as compared with wild-type mice. The reduction of the rate was comparable with the presence of a PAF antagonist WEB 2086 in wild-type cells. PAF was internalized rapidly (t 12 ≈ 1 min) into wild-type macrophages.

PAF is degraded by PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF-AHs), isozymes with a Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, which remove the acetyl moiety at the sn-2 position of PAF (11Hattori M. Arai H.

We employed a method to quantify the internalization of a lipid ligand with its receptor by washing cells with an acidic buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). PAFR-KO mice provide us a useful tool for examining the precise role of PAF receptor in PAF metabolism. We demonstrate here that PAF receptor internalization and receptor-dependent exocytosis of PAF-AH are important for the PAF degradation in macrophages. PAF C-16 (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and lyso-PAF C-16 (1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) were obtained from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). PAF antagonist WEB 2086 was a generous gift from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany). [Acetyl- 3H]PAF C-16 (370 GBq/mmol), [alkyl-3H]PAF C-16 (2157 GBq/mmol), and [3H]WEB 2086 (703 GBq/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg yolk, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), and concanavalin A (ConA) were purchased from Sigma. BSA (very low endotoxin, fatty acid-free) and thioglycollate were from Serological Proteins (Kankakee, IL) and Difco, respectively. A rabbit serum against guinea pig plasma-type PAF-AH was a kind gift from Dr. K. Karasawa (Teikyo University, Kanagawa, Japan). Monoclonal anti-PAF-AH I and anti-PAF-AH II antibodies were kind gifts from Drs. H. Arai and J. Aoki (University of Tokyo, Japan). The ECL Western blotting analysis system was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. All other reagents, unless otherwise stated, were of analytical grade and were from Wako (Osaka, Japan) or Sigma. Specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Japan (Tokyo, Japan). In the experiments with PAFR-KO mice (8–16 weeks old), sex- and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice were used as controls. Mice back-crossed seven times with C57BL/6 were used for experiments. Peritoneal exudate macrophages were obtained by washing the peritoneal cavity three times each with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of sterile 4% thioglycollate. After centrifugation at 250 × g, the cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 100 international units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma). They were cultured in 12-well (1 × 106cells/well) or 24-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with Tyrode's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 0.49 mmMgCl2, and 0.37 mmNaH2PO4) containing 10 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 0.1% of BSA (Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA) before assay. The numbers of cells recovered from PAFR-WT (3.5 ± 0.9 × 107 cells/mouse, mean ± S.D.,n = 4) and -KO (3.7 ± 0.4 × 107cells/mouse, n = 4) mice were not significantly different. Macrophages seeded onto 24-well plates were incubated with 2 nm[acetyl-3H]PAF in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA for 30–120 min at 37 °C. The medium was recovered, and the lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (26Bligh E.C. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in the aqueous phase was regarded as PAF degradation products. The radioactivity was counted with an LS 6500 scintillation system (Beckman Instruments) and a liquid scintillation mixture (Atomlight; Packard, Meriden, CT). Macrophages seeded onto 12-well plates were incubated with different concentrations of [alkyl-3H]PAF in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with the same buffer at 4 °C, cells were lysed with 5% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm PAF. Macrophages were also incubated with different concentrations of [3H]WEB 2086 at 25 °C for 1 h to determine WEB 2086 binding to macrophages in the presence or absence of 10 μm WEB 2086. Macrophages seeded onto 12-well plates were incubated with 2 nm[alkyl-3H]PAF in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with the same buffer at 4 °C, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in Tyrode's buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) (Hepes/Tyrode's) for 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min and then washed twice for 15 min with 200 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 25 mm NaCl and 1% BSA at 4 °C to remove PAF bound to the cell surface receptors. This acid wash procedure was used to separate cell-surface (acid-sensitive) PAF from internalized (acid-resistant) PAF. After the cells were washed, they were lysed with 5% Triton X-100 containing 50 mm NaOH to measure the internalized PAF. At each time, the radioactivity of both the cell surface PAF and the internalized PAF were counted. Inhibitors for receptor internalization were added 20 min before incubation with [alkyl-3H] PAF. Although ConA (250 μg/ml) or sucrose (0.45 m) were present in the medium throughout the assays, PAO (80 μm) was removed before the incubation with [alkyl-3H]PAF. Macrophages seeded onto 12-well plates were incubated with 2 nm[alkyl-3H]PAF in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with the same buffer at 4 °C, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with Hepes/Tyrode's for 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. At each time, cells were scraped off from the plates by a cell lifter (Corning, Corning, NY) in 50 mmacetic acid in methanol/water (1:2, v/v) (27McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Satoh K. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Total lipids were obtained from the cells by the Bligh and Dyer method (26Bligh E.C. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

The spots corresponding to PAF, lyso-PAF, and PC were scraped off. Each scraped silica gel was mixed with 10 ml of a liquid scintillation mixture, Atomlight, to determine the radioactivity. Macrophages seeded onto 12-well plates were incubated with 2 nm[acetyl-3H]PAF or [alkyl-3H]PAF in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with the same buffer at 4 °C, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with Hepes/Tyrode's for 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. At each time the medium was recovered, and its radioactivity was counted. Mouse blood samples were obtained from the femoral artery and vein and were placed at room temperature to form clots for 1 h. Sera were prepared by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min at room temperature. PAF-AH assays was performed under the same conditions as reported previously with minor modifications (11Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the serum was diluted to 50 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.20 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EDTA and 100 μm [acetyl-3H]PAF. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) and 0.25 ml of water. The radioactivity of an aliquot (0.6 ml) of each aqueous phase was measured with a liquid scintillation mixture, Atomlight, to determine the amount of acetyl moiety liberated from PAF. For the detection of PAF-AH activity released from macrophages, macrophages seeded onto 6-well plates were stimulated with 2 or 10 nm PAF. After 60 min, the medium was collected, and its PAF-AH activity was measured. All assay conditions were the same as those of the serum PAF-AH assay, except for the concentration of [acetyl-3H]PAF (10 μm) and the incubation time (20 min). Macrophages were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline and applied to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were then washed once with Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then blocked with nonfat milk (BlockAce; Dainippon Medical, Osaka, Japan) at 4 °C over night. After washing the membranes with TBS-T, a rabbit serum against guinea-pig plasma-type PAF-AH was added at a dilution of 1:1,000 in TBS-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) (1:5,000 dilution) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Western blot analysis system. For the detection of PAF-AH II, anti-PAF-AH II monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were used. Statistical analysis was performed using StatView (version 4.0) software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Ap value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We analyzed PAF degradation activity of peritoneal macrophages obtained from PAFR-WT and -KO mice. When cells were incubated with 2 nm[acetyl-3H]PAF, the aqueous degradation products of PAF, i.e. acetate or its derivatives, gradually accumulated in the culture medium in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). After a 120-min incubation, about 50% of the total PAF added had been degraded by WT cells. In PAFR-KO macrophages, PAF degradation was significantly slower as compared with WT cells. At 60 min, PAF degradation by KO cells was almost half that by WT cells. Under cell-free conditions, PAF was not degraded for at least 120 min. To confirm whether the reduced PAF inactivation in KO cells was specific, we examined the effects of a PAF antagonist WEB 2086. In the presence of 10 μm WEB 2086, PAF degradation activity in WT cells was decreased to the same level as observed in KO cells (Fig.1). In KO cells, WEB 2086 had no further effects on PAF degradation. These results suggest that PAF degradation by murine macrophages is accelerated by PAF receptor. GPCRs are known to internalize by ligand stimulation. Thus, we examined the internalization of PAF and PAF receptor in macrophages at 37 °C after treating with [alkyl-3H]PAF for 1 h at 4 °C. The number of cell surface receptors (B max) observed at 4 °C using [alkyl-3H]PAF (Fig.2) was nearly equal to that at room temperature using [3H]WEB 2086 (data not shown), showing that PAF binding to PAF receptor was not blocked at 4 °C. As previously reported for some GPCRs, ligands that bind to the cell-surface receptors are released by acidic pH treatment (19Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Once the ligands internalize with receptors, they become tolerant to the acid-washing procedures. Therefore, PAF-PAF receptor complexes remaining on the cell surface are separated effectively by washing with sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 1% BSA. Most of the cell-associated PAF (91 ± 0.04%, n = 3) was recovered by acid treatment at 0 min (Fig.3). However, within 1 min after the temperature-shift to 37 °C, about half of PAF transferred to acid-resistant fraction (Fig. 3). This demonstrates that PAF together with PAF receptor internalized very rapidly into cells. When cells were pretreated either with ConA, PAO, or hypertonic shock with 0.45m sucrose to block the receptor internalization, the rates of PAF internalization were significantly decreased (Fig. 3). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, known to inhibit caveola-mediated processes, had no effect on the rates of internalization (Fig. 3). These results suggest that PAF internalize with PAF receptor in a clathrin-dependent pathway.Figure 3Internalization of PAF with PAF receptor. Macrophages were incubated with 2 nm[alkyl-3H]PAF at 4 °C for 1 h and washed with Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA. Upon incubation at 37 °C, PAF internalization was initiated. At each time, the PAF remaining bound to the cell surface receptors was recovered with an acidic buffer containing 1% BSA, and cells were lysed with 5% Triton X-100 to quantify PAF internalization. Cell-surface PAF is expressed as a percentage of the total PAF, i.e. sum of radioactivity of the acid-washable (cell surface) PAF and the acid-resistant (internalized) PAF. The PAF binding varied with each treatment: control (18,800 dpm), ConA (8,767 dpm), PAO (7,495 dpm), sucrose (4,090 dpm), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10,311 dpm). Data are the means of triplicate samples and are representative of two independent experiments that gave similar results. Because S.D. values are within the symbol size, error bars are omitted. The values from the treatment of ConA, PAO, or sucrose are significantly different at 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 min as compared with the control (*, p < 0.0001versus each group by analysis of variance with Fisher's test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the destiny of internalized PAF, we analyzed the metabolic fate of PAF after binding to its specific receptor. Degraded products of [alkyl-3H]PAF were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography, and the radioactivity was counted. Fig.4 A shows the time course of PAF degradation in macrophages. Once internalized, PAF was initially degraded to lyso-PAF, which was subsequently converted into 1-alkyl-2-acyl PC by acylation at the sn-2 position. The percentage of lyso-PAF was maintained in equilibrium at about 20% of total [alkyl-3H]PAF metabolites between 10 and 60 min. The PAF degradation in the cells was a slower reaction (t 12 ≈ 20 min) as compared with the PAF internalization (t 12 ≈ 1 min). To examine whether the receptor-mediated PAF internalization has a significant role on intracellular PAF metabolism, PAF degradation was measured using macrophages treated with ConA. The metabolic conversion of PAF to lyso-PAF and 1-alkyl-2-acyl PC was significantly decreased (t 12 ≈ 40–50 min) (Fig. 4 B). When macrophages were incubated with [alkyl-3H]PAF, most of the internalized radioactivity was retained in the cells at least until 120 min (Fig. 5). On the other hand, about 90% of the internalized radioactivity of [acetyl-3H]PAF was released into the medium at 120 min (Fig. 5). These observations imply that the acetyl group of PAF (either acetic acid or its derivatives), but not lyso-PAF or 1-alkyl-2-acyl PC, is released from macrophages. Macrophages are known to secrete plasma-type PAF-AH. Indeed, we observed the constitutive secretion of PAF-AH into the culture medium of WT macrophages, which was enhanced upon the stimulation with PAF (Fig.6 A). By contrast, PAF did not enhance the PAF-AH release for 30 min in PAFR-KO cells (Fig.6 B). The similar results were obtained when the medium was recovered after 60 min of stimulation (data not shown). The enhancement observed in WT cells was consistently blocked by the addition of WEB 2086 (data not shown). These results show that PAF-AH secretion is slightly but significantly increased from macrophages by the activation of PAF receptor. Serum PAF-AH activities from WT and KO mice were measured (TableI). PAF-AH activity in the serum from WT mice was almost the same as that from KO mice. Thus, PAF receptor does not appear to regulate the PAF-AH activity in blood at least under physiological conditions.Table IPAF acetylhydrolase activity in murine serumGenotypePAF-AH activitynpmol/μl serum/minPAFR-WT415 ± 31.24PAFR-KO420 ± 42.24Sera from PAFR-WT and -KO mice were incubated with 10 μm[3H]PAF at 37 °C for 10 min. PAF-AH activity was determined by measuring [3H]acetate liberated from PAF. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Values are the means ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Sera from PAFR-WT and -KO mice were incubated with 10 μm[3H]PAF at 37 °C for 10 min. PAF-AH activity was determined by measuring [3H]acetate liberated from PAF. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Values are the means ± S.D. The total cell lysates from PAFR-WT and -KO macrophages were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A major protein band with a molecular mass of ≈40 kDa was detected using an antiserum against plasma-type PAF-AH (Fig. 7 A). Similar expression levels of plasma-type PAF-AH were observed in WT and KO macrophages. The observed molecular size appears to correspond to the size of non-glycosylated plasma-type PAF-AH (29Karasawa K. Kuge O. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Nakano Y. Tomita M. Yokoyama K. Setaka M. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A protein band with a molecular mass of 42 kDa was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-PAF-AH II antibody (Fig. 7 B). The expression levels of PAF-AH II were similar in WT and KO macrophages. Thus, the intracellular and extracellular degradation of PAF in macrophages might be due to the PAF-AH II and the plasma-type PAF-AH, respectively. Type I PAF-AH was not detected in murine macrophages by Western blot analysis (data not shown). It is, however, possible that other PLA2s are also involved in PAF degradation. As a result of agonist binding, many GPCRs undergo rapid internalization with their agonists. We have previously reported that PAF receptor internalization in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing PAF receptors occurred with a t 12 of about 30–40 min after 100 nm PAF stimulation (20Ishii I. Saito E. Izumi T. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On macrophages, however, the internalization was much faster (t 12 ≈ 1 min), even with low concentrations of PAF (0.5–2.0 nm). These results suggest that the rates of receptor internalization vary with the cell types. This is consistent with studies on the agonist-induced β2-adrenergic receptor internalization, where the rates of internalization are different: T-lymphoma cell line (t 12 ≈ 1 min) (30Mahan L.C.

J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and angiotensin II receptor in rat hepatocytes (34Jimenez E. Caro M.C. Marsigliante S. Montiel M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the rates of receptor internalization (t 12 ≈ 2–3 min) are comparable with that of the PAF receptor internalization in macrophages shown in this study. Quantitative and qualitative differences may be present in the expression of some components of the endocytic machinery between macrophages and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Internalization of thromboxane A2 receptor is accelerated when G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 or arrestin 2 was co-transfected in HEK 293 cells (35Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors is modified by Rab GTPases that involve in vesicular membrane transport (36Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of PAF receptor internalization was studied using inhibitors against receptor internalization, PAO, ConA, hypertonic sucrose, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment (Fig. 3). PAO, a tri-arsenical compound, blocks endocytosis of macromolecules by cross-linking proteins with sulfur groups and inhibits internalization of various kinds of membrane receptors (34Jimenez E. Caro M.C. Marsigliante S. Montiel M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 37Beaumont V. Hepworth M.B. Luty J.S. Kelly E. Henderson G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ConA or hypertonic sucrose also inhibits the internalization of many receptors including PAF receptor (20Ishii I. Saito E. Izumi T. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hypertonic sucrose inhibits vesicle endocytosis by inhibiting the formation of clathrin lattice (39Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Treatment of hypertonic sucrose here almost completely inhibited the PAF internalization (Fig. 2), whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an inhibitor of caveola-mediated receptor internalization, did not affect the PAF internalization (Fig. 3). The PAF binding decreased with ConA (8,767 dpm), PAO (7,495 dpm) or sucrose (4,090 dpm) compared with the control (18,800 dpm) (Fig. 3). The rates of PAF internalization, however, were similar at PAF concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 nm (data not shown), suggesting that the numbers of bound receptors do not affect the internalization rates. Thus, PAF upon binding to its receptor appears to internalize with clathrin-coated vesicles in macrophages. The rapid internalization of PAF receptor is likely to prevent excessive stimulation of macrophages by PAF. In fact, the PAF concentrations (≈10−9m) used here were sufficient for the PAF receptor activation and internalization in macrophages. PAF degradation was decreased in macrophages from PAFR-KO mice (Fig.1), suggesting the functional significance of the receptor-dependent degradation mechanism. A PAF antagonist, BN 52021, was previously reported to decrease PAF degradation activity of rabbit platelets (40Lamant V. Mauco G. Braquet P. Chap H. Douste-Blazy L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2749-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Lachachi H. Plantavid M. Simon M.F. Chap H. Braquet P. Douste-Blazy L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By tracing [3H]PAF, we showed that PAF was internalized very rapidly with PAF receptor (Fig.3). It is likely that the receptor-bound PAF is degraded intracellularly; PAF internalization (t 12 ≈ 1 min) clearly preceded PAF degradation (t 12 ≈ 20 min) (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, when internalization was blocked by ConA, PAF degradation was delayed (Fig. 4). Internalized PAF was converted to acetic acid and lyso-PAF. The former was liberated extracellularly (t 12 ≈ 40 min), whereas the latter was metabolized to 1-alkyl-2-acyl-PC intracellularly (Fig.4 A). Finally, we found that PAF-AH release from macrophages was enhanced by PAF stimulation (Fig. 6) and contributed to receptor-dependent degradation of PAF (Fig. 1). Plasma-type PAF-AH is expressed in macrophages (42Elstad M.R. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8467-8470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells (43Satoh K. Imaizumi T. Kawamura Y. Yoshida H. Hiramoto M. Takamatsu S. Takamatsu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and rat hepatocytes (44Svetlov S.I. Howard K.M. Miwa M. Flickinger B.D. Olson M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), PAF has been shown to stimulate the release of the plasma-type PAF-AH. On the other hand, PAF-AH activity in serum was not significantly different between PAFR-WT and -KO mice under physiological conditions (Table I). Thus, although the base-line release of PAF-AH appears to be unaffected by PAF receptor, a difference in serum PAF-AH activity between PAFR-WT and -KO mice may be seen under pathological conditions such as endotoxemia that increases blood PAF levels (45Chang S.W. Feddersen C.O. Henson P.M. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1498-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed that the expression levels of plasma-type PAF-AH and PAF-AH II were almost the same in PAFR-WT and -KO macrophages (Fig. 7). Thus, the expression levels of PAF-AHs are not major reasons for the difference of PAF degradation rates between PAFR-WT and -KO macrophages. Because we need a number of mice and cells, we were unable to identify the isoforms of PAF-AH in the medium by Western blot analysis. Roles of other PLA2s on the receptor-dependent degradation of PAF also remain to be clarified. In conclusion, PAF receptor in macrophages significantly enhances PAF degradation by enhancing internalization of receptor-bound PAF and the release of PAF-AH. PAF is synthesized at inflammatory sites by macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils, all of which also express PAF receptor (1Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). PAF is known to be an autacoid that functions at restricted regions. In inflammatory sites, therefore, both receptor-dependent PAF internalization and PAF-AH release are probably important for the rapid removal of PAF from the extracellular space and the cell surface. The intracellular signals of PAF that lead to PAF internalization and PAF-AH exocytosis are yet to be determined. We are grateful to Dr. K. Karasawa (Teikyo University) and Drs. H. Arai and J. Aoki (The University of Tokyo) for PAF-AH antibodies and valuable discussions. We thank Dr. Dennis Wong (University of Chicago) for comments and laboratory members for kind and valuable suggestions."

Full-Text PDF Open Access vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase cytomegalovirus initiator element untranslated region The proton-translocating vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase)1 utilizes energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport protons across cellular membranes. In eukaryotic cells, the action of V-ATPase is required for acidification of the endocytic network, and thus is crucial for protein processing, degradation, and trafficking. Two functionally and structurally distinct domains compose this enzyme (1Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The V1, or catalytic domain, contains the site of ATP hydrolysis and includes eight distinct polypeptide subunits. The V0, or membrane-spanning domain, is composed of up to five distinct polypeptides and forms the pore through which protons traverse the membrane. The most abundant proteins of the V0 domain are highly hydrophobic proteolipids that form hexameric rings within cell membranes (2Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although all eukaryotic cells require the V-ATPase for normal cellular function, some specialized, proton-secreting cells such as macrophages, osteoclasts, and renal tubule cells, express the enzyme at high levels on their plasma membranes and specialized intracellular compartments. Osteoclasts and renal intercalated cells shuttle V-ATPases between intracellular stores and the plasma membrane in response to extracellular stimuli (3Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S.

In addition, these cells and others that utilize V-ATPases for specialized purposes often express tissue-restricted isoforms of a few V-ATPase subunits. The B subunit, a component of the V1 domain, is expressed as two isoforms, designated B1 and B2 (8Südhof T.C. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Johnston P.A. Xie X.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Side-by-side comparisons of V-ATPase protein and mRNA for low and high expressing tissues show that subunit protein levels generally correlate with subunit mRNA levels, indicating that overall enzyme amounts are controlled by steady-state mRNA expression (10Nelson R.D.

Sukhatme V. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3004-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, V-ATPase subunit mRNAs appear to be tandemly regulated. In previous studies, we found that the stoichiometry of V-ATPase mRNAs in bone marrow cultures reflected the stoichiometry of V-ATPase subunits in intact enzyme complexes (22Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). mRNA transcripts for subunits that are present in multiple copies in an intact V-ATPase were expressed at higher levels than mRNA transcripts for those subunits present in single copies. Furthermore, subunit levels appear to change in tandem during cellular processes that increase V-ATPase levels, such as cell differentiation (22Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggest that expression of V-ATPase subunits is tightly controlled and that there may exist a universal mechanism that regulates expression levels of all subunits in a coordinated manner. Based on these data, we began to examine mRNA transcription and stability for one V-ATPase subunit in an effort to define the control mechanisms that mediate overall expression levels. We chose the proteolipid c subunit, because it is ubiquitously expressed, and the corresponding mRNA transcript is highly abundant (22Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Sakai D. Tong H.S. Minkin C. Bone. 1995; 17: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), facilitating analysis of its expression. We isolated the murine c subunit promoter and assayed transcription factor binding and promoter activity in two mouse cell lines, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Although macrophages express 6- to 8-fold more V-ATPase than fibroblasts, we found no difference in relative promoter activity or in the transcription factors used by each cell line. However, the c subunit mRNAs exhibited a greatly enhanced stability in RAW 264.7 cells, accounting for the differences in cellular expression levels. All other subunits tested showed similarly enhanced mRNA half-lives, with the exception of the B2 subunit. In addition, the a subunits appear to be regulated at least in part by transcriptional control. These data suggest that transcriptional control may determine the subunit content of the V-ATPase, whereas regulation of mRNA stability determines its overall expression levels. A DNA fragment of 116 bp, comprising a portion of the first exon of the human c subunit gene, was used to screen a pre-arrayed mouse genomic BAC library (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA). BAC clones that gave a positive signal in the initial screen were digested with multiple restriction enzymes and reprobed with the same 116-bp DNA fragment. Positive bands were cloned into the plasmid pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for further experiments. Putative promoter regions were characterized by sequencing the first exon and surrounding regions, using the ABI Prism dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing reactions were analyzed by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory at the Washington University School of Medicine. An antisense oligonucleotide primer of the sequence 5′-GAAAAACGAAGAATATTCGG-3′, corresponding to c subunit base pairs 23–42 (relative to the translational start), was synthesized and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Total RNA was purified from mouse kidney using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Primer extension reactions were performed as described previously (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the products were analyzed in a conventional 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE (0.09 m Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) with a DNA sequencing ladder as the molecular weight standard. Promoter fragments were subcloned into the firefly luciferase-encoding vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). All fragments of clone L5 contained the entire 5′-untranslated region (up to bp +158) and were truncated at upstream sequences. Deletions were performed by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. NIH 3T3, RAW 264.7, and LLC-PK1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. IC-21 cells also were obtained from the American Types Culture Collection but were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mmHepes, and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfection was performed using the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen Inc.). Cells in 60-mm dishes at 50% confluence were transfected with ∼1 μg of DNA. Promoter fragments in pGL3 were co-transfected at a ratio of 5:1 with the plasmid pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal standard for transfection efficiency. The total concentration of plasmid added to the transfection mixture was kept constant in all experiments. Luciferase activity was quantified using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) and a Zylux FB12 tube luminometer, according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Nuclear extracts from NIH 3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells were isolated as described (26Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were 32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified over a G-50 NICK Spin column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Six micrograms of nuclear extract either alone or premixed for 10 min with 100× competitor oligonucleotide were added to 50,000 cpm of probe, and incubated 20 min at room temperature prior to gel electrophoresis. For supershifts, extracts were mixed with 50,000 cpm of probe for 30 min at 4 °C, then 4 μg of purified antibody was added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Antibodies against the Sp1 and AP-2 families of transcription factors were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Reactions were run in precast 1× TBE minigels containing 5% acrylamide (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Preparation of NIH 3T3 and RAW 264.7 nuclei and radiolabeling of nascent transcripts were performed as described (27Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl D. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1997: 4.10.11-14.10.11Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNA was isolated using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of ammonium acetate to remove unincorporated nucleotides. Radiolabeled RNA samples from 3T3 and RAW cell nuclei were adjusted to equal counts/min and were added to nitrocellulose membranes to which 5 μg of linearized, denatured plasmid had been applied using a slotted filtration manifold (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Hybridization and washing of the membrane strips were performed as previously described (27Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl D. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1997: 4.10.11-14.10.11Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 or RAW 264.7 cells were treated over time with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Total RNA was prepared using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc.), following the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of each RNA sample was separated in a formaldehyde gel system as previously described (23Lee B.S. Underhill D.M. Crane M.K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7320-7329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the RNA was transferred to GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). The blots were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA fragments of various murine V-ATPase subunits generated by reverse transcription-PCR from murine marrow cultures, as previously described (22Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits I. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as well as32P-labeled probes for murine β-actin and murine 18 S rRNA (both from Ambion, Austin, TX). Final washing conditions for all probes were 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS, at 65 °C. Hybridized probe was quantified using phosphorimaging and ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Polyclonal antiserum generated against a C-terminal peptide of the a1 subunit was a kind gift of Dr. Xiao-Song Xie (University of Texas-Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Antiserum derived against the V-ATPase a3 subunit was generously provided by Dr. Jan Mattsson (AstraZeneca Corp., Sweden). Polyclonal antiserum against the B2 subunit was described previously (28Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Ojikutu B. Krits I. Gluck S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C382-C388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblots, equivalent amounts of whole cell lysates from NIH 3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells were run in 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) under standard conditions. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and probed with antisera at the following dilutions: a1, 1:5000; a3, 1:1250; B2, 1:1000. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) and chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Results were visualized using a Chemi-Doc image analysis system (Bio-Rad). For immunostaining, IC-21 cells were plated on glass coverslips and, after an overnight incubation, were fixed and permeabilized in a solution containing 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% deoxycholate in a physiological salt solution. Free aldehydes were quenched using 10 mm sodium borohydride, and the cells were preblocked in a solution of 0.8% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% gelatin, and 10 μg/ml goat IgG in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were then added in a solution of 0.08% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% gelatin, and 1 μg/ml goat IgG in phosphate-buffered saline. Following a 2-h incubation, cells were washed and incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. After further washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides in a mixture of 9 parts glycerol/1 part phosphate-buffered saline plus an anti-fading reagent. Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and SPOT image analysis software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Five positive clones from a murine BAC library were identified using a 116-bp DNA fragment from the first exon of the human c subunit gene. Following digestion of these clones with multiple restriction enzymes and Southern blotting, subclones were generated for further study. Three were identified that contained the putative first exon and promoter region of the c subunit gene. These subclones included pL5, an 8-kb BamHI fragment; pD6, a 9-kbBamHI fragment; and pP10R, a 9-kb EcoRI fragment. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that pL5 contained the first exon of the c gene, with a consensus intron boundary at the same position as that found in the human gene (29Hasebe M. Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, pD6 encoded the entire c subunit coding region without introns, and its upstream sequence contained a long stretch of sequence corresponding to retroviral long terminal repeats. These results indicate that clone pD6 represents a pseudogene resulting from an event of retroviral reverse transcription and integration. Clone pP10R also encoded the c subunit without introns; however, the putative promoter region of pP10R was unlike that of pD6, indicating that it may represent a second pseudogene. To examine this possibility that pL5 might represent a true c subunit gene fragment, we isolated regions of the three clones upstream of their coding sequences, fused them to a firefly luciferase reporter, and assayed their relative activities as promoters. As shown in TableI, the upstream fragment of pP10R showed no activity higher than the vector alone (pGL3-basic). Although pD6 elicited some activity, pL5 was by far the strongest promoter, with activity comparable to the CMV promoter. These data, coupled with the sequence information above, strongly suggested that clone pL5 contained the true c subunit promoter elements.Table IRelative activities of putative c subunit promoter fragmentsPlasmid3T3 cellsLLC-PK1 cells%pCMV-luc100.0 ± 2.0100.0 ± 12.8pGL3-basic0.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.0pP10R-luc0.2 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.0pD6-luc2.9 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.1pL5-luc87.1 ± 4.973.7 ± 6.1Fragments upstream of the putative coding regions for the genomic clones P10R, D6, and L5 were subcloned upstream of a luciferase reporter and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells or LLC-PK1 cells.

Fig. 1 A illustrates a restriction map of the 8-kb L5 clone, whereas Fig. 1 B shows the nucleotide sequence of ∼1.1 kb beginning in the 5′-flanking region and ending at the base immediately upstream of the coding region. 2GenBankTM accession numberAF366932. Nucleotides are numbered relative to the site of transcription initiation, which were determined as discussed below. To pinpoint the transcriptional start site(s) of the c subunit, the 5′-end of the native c subunit transcript was mapped by primer extension analysis. A strong band was produced (Fig. 2, arrow) that indicated transcriptional initiation 158 bases upstream of the translation start site, in the sequence 5′-CCATCTT-3′, where the adenosine residue represents the start of transcription. A second experiment with a primer ∼100 bp upstream of the one used in Fig. 2 gave the same results (data not shown). This start sequence corresponds well, although not perfectly, to the loose consensus sequence for an initiator (Inr) box, 5′-Py2AN(T/A)Py2-3′, where Py = pyrimidine (30Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). No corresponding TATA box was evident 25–30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site (see Fig. 1 B). Although most abundantly expressed genes contain TATA boxes, Inr elements can serve as functional analogs in directing transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (31Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To determine the promoter elements required for expression of the c subunit, portions of the L5 clone upstream of the coding region were subcloned in the firefly luciferase expression vector pGL3-basic. All constructs included the entire 5′-untranslated region and were truncated at various points upstream (see Fig.3 A). Fig. 3 shows the activities of these promoter fragments in 3T3 (Fig. 3 B,left panel) and RAW 264.7 (right panel) cells. The overall pattern of expression in the two cell types was highly similar; fragments −571 to +158, −145 to +158, and −88 to +158 produced the highest activity. The longest fragment tested, −1.7 kb to +158, was only half as active, suggesting potential negative regulatory elements in the region from −1.7 to −571 kb. However, deletion of regions downstream of −88 produced the most dramatic change in promoter activity levels. As expected, removal of the transcriptional start site (fragment +3 to +158) caused a complete ablation of promoter activity. More significantly, deletion of sequences between −88 and −31 produced greater than 90% loss in promoter activity in both cell types. Inspection of this region for promoter element consensus sequences resulted in identification of a single GC box (GGGGCGGGG) centered at −34 (Fig. 1 B). An identical sequence was found in the human gene centered at −36, further suggesting a role for this region in regulation of the c subunit gene (32Gillespie G.A. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Weinstat-Saslow D. Reeders S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because GC/GT boxes, the cognate binding sequences for the Sp1 family of transcription factors, are often critical components of TATA-less promoters (31Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), we mutated this site to GGaataaGG and determined activity of the resulting fragment. As illustrated in Fig. 3, construct −88 to +158/mutGC showed activity similar to the construct in which the majority of the GC box was deleted (−31 to +158), indicating that this site is a primary element required for basal expression of the c subunit in both 3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the activity of the c subunit promoter, relative to the CMV-driven internal standard, was higher in 3T3 cells than in RAW 264.7; however, these data cannot be taken as measurements of absolute activity, because the strength of the CMV promoter varies among cell types. To more accurately measure the relative transcriptional activity of the c subunit promoter in fibroblasts and macrophages, we performed nuclear run-off analysis. Nuclei were prepared from both cell types, and transcription was permitted to proceed in the presence of [32P]UTP. Equal numbers of radiolabeled RNA were added to membrane strips containing cDNA probes for either the c subunit, or the cloning vector pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as a negative control. As shown in Fig.3 C, radiolabeled c subunit mRNAs were detected at equal levels in both 3T3 and RAW cells, indicating that c subunit transcription in these cells represents equivalent fractions of overall transcription. Although interpretation of this experiment requires the assumption that the overall levels of RNA synthesis do not differ dramatically between the two cell types, this result further suggests that activity of the c subunit promoter is similar in both fibroblasts and macrophages. To determine the identity of factors that bind to the GC box, we performed gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from both 3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells.

Although thrombomodulin has been proposed to alter the thrombin active site, the recently determined structure of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex does not support this proposal. In this study, the contribution of amino acids near the activation site of TAFI toward thrombomodulin dependence was determined, utilizing four variants of TAFI with specific substitutions in the P6-P′3 region surrounding the Arg-92 cleavage site. Two point mutants had either the Ser-90 or Asp-87 of TAFI replaced with Ala, a third mutant had the thrombin activation site of the fibrinogen Bβ-chain substituted into positions 91–95 of TAFI, and a fourth mutant had the thrombin activation site of protein C substituted into positions 90–95 of TAFI. Each of these mutants was expressed, purified, and characterized with respect to activation kinetics and functional properties of the enzyme. Even though fibrinogen is poorly cleaved by thrombin-thrombomodulin, the fibrinogen activation site does not significantly alter the thrombomodulin dependence of TAFI activation. The TAFI variant with the protein C activation sequence is only slowly activated by thrombin-thrombomodulin, and not at all by free thrombin. Mutating Asp-87 to Ala increases the catalytic efficiency of activation 3-fold both in the presence and absence of thrombomodulin, whereas mutating Ser-90 to Ala effects only minor kinetic differences compared with wild type TAFI. The thermal stabilities and antifibrinolytic properties of the enzymes were not substantially altered by any of the mutations that allowed for efficient activation of the enzyme. We conclude that residues in the P6-P′3 region of TAFI do not determine the thrombomodulin dependence of activation, which lends support to the argument that the role of thrombomodulin is to optimally orient thrombin and its substrate, rather than to allosterically alter the specificity of the thrombin active site.

Free thrombin is a potent procoagulant enzyme, whereas thrombin bound to thrombomodulin exerts anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic effects. In response to a vascular injury, the coagulation cascade produces free thrombin that catalyzes the formation of a fibrin clot. Subsequently, the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex inhibits the coagulation cascade, while still protecting the formed clot from premature lysis. In this way clot formation is highly localized, and any clots formed presumably remain intact long enough to prevent excessive blood loss at a site of injury.Thrombin-thrombomodulin mediates its anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic effects through the activation of two zymogens, protein C (3Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Harris K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7944-7947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI)1 (4Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The latter zymogen is also known as plasma procarboxypeptidase B (5Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and proCPU (6Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein C is activated by thrombin at a single cleavage site to form the active serine protease, activated protein C, which acts to inhibit the coagulation cascade by proteolytically inactivating the upstream coagulation factors Va and VIIIa (1Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). TAFI, which can also be activated by a single thrombin cleavage to form the active carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme TAFIa, catalyzes the removal of carboxyl-terminal lysines from a fibrin clot, thereby attenuating co-factor activity for plasminogen activation (7Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Through the activities of these enzymes, thrombin exerts its respective anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic activities.The switch in thrombin specificity mediated by thrombomodulin is nearly absolute. Thrombin can effectively activate many procoagulant substrates, whereas thrombin-thrombomodulin can effectively activate protein C and TAFI; however, the reverse is not true. Thrombin-thrombomodulin has little or no activity toward procoagulant substrates (3Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Harris K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7944-7947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas thrombin is at least a thousandfold less active against protein C and TAFI (8Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby thrombomodulin alters the activity of thrombin has been widely investigated.Thrombomodulin is a membrane-bound protein that projects into the lumen of blood vessels (2Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. Esmon N.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has a lectin-like domain, six tandem EGF domains, a Ser/Thr-rich domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. Although thrombin binds exclusively to the EGF 5 and 6 domains of thrombomodulin, this fragment is not sufficient to activate either protein C or TAFI (10Wang W. Nagashima M. Schneider M. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22942-22947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To effectively activate protein C, a fragment including EGF domains 4–6 plus the interdomain sequence connecting EGF 3 and EGF 4 is required (TMi4–6). TAFI activation requires an additional 13 residues from the C loop of the EGF3 domain (TMc3–6). Therefore, despite the similarity in the kinetics of activation of TAFI and protein C, different structural elements of thrombomodulin are essential for each respective reaction.Esmon and co-workers (11Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have used thrombin mutants and peptides corresponding to the P7-P′3 region of protein C to identify unfavorable charge interactions between Glu-192 and Glu-39 of thrombin and Asp residues at the P3 and P′3 residues of the protein C activation site. They attributed part of the thrombomodulin dependence of protein C activation to the ability of thrombomodulin to minimize these charge interactions, possibly by allosterically altering the thrombin active site, including reorientation of the charged Glu-39 and Glu-192 residues. However, more recent work on the structure of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex has shown that large allosteric changes to thrombin probably do not occur upon binding to thrombomodulin (13Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Rather, thrombomodulin binds to exosite 1 of thrombin, thereby precluding binding of procoagulant substrates such as fibrinogen. Thrombomodulin also may serve as a template directing protein C or TAFI in an optimal orientation for cleavage by thrombin. In addition, extensive Ala scanning mutagenesis of thrombin found that distinct areas of thrombin structure are required for effective protein C or TAFI activation, which further supports a structural argument rather than an argument for an allosterically modified thrombin active site (14Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, the unfavorable effect of the charged residues near the activation site of protein C may be minimized by the orientation of protein C, rather than by alterations to the thrombin active site.In TAFI, the P3 and P′3 residues are the polar Ser-90 and the uncharged Ala-95, respectively (15Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, TAFI exhibits thrombomodulin dependence in its activation that is very similar to protein C (9Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In the TAFI sequence, the closest charged residue is Asp-87 at P6. To explore the role of the residues of TAFI near the cleavage site with respect to the thrombomodulin dependence of activation, we made four TAFI mutants with selective alterations in the P6-P′3 region. We measured the kinetics of activation of each mutant by free thrombin and the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex and found that residues in the P6-P′3 region of TAFI do not contribute significantly to the thrombomodulin dependence of activation.DISCUSSIONTAFI-S90A, TAFI-D87A, and TAFI-FGNap all behave similarly to TAFI-wt with respect to thermal stability, antifibrinolytic potential, and activation kinetics. For each mutant, activation by thrombin in the presence of thrombomodulin was approximately 3 orders of magnitude more efficient than in the presence of thrombin alone, ranging between 1350- and 3180-fold. TAFI-PCap was inefficiently activated by thrombin-thrombomodulin and was not at all activated by thrombin. Although we could not quantify the thrombomodulin dependence, even this mutant exhibited thrombomodulin dependence in its activation. Therefore, these changes to the activation sequence of TAFI do not remove the thrombomodulin dependence of TAFI activation.Because charged residues are important to the thrombomodulin dependence of protein C activation, the role of Asp-87 in TAFI is interesting. When we mutated this residue to Ala, we found that thek cat/K m was 3-fold higher than wild type, and this increase in catalytic efficiency is observed in the presence and absence of thrombomodulin. Similarly to TAFI-wt, TAFI-D87A is activated 1500-fold more efficiently in the presence of thrombomodulin. TAFI-D87A does not exhibit exactly the same thrombomodulin structural requirement as TAFI-wt, because the activation of TAFI-wt is not stimulated at all by TMi4–6, whereas TAFI-D87A is activated by TMi4–6 with approximately 5% of the efficiency of full-length thrombomodulin. Therefore, we have identified a charged residue, Asp-87, that is probably involved in an unfavorable interaction with thrombin and that interaction is not ameliorated by formation of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex.As expected, mutating the Ser-90 residue of TAFI had only a small effect on the activation kinetics. Activation of TAFI-S90A by thrombin-thrombomodulin was roughly 3180-fold more efficient than by thrombin alone, whereas TAFI-wt shows a 1360-fold increase in activation efficiency under the same conditions. We have shown that the presence of a polar residue in the P3 position of TAFI is not especially important in the thrombomodulin dependence of TAFI activation.To explore in more depth whether the residues around the activation site of TAFI are important for thrombomodulin dependence, we made variants of TAFI containing either the fibrinogen or the protein C cleavage site in place of the TAFI cleavage site. Perhaps most surprising is how well TAFI-FGNap is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. It shows a 2000-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of activation in the presence of thrombomodulin as compared with 1360-fold for TAFI-wt. The efficiency of activation is approximately 45% of TAFI-wt, despite the change to the activation site. In fibrinogen, the fibrinogen Bβ chain is quickly cleaved by a low concentration of free thrombin, thereby forming a clot; however, the fibrinogen Bβ chain is not measurably cleaved by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. In the context of TAFI, this sequence has only modest effects on the kinetics of activation, which are similar to those of TAFI-wt and dissimilar to those of fibrinogen. Therefore, the structural elements that make TAFI thrombomodulin-dependent, while fibrinogen is thrombomodulin-independent, apparently are not contained in the activation sites of either protein.TAFI-PCap was the only TAFI mutant that was not efficiently activated by thrombin-thrombomodulin. Intact protein C is activated with kinetics similar to TAFI, showing a large increase in the rate of activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex as compared with thrombin alone. Yet, in TAFI, the protein C thrombin activation site is not efficiently cleaved by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, although the thrombomodulin dependence was retained. Possibly, in the context of TAFI, thrombomodulin is no longer in an appropriate orientation to minimize the unfavorable charge interactions between thrombin and the Asp residues.TMc3–6 was able to activate all of the mutants nearly as efficiently as the full-length soluble thrombomodulin; however, TMi4–6 could not effectively activate the TAFI mutants. Therefore, despite activation site changes, the mutants have the same structural requirements for thrombomodulin as TAFI-wt. Even TAFI-PCap could not be measurably activated by TMi4–6, although this thrombomodulin deletion mutant is fully as active against protein C as full-length thrombomodulin. Therefore, none of the changes in the activation site alter thrombomodulin dependence or remove the requirement for the C loop of the third EGF domain for TAFI activation.Plasmin is the only other identified activator of TAFI that could be physiologically relevant. Like thrombin, plasmin is a serine protease that is highly selective in its physiological targets, so we were interested to see how these mutations altered the activation kinetics by plasmin. Except for TAFI-PCap, all of the TAFI mutants activated at least as well as TAFI-wt. Most surprising was TAFI-FGNap, which was found to be activated with nearly the same kinetics as TAFI-wt. Similar to thrombin, plasmin appears to recognize the fibrinogen cleavage site in the context of TAFI, indicating that elements that make TAFI activable by plasmin probably do not reside in the cleavage site of TAFI or fibrinogen. TAFI-D87A had the most pronounced effect on the activation kinetics by plasmin, increasing thek cat and decreasing the K m. Again, similar to thrombin, the charged residue at position 87 in TAFI is probably involved in an unfavorable interaction with plasmin. TAFI-PCap was the only variant that could not be measurably activated by plasmin, perhaps because of the charged residues introduced in this variant.The allosteric model of thrombin modulation by thrombomodulin predicts a change in the active site of thrombin that alters its specificity from one type of substrate (procoagulant targets) toward another type of substrate (protein C or TAFI). We would expect that, if the allosteric model of thrombomodulin switching is correct, the main determinants of thrombomodulin dependence would reside in the activation site. We would expect that the fibrinogen activation peptide would be thrombomodulin-independent even in the context of TAFI, whereas the protein C activation peptide would be thrombomodulin-dependent in both TAFI and protein C. Instead, we have found that both TAFI-FGNap and TAFI-PCap are thrombomodulin-dependent. Moreover, although TAFI-FGNap is effectively activated, TAFI-PCap is not. These findings lend support to the argument that thrombomodulin functions by orienting the active site of thrombin with the activation peptide of protein C and TAFI, rather than by creating a version of thrombin with an altered active site. More generally we have also shown that residues in the P6-P′3 region neither dictate the overall thrombomodulin dependence of TAFI activation nor change the thrombomodulin structural requirements for efficient TAFI activation. Hemostasis requires a fine balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis (1Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Inappropriately up-regulated coagulation results in a thrombotic tendency, whereas augmented fibrinolysis results in a bleeding tendency. A central protein in this process is thrombomodulin, which fundamentally alters the substrate specificity of thrombin (2Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. Esmon N.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).

Similarly to TAFI-wt, TAFI-D87A is activated 1500-fold more efficiently in the presence of thrombomodulin. TAFI-D87A does not exhibit exactly the same thrombomodulin structural requirement as TAFI-wt, because the activation of TAFI-wt is not stimulated at all by TMi4–6, whereas TAFI-D87A is activated by TMi4–6 with approximately 5% of the efficiency of full-length thrombomodulin. Therefore, we have identified a charged residue, Asp-87, that is probably involved in an unfavorable interaction with thrombin and that interaction is not ameliorated by formation of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. As expected, mutating the Ser-90 residue of TAFI had only a small effect on the activation kinetics. Activation of TAFI-S90A by thrombin-thrombomodulin was roughly 3180-fold more efficient than by thrombin alone, whereas TAFI-wt shows a 1360-fold increase in activation efficiency under the same conditions. We have shown that the presence of a polar residue in the P3 position of TAFI is not especially important in the thrombomodulin dependence of TAFI activation. To explore in more depth whether the residues around the activation site of TAFI are important for thrombomodulin dependence, we made variants of TAFI containing either the fibrinogen or the protein C cleavage site in place of the TAFI cleavage site. Perhaps most surprising is how well TAFI-FGNap is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. It shows a 2000-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of activation in the presence of thrombomodulin as compared with 1360-fold for TAFI-wt. The efficiency of activation is approximately 45% of TAFI-wt, despite the change to the activation site. In fibrinogen, the fibrinogen Bβ chain is quickly cleaved by a low concentration of free thrombin, thereby forming a clot; however, the fibrinogen Bβ chain is not measurably cleaved by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. In the context of TAFI, this sequence has only modest effects on the kinetics of activation, which are similar to those of TAFI-wt and dissimilar to those of fibrinogen. Therefore, the structural elements that make TAFI thrombomodulin-dependent, while fibrinogen is thrombomodulin-independent, apparently are not contained in the activation sites of either protein. TAFI-PCap was the only TAFI mutant that was not efficiently activated by thrombin-thrombomodulin. Intact protein C is activated with kinetics similar to TAFI, showing a large increase in the rate of activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex as compared with thrombin alone. Yet, in TAFI, the protein C thrombin activation site is not efficiently cleaved by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, although the thrombomodulin dependence was retained. Possibly, in the context of TAFI, thrombomodulin is no longer in an appropriate orientation to minimize the unfavorable charge interactions between thrombin and the Asp residues. TMc3–6 was able to activate all of the mutants nearly as efficiently as the full-length soluble thrombomodulin; however, TMi4–6 could not effectively activate the TAFI mutants. Therefore, despite activation site changes, the mutants have the same structural requirements for thrombomodulin as TAFI-wt. Even TAFI-PCap could not be measurably activated by TMi4–6, although this thrombomodulin deletion mutant is fully as active against protein C as full-length thrombomodulin. Therefore, none of the changes in the activation site alter thrombomodulin dependence or remove the requirement for the C loop of the third EGF domain for TAFI activation. Plasmin is the only other identified activator of TAFI that could be physiologically relevant. Like thrombin, plasmin is a serine protease that is highly selective in its physiological targets, so we were interested to see how these mutations altered the activation kinetics by plasmin. Except for TAFI-PCap, all of the TAFI mutants activated at least as well as TAFI-wt. Most surprising was TAFI-FGNap, which was found to be activated with nearly the same kinetics as TAFI-wt. Similar to thrombin, plasmin appears to recognize the fibrinogen cleavage site in the context of TAFI, indicating that elements that make TAFI activable by plasmin probably do not reside in the cleavage site of TAFI or fibrinogen. TAFI-D87A had the most pronounced effect on the activation kinetics by plasmin, increasing thek cat and decreasing the K m. Again, similar to thrombin, the charged residue at position 87 in TAFI is probably involved in an unfavorable interaction with plasmin. TAFI-PCap was the only variant that could not be measurably activated by plasmin, perhaps because of the charged residues introduced in this variant. The allosteric model of thrombin modulation by thrombomodulin predicts a change in the active site of thrombin that alters its specificity from one type of substrate (procoagulant targets) toward another type of substrate (protein C or TAFI). We would expect that, if the allosteric model of thrombomodulin switching is correct, the main determinants of thrombomodulin dependence would reside in the activation site. We would expect that the fibrinogen activation peptide would be thrombomodulin-independent even in the context of TAFI, whereas the protein C activation peptide would be thrombomodulin-dependent in both TAFI and protein C. Instead, we have found that both TAFI-FGNap and TAFI-PCap are thrombomodulin-dependent. Moreover, although TAFI-FGNap is effectively activated, TAFI-PCap is not. These findings lend support to the argument that thrombomodulin functions by orienting the active site of thrombin with the activation peptide of protein C and TAFI, rather than by creating a version of thrombin with an altered active site. More generally we have also shown that residues in the P6-P′3 region neither dictate the overall thrombomodulin dependence of TAFI activation nor change the thrombomodulin structural requirements for efficient TAFI activation."

Despite recent determination of the crystal structures of a Michaelis protease-serpin complex as well as a stable covalent complex, details on the kinetic mechanism remain unsolved mainly due to difficulties in measuring kinetic parameters of acylation, protease translocation, and deacylation steps. To address the problem, we applied a mathematical model developed on the basis of a suicide inhibition mechanism to the stopped-flow kinetics of fluorescence resonance energy transfer during complex formation between α1-antitrypsin, a prototype serpin, and proteases. Compared with the hydrolysis of a peptide substrate, acylation of the protease by α1-antitrypsin is facilitated, whereas deacylation of the acyl intermediate is strongly suppressed during the protease translocation. The results from nucleophile susceptibility of the acyl intermediate suggest strongly that the active site of the protease is already perturbed during translocation.

Upon binding a target protease, the serpin acylates the protease, and the resulting cleavage at P1-P1′ bond in the reactive site loop of the serpin triggers insertion of the loop into the major β-sheet, sheet A, of the serpin molecule, which accompanies translocation of the protease to the opposite pole (6.Wright H.T.

We describe here a development of a mathematical model for the inhibition kinetics and an interpretation of a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer from protease to α1-antitrypsin (α1AT), a prototype serpin, during complex formation with a target protease. This approach allowed us to measure the individual kinetic constants and to compare differences in the reaction of the protease with the serpin and that with a peptide substrate. In addition, steady state kinetic analyses of acyl-transfer efficiency of various nucleophiles provided evidence supporting that the active site of a protease is already perturbed during the translocation. Porcine pancreatic elastase, bovine pancreatic trypsin (diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated), N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide,d-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide were purchased from Sigma. 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS) was from Molecular Probes. Synthetic octapeptide spanning from P4 to P4′ of the reactive site loop of α1AT (8-mer RSL: Ac-Ala-Ile-Pro-Met-Ser-Ile-Pro-Pro-NH2) was from Peptron (Taejon, Korea). All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Plasmids for α1AT expression in Escherichia coli, and preparation of recombinant proteins were carried out as described previously (30.Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the oligonucleotide-directed method. Concentrations of wild-type or mutants α1AT were determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 27,000m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (31.Pannell R. Johnson D. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5439-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The SI was determined as described previously (16.Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active concentration of elastase was determined by measuring the initial rate of hydrolysis of 1 mm N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide. The active concentration of trypsin was determined using p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate as an active site titrant (32.Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 75: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Purified α1AT was incubated in 50 μl of assay buffer (200 mm Tris, 160 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) with 100 nm elastase or trypsin at predetermined molar ratios of α1AT to protease. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with the assay buffer, and the residual activity of elastase or trypsin was determined using 1 mm N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide or 0.1 mmd-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide as a substrate, respectively. The activity inhibition was extrapolated to yield the minimum molar ratio of α1AT to the protease giving 100% inhibition. Measurements of the SI at pH values other than 8.0 were carried out using the same assay buffer (pH 7.5–8.5) or modified assay buffer (pH 6.5–7.0; Tris was replaced by potassium phosphate). Irrespective of pH values in the incubating solution, residual activity of protease was measured at pH 8.0. Determination of the SI toward elastase in the presence of nucleophiles was carried out in 50 μl of the assay buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 nmelastase and various concentrations of nucleophiles (0–200 mm for l-Phe-NH2 and l-Arg-NH2; 0–540 mm for Gly-NH2, l-Ala-NH2,l-Val-NH2, l-Met-NH2,l-Leu-NH2, and l-Lys-NH2). After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with the assay buffer and the residual activity of elastase was determined using 1 mm N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide. The association rate constant between α1AT and the protease was determined using a continuous assay procedure (25.Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33.Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Patston P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4569-4573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Elastase or trypsin (10 nm) was incubated with various concentrations of α1AT (100–300 nm) in the assay buffer containing 1 mm N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide or 0.1 mmd-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide, respectively. The reaction was continuously monitored at 410 nm. Initial rates of hydrolysis of N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide (0.1–1 mm) ord-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide (10–100 μm) by elastase or trypsin, respectively, were measured spectroscopically using molar extinction coefficient of p-nitroaniline of 8372 m−1cm−1 (determined empirically) at 410 nm in the assay buffer described above. The concentrations of the proteases were 10 nm. At each pH value, Km and Vm were obtained by non-linear fits of the kinetic data to Michaelis-Menten equation. The 314-residue site of α1AT was chosen for dansylation because of proximity to the protease (9.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10.Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) and insensitivity to activity change by point mutations (14.Seo E.J. Im H. Maeng J.-S. Kim K.E. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16904-16909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The original cysteine at the 232 site was replaced with serine, and a unique cysteinyl residue was introduced at the 314 site by site-directed mutagenesis. Dansylation of the resulting Cys314/Ser232 α1AT variant was carried out with thiol-selective reagent, 1,5-IAEDANS, as described elsewhere (9.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The purified α1AT mutant (10–20 μm) was reacted overnight with a 20-fold excess of 1,5-IAEDANS in 50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C in the dark. Dithiothreitol was added to the final concentration of 1 mmto quench the reaction. Residual reagents were removed by applying the solution on gel filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S-100). Labeling efficiency was determined spectrophotometrically using ε340 of 5700 m−1cm−1 for the dansyl group (9.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and the protein absorbance at 280 nm that was corrected for the contribution of dansyl at the wavelength (empirically determined to be 23.7% of the absorbance at 340 nm). The labeling ratios were above 0.95. Covalent complexes of protease-α1AT were prepared by reaction of 1:1 or 1:1.7 molar ratio of trypsin or elastase over dansyl-labeled α1AT, respectively. The products, protease-α1AT complex and cleaved α1AT, were separated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-100. In all cases, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to characterize the reaction products. All fluorescence measurements were made on an LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 25 °C using a thermostated cuvette. For measurement of fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophan to dansyl, excitation was at 292 nm with emission recorded from 400 to 600 nm. Slits were 4 nm for both excitation and emission. Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer was measured using an SFM-4 stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). Reactions were carried out at 60 nmdansyl-α1AT (314C/232S) and various concentration of elastase or trypsin in 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH ∼6.5–7.0) or 200 mm Tris (pH ∼7.5–8.5) at 25 °C. Excitation was at 292 nm, and emission was measured using a 435-nm cut-off filter. The ratio between aminolysis and hydrolysis of acyl complex formed between elastase and the synthetic peptide spanning from P4 to P4′ of α1AT (8-mer RSL: Ac-Ala-Ile-Pro-Met-Ser-Ile-Pro-Pro-NH2) was determined by analyzing reaction products. Reactions were conducted for 1 h in 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 100 μmsynthetic peptide, 0–40 mm nucleophiles (amide forms of amino acids) and 1 μm elastase at 25 °C. The reactions were quenched with 16% perchloric acid. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, 100 μl of supernatant was injected into a Vydac C8 column on an Äcta explorer system (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). A gradient elution of water (A)/acetonitrile (B) (both contain 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was used (0–7 min, isocratic elution of 95/5 (A/B), 7–32 min, linear gradient from 95/5 to 30/70, flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, and detection at 270 nm). Only one N-terminal fragment (Ac-Ala-Ile-Pro-Met) was identified on the reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography after hydrolyzing the 8-mer RSL, as reported previously (34.McRae B. Nakajima K. Travis J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3973-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The aminolysis product was estimated from the decrease in the hydrolysis product because the presence of nucleophiles other than water decreased the concentration of the N-terminal fragment due to the formation of the aminolyzed product (Ac-Ala-Ile-Pro-Met-X-NH2). In all cases, the reaction time of 1 h was sufficient to completely hydrolyze and/or aminolyze the 8-mer RSL in the reaction conditions. The ratio between aminolysis and hydrolysis rate constants were determined by linear regression of the product ratio against the concentration of nucleophile as described earlier (35.Schellenberger V. Schellenberger U. Mitin Y.V. Jakubke H.-D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36.Kurth T. Ullmann D. Jakubke H.-D. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10098-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Initial rates of 8-mer RSL hydrolysis by elastase (100 nm) were measured in 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, using the reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography described above. The concentration of the 8-mer RSL was varied between 50 and 500 μm. The Km and Vmvalues were obtained by non-linear fit. To develop a mathematical model for describing protease inhibition by serpin, mass balance equations for the six-reaction species in Scheme FS1 were derived as follows in Equation 1. d[E]dt=−k1[E][I]+k−1[EI]+kdeac[E­I]Equation 1 d[I]dt=−k1[E][I]+k−1[EI] d[EI]dt=k1[E][I]−(k−1+kac)[EI] d[E­I]dt=kac[EI]−(ktr+kdeac)[E­I] d[E­I*]dt=ktr[E­I] d[I*]dt=kdeac[E­I] Under pseudo-first order reaction conditions ([E]0≫[I]0), the mass balance equations followed by Laplace transformation are given in matrix form in Equation 2, pk1[E]0−k−1−kdeac000p+k1[E]0−k−10000−k1[E]0k−1+kac+p00000−kacktr+kdeac+p00000−ktrp0000−kdeac0pL[E]L[I]L[EI]L[E­I]L[E­I*]L[I*]=[E]0[I]00000Equation 2 where the function L of the variable p represents Laplace transform and initial concentrations of the species, except E and I are zero. Equation 2 afforded derivation of rate equations for all reaction species. E-I* was expressed in Equation 3 as a function of time by taking inverse Laplace transform to L[E-I*] [E­I*]=ktr[I]0kdeac+ktr+k1kacktr[E]0[I]0e−α·tα(β−α)(α−γ)+e−β·tβ(α−β)(β−γ)+e−γ·tγ(γ−β)(α−γ)Equation 3 where α, β, and γ are given in Equations 4 through 6. α=ktr+kdeacEquation 4 β={(k−1+kac+k1[E]0) +(k−1+kac+k1[E]0)2−4k1kac[E]0}/2Equation 5 γ={(k−1+kac+k1[E]0) −(k−1+kac+k1[E]0)2−4k1kac[E]0}/2Equation 6 Although Equation 3 is intractable for an analysis of kinetic data, the equation can be further simplified at the saturating concentration of E (note that β and γ approach k1[E]0 and kac, respectively, as [E]0 goes infinite). Therefore, at the limiting condition [E-I*] can be rewritten as shown in Equation 7. [E­I*]=ktr[I]0kdeac+ktr+kacktr[I]0(kdeac+ktr)(kdeac+ktr−kac)e−(kdeac+ktr)·t+ktr[I]0kac−ktr−kdeace−kac·tEquation 7 Equation 7 indicates that the observed kinetic constants obtained by fitting the kinetic data to exponential growth function should approach kdeac + ktr or kac as [E]0 goes infinite. Given the kinetic model above, kinetic measurement of E-I* production during the reaction was performed by monitoring fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophans in the protease to the dansyl group labeled at Cys314 of α1AT. Fig. 1 shows that emission intensity of the dansyl group increased strongly by complex formation of α1AT with elastase (dashed line) or trypsin (dot-dashed line) compared with dansyl-labeled free α1AT (solid line) or cleaved α1AT (dotted line). Contribution of elastase or trypsin to the emission spectra in the monitored region was negligible (data not shown). It was reported that formation of a Michaelis complex between dansyl-labeled α1AT and anhydrotrypsin did not induce any increase in the emission spectra (9.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Taken together, increase in the fluorescence intensity upon complex formation can be truly correlated with the actual increase in the concentration of the stable covalent complex (E-I*). To confirm that kinetic and inhibitory properties of α1AT are not affected by dansyl labeling and the mutations (N314C/C232S) introduced for the labeling, the SI and association rate constants were measured. Dansyl-labeled α1AT and the wild-type α1AT exhibited nearly identical values toward both elastase and trypsin (Table I). Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the dansyl-labeling does not alter individual kinetic steps of the complex formation.Table IInhibitory parameters of dansyl-labeled α1AT variantsSI105m−1 s−1 kaaSecond-order association rate constant is defined by k1/k−1 ×kac.elastasetrypsinelastasetrypsinWild-type α1AT1.68 ± 0.041.01 ± 0.024.67 ± 0.411.56 ± 0.09Dansyl-labeled α1AT1.72 ± 0.061.03 ± 0.034.63 ± 0.251.64 ± 0.04All the kinetic measurements were carried out independently at least in triplicate, and the typical deviation of the kinetic parameter from the mean did not exceed 10%.a Second-order association rate constant is defined by k1/k−1 ×kac. Open table in a new tab All the kinetic measurements were carried out independently at least in triplicate, and the typical deviation of the kinetic parameter from the mean did not exceed 10%. Fig. 2A shows typical progress curves during the reaction between dansyl-labeled α1AT and a target protease. The progress curve of the reaction between α1AT and trypsin showed a double-exponential phase that extrapolated to the fluorescence of free α1AT at zero time, whereas the progress curve of the elastase reaction showed a single-exponential phase of which the extrapolation greatly exceeded the fluorescence of free α1AT. Fig. 2B shows the observed rate constants (kobs) as a function of protease concentration (filled symbols, reaction with elastase;open symbols, reaction with trypsin), which follows a hyperbolic dependence. To identify steps corresponding to each phase, pH dependence of each phase was examined. The limiting value of kobs for the reaction between α1AT and elastase (Fig. 3A, ●) was relatively insensitive to the pH change. Similarly, the limiting value of kobs of the slow phase in the reaction between α1AT and trypsin (Fig. 3B, ▾) was not sensitive to pH change. In contrast, the limiting value of kobs for the fast phase in the reaction between α1AT and trypsin showed a bell-shaped pH profile (Fig. 3B, ▴). The kcat value for the hydrolysis of N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide ord-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide showed a typical bell-shaped pH profile for both proteases (Fig. 3, A and B, ▪). The SI values for both reactions were not sensitive to the pH change (data not shown).Figure 3The pH dependence of limiting values of the observed rate constants.

We examined the susceptibility of the acyl linkage between α1AT and elastase to nucleophilic attack during conformational change. The presence of the nucleophiles in reaction medium increased SI of α1AT (Fig. 4). The nucleophiles added in reaction medium deacylate E-I and regenerate free enzyme as depicted in Scheme FS2, where kN is the deacylation rate constant by the nucleophile and [Nu] is the concentration of the nucleophile. As shown in Equation 8, the SI value considering the deacylation by the nucleophiles can be derived asScheme FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SI=SI0+(kN/ktr)[Nu]Equation 8 where SI0 is the SI value in the absence of nucleophile. As predicted by Equation 8, irrespective of the nucleophiles employed, the SI values showed a linear correlation with nucleophile concentration (Fig. 4). The increase in SI was not from enhanced deacylation of stable covalent complex (E-I*) because regeneration of protease activity from the stable complex was negligible and was not affected by the nucleophiles under the experimental conditions (data not shown). Because the nucleophiles do not affect ktr, the slopes on the plot reflect relative nucleophilicities, l-Arg-NH2 showing the strongest nucleophilicity, whereas Gly-NH2 the weakest. The order of nucleophilicity in Fig. 4 was in accordance with the results from the previ"
