During contraction the error could be as much as 40 degrees. The subject thought that the elbow was in the position that it would have assumed if the vibrated muscle had been stretched."
https://openalex.org/W1499814836,"The levels of glycolytic intermediates, selected amino acids, and citric acid cycle intermediates have been measured in Escherichia coli in logarithmic growth on a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources, and also after rapid addition of nitrients to cultures. The results have been used to assess the regulatory role of various metabolites in E. coli. Gluconeogenesis is associated with high phosphoenolpyruvate levels and low levels of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, in agreement with the proposed regulatory mechanisms for phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Isotopic experiments indicate that considerable gluconeogenesis occurs in succinate- or glycerol-grown cells after the addition of glucose, although the levels of glycolytic intermediates resemble those of glucose-grown cells, indicating that control gluconeogenesis is leaky. The levels of adenosine triphosphate are lower in slowly growing cells, limited either by the availability of carbon (cells grown on acetate-NH4Cl) or by the availability of nitrogen (cells grown on glucose-glycine). These changes reflect primarily changes in the total adenine nucleotide pool, rather than major changes in the ratio of various adenine nucleotides. Measurements of the level of metabolic intermediates in acetate-grown cells, before and after the addition of glucose, suggest that isocitrate lyase is controlled in vivo by metabolites other than phosphoenolpyruvate, and that both isocitrate lyase and isocitrate dehydrogenase play roles in regulating isocitrate utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1595343629,"A glycoprotein of human platelets is released into the incubation medium upon treatment of the intact cells with 1 unit per ml of thrombin for 2 min. The cellular location and properties of this protein differ from those of other thrombin-labile platelet proteins such as fibrin-stabilizing factor, fibrinogen, and the contractile protein thrombosthenin. It occurs only in the particulate fraction and is released only from intact cells. Thrombin concentrations of 100 units per ml do not release this thrombin-sensitive protein from sonicated platelets. As isolated from the incubation supernatant of thrombin-treated platelets the thrombin-sensitive protein is excluded from Sephadex G-200; it has an apparent molecular weight of 190,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, from which it has been purified and partially characterized. No smaller subunits have been found. It has limited solubility in the absence of detergent, and is highly sensitive to proteolytic degradation in whole platelets and after release from the cells. Membrane-bound and released forms of the thrombin-sensitive protein show no significant difference in molecular weight or amino acid and carbohydrate composition, suggesting that release does not involve proteolysis of the thrombin-sensitive protein itself by thrombin. This protein contains 3.9% sialic acid, 1.6% N-acetylglucosamine, and 25% each of acidic and nonpolar residues. Although it contains carbohydrate the thrombin-sensitive protein does not represent the major membrane glycoprotein of platelets, for it contains only 5% of the total platelet sialic acid. The thrombin-sensitive protein accounts for approximately 5% of the total protein in the particulate fraction of human platelets and represents about 20 to 30% of the protein found in the incubation supernatant after thrombin treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1584934876,"Abstract The rutamycin-sensitive adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) complex has been solubilized from yeast submitochondrial particles with Triton X-100 and further purified by centrifugation on a glycerol gradient. The purified enzyme is dispersed and by electron microscopic criteria appears to be an oval-shaped globular particle 100 by 150 A. Both the cold-labile ATPase, coupling factor 1 (F1) and the rutamycin-sensitive complex have been analyzed for their subunit protein composition and their molecular weights by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The results of these analyses indicate that F1 contains five different subunit proteins. The two major subunits of F1 have molecular weights of 58,500 and 54,000. The rutamycin-sensitive complex contains all of the components of F1 and four additional proteins. The composite molecular weight of the proteins specific to the complex is approximately 100,000. Two lines of evidence indicate that the subunit proteins seen on polyacrylamide gels are intrinsic components of the complex. The ATPase complex reconstituted from F1, oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein, and depleted membranes has been shown to contain all of the subunits seen in the native enzyme. Secondly, antibody prepared against F1 cause the nine subunits of the complex to precipitate."

https://openalex.org/W1639997195,"The role of proactivators for the streptokinase activation of human plasminogen was studied. It was found that plasmin, as well as plasminogen, can form activator complex with streptokinase. The relative importance of these two proactivators for the streptokinase activation of human plasminogen is discussed. The use of the active center-specific reagent, p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate (NPGB) established that an active center appears in the streptokinase-plasminogen complex even before proteolytic activity develops, i.e. before conversion to streptokinase-plasmin. When, in the presence of NPGB, plasminogen is mixed with increasing amounts of streptokinase, equivalent amounts of unactivatable plasminogen are obtained. Physical evidence indicates that the active center develops in the complex before the plasminogen moiety was converted to plasmin, i.e. before cleavage of the single peptide chain of plasminogen. Activator activity, like NPGB-reactivity, is imparted to the complex before proteolytic activity is acquired. It appears that the transitory streptokinase-plasminogen complex plays a dominant role in the streptokinase activation of human plasminogen, as its formation does not depend on the presence of spontaneous plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W1576393321,"Abstract The rutamycin-sensitive ATPase complex of yeast mitocondria consists of the ATPase, F1, of an easily extractable protein (OSCP) which is concerned with the binding of F1 to the membrane, and of another membrane factor which contains at least four distinct subunit proteins. When glucose-repressed yeast are incubated in a low glucose medium containing cycloheximide and radioactive leucine, label is incorporated into a fraction which forms a precipitable complex with antiserum to the rutamycin-sensitive ATPase. Analysis of the antibody precipitate by gel electrophoresis has revealed that at least four distinct proteins are labeled. The labeled products comigrate with known subunits of the rutamycin-sensitive ATPase and comprise those protein components of the ATPase which are most firmly associated with the membrane. These results indicate that with the exception of F1 and OSCP, which are synthesized in the cytoplasm, the remaining subunits of the ATPase are made by the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W2019136523,"Factors that induce cell aggregation are released by several types of chick embryo and mammalian cell cultures. These aggregation factors are also present in some serums. The factors in each of the preparations tested were inactivated by treatment with bovine testicular hyaluronidase. Conversely, hyaluronic acid promoted aggregation of only those cells that were aggregated by media containing the factors. These factors appear to be acid mucopolysaccharides, with hyaluronic acid being a major component."
https://openalex.org/W1993841155,"A new, highly fluorescent adenosine triphophate (ATP) analog, 1,N(6) ethenoadenosine triphosphate, has been synthesized. Its fluorescence properties, including the long fluorescence lifetime and the possibility of detection at very low concentrations, in conjunction with its activity in the representative enzyme systems here reported, make it a valuable probe of enzymic mechanism and structure."
https://openalex.org/W1535500294,"Abstract Fibroblasts from patients with the Sanfilippo syndrome fall into two subgroups, each manifesting a deficiency of a specific factor required for normal metabolism of sulfated mucopolysaccharide. The factor deficient in the A subgroup has been purified 850-fold from normal human urine by ammonium sulfate precipitation, successive chromatography on Sephadex G-200, carboxymethylcellulose, and hydroxylapatite, and finally, by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The best preparation, estimated to be about 40% pure, was free of factors specific for other mucopolysaccharidoses, as well as of several lysosomal enzymes found in urine: β-d-galactosidase, N-acetyl-α-d-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-α-d-galactosaminidase, β-d-glucuronidase, and arylsulfatase B. It was, however, somewhat contaminated with aryl sulfatase A, and markedly so with N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and N-acetyl-β-d-galactosaminidase. The factor accelerates degradation of stored mucopolysaccharide in Sanfilippo A fibroblasts, as indicated by chase experiments. After the factor is removed from the medium, its effect persists in the cells with a half-life of 2 days. Incubation of stored mucopolysaccharide (tentatively identified as heparan sulfate with a high N-sulfate content) with purified factor resulted in release of inorganic sulfate. It is suggested that the Sanfilippo A factor is a heparan sulfate sulfatase."
https://openalex.org/W1557095374,"Abstract Highly purified rat kidney γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (mol wt ∼92,000) catalyzes three partial reactions which appear to reflect aspects of the over-all catalytic mechanism: Reaction 1, hydrolysis of ATP; Reaction 2, phosphorylation by ATP of inorganic phosphate to yield inorganic pyrophosphate, and Reaction 3, cyclization of glutamate to pyrrolidone carboxylate associated with cleavage of ATP. Reactions 1 and 2 are inhibited by l-glutamate, glutamate analogues, and methionine sulfoximine. The enzyme does not catalyze ADP-ATP or Pi-ATP exchange reactions, but does catalyze incorporation of glutamate and of α-aminobutyrate into γ-glutamyl-α-aminobutyrate in the presence of ADP and Pi. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of pyrrolidone carboxylate from d-glutamate about 5 times more rapidly than from l-glutamate; however, the rate of synthesis of dipeptide from d-glutamate is very much less than that from l-glutamate. The enzyme is less active in γ-glutamylcysteine and γ-glutamyl-α-aminobutyrate synthesis when Mg++ is replaced by Mn++, but the amino acid acceptor specificity is broader with Mn++ than with Mg++ and some amino acids are utilized more rapidly with Mn++ than with Mg++. An enzyme-glutamate complex was isolated by gel filtration in the presence of ATP-Mn++; the data are consistent with the conclusion that enzyme-bound γ-glutamylphosphate is an intermediate in dipeptide synthesis. A scheme is presented for the reactions catalyzed by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1548212179,"Abstract Protein-keratan sulfate core was isolated from bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan after enzymatically removing chondroitin sulfate with chondroitinase AC from Flavobacterium heparinum. The core preparation exhibited a broad, approximately Gaussian distribution of buoyant densities in CsCl density gradients (between 1.43 and 1.58 g per ml with an average of 1.51 g per ml). Chemical and physical analyses of subfractions from the density gradient indicate that the core macromolecules have a wide polydispersity in molecular weights (350,000 to 550,000, with an average of 450,000). Molecules with larger molecular weights have greater buoyant densities and higher ratios of keratan sulfate to protein. The data suggest that the core molecules contain a protein (or combination of proteins) with a molecular weight of about 200,000 to which different amounts of keratan sulfate are attached. Differences in average keratan sulfate chain lengths and chain numbers appear to contribute to the polydispersity of the protein-keratan sulfate core. Keratan sulfate was isolated from the core preparation after proteolysis with papain and purification with DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Chemical and physical analyses of the keratan sulfate indicate that the polysaccharide exhibits a large polydispersity of molecular weights with a weight average molecular weight of about 8,500 and a z-average molecular weight of about 11,000, and that polysaccharide molecules with larger molecular weights have higher ratios of glucosamine to galactosamine. Alkali treatment of the keratan sulfate selectively destroys threonine and serine as it does for other skeletal keratan sulfates. After alkaline treatment the keratan sulfate chromatographs on Sephadex G-100 with a higher retention volume, Kd = 0.6, than that for the untreated preparation, Kd = 0.3, which indicates that the sizes of the molecules have been significantly reduced. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the papain-prepared keratan sulfate consists of molecules which contain two polysaccharide chains, each with an average of about six repeat disaccharides, connected through a peptide bridge. Each chain probably contains a terminal sialic acid residue and is attached to the protein with a glycosidic bond between galactosamine and a threonine or serine residue. The high concentration of glutamic acid in the fraction suggests that the polysaccharide chains are also attached in some way to this amino acid. Such a model suggests that the intact proteoglycan macromolecules each contain about 60 keratan sulfate chains of variable lengths built onto the protein core structure."
https://openalex.org/W1468528382,"Abstract Exposure of chloroplasts to a tritiated water solvent resulted in labeling of the coupling factor protein (CF1) concomitant with formation of a phosphorylating state in the membranes; tritium uptake occurred during illumination, acid-base transition, and ATPase activity in chloroplasts, and was largely abolished by inhibitors which destroy the high energy condition. In digitonin subchloroplast particles, the light-dependent tritiation of CF1 occurred in the presence of NH4Cl. Further addition of valinomycin, which uncouples phosphorylation, largely prevented the labeling. These and previous observations (Ryrie, I. J., and Jagendorf, A. T. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 3771) are interpreted as evidence for an energy-linked conformational change in CF1. It is suggested that this may be necessary to allow ATP synthesis. Inclusion of ADP and Pi decreased both tritium uptake into CF1 and a light-induced discharge from the previously labeled protein. Apparently, the inhibition was not dependent on ATP synthesis. We conclude that in the presence of substrates, less of the protein matrix is exposed by the conformaional change."
https://openalex.org/W1557778695,"Abstract The treatment of chloroplasts with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in the light, but not in the dark, resulted in a partial, permanent inhibition of photophosphorylation. Noncyclic electron flow coupled to phosphorylation was also inhibited on incubation of chloroplasts with NEM in the light, but this inhibition was reversed by ammonium chloride. The uncouplers, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and ammonium chloride, largely prevented the inhibition. Adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate partially protected phosphorylation from inhibition by light and NEM. Light-induced hydrogen ion uptake was unaffected by NEM except that the uptake stimulated by adenosine triphosphate was inhibited. The calcium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase of coupling factor 1 was also inhibited in chloroplasts treated with NEM in the light prior to extraction of the coupling factor. It is suggested that light causes a conformational change in the membrane-bound coupling factor, allowing the reaction of a group (or groups) with NEM. The sensitivity of the inhibition to adenine nucleotides suggests that these nucleotides modify the conformation of coupling factor 1 in the light."
https://openalex.org/W1486928458,"Abstract The factor which corrects the abnormal mucopolysaccharide metabolism of Hurler fibroblasts (Hurler factor) has been purified 1000-fold from normal human urine. The Hurler factor behaves at high salt concentration as a protein of molecular weight of 87,000, as determined by chromatography on Sephadex G-200; at low salt concentration, it tends to aggregate and become inactive. Two major peaks of corrective activity can be separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Experiments with whole cells indicate that Hurler factor accelerates degradation of stored sulfated mucopolysaccharide and that the effect of exogenously supplied Hurler factor persists in Hurler fibroblasts with a half-life of at least 9 days. Hurler factor is distinct from the common lysosomal hydrolases, including β-galactosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1498085580,"Abstract An actin-like protein was isolated from the acetone powder of glycerinated chick embryo fibroblasts and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein has a molecular weight of 45,500, resembles rabbit actin in electrophoretic mobility and ultrastructure, undergoes reversible globular-fibrous transformations, and combines with rabbit myosin to form hybrid actomyosin. This actomyosin exhibits ATPase activity and superprecipitation properties similar to those of actomyosin from rabbit muscle. In fibroblasts, the actin-like protein may function in the maintenance of shape and in the implementation of intra- and extracellular movements."

The enzyme has optimal activity at pH 8.0, is inactive below pH 5.0 or above pH 10.5, requires calcium for maximum activity, hydrolyzes fibrinogen, gelatin, and benzoylarginine ethyl ester, and is inhibited by various synthetic and natural proteinase inhibitors. The molecular weight was estimated to be 30,000. Human spermatozoa also possess a proteinase inhibitor that is similar to one of the proteinase inhibitors from human seminal plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1571624606,"Abstract Human plasminogen and diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate or l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated plasmin, prepared from plasma Fraction III2,3 by ion exchange and gel filtration methods, and the equimolar human plasminstreptokinase complex show multiple molecular forms in acrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.4 in either 0.3 m e-aminocaproic acid or 8 m urea. Eight similar bands were found in the gel patterns of the zymogen and enzyme. The S-carboxymethyl heavy (A) chain derivative of plasmin did not show multiple molecular forms in acrylamide gel electrophoresis in either 0.3 m e-aminocaproic acid or 8 m urea. However, the S-carboxymethyl light (B) chain derivative showed multiple forms in acrylamide gel electrophoresis but in 8 m urea only. Plasminogen prepared from either pooled plasma, or plasma Fractions III or III2,3, by affinity chromatography on lysine-substituted-Sepharose columns showed the same multiple molecular forms in acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.3 m e-aminocaproic acid as were found in our highly purified plasminogen preparations but with different quantitative distributions. Affinity chromatography of only plasma Fraction III2,3 gave preparations with specific potential proteolytic activities which were equivalent in activity to our standard preparations. The multiple molecular forms of plasminogen and plasmin prepared from plasma Fraction III2,3 by ion exchange and gel filtration methods were isolated by isoelectric focusing methods. Eight plasminogen forms were obtained with isoelectric points ranging from pH 6.4 to pH 8.5. All of the forms had similar specific potential proteolytic activities. Each isoelectric form contained two closely related acrylamide gel electrophoretic components (doublet bands), both common to either adjacent isoelectric forms. Eight diisopropylphosphoryl-plasmin forms were isolated with isoelectric points ranging from pH 7.0 to pH 8.5. Radiolabeling and specific antibody were used to determine specific plasmin forms. Each plasmin isoelectric form also contained two closely related acrylamide gel electrophoretic components (doublet bands), both common to either adjacent isoelectric forms. Plasminogen isoelectric forms pH values 7.2 and 7.5 and diisopropylphosphoryl-plasmin isoelectric forms pH values 7.4 and 7.7 show the same acrylamide gel electrophoretic mobilities, respectively; the zymogen and enzyme forms differ in isoelectric point by approximately 0.2 pH unit. Plasminogen form pH 7.2 and its derived diisopropylphosphoryl-plasmin form show the same acrylamide gel electrophoretic mobilities. The S-carboxymethyl heavy (A) and light (B) chain derivatives of plasmin were studied in isoelectric focusing. Three major light (B) chain fractions were isolated with isoelectric points of pH values 5.8, 5.9, and 6.0. The amount of each of the three major acrylamide gel electrophoretic forms in each isoelectric fraction was different; none of the fractions showed a single pure form. The heavy (A) chain derivative gave a single form with an isoelectric point of pH 4.9. The plasminogen isoelectric forms pH values 7.5 and 7.8, after conversion to plasmin, followed by reduction and alkylation, each gave light (B) chain preparations containing all of the major acrylamide gel electrophoretic forms. No changes in acrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility could be found in any of the multiple molecular forms of zymogen, enzyme, or light (B) chain derivative following isoelectric focusing or other preparative procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1581351937,"Abstract The binding of ATP to sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, the formation of a phosphoprotein intermediate, and its subsequent hydrolysis were studied. Calcium, but not magnesium, decreased the dissociation constant of the ATP-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) complex. Phosphoprotein formation was dependent on calcium, but not on magnesium. Essentially all the accumulated phosphoprotein could readily react with ADP. The apparent equilibrium constant of the phosphorylation reaction was close to 1, indicating that the change in free energy was very small. Phosphoprotein hydrolysis was measured by a procedure which made it possible to study the reaction in the absence of ATP and ADP. Under these conditions, the rate of phosphoprotein hydrolysis was increased by magnesium and decreased by calcium. While the content of sulfhydryls essential for ATPase activity was 1 mole per 105 g of protein, the yield of phosphoprotein was only 0.3 to 0.5 mole per 105 g of protein. It was concluded that there was only one essential sulfhydryl in the active site since inhibition of the enzyme action by N-ethylmaleimide was a first order reaction with respect to inhibitor concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1584415349,"Abstract It was previously found that the enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain increase in leg muscles of rats subjected to a program of running. The results of the present study provide evidence that mitochondrial coupling factor 1 (F1) is increased in proportion to the constituents of the respiratory chain in muscle that has adapted to endurance exercise. The oligomycin-sensitive adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of the mitochondrial fraction of muscle, after disruption of the mitochondria and unmasking of the latent ATPase activity, was used as a measure of F1. The concentration of cytochrome c was used as a marker for the respiratory chain. Both mitochondrial ATPase and cytochrome c increased 2-fold in gastrocnemius muscle in response to a running program, suggesting that a coordinated, quantitatively related increase in these components of the mitochondrial cristae occurs during the adaptation to exercise. In contrast, the levels of activity of mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase and adenylate kinase did not increase, providing evidence of a change in mitochondrial composition. Cytoplasmic creatine phosphokinase and adenylate kinase activities were also unchanged. These findings reinforce previous evidence indicating that endurance exercise results in an adaptive increase in the capacity of muscle to regenerate ATP aerobically, whereas the ability to form ATP by anaerobic mechanisms is unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W1604363911,"Abstract A simple procedure for purification of phosphofructokinase from rabbit erythrocytes was developed. The purified enzyme yields a single band on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. A schlieren pattern obtained from ultracentrifugation of the enzyme shows an asymmetrical peak and the major component has a sedimentation coefficient of 80 S. The results of sucrose density gradient centrifugation of fresh hemolysate show that the erythrocyte phosphofructokinase has a molecular weight of about 500,000. The molecular weight of dissociated enzyme in guanidine was determined to be approximately 53,000. Amino acid composition and a tryptic peptide map of erythrocyte phosphofructokinase are considerably different from those of skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase. Immunological reactivity of erythrocyte phosphofructokinase with antibody against muscle enzyme is less than that of muscle phosphofructokinase. Kinetic studies reveal that erythrocyte phosphofructokinase is inhibited by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and that this inhibition is released by inorganic phosphate but not by AMP or ADP. Possible physiological significance of these observations is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1603184703,"We have isolated mutants of Streptococcus faecalis whose growth is resistant to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). These mutants were isolated by direct selection without using a mutagenic agent. It was found that the adenosine triphosphatase in plasma membrane preparations from all the mutant strains was about 100-fold less sensitive to inhibition by DCCD than the enzyme in wild type membranes. In addition the energized uptake of K+ and cycloleucine which is inhibited by DCCD in the wild type organism became resistant to DCCD inhibition in the mutant strain SF-dcc-8. These findings provide genetic evidence for the view that energized uptake of K+ and cycloleucine is coupled to the activity of the membrane ATPase. Sensitivity to DCCD requires that the ATPase be attached to the membrane. To define the site of mutation we studied the DCCD sensitivity of hybrid ATPase-nectin-membrane complexes reconstituted in vitro from isolated wild type and mutant components. When the complex was reconstituted with mutant ATPase, mutant nectin, and wild type depleted membranes, the enzyme was normally sensitive to DCCD. However, when mutant membranes were used for reconstitution the attached ATPase was insensitive to DCCD. These results indicate that in the mutant there is no alteration in either the ATPase or in nectin, the protein required to attach the enzyme to the membrane. It was concluded that resistance of the membrane ATPase to DCCD was due to a defective carbodiimide-sensitizing factor, the membrane component that mediates DCCD inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1609152767,"Abstract The results of kinetic investigations with pure chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase from Escherichia coli K-12 were as follows: a pH optimum of 7.3 for the mutase activity, a Km of 0.045 mm for chorismate, and a Km of 1.0 mm for prephenate. l-Phenylalanine inhibited both the mutase and the dehydratase activities. In each case the relationship between activity and concentration of l-phenylalanine was sigmoidal and analysis of the results by the Hill equation gave values of n' = 2.3. d-Phenylalanine and l-tryptophan did not inhibit either activity whilst varying degrees of inhibition were observed with o-, m-, and p-monosubstituted fluoro-, chloro-, and hydroxyphenylalanines. Investigations with other phenylalanine analogues indicated that the α-NH2 group is not essential for inhibition, although it is required for maximal effect. There is an absolute requirement for an unmodified α-COOH group. Thiol compounds such as β-mercaptoethanol and dithioerythritol have little effect on the mutase activity but stimulate the dehydratase activity by approximately 150%."
https://openalex.org/W1570489146,"Electroplax microsomes enriched in sodium-potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase are found to catalyze sodium-stimulated, potassium-inhibited hydrolysis of UTP. The microsomes are phosphorylated by [γ-32P]UTP in a (Mg2+ + Na+)-stimulated reaction to yield an acid-stable phosphoprotein. Stimulation of the phosphorylation by Na+ in the presence of Mg2+ is paralleled by stimulation of UTP hydrolysis. K+ inhibits both the Na+-stimulated phosphorylation and hydrolysis in parallel at 0°. UTP and Na+ each partially antagonize the K+ inhibition. The phosphoprotein upon partial proteolysis yields labeled phosphopeptides which have the same electrophoretic mobilities as similarly obtained phosphopeptides after phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP. ATP inhibits the UTP phosphorylation and hydrolytic reactions, whereas UTP inhibits the Na+-stimulated and (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. However, the enzyme affinity for UTP is at least 1000 times less than for ATP. Ouabain abolishes the Na+-dependent UTP phosphorylation and hydrolysis, whereas 2,3-dimercaptopropanol-arsenite inhibits only the hydrolysis, which is similar to its action with ATP as substrate. It is concluded that the UTP phosphorylation site is identical with that reactive with ATP and that the same phosphopeptide is involved in the Na+-stimulated hydrolysis of UTP or ATP and the (Na+ + K+)-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP. K+ inhibition of UTP hydrolysis results from inhibition of phosphorylation. Thus, K+ can have at least two separate effects on the enzyme: inhibition of phosphorylation, in addition to the well known activation of dephosphorylation in the presence of ATP. Both of these effects can be explained by a model in which it is assumed that potassium-enzyme has a reduced affinity for nucleotides and Na+. These, on the other hand, reduce the affinity of dephosphoenzyme for K+. In this view, ATP, by virtue of its greater affinity than UTP for the enzyme, is able to reduce the K+ inhibition of phosphorylation, thus permitting the subsequent K+ activation of enzyme dephosphorylation to follow in cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1483507325,"The NH2-terminal amino acid residues of the plasmin derivatives of human fibrinogen (Fragments X, Y, D, and E) were determined and compared with those of undigested fibrinogen. Fibrinogen and Fragments X (mol wt 260,000) and Y (mol wt 155,000) had primarily alanine and tyrosine NH2-terminal residues. Fragment E (mol wt 50,000) also had alanine and tyrosine and in addition contained smaller amounts of glycine and valine residues. Fragment D (mol wt 85,000) had a clearly different complement of NH2-terminal residues, aspartic acid, methionine and valine, and probably derives from the COOH-terminal part of the parent fibrinogen molecule. That the NH2-terminal region of the fibrinogen molecule is present in Fragments X, Y, and E was confirmed by direct comparison of Fragments D and E with the NH2-terminal disulfide knot (mol wt 57,000), a chemical derivative of fibrinogen that contains the NH2-terminal region of fibrinogen, including fibrinopeptides A and B. Fragment E showed striking similarity of NH2-terminal amino acid residues, cysteine content, and antigenic determinants with the NH2-terminal disulfide knot. Thus, a derivative formed by proteolytic degradation of fibrinogen, Fragment E, has been shown to be virtually identical with a derivative formed by chemical degradation, the NH2-terminal disulfide knot. These data are consistent with the hypothesis of asymmetrical proteolysis of fibrinogen by plasmin, retaining the NH2-terminal region of the fibrinogen molecule relatively intact in Fragments X, Y, and E."

https://openalex.org/W1607845566,1. Spectrophotometric titration of the tyrosyl residues of coupling factor 1 from spinach chloroplasts with NaOH revealed that approximately one-half of the total tyrosyl groups are located on the surface of the molecules and are readily accessible to the aqueous medium. About onequarter of the tyrosyl residues appear to be located in the intersubunit regions and the remaining quarter of the tyrosyl residues are buried in the hydrophobic region of the subunits. 2. Cold inactivation of coupling factor 1 at mild acid pH in the presence of neutral salts resulted in the dissociation of the protein into subunits. Restoration of over 60% of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase and of the coupling factor activity was achieved at 25° provided ATP and 25% glycerol were present. 3. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis of coupling factor 1 under various dissociating conditions indicated the existence of at least two antigenically distinct subunits and the presence of three species of dissociated products with nonidentical electrophoretic mobilities. A specific antibody directed against the native enzyme and not reactive with the subunits was also present in the sera of rabbits after immunization with coupling factor 1.
https://openalex.org/W1561210680,"Fibrinogen has been isolated from human blood platelets by stepwise precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by gel filtration through Sephadex G-150 and chromatography through diethylaminoethyl-cellulose. The isolated protein was homogeneous on disc gel and had electrophoretic properties similar to plasma fibrinogen. In immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, platelet fibrinogen produced a single precipitin line with antiplatelet serum or antifibrinogen serum which was identical with that of plasma fibrinogen. The protein band in disc electrophoresis or the precipitin line in immunoelectrophoresis could not be detected when platelet fibrinogen was treated with thrombin. These properties of platelet fibrinogen were similar to those of plasma fibrinogen. The sedimentation coefficient and intrinsic viscosity of platelet fibrinogen were lower, indicating a lower molecular weight of platelet fibrinogen compared to plasma fibrinogen. Starch gel electrophoresis of plasmin digest of platelet fibrinogen showed a smaller number of bands, the distribution also being different from that of plasma fibrinogen digest. The rate of reaction as well as the extent of polymerization of platelet fibrinogen with thrombin was significantly lower than that of plasma fibrinogen. Results of disc electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol confirmed a lower molecular weight of platelet fibrinogen. It has been concluded that platelet fibrinogen, although sharing some properties of plasma fibrinogen, is structurally different and a smaller molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1621655093,"Substituent constants and regression analysis have been employed in a study of the structure-activity relationship of binding and inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase with small molecules. Using this technique, it is possible to separate the hydrophobic, electronic, and steric roles of substituents in the interaction of the small molecules with the enzyme. It is shown that electron-withdrawing substituents decrease interaction of amides and alcohols. Substituents on the α carbon atom of amides and acids do not show a steric effect. From these two facts it is concluded that the carbonyl function attaches to the enzyme via the oxygen atom rather than the carbon atom. The dependence of interaction on the hydrophobic character of the substituents is found to be similar to that of many other sets of congeners acting on simple proteins and enzymes. Although there is some evidence that interaction is related parabolically to lipophilic character of the organic compounds, insufficient results are in hand to define sharply the relationship. The results of this study show that data from different laboratories using different types of compounds can be quantitatively compared and from such comparisons a self-consistent picture emerges."
https://openalex.org/W2058883316,"The role of sodium in intestinal calcium transport was investigated in everted rat intestine. Ethacrynic acid, but not ouabain, inhibited calcium transport. However, ouabain did inhibit net water transport and, therefore, sodium transport, establishing the dissociation of the two transport processes. In addition to a magnesium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (activated by sodium and potassium), a phosphatase dependent on sodium and calcium was localized to the lateral and basal membrane fractions of the mucosal cell. Activity of the latter phosphatase, similar to calcium transport in intact tissue, was inhibited by ethacrynic acid and not by ouabain. Sodium, therefore, may participate in the calcium transport process by activating an enzyme complex, dependent on adenosine triphosphate, that mediates calcium transport."
https://openalex.org/W2075128211,"With inhibitors of DNA synthesis used in the presence of ethidium bromide, it has been possible to distinguish between synthesis of informational DNA (I-DNA) and that of nuclear DNA. Hydroxyurea depresses I-DNA synthesis preferentially but does not affect DNA transport between cell compartments. 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine and cytosine arabinoside reduce synthesis of I-DNA to a much lesser degree than that of nuclear DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1484040049,"Abstract A particulate enzyme system from Bacillus megaterium QMB1551 is described which catalyzes the utilization of the uridine nucleotides, UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-Ala-d-Glumeso-Dap-d-Ala-d-Ala and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, for peptidoglycan synthesis. Unlike systems previously studied in gram-positive microorganisms, this particulate enzyme preparation catalyzed the terminal cross-linking reaction in cell wall biosynthesis. This system could also incorporate free diaminopimelic acid dependent on the formation of peptidoglycan polymer from the uridine nucleotide substrates but independent of ATP. Furthermore, the incorporation of diaminopimelic acid was inhibited by penicillins, and the diaminopimelic acid appeared to be incorporated onto a terminal position of the peptide of a disaccharide-pentapeptide peptidoglycan unit with the release of alanine. The disaccharide-peptide products formed during the incorporation of free diaminopimelic acid were isolated from peptidoglycan and analyzed. A reaction sequence for incorporation of free diaminopimelic acid into peptidoglycan is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1521300615,"Abstract Rabbit antiserum to cardiolipin, which is reactive with the polar head but not the nonpolar fatty acid moieties of cardiolipin, was used to explore the location of the polar head of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membranes. Only a few per cent of the cardiolipin in intact mitochondria from rat liver, blowfly flight muscle, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Neurospora and none of the cardiolipin in intact beef heart mitochondria is available for binding of anticardiolipin antibody. Freezing and thawing, aging at 45°, or sonication, in the absence or presence of the antibody, increased only slightly the anticardiolipin antibody binding activity of various types of mitochondria. The only mitochondrial preparation showing complete ability to bind anticardiolipin antibody was a mitochondrial precursor fraction isolated from glucose-repressed, anaerobic yeast cells. The isolated outer and inner membrane fractions from rat liver mitochondria also showed very little capacity to bind the antibody; both the cytoplasmic side and the matrix side of the inner membrane, which contains most of the cardiolipin showed little antibody binding activity. Removal of the F1 ATPase molecules from inner membrane vesicles of beef heart mitochondria also failed to unmask antibody binding activity. Neither oxidative phosphorylation nor energy-linked Ca++ transport in intact rat liver mitochondria were influenced by addition of excess anticardiolipin antibody. It is concluded that the polar heads of most of the cardiolipin molecules in the mitochondrial membranes are buried within the structure of the membrane or shielded by the binding of other membrane components."

This inhibition was reversed by an increased calcium concentration. It is possible that inhibition of (Na+,K+)-activated adenosine triphosphatase) by DDT causes this species to lose the ability to lerate sodium chloride."
https://openalex.org/W1605911034,"Abstract A mucopolysaccharide sulfotransferase utilizing 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (sulfate donor) and endogenous proteinpolysaccharides (sulfate acceptor) was characterized from squid cartilage. This enzyme had the unique property of catalyzing the introduction of sulfate into position 6 of an acetylgalactosamine moiety already bearing a sulfate residue at position 4. The sulfotransferase was separated from endogenous proteinpolysaccharides and purified some 9-fold on DEAE-Sephadex A-50. The enzyme thus purified was effective only when exogenous acceptors were added. Although various mono-, di-, and polysaccharides were active as sulfate acceptors, the presence of a sulfate at position 4 of their acetylgalactosamine residue was essential for the acceptor activity. These observations suggest that an interpretation of the known change in type of chondroitin sulfates with phylogenic and ontogenic development must take into consideration the development of a specific family of sulfotransferases with respect to the site of sulfation."
https://openalex.org/W1561503408,"Abstract Pure phosphofructokinase from rabbit skeletal muscle is shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of fructose-1-P. The rate of fructose-1-P phosphorylation is about one-twentieth that of fructose-6-P phosphorylation at optimum conditions. The product of fructose-1-P phosphorylation was shown to be fructose 1,6-diphosphate by a number of criteria. The stoichiometry of the reaction with fructose 1-phosphate was demonstrated to be as shown by Equation 1. The following lines of evidence strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of fructose-1-P is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase. (a) The ratio of fructose-6-P kinase and fructose-1-P kinase activities remains constant during purification, upon DEAE-chromatography and molecular sieve filtration. (b) Rates of inactivation by heating, trypsin digestion, and treatment with pyridoxal-P, maleic anhydride, and succinic anhydride are identical for both activities. (c) Fructose-1-P is a competitive inhibitor of fructose-6-P. (d) The pH activity profiles for both phosphorylation reactions are similar. The enzyme exhibits a normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with fructose-1-P, but shows positive cooperativity with fructose-6-P as the substrate under the identical conditions. ATP at high concentrations inhibits both kinase activities. Initial rate and product inhibition studies were carried out for the fructose-1-P kinase reaction. The Lineweaver-Burk plots for MgATP at several fixed concentrations of fructose1-P show intersecting lines. MgADP is a competitive inhibitor of MgATP but is noncompetitive with fructose-1-P. Fructose-1,6-diP is a noncompetitive inhibitor of MgATP and fructose-1-P. These results suggest that the kinetic mechanism for the fructose-1-P kinase reaction is sequential."
https://openalex.org/W1605762767,"Abstract Cell-free extracts of the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardi, catalyze the incorporation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA into long chain fatty acids. The fatty acid synthetase is dependent on added acyl carrier protein for activity, regardless if the cells are grown in the light or in the dark. The major products formed from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by cells in the light period of synchronous growth are palmitate, stearate, and arachidate, whereas in the dark period of synchronous growth more short fatty acids are formed. Rifampicin has no effect on the appearance of the fatty acid synthetase in synchronous cultures of C. reinhardi, thus suggesting that transcriptional steps necessary for formation of fatty acid synthetase occur in the nucleus. Cycloheximide has no effect on the activity of fatty acid synthetase in the synchronous cultures, whereas spectinomycin reduced the activity significantly. These findings strongly indicate that the chloroplast ribosomes are responsible for the de novo protein synthesis required for fatty acid synthetase in C. reinhardi."
https://openalex.org/W1650319744,"Abstract Spontaneous degradation of IgD into Fc and Fab fragments frequently occurs during purification and storage. Because proteolysis is the likely mechanism for cleavage of IgD under these conditions, the susceptibility of IgD and other immunoglobulins to digestion with trypsin, plasmin, and papain was analyzed. IgD was much more susceptible to proteolysis than the other immunoglobulins studied. The fast fragments, Fc, obtained after spontaneous degradation and after proteolysis were immunologically identical and this was also true of the slow fragments, Fab. The sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii of the intact protein and fragments were determined and the frictional coefficient ratios and molecular weights calculated. Both the intact IgD and the Fc fragment appear to be less compact than other intact immunoglobulins or the Fc fragment of IgG. We propose that this apparent difference in conformation may account in part for the increased susceptibility of IgD to proteolysis. Finally, attention is drawn to the potential contamination of IgD preparations with the fifth component of complement (C5)."
https://openalex.org/W1492848335,"Abstract The incorporation of l-[4,5-3H]leucine into slices of rat cerebral cortex has been measured, with emphasis on the time course of the distribution of label in subcellular fractions prepared by zonal isopycnic centrifugation in continuous sucrose gradients. Rapidly labeled proteins are found in both the soluble and membranous components of the nerve end particles. Except for a minor part of the mitochondrial protein, the synthesis of all membrane-bound proteins is inhibited drastically by cycloheximide. When synthesis is blocked by cycloheximide, the supply of label continues for some minutes to certain membrane fractions derived from synaptic structures, apparently by a rapid transport of newly synthesized proteins from cytoplasmic ribosomes in the neuronal perikaryon. An increased extracellular concentration of potassium ion inhibits and ouabain accelerates protein synthesis in some fractions. These effects suggest a coupling of the protein synthesizing system with the (Na+ + K+)-activated ouabain-sensitive adenosine triphosphatase in the plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1569729367,"Abstract The synthesis of the glucuronic acid residue, which in several glycosaminoglycans occurs as a link between a serine-bound neutral trisaccharide and the polysaccharide chain proper, has been investigated in heparin-producing mastocytoma tissue. A membrane-bound enzyme was detected which catalyzed the transfer of glucuronic acid from uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid to 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-galactose, a structural unit occurring in the neutral trisaccharide. A partial separation of this glucuronosyltransferase from an enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of β-d-glucuronidic bonds to N-acetylglucosamine residues was achieved by treatment of the microsomal particles with ammonium hydroxide in the presence of detergent. This procedure brought 67% of the latter enzyme into solution, whereas only 18% of the total UDP-glucuronic acid-3-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-galactose glucuronosyltransferase activity was recovered in soluble form after ultracentrifugation. Subsequent gel chromatography of the soluble enzyme fraction afforded a 330-fold purification of the latter glucuronosyltransferase. In conjunction with earlier studies, the results of the present investigation permit the formulation of a complete mechanism for the biosynthesis of the heparin-polypeptide linkage region."

https://openalex.org/W1526445651,Abstract The ATP-dependent DNase of Hemophilus influenzae Rd acts as a DNA-dependent ATPase which splits ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of magnesium ions and DNA. The apparent Km for ATP in the ATPase reaction is 0.18 mm. Approximately 40 ATP molecules are utilized for each DNA phosphodiester bond cleaved. All of the common ribose and deoxyribose nucleoside 5'-triphosphates can replace ATP in the DNase reaction with varying degrees of effectiveness ranging from 40 to 90%.
https://openalex.org/W1524574498,"Abstract The effects of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, 5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, and 3-N-methyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, a new analog of thymidine, on the ultraviolet (UV) inactivation of thymidine kinase have been investigated. Of these compounds only 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and 3-N-methyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine enhance the rate of inactivation of the enzyme by UV light. The other halogenated analogs neither protect nor sensitize thymidine kinase to UV inactivation. Whereas the inactivation of thymidine kinase by UV light in the presence of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine can be prevented by the substrate, thymidine (Cysyk, R., and Prusoff, W. H. (1969) Fed. Proc., 28, 473; Cysyk, R. (1970) Ph.D. thesis, Yale University), that produced by 3-N-methyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine is not prevented by thymidine alone but requires the presence of both substrates, thymidine and MgATP. Kinetic studies with thymidine kinase show 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to thymidine; however, 3-N-methyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine shows uncompetitive inhibition with thymidine and competitive inhibition with MgATP. The allosteric regulators, dCDP, an activator, and dTTP, an inhibitor, protect the enzyme against UV irradiation and decrease the rate of inactivation caused by 3-N-methyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. The primary photostable compound formed during photolysis of 3-N-methyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine appears to be 3-N-methyl deoxyuridine, which is analogous to the formation of deoxyuridine during photolysis of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (Cysyk, R. (1970) Ph.D. thesis, Yale University)."
https://openalex.org/W1524758467,"Abstract Studies of the binding of N-methyl nicotinamide chloride by α-lactalbumin show that complex formation occurs with 1 of 4 tryptophan residues at pH 6 whereas two form complexes at pH 2 as a result of acid denaturation. Alkaline denaturation likewise leads to an increase in exposure of tryptophans, and three of the four groups form complexes at pH 11. From a consideration of previous studies and a recently proposed molecular model for α-lactalbumin, the residues involved in binding N-methyl nicotinamide chloride have been tentatively identified as tryptophan-118, tryptophan-104, and tryptophan-60."
https://openalex.org/W1549543125,"Abstract The rate of hydrogen ion liberation during the hydrolysis of ATP by Subfragment I was followed in a stopped flow spectrophotometer. At pH 8, 20°, and in the presence of MgCl2 the initial rate of hydrogen ion liberation was greater than the steady state rate and the approach to a steady state rate could be described by a single exponential term. The rate constant characterizing the exponential term increased with MgATP concentration from 0.01 to 0.1 mm above which an average limiting value of 128 s-1 was reached. It was confirmed that two exponential terms are required to describe the course of the reaction for myosin. These results can be interpreted as indicating interaction between the two ATPase sites on intact myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1494578976,Abstract The rate of 5' to 3' exonucleolytic degradation by the Micrococcus luteus DNA polymerase is stimulated by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. A single deoxynucleoside triphosphate can stimulate 6-fold the rate of degradation of an alternating sequence DNA polymer. It is neither necessary nor sufficient that the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate be complementary to the bases of the DNA polymer in order to stimulate the rate of exonucleolytic degradation of that polymer. The deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate is not chemically altered due to its role as a stimulator.
https://openalex.org/W1553646168,"Abstract The ATPase of glycerinated sperm flagella from the sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) catalyzes the preferential exchange of water oxygens into the phosphate originating from ATP. This type of exchange, so far known only for myosin-related ATPases, occurred under conditions (60 mm Mg2+, 1 to 10 mm Ca2+) in which no inorganic phosphate-water exchange or exchange into unhydrolyzed ATP was observed. These results suggest that similar intermediates are formed by both skeletal myosin and flagellar ATPase during the cleavage of ATP, in spite of the known large differences in physical and enzymatic properties of the two contractile systems."
https://openalex.org/W1582915224,"Abstract The initiation of protein biosynthesis in the cytoplasmic system of Neurospora crassa has been investigated. Two major methionyl-tRNA species exist in the cytoplasm of Neurospora, only one of which (methionyl-tRNAf) is formylatable with Escherichia coli transformylase. In addition, methionyl-tRNAf has more affinity to bind on ribosomes in the presence of the AUG codon than methionyl-tRNAm. This methionyl-tRNAf appears to function for the initiation of protein biosynthesis by incorporating methionine at the amino-terminal end of proteins. In contrast, methionyl-tRNAm transfers methionine predominantly into the internal positions. This investigation provides evidence that protein biosynthesis in the cytoplasm of Neurospora is initiated by methionyl-tRNAf without prior formylation."
