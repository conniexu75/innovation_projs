https://openalex.org/W2000517171,"The vertebrate retinoid X receptor (RXR) has been implicated in the regulation of multiple hormonal signaling pathways through the formation of heteromeric receptor complexes that bind DNA with high affinity. We now demonstrate that ultraspiracle (usp), a Drosophila RXR homolog, can substitute for RXR in stimulating the DNA binding of receptors for retinoic acid, T3, vitamin D, and peroxisome proliferator activators. These observations led to the search and ultimate identification of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) as a Drosophila partner of usp. Together, usp and EcR bind DNA in a highly cooperative fashion. Cotransfection of both EcR and usp expression vectors is required to render cultured mammalian cells ecdysone responsive. These results implicate usp as an integral component of the functional EcR. By demonstrating that receptor heterodimer formation precedes the divergence of vertebrate and invertebrate lineages, these data underscore a central role for RXR and its homolog usp in the evolution and control of the nuclear receptor-based endocrine system."
https://openalex.org/W2009338295,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are 42- and 44-kD serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation in cells stimulated with mitogens and growth factors. MAP kinase and the protein kinase that activates it (MAP kinase kinase) were constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells infected with viruses containing either of two oncogenic forms (p35EC12, p3722W) of the c-Raf-1 protein kinase. The v-Raf proteins purified from cells infected with EC12 or 22W viruses activated MAP kinase kinase from skeletal muscle in vitro. Furthermore, a bacterially expressed v-Raf fusion protein (glutathione S-transferase-p3722W) also activated MAP kinase kinase in vitro. These findings suggest that one function of c-Raf-1 in mitogenic signaling is to phosphorylate and activate MAP kinase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2012761399,"Two cooperating retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABPII) gene mediate differential transcriptional transactivation by retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. RARE1 and RARE2 are direct repeats (DR) of two motifs separated by 2 bp (DR2) and 1 bp (DR1), respectively, and bind RAR-RXR heterodimers more efficiently than homodimers. Using all-trans and 9-cis RA, which differentially activate RARs and RXRs, and RAR and RXR dominant-negative mutants, RAR-RXR heterodimers bound to RARE1 and RARE2 are shown to be responsible for CRABPII promoter transactivation, arguing against a unique DR spacing specifying recognition by RARs. Within heterodimers, RAR and RXR independently and differentially transactivate, depending on the specific RARE. Consistent with these results, 9-cis RA increases CRABPII mRNA levels more efficiently than all-trans RA. In contrast, all-trans and 9-cis RA have identical effects on induction of RARÎ²2 transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1606588479,"The gene encoding a novel mouse somatostatin receptor termed mSSTR3 was isolated and characterized. The sequence of mSSTR3 shows 46 and 47% identity with mSSTR1 and mSSTR2, respectively. mSSTR3 binds somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 with high affinity, but shows very low affinity for the somatostatin analogs MK-678 and SMS-201-995. In addition, mSSTR3 is coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and mediates somatostatin inhibition of forskolin-stimulated and dopamine D1 receptor-stimulated cAMP formation, indicating that it is coupled to adenylylcyclase. The pharmacological properties of mSSTR3 and its ability to couple with adenylylcyclase distinguish SSTR3 from the other cloned somatostatin receptors and indicates that it mediates biological functions different from SSTR1 or SSTR2. In situ hybridization indicates that SSTR3 mRNA is widely distributed in the mouse brain, and its expression in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract and in the piriform cortex, the primary olfactory cortex in the rodent brain, suggests that SSTR3 may participate in the processing and modulation of primary sensory information."
https://openalex.org/W1490772051,"Thrombin both stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and inhibits adenylyl cyclase in a variety of cell types. Whether the cloned human platelet thrombin receptor accounts for both of these signaling events is unknown. We report that thrombin receptor agonist peptide causes both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in naturally thrombin-responsive CCL-39 cells. To exclude the possibility that the agonist peptide or thrombin itself may activate these pathways via distinct receptors and to circumvent a lack of suitable thrombin receptor-null cells, we utilized a designed receptor, a thrombin receptor with its thrombin cleavage recognition sequence LDPR replaced by DDDDK, the enterokinase cleavage recognition sequence. Transfection of enterokinase-unresponsive cells with this construct conferred both enterokinase-sensitive phosphoinositide hydrolysis and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The phosphoinositide hydrolysis response was largely insensitive to pertussis toxin, whereas the adenylyl cyclase response was completely blocked by pertussis toxin. These data show that the cloned thrombin receptor can effect both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via at least two distinct effectors, most likely Gq-like and Gi-like G-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1542412714,"In order to determine the effect of calcium mobilization on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, we have treated human foreskin fibroblasts (HSWP cells) and human epidermal carcinoma (A431) cells with thapsigargin. Intracellular free calcium was monitored by single cell image analysis using fura-2 and correlated with MAP kinase stimulation as assessed by immunoprecipitation, kinase renaturation assays and immunoblotting. Thapsigargin stimulated the 44- and 42-kDa MAP kinase isozymes in both cell types with kinetics that were slightly delayed relative to enzyme stimulated by epidermal growth factor. Removal of external calcium did not significantly affect the activation of the MAP kinases by thapsigargin, indicating that intracellular calcium mobilization is sufficient to stimulate the enzymes. However, treatment of cells with EGTA under conditions which deplete both intra- and extracellular calcium inhibited stimulation by thapsigargin but not epidermal growth factor. Stimulation of the MAP kinases by the calcium ionophore ionomycin paralleled the activation observed with thapsigargin in both calcium-containing and calcium-free conditions. These results indicate that there are at least two independent pathways for stimulation of MAP kinase: one that is dependent on intracellular calcium mobilization, and one that is mediated by the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor and is calcium-independent."
https://openalex.org/W1586407696,"The primary structure of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor was determined by sequencing a functional receptor cDNA isolated by expression cloning from an immortalized murine gonadotroph (alpha T3) cell line. Positive clone pools from a cDNA library were detected by screening expressed RNA in aequorin-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes, in which receptor-mediated calcium responses were monitored as light emission during stimulation by GnRH. The isolated receptor cDNA encodes a 327-amino acid protein that has seven putative transmembrane regions and is unique among G protein-coupled receptors in that the predicted sequence lacks a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. COS-7 cells transfected with the receptor cDNA expressed high affinity binding sites for GnRH and its agonist and antagonist analogs and exhibited calcium responses to GnRH stimulation. These, and the prominent calcium responses of Xenopus oocytes injected with receptor RNA, were inhibited by GnRH antagonists. Northern blot analysis revealed two mRNAs (1.6 and 3.5 kilobases) in alpha T3 cells and in the mouse pituitary gland, and both transcripts were shown to encode functional GnRH receptors when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, a single 4.6-kilobase receptor mRNA was present in rat anterior pituitary gland, ovary, and Leydig cells. The absence of a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain indicates the importance of other regions of the GnRH receptor in agonist-induced signal transduction, and possibly in receptor desensitization and sequestration."
https://openalex.org/W1561043766,"We have recently demonstrated that fibroblast-conditioned medium induces Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells to form branching tubules when grown in three-dimensional collagen or fibrin gels (Montesano, R., Schaller, G., and Orci, L. (1991) Cell 66, 697-711), and that this morphogenetic effect is mediated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (Montesano, R., Matsumoto, K., Nakamura, T., and Orci, L. (1991) Cell 67, 901-908). In fibrin gels, this effect is inhibited by addition of exogenous serine protease inhibitors, which suggests a role for plasminogen activators (PAs) in the matrix remodeling required for tubulogenesis. In the studies reported in this paper, we have investigated the effect of fibroblast-conditioned medium (CM) and HGF on the production of PAs by MDCK cells. We have found that urokinase-type PA (u-PA) activity and mRNA are increased 4.9-fold by CM from human MRC-5 fibroblasts, which has tubulogenic activity, but not by CM from human Detroit-550 fibroblasts, which lacks tubulogenic activity. The u-PA inductive property of MRC-5 CM was completely inhibited by preincubation with antibodies to recombinant human HGF (rhHGF). Exogenously added rhHGF also increased u-PA activity and mRNA 5.9-fold in MDCK cells, with an optimal effect at approximately 10 ng/ml. MRC-5 CM also increased u-PA receptor mRNA 34.9-fold in MDCK cells, an effect which was inhibited by 71% by preincubating the CM with antibodies to rhHGF, and which was mimicked by exogenously added rhHGF (31.3-fold increase). These results demonstrate that HGF, which induces tubulogenesis by MDCK cells in vitro, also increases u-PA and u-PA receptor expression in these cells. Taken together with our previous observations, this suggests that the resulting increase in extracellular proteolysis, appropriately localized to the cell surface, is required for epithelial morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1508371220,"Several studies have shown that the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) receptor protein levels increase in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3. We have studied the mechanism of this regulation in both mouse fibroblasts and rat intestinal epithelial cells. Cell extracts and total RNA were prepared at varying times after addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein levels, measured using an immunoradiometric assay, rose significantly 2-3 h posttreatment and had risen 3-fold at 8 h. Concurrently, the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor mRNA content, measured using a ribonuclease protection assay, was not altered by 1,25-(OH)2D3 during this time. In cycloheximide-blocked cells, the administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 markedly reduced the degradation rate of previously formed receptor. The 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein half-life was determined as 4 h in the absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and increased to at least 8 h in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. We also measured the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor mRNA levels in the duodena and kidney of vitamin D-deficient rats after a single 150-pmol injection of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Again, we found that 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor mRNA levels were not changed in these tissues after 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Therefore, the elevation of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor protein following 1,25-(OH)2D3 administration is apparently the result of increased receptor protein lifetime and not increased transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1505921511,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain held by a disulfide bond. These chains are produced by endoproteolytic processing from a single chain precursor. In this study, we examined whether the processing is a prerequisite for the mitogenic activity of HGF on hepatocytes in primary culture. Single chain HGF was proteolytically converted to the heterodimeric form during incubation with hepatocytes and was as mitogenic as the heterodimeric form. When the conversion was inhibited by serine-protease inhibitors, the mitogenic activity of single chain HGF was markedly reduced. Furthermore, a mutant resistant to the proteolytic processing, which was prepared by in vitro mutagenesis, completely lost the mitogenic activity. From these results, we concluded that the single chain form of HGF is endoproteolytically processed by a serine-protease and that this processing is a prerequisite for the mitogenic activity of HGF."
https://openalex.org/W2059917807,"Hypothalamic injury causes female sexual precocity by activating luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons, which control sexual development. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) has been implicated in this process, but its involvement in normal sexual maturation is unknown. The present study addresses this issue. TGF-alpha mRNA and protein were found mostly in astroglia, in regions of the hypothalamus concerned with LHRH control. Hypothalamic TGF-alpha mRNA levels increased at times when secretion of pituitary gonadotropins--an LHRH-dependent event--was elevated, particularly at the time of puberty. Gonadal steroids involved in the control of LHRH secretion increased TGF-alpha mRNA levels. Blockade of TGF-alpha action in the median eminence, a site of glial-LHRH nerve terminal association, delayed puberty. These results suggest that TGF-alpha of glial origin is a component of the developmental program by which the brain controls mammalian sexual maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1510103500,"Each polypeptide chain of protein R2, the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, contains a stable tyrosyl radical and two antiferromagnetically coupled oxo-bridged ferric ions. A refined structure of R2 has been recently obtained. R2 can be converted into apoR2 by chelating out the metal cofactor and scavenging the radical. This study shows that apoR2 has a very strong affinity for four stable Mn2+ ions. The manganese-containing form of R2, named Mn-R2, has been studied by EPR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. It contains two binuclear manganese clusters in which the two manganese ions occupy the natural iron-binding sites and are only bridged by carboxylates from glutamates 115 and 238. This in turn explains why the spin-exchange interaction between the two ions is very weak and why Mn-R2 is EPR active. Mn-R2 could provide a model for the native diferrous form of protein R2, and a detailed molecular mechanism for the reduction of the iron center of protein R2 is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1602389953,"Rac1 and Rac2 gene products are small GTP-binding proteins showing 92% homology to each other. According to recent studies performed in cell-free systems, Rac1 and Rac2 proteins may be involved in the activation of NADPH-oxidase, the superoxide-generating enzymatic complex active in phagocytes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed B lymphocytes, which express rac1 and rac2 genes, also efficiently release superoxide anions when triggered by various cell surface stimuli. To investigate the regulatory role of Rac proteins in living cells, we analyzed superoxide production in response to cross-linking of surface immunoglobulins or phorbol ester treatment in human EBV-transformed B lymphocytes pretreated with Rac sense and antisense oligonucleotides. We report here that (i) the rac protein content estimated by immunoblotting can be decreased by 60% in Rac antisense pretreated cells and (ii) a strong (50-60%), dose-dependent inhibition of superoxide production is observed in antisense pretreated cells whereas cells pretreated with sense oligonucleotide are unaffected. The data presented show, for the first time in whole cells, that superoxide production is modulated by the Rac protein content, thus demonstrating the physiological role of Rac proteins in the regulation of NADPH-oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1558182564,"To find mammalian analogues of exendin-4, a peptide from Helodermatidae venoms that interacts with newly discovered exendin receptors on dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas, we examined the actions of recent additions to the vasoactive intestinal peptide/secretin/glucagon family of regulatory peptides. In every respect tested, the truncated form of glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1(7-36)NH2, mimicked the actions of exendin-4. Like exendin-4, GLP-1(7-36)NH2 caused an increase in acinar cAMP without stimulating amylase release. GLP-1(7-36)NH2-induced increases in cAMP were inhibited progressively by increasing concentrations of the specific exendin-receptor antagonist, exendin(9-39)NH2. In dispersed acini from guinea pig and rat pancreas, concentrations of GLP-1(7-36)NH2 that stimulated increases in cAMP caused potentiation of cholecystokinin-induced amylase release. Binding of 125I-[Y39]exendin-4 or 125I-GLP-1(7-36)NH2 to dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas was inhibited by adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled exendin-4 or GLP-1(7-36)NH2. We conclude that the mammalian peptide GLP-1(7-36)NH2 interacts with exendin receptors on dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas. Exendin(9-39)NH2, a competitive antagonist of the actions of GLP-1(7-36)NH2 in pancreatic acini, may be a useful tool for examining the physiological actions of this peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1575879166,"The 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III from spinach was purified to homogeneity by an eight-step procedure that included an ACP-affinity column. The size of the native enzyme was M(r) = 63,000 based on gel filtration, and its subunit size was M(r) = 40,500 based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III may be a homodimer. The purified enzyme was highly specific for acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP. The Km for acetyl-CoA was 5 microM when assayed in the presence of 10 microM malonyl-CoA. Acetyl-, butyryl-, and hexanoyl-ACP would not substitute for acetyl-CoA as substrates. The specificity for acetyl-CoA suggested that the physiological function of 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase is to catalyze the initial condensation reaction in fatty acid biosynthesis. The homogeneous 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase was capable of catalyzing acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylation but at a rate about 90-fold slower than the condensation reaction with malonyl-ACP. The 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase was inhibited 100% by 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide or 20 mM sodium arsenite."
https://openalex.org/W1959325762,"Full-length human LINE-1 retrotransposons encode p40 proteins with varying electrophoretic mobilities under denaturing conditions. The p40 expressed from the first open reading frame in the LINE-1 copy designated L1.2A co-electrophoreses with the endogenous p40 in human teratocarcinoma cells. This finding is consistent with previous data indicating that L1.2A is an active element. The amino acid sequence in the central region of the L1.2A p40 accounts, at least in part, for its characteristic mobility. This region includes sequences which can, in principle, form a leucine zipper."
https://openalex.org/W1591062957,"Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, also inhibits phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, the enzyme that converts phosphatidic acid into diacylglycerol. This latter effect has prompted recent use of propranolol in studies examining the importance of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid in cellular signalling events. Here, we show that propranolol is also an inhibitor of protein kinase C. At concentrations greater than or equal to 20 microM, propranolol reduced [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding (IC50 = 200 microM) and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated superoxide anion release (IC50 = 130 microM) in human neutrophils. Scatchard analysis showed that propranolol lowers the number of phorbol diester binding sites without significantly affecting their affinity. In vitro kinetic analysis, performed in a mixed micellar assay with protein kinase C purified from human neutrophils, suggested a competitive inhibition of propranolol with the cofactor phosphatidylserine. Complex kinetic patterns were observed with respect to diacylglycerol and ATP, approximating competitive and noncompetitive inhibition, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that the drug interacts at the level of the regulatory domain of the enzyme. Fifty % inhibition occurred at approximately 150 microM propranolol. Similar levels of inhibition were obtained using exogenous (histone) and endogenous (p47-phox, a NADPH oxidase component) substrates. Protein kinase C-alpha and protein kinase C-beta, two protein kinase C isozymes present in human neutrophils, were inhibited by propranolol in a comparable manner. In the range of concentrations tested (30-1000 microM), neither cAMP-dependent protein kinase nor neutrophil protein tyrosine kinases were affected. The racemic form of propranolol and the (+) and the (-) stereoisomers were equally active, and other beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (pindolol) and agonists (isoproterenol) were inactive. This suggests that the inhibitory action of propranolol on protein kinase C is related to the amphipathic nature of the drug rather than to its beta-adrenergic receptor blocking ability. Analogs of propranolol were synthesized and found to be more potent protein kinase C inhibitors, with IC50 values in the 10-20 microM range. We conclude that the ability of propranolol to inhibit both protein kinase C and PA phosphohydrolase complicates interpretation of results when this drug is used in signal transduction studies. In addition, propranolol may be a useful prototype for the synthesis of new protein kinase C inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1583715205,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is a serine/threonine kinase whose function is thought to be essential for the transduction of mitogenic signals. MAP kinase is activated by phosphorylation induced by a variety of extracellular stimuli, and its direct upstream activator has been identified. Using amphibian and mammalian systems, we show here that ras can activate MAP kinase and its activator. Injection of v-Ha-ras p21 into Xenopus immature oocytes activated both MAP kinase and maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activities. The activation of MAP kinase preceded that of MPF, demonstrating that ras activates MAP kinase in an MPF-independent pathway. Moreover, we found that the MAP kinase activator is also activated in ras-injected oocytes. Activation of MAP kinase and its activator occurred also when the v-Ki-ras gene was conditionally induced in rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells. Furthermore, we observed that ras activated MAP kinase and its activator in a cell-free system prepared from Xenopus oocytes. Using an antibody against the Xenopus 45-kDa MAP kinase activator, we demonstrated that the 45-kDa activator molecule was activated by ras. These findings suggest that the MAP kinase activator/MAP kinase system may be the downstream components of ras signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1903324181,"Using a strategy based on amino acid sequence homology between 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors that interact with G proteins, we have isolated from a mouse brain library a cDNA encoding a new serotonin receptor, the 5HT1E beta receptor. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that its closest relatives were the recently characterized 5HT1E receptor (S31) and the 5HT1B and 5HT1D receptors. When expressed transiently in Cos-7 cells, the 5HT1E beta receptor displayed a high affinity for the nonspecific serotonergic radioligand 2-[125I]iodolysergic acid diethylamide (Kd = 980 pM). The pharmacological profile of the 5HT1E beta receptor resembled that of previously reported 5HT1E sites that have a low affinity for 5-carboxamidotryptamine and that have been found in human and rat brain. When stably expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, the 5HT1E beta receptor was negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that the 5HT1E beta transcripts were detected only in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 layers of the hippocampus. Our results therefore demonstrate that the 5HT1E receptors constitute a heterogeneous family of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1550073363,"A methionine aminopeptidase that specifically removes methionine residues from peptides with amino-terminal sequences of Met-Ala-, Met-Val-, Met-Ser-, Met-Gly-, and Met-Pro- but not Met-Leu- or Met-Lys- has been isolated to homogeneity from porcine liver by a procedure involving five chromatographic steps. The enzyme, whose specificity matches that predicted for the entity responsible for the co-translational amino-terminal processing of nascent polypeptide chains, has a measured molecular mass of 70,000 Da by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and 67,000 Da by gel chromatography (under nondenaturing conditions), suggesting the native molecule is a monomer. It is activated by Co2+ and inhibited by beta-mercaptoethanol and EDTA. With octapeptide substrates related to the amino-terminal portion of the beta-chain of human hemoglobin (with a histidine in position 3), the enzyme had a pH optimum of 6.0. With a synthetic peptide devoid of histidine, it showed no pH dependence from 6.0 to 8.0. This sensitivity may be due to the propensity of peptides with histidine in the third position to bind divalent cations such as Co2+. The measured Km and kappa cat values were affected by residues in the second position. The peptide corresponding to the natural sequence (Met-Val-His-) gave a kappa cat/Km value of 260 mM-1 s-1; substitution of alanine in the second position raised the kappa cat/Km to 1523 mM-1 s-1, but substitution of proline lowered the value to 130. The effects are primarily on the kappa cat. The substitution of proline (for histidine) in the third position, the mutation found in hemoglobin Long Island, prevents the removal of the methionine residue, as occurs with the mutant protein. The porcine liver enzyme is similar to methionine aminopeptidases isolated from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and yeast in that it also is stimulated by Co2+. However, it is much larger than these enzymes and differs somewhat in specificity, particularly with the yeast enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1538083688,"Insulin-induced differentiation of 3T3 L1 cells to adipocytes can be mimicked by the expression of transfected ras oncogenes but not of the tyrosine-kinase oncogenes src and trk. Expression of two different transfected, dominant inhibitory ras mutants resulted in significant inhibition of insulin-induced differentiation, suggesting that endogenous Ras proteins are mediators of insulin signaling in these cells. Exposure of untransfected 3T3 L1 cells to insulin resulted in significant formation of the active Ras.GTP complex, at levels comparable with those resulting from exposure to platelet-derived growth factor. However, whereas exposure of the same cells to platelet-derived growth factor resulted in significant tyrosine phosphorylation of the p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), insulin-treated cells did not show any detectable levels of de novo GAP tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, insulin caused tyrosine phosphorylation of the p62 polypeptide coprecipitated with GAP by anti-GAP antibodies. Insulin-induced activation of cytosolic MAP kinase activity in untransfected 3T3 L1 cells was also mimicked by Ras expression (in the absence of insulin) in the same cells transfected with an inducible ras construct. These results confirm that Ras proteins participate in insulin signaling pathways in these mammalian cells and indicate that activation of cytosolic MAP kinases is an early event occurring downstream from Ras activation. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP appears not to be a significant upstream regulatory event in the activation of Ras by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W319935163,"An expression plasmid encoding the human 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type 2 receptor (TNF-R2) was constructed and used to generate a stable human cell line (293/TNF-R2) overexpressing TNF-R2. Ligand binding analysis revealed high affinity binding (Kd = 0.2 nM) with approximately 94,000 +/- 7,500 sites/cell for 125I-TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for TNF-beta (Kd = 1.1 nM) with 264,000 +/- 2,000 sites/cell. Cross-linking of 125I-TNF-alpha and 125I-TNF-beta to 293/TNF-R2 cells yielded predominant complexes with apparent molecular weights of 211,000 for TNF-alpha and 205,000 and 244,000 for TNF-beta, suggesting these complexes contain two or three TNF-R2 molecules. Immunoprecipitation of TNF-R2 from 32P-labeled 293/TNF-R2 cells demonstrated that the receptor is phosphorylated. The majority (97%) of 32Pi incorporation was found in serine residues with a very low level of incorporation (3%) in threonine residues. TNF-alpha treatment of 293/TNF-R2 cells did not significantly affect the degree or pattern of phosphorylation. Cell surface-bound 125I-TNF-alpha was slowly internalized by the 293/TNF-R2 cell line with a t1/2 = 25 min. Shedding of the extracellular domain of TNF-R2 was induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by TNF-alpha or TNF-beta."
https://openalex.org/W1567103423,"Cytochrome c reductase purified from the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata retained antimycin A sensitivity and catalyzed the reduction of horse heart ferricytochrome c in the presence of reduced coenzyme Q10. The complex contained heme b and heme c1 in a ratio of 2:1. Nine major protein bands ranging in size from 55.3 to approximately 12.8 kDa were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A 31.6-kDa protein was identified as cytochrome c1 by the presence of a covalently attached heme. A red shift in the alpha-absorbance band of the cytochrome c1 absolute absorbance spectrum, difference absorbance spectrum, and pyridine ferrohemochrome absorbance spectrum suggested that the heme prosthetic group of C. fasciculata cytochrome c1 is bound to the apoprotein through only one thioether bond. A fragment of the cytochrome c1 gene was amplified from C. fasciculata, Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania tarentolae, and Bodo caudatus. The deduced heme binding site sequence of each of these kinetoplastid species, Phe-Ala-Pro-Cys-His, contains a phenylalanine rather that a cysteine at the first position so that only one thioether bond can be formed between heme and apoprotein. This phenylalanine substitution and the presence of a conserved proline in the sequence may represent compensatory changes that are necessary for optimal interaction of the cytochromes c1 with the atypical cytochromes c of these species."
https://openalex.org/W1540961844,"Unlike wild type, certain Mo-dependent nitrogenases, which are expressed in non-N2-fixing mutant strains of Azotobacter vinelandii and have single amino acid substitutions within a region of the MoFe protein alpha-subunit proposed to encompass an FeMo cofactor-binding domain, are able to catalyze the reduction of acetylene by both two and four electrons to yield ethylene and ethane, respectively (Scott, D. J., May, H. D., Newton, W. E., Brigle, K. E., and Dean, D. R. (1990) Nature 343, 188-190). Although the V-dependent nitrogenase is also able to catalyze the reduction of acetylene to the same two- and four-electron products (Dilworth, M. J., Eady, R. R., Robson, R. L., and Miller, R. W. (1987) Nature 327, 167-168), we find that ethane formation from acetylene catalyzed by the altered Mo-dependent nitrogenases occurs by a different mechanism, which is distinguished by: (i) an increased sensitivity to CO; (ii) the absence of a lag; and (iii) no temperature dependence of product distribution among ethylene and ethane during acetylene reduction. An altered MoFe protein, which was purified from one such mutant strain having the alpha-subunit glutaminyl 191 residue substituted by lysyl, exhibited both a changed S = 3/2 EPR spectrum and changes in the distribution of electrons to various products when compared to wild type. Also, unlike wild type, this altered MoFe protein catalyzed proton reduction that is inhibited by carbon monoxide (CO). Because proton reduction catalyzed by a nitrogenase that has a FeMo cofactor with citrate rather than homocitrate as its organic constituent (Liang, J., Madden, M., Shah, V. K., and Burris, R. H. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8577-8581) is also inhibited by CO, the possibility arose that changes in the polypeptide environment of FeMo cofactor might have caused a rearrangement in its molecular structure or composition. However, this possibility was ruled out by biochemical reconstitution studies (using FeMo cofactor isolated from both the wild-type and altered MoFe proteins), which were monitored by EPR spectroscopy and resulting catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1606458257,"The tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TK) was determined at varying poly-Glu6Ala3Tyr1 (GAT) or [Val5]-angiotensin II (AT) and constant ATP concentrations and vice versa. With GAT as substrate, double reciprocal plots intersected practically on the abscissa following EGFR-TK pre-activation with EGF, but below the abscissa without EGF pre-activation. The EGFR-TK inhibitors App(NH)p (5'-adenylyl-beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate) and ADP were competitive with ATP and noncompetitive with GAT. Four families of 1/v vs. 1/[ATP] plots, constructed at different fixed concentrations of ADP and a different constant concentration of GAT for each family, yielded Slope1/ATP replots which intersected to the left of the ordinate and below the abscissa. GAT and AT, as cosubstrates, were competitive with each other and noncompetitive with ATP; 1/v vs. 1/[GAT] or 1/[AT] plots were hyperbolic and reached horizontal asymptotes when v was expressed as the rate of common product formation. All data were subjected to computer best-fit analysis by a program written especially for this purpose. We conclude that (i) the EGFR-TK reaction follows a Sequential Bi-Bi Rapid Equilibrium Random mechanism, and (ii) EGF induces conformational changes in the EGFR-TK active center which lead to marked decreases in the apparent dissociation constants of both substrates of the kinase reaction and a concomitant increase in initial velocities and Vmax (apparent)."
https://openalex.org/W1499539705,"The respiratory burst oxidase is a multimeric enzyme responsible for O2- production by stimulated neutrophils and a few other cell types. In the resting neutrophil, the oxidase is dormant, and its subunits are distributed between the cytosol, in which they appear to exist in the form of a multisubunit complex, and the plasma membrane; but, when the neutrophil is activated, the cytosolic complex translocates to the membrane to assemble the active enzyme. Using a cell-free system in which oxidase activity was elicited with SDS, we examined the effects of GTP gamma S and dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8) on both the activation of O2- production and the transfer of the cytosolic oxidase components p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane. GTP (added as undialyzed cytosol) and GTP gamma S augmented the transfer of the oxidase components to the plasma membrane and was essential for the acquisition of O2- producing activity by the oxidase. DiC8 also supported the SDS-mediated transfer of oxidase components to the membrane, but O2- production did not take place unless GTP or GTP gamma S was present. In the presence of these nucleotides, however, DiC8 augmented both translocation and O2- production. We interpreted these results in terms of a mechanism in which 2 membrane-binding sites are created during the activation of the cytosolic complex, one for diacylglycerol and the other for a second site on the membrane. Development of the second membrane-binding site depends upon the action of a G protein and is essential for the expression of oxidase activity. The results further suggested that the priming of the respiratory burst oxidase in intact neutrophils might be due to an increase in membrane diacylglycerol concentration that occurs in response to the priming stimulus. Because of the increased diacylglycerol content, a larger than usual amount of active respiratory burst oxidase could be assembled on the primed plasma membrane when the neutrophil is fully activated."
https://openalex.org/W1579284307,"An insulin-stimulated phosphorylation cascade was examined in rat liver after insulin injection via a portal vein by the use of immune complex kinase assays specific to the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and S6 kinase II homologue (rsk) kinase. We have prepared an antibody against the peptide consisting of a carboxyl-terminal portion of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (alpha C92), one of the MAP kinases, and an antibody against the peptide consisting of the carboxyl terminus of the mouse S6 kinase II homologue (alpha rsk(m)C). In alpha C92 immune complex assay, maximal activation of rat liver MAP kinases (approximately 4.3-fold) were observed 4.5 min after insulin injection. We also observed an insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity (approximately 3-fold) in liver extracts from insulin-treated rat in fractions eluted from phenyl-Sepharose with 30-50% ethylene glycol. Kinase assay in myelin basic protein (MBP)-containing gel after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by denaturation with 6 M guanidine HCl, and renaturation revealed that insulin injection stimulated the kinase activity of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins, which corresponded to the two distinct MAP kinases. In alpha rsk(m)C immune complex assay, maximal stimulation (approximately 5-fold) of the S6 peptide (Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala) kinase activity was observed 7.5 min after insulin injection. In addition, MAP kinases purified from insulin-treated rat liver were able to activate S6 peptide kinase activity in vitro in alpha rsk(m)C immunoprecipitates from untreated rat liver, accompanied by the appearance of several phosphorylated bands including a major band at 88 kDa. We also examined whether insulin injection stimulates the MAP kinase activator (Ahn, N. G., Seger, R., Bratlien, R. L., Diltz, C. D., Tonks, N. K., and Krebs, E. G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4220-4227) in rat liver. Using recombinant Xenopus MAP kinase, fractions of Q-Sepharose eluted early in the NaCl gradient were found to have MAP kinase activator activity accompanied by the phosphorylation of 42-kDa recombinant Xenopus MAP kinase. From these data, we demonstrate three tiers of a cascade composed of the MAP kinase activator, MAP kinases, and an S6 peptide kinase activity in rat liver under physiological conditions in the intact animal."
https://openalex.org/W1587588231,"To study the mechanisms involved in regulation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes in oxidative energy pathways, the promoter region of the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) gene was analyzed. A series of hexamer sequences known to bind and confer responsiveness to a subset of members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors was identified. Cotransfection of an MCAD promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid with retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha, beta, or retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) resulted in 10-15-fold transcriptional activation in response to retinoic acid. The retinoic acid-induced activation was 3-4-fold higher with RXR alpha than with either RAR alpha or RAR beta. Deletional analysis confirmed that a region between -341 and -308 base pairs upstream of the MCAD gene cap site conferred the RA-responsive transcriptional activation to homologous and heterologous promoters. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the MCAD RARE interacted directly with overexpressed receptors. Mutational analysis of the RARE delineated three hexamer binding sequences with unique orientation and spacing compared to other reported retinoid responsive elements. These results indicate that the MCAD gene promoter region contains a novel regulatory element that interacts with members of the retinoid receptor family, with preferential activation by RXR alpha. This element likely plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of this gene and perhaps others involved in oxidative energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1588042372,"1,3-Butadiene was oxidized by human myeloperoxidase in the absence of KCl to yield butadiene monoxide (BM) and crotonaldehyde (CA), but at KCl concentrations higher than 50 mM, 1-chloro-2-hydroxy-3-butene (CHB) was the major metabolite detected; metabolite formation was dependent on incubation time, pH, KCl, 1,3-butadiene, and H2O2 concentrations. The data are best explained by 1,3-butadiene being oxidized by myeloperoxidase by two different mechanisms. First, oxygen transfer from the hemoprotein would occur to either C-1 or C-4 of 1,3-butadiene to form an intermediate which may cyclize to form BM or undergo a hydrogen shift to form 3-butenal, an unstable precursor of CA. Further evidence for this mechanism was provided by the inability to detect methyl vinyl ketone, a possible product of an oxygen transfer reaction to C-2 or C-3 of 1,3-butadiene, and by the finding that CA was not simply a decomposition product of BM under assay conditions. In the second mechanism, however, chloride ion is oxidized by myeloperoxidase to HOCl which reacts with 1,3-butadiene to yield CHB. Further evidence for this mechanism was provided by the finding that CHB was readily formed when 1,3-butadiene was added to the filtrate of a myeloperoxidase/H2O2/KCl incubation and when 1,3-butadiene was allowed to react with authentic HOCl. In addition, CHB was not detected when BM or CA was incubated with myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and KCl for up to 60 min, or when 1,3-butadiene and KCl were incubated with chloroperoxidase and H2O2 or with mouse liver microsomes and NADPH, enzyme systems which catalyze 1,3-butadiene oxidation to BM and CA, but unlike myeloperoxidase, do not catalyze chloride ion oxidation to HOCl. These results provide clear evidence for novel olefinic oxidation reactions by myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1932284387,"The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) has several ligands including activated alpha 2-macroglobulin, pregnancy zone protein, and very low density lipoproteins enriched with apolipoprotein E. The diversity of ligands suggests a role for the alpha 2MR/LRP in a variety of processes including tissue remodeling and lipoprotein metabolism. We examined alpha 2MR/LRP in placental trophoblasts, invasive cells that also function in lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism. alpha 2MR/LRP protein was localized by immunohistochemistry in the syncytiotrophoblast of term placenta. Cytotrophoblasts did not stain prominently. alpha 2MR/LRP (protein and message) in primary cultures of human trophoblast cells increased as cytotrophoblasts differentiated into syncytiotrophoblast. 8-Bromo-cAMP prevented this increase and suppressed alpha 2MR/LRP expression. The cyclic nucleotide had similar suppressive effects on alpha 2MR/LRP in BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. In contrast, low density lipoprotein receptor gene expression was increased. We conclude that: 1) there is a differentiation-dependent pattern of alpha 2MR/LRP expression in the human trophoblast; 2) cAMP negatively regulates alpha 2MR/LRP; 3) there is an inverse relationship between alpha 2MR/LRP and low density lipoprotein receptor gene expression in trophoblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1536466971,"The catalytic activity of topoisomerase II is stimulated approximately 2-3-fold following phosphorylation by casein kinase II (Ackerman, P., Glover, C. V. C., and Osheroff, N. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3164-3168). In order to delineate the mechanism by which the activity of the enzyme is enhanced, the effects of casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation on the individual steps of the catalytic cycle of Drosophila topoisomerase II were characterized. Phosphorylation did not affect reaction steps that preceded hydrolysis of the enzyme's high energy ATP cofactor. This included enzyme-DNA binding, pre-strand passage DNA cleavage/religation, the double-stranded DNA passage event, and post-strand passage DNA cleavage/religation. In contrast, the rate of topoisomerase II-mediated ATP hydrolysis was stimulated 2.7-fold following phosphorylation by casein kinase II. Since ATP hydrolysis is a prerequisite for enzyme turnover, it is concluded that phosphorylation modulates the overall catalytic activity of topoisomerase II by stimulating the enzyme's ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2169904230,"Toxoplasmosis, a disease that affects humans and a wide variety of mammals is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, the obligate intracellular coccidian protozoan parasite. Most T. gondii research has focused on the rapidly growing invasive form, the tachyzoite, which expresses five major surface proteins attached to the parasite membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. We have recently reported the purification and partial characterization of candidate precursor glycolipids (GPIs) from metabolically labeled parasites and have presented evidence that these GPIs have a linear glycan backbone sequence indistinguishable from the GPI core glycan of the major tachyzoite surface protein, P30. In this report, we describe a cell-free system derived from tachyzoite membranes which is capable of catalyzing GPI biosynthesis. Incubation of the membrane preparations with radioactive sugar nucleotides (GDP-[3H]mannose or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc) resulted in incorporation of radiolabeled into numerous glycolipids. By using a combination of chemical/enzymatic tests and chromatographic analysis, a series of incompletely glycosylated lipid species and mature GPIs have been identified. We have also established the involvement of Dol-P-mannose in the synthesis of T. gondii GPIs by demonstrating that the incorporation of [3H]mannose into the mannosylated GPIs is stimulated by dolichylphosphate and inhibited by amphomycin. In addition, increasing the concentration of nonradioactive GDP mannose resulted in a loss of radiolabel from the first easily detectable GPI precursor, GlcN-PI, and a concomittant appearance of the radio-activity into mannosylated glycolipids. Altogether, our data suggest that the GPI core glycan in T. gondii is assembled via sequential glycosylation of phosphatidylinositol, as proposed for the biosynthesis of GPIs in Trypanosoma brucei. In contrast to T. brucei, preliminary experiments indicate that the core glycan of some GPIs synthesized by the T. gondii cell-free system is modified by N-acetylgalactosamine similar to the situation for mammalian Thy-1."
https://openalex.org/W1570184892,"To investigate the role of the A protein-binding sites at the Mu ends in the DNA strand transfer reaction, we constructed mutant mini-Mu molecules in which these sites were deleted (L3 or R3) or substituted (L2 or R2) to conserve the spacing arrangements at the adjacent sites. The single site mutants are poor substrates for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis at the Mu ends in Type 1 reactions in the absence of Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF). Addition of IHF to the reaction stimulates Type 1 cleavage more than 10 times for the delta-R3, delta-L3, S-L2 mutants and more than five times in the case of the S-R2 mutant under alternate conditions. The site of IHF stimulation resides within the transpositional enhancer which implicates the end-binding sites L2, L3, R2, and R3 in interactions with the enhancer. At least two of the L2, L3, and R3 sites are required for proficient reaction in the presence of IHF. By combining the single site mutants with O1 or O2 partially deleted enhancer elements, we have tentatively localized some of the interactions to each side of the functional enhancer revealing a complex circuit of end-enhancer interactions. The R3 site is suggested to be involved in interactions only with O2 and the L3 site only with O1. The data also suggest the possibility that L2 and R2 may be involved in interactions with both O1 and O2. Finally, our working model predicts that the L3-O1 and R3-O2 interactions may be required contacts for discriminating between the Mu left and right ends in transpososome formation."
https://openalex.org/W45261678,"A 60-kDa substrate of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was characterized by purification and cDNA cloning. Purification was achieved by column chromatography using DEAE-Sephacel, heparin-agarose, and hydroxylapatite in 0.5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS). Analyses of amino acid sequence and composition indicated that the CHAPS-soluble 60-kDa protein is an isoform of phosphoglucomutase (PGM). cDNAs encoding two isoforms of PGM were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscles. The translated amino acid sequences show that the isoforms, PGM1 and PGM2, differ in the N-terminal 77 amino acids and that PGM2 is identical to the 60-kDa protein in the SR. Northern blot analysis showed that the size of the mRNA encoding PGM2 is 2.4 kilobases. The PGM enzyme activity was markedly inhibited in SR membranes, while perturbation of the membranes with CHAPS or guanidine-HCl recovered the enzyme activity. KCl (0.15-1 M) led to a partial recovery of the enzyme activity suggesting that the charge interaction is not the primary force for PGM-SR interaction. PGM is localized in the heavy fraction of SR, where calsequestrin and Ca2+ release channel are enriched. Our results demonstrate that an isoform of PGM localized in junctional skeletal SR is the 60-kDa substrate of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W122439204,"Recently, two different receptors for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) with molecular masses of 60 kDa (p60) and 80 kDa (p80) have been identified. In this report, we investigated the effect of the soluble forms of these receptors and monoclonal antibodies against them on ligand interaction, receptor down-regulation, and mediation of cellular response in U-937 cells. Our results indicate that p60 and p80 constitute 20-30 and 60-80% of the total TNF-binding sites on U-937 cells, respectively. However, by cross-linking, only the p80 form of the receptor could be detected. In contrast to unlabeled TNF, the anti-p60 and anti-p80 antibodies together only partially inhibited ligand binding, and this inhibition was not additive. Lack of additive inhibition of binding was found to be not due to stereo-chemical hindrance. TNF binding to cells can be completely displaced by soluble forms of either the p60 or p80 receptor. However, 100-fold more of the p80 than the p60 form of the soluble receptor is needed for equivalent displacement. Under optimum conditions, TNF and the anti-p80 and anti-p60 antibodies down-regulated 30, 80, and 20% of the TNF receptors, respectively. The anti-p60 and anti-p80 antibodies down-regulated not only their own receptors, but also reciprocal receptors, suggesting a cross-communication between the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor. In spite of inhibiting as much as 80% of TNF binding, none of the receptor antibodies significantly inhibited the cytotoxic response to TNF in U-937 cells. Soluble forms of both receptors, however, completely abrogated the cellular response to TNF. Thus, overall, our results indicate that the antibodies against both receptors together inhibit the majority of the receptor-ligand interaction without any significant effect on the biological response to TNF."
https://openalex.org/W11744232,"It has been previously demonstrated that the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) trans-activates the gene coding for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) and binds to several sites along the promoter. The additional observations that C/EBP is expressed in liver and follows the same developmental profile as PEPCK suggests that C/EBP plays an important role in the regulation of PEPCK gene expression. However, since C/EBP is expressed at high levels in lung, a tissue in which PEPCK is not expressed, it appears that other mechanisms are involved to provide PEPCK with high level expression in liver. We now show that the albumin promoter D-site-binding protein (DBP), a transcription factor whose expression is limited to the liver, is also able to trans-activate the PEPCK promoter through sequence-specific binding. Both recombinant DBP and C/EBP bind with highest affinity to regions located at positions -85 and -245 in the promoter, but display differences in their binding properties at other sites. Using eukaryotic expression vectors for both C/EBP and DBP, we found that with 5'-deletion mutants of the PEPCK promoter, both C/EBP and DBP exerted their effects through similar regions of the promoter. However, the use of internal deletion mutants of the promoter identified distinct differences in the mechanism of activation by C/EBP and DBP. In particular, a region of the promoter between positions -86 and -117 significantly attenuated the level of trans-activation by DBP, but not by C/EBP. Evidence presented also supports a model whereby the relative ratios of C/EBP and DBP in the cell fine-tune the expression of the PEPCK gene. These results demonstrate that DBP and C/EBP, while having similar DNA binding specificities, have distinct functional differences in the context of the PEPCK promoter. These differences, along with the developmental profiles of C/EBP and DBP, may provide a mechanistic explanation for the liver-specific as well as the developmental profile of PEPCK gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1569352155,"Chimeric cDNAs encoding regions of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit and a sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase were constructed and expressed together with the avian Na,K-ATPase beta-subunit cDNA in COS-1 cells to determine which regions of the alpha-subunit are required for assembly with the beta-subunit. Assembly was assayed by immune precipitation of the chimeric subunit with a monoclonal antibody to the avian beta-subunit. A chimera composed of the amino-terminal two-thirds of the Na,K-ATPase and carboxyl-terminal one-third of the Ca(2+)-ATPase did not assemble with the avian beta-subunit. In contrast, the reciprocal chimera, containing the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the Na,K-ATPase, assembled with the beta-subunit. A third chimera, in which 161 amino acids of the Na,K-ATPase carboxyl terminus replaced the corresponding amino acids of the Ca(2+)-ATPase carboxyl terminus, also assembled with the beta-subunit. These results suggest that the aminoacyl residues of the Na,K-ATPase alpha-subunit critical for subunit assembly lie within the carboxyl-terminal 16% of the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1643968031,"The proglucagon gene is expressed in A cells of the pancreas and L cells of the large and small intestine. Transgenic mice expressing SV40 large T antigen under the control of proglucagon regulatory sequences develop neuroendocrine carcinoma of the large intestine. To determine the consequences of coexpression of SV40 large T antigen and proglucagon in different cell types, the levels of proglucagon mRNA transcripts and proglucagon-derived peptides were determined in tumor-bearing transgenic mice and in age-matched paired controls. Plasma levels of proglucagon-derived peptides (glicentin, oxyntomodulin, and glucagon, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay) were markedly elevated in association with tumor growth (p < 0.001). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the increased concentration of proglucagon-derived peptides was associated with significant inhibition of the endogenous proglucagon gene in pancreas, and to a lesser extent, small intestine. Concomitantly, the concentrations of proglucagon-derived peptides fell to 1-10% of control values in pancreas (p < 0.001) and to 62% of control values in small intestine (p < 0.001). Analysis of proglucagon-derived peptides in mice of different ages demonstrated that tumor growth was associated with a switch in the post-translational processing of proglucagon. Compared with normal mouse intestine, tumors contained increased proportions of glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1(7-37) relative to glicentin, oxyntomodulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1(1-37). The results of these studies provide evidence for humorally-mediated tissue-specific inhibition of proglucagon gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2108366710,"We have previously shown that the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulates activity of the ubiquitous Na-H exchanger (NHE-1) independently of changes in cAMP accumulation and independently of a cholera toxin-sensitive stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs). To further investigate the potential role of a GTP-binding protein in coupling the beta-AR to NHE-1, we have used a recently available nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, caged guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), to study time-dependent effects of GTP on NHE-1 in intact cells. By monitoring intracellular pH (pHi) in cells loaded with the fluorescent pH-sensitive dye, 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, we determined NHE-1 activity in primary cultures of canine enteric endocrine cells, which express an endogenous beta-AR, and in mouse L cells stably transfected with either the wild type hamster beta 2-AR or a mutant construct of the hamster beta 2-AR containing a deletion in amino acid residues 222-229. This D(222-229)beta 2-AR is functionally uncoupled from Gs and adenylylcyclase. In all three cell types, NaF and GTP gamma S induced an increase in activity of the exchanger, determined by assessing the rate of pHi recovery from an acute intracellular acid load (dpHi/dt). This increase in pHi recovery was dependent on extracellular Na+ and sensitive to the amiloride analog ethylisopropylamiloride. GTP gamma S, but not NaF, also increased beta-adrenergic stimulation of resting NHE-1 activity. The alkalinization in response to isoproterenol was reversed by propranolol in the absence, but not the presence, of GTP gamma S and was completely blocked by GDP beta S. The ability of guanine nucleotides to regulate beta-adrenergic activation of NHE-1 in cells expressing the mutant D(222-229)beta 2-AR suggests that functional coupling of the beta-AR to NHE-1 may be mediated by a GTP-binding protein other than Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1571597530,"The successful prevention of hydrogen peroxide-induced damage to the rat jejunal mucosa by cationized catalase is described in this study. Biological damage was induced in a closed circulating intestinal loop of the rat by hydrogen peroxide and by hydroxyl radicals induced in situ via the metal-mediated Haber-Wiess reaction. The mucosal activity of lactate dehydrogenase and the amount of potassium ions were used to quantitatively characterize the tissue damage. Catalase was cationized by reacting it with N,N'-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine to give a soluble product or with polyhistidine to give an insoluble product. The activity of the modified enzymes was assessed, and their ability to protect the rat jejunal mucosa against oxidative stress was studied. It was found that in all cases the cationized enzymes were superior to the native catalase in their shield capability. A significant protection against Fe(II)/H2O2 and ascorbic acid/copper ion-mediated damage was obtained when the cationized enzymes were used. In the presence of glucose, native glucose oxidase failed to cause damage in the rat jejunal mucosa; however, the cationized enzyme caused profound tissue injury. These findings indicate the potential therapeutic merit of cationized enzymes for the treatment of pathological processes in the intestine, whenever oxidative stress is involved."
https://openalex.org/W1560568907,"The binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) to a specific receptor induces the release of Ca2+ from an intracellular store. In the liver, the KD of a low affinity state of the receptor (RL) found at low Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) is in close agreement with the EC50 of the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. We have developed an experimental procedure for measuring the rate of dissociation of this low affinity [32P]InsP3-receptor complex in less than 1 s. When the receptor was in the RL state, two kinetic components, RL1 and RL2, were identified with respective rate constants (k(off)) of 1-2 s-1 and 0.03-0.06 s-1. Increasing the [Ca2+] up to 1 microM transformed the receptor into the high affinity state (RH) and decreased the dissociation rate constant to 2 x 10(-2) min-1. We also investigated the time course of the transformation of the receptor from the high affinity (RH) to the low affinity state (RL) after decreasing the [Ca2+] to less than 10 nM. This reversion was dramatically dependent on temperature: at 4 degrees C, the receptor was locked in the RH state, whereas at 37 degrees C the receptor reverted to the RL state with a half-time of less than 1 s. The reversion from the RH state to the RL one is associated to a recovery of InsP3-induced 45Ca2+ release on permeabilized hepatocytes. The rapid and reversible transformation of the InsP3 receptor from an active to an inactive state may be a key event in the Ca2+ release process in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559156419,"Cytochrome b558 of pig blood neutrophils was partially purified, and its EPR spectra were measured. The cytochrome b558 was solubilized from membranes with the detergent n-heptyl-beta-thioglucoside and purified by DEAE-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose chromatographies. The small and large subunits of cytochrome b558 were detected on gel by immunoblotting. A solution of the purified, undenatured cytochrome b558 at 85-108 microM concentration was obtained. The concentrated cytochrome b558 showed an EPR signal at a g value of 3.26 with a bandwidth of 100 G at 10 K. Addition of 2 mM KCN had no effect on the low spin signal at g = 3.26 but caused disappearance of a minor high spin signal. The cyanide-insensitive signal at g = 3.26 disappeared completely on reduction with Na2S2O4. These results suggest that the g = 3.26 signal is characteristic of the low spin heme in cytochrome b558 of neutrophils."

Interaction of purified G-protein and PDE is achieved in the presence of lecithin vesicles, at protein concentrations sufficient for full PDE activation. Protein subunits linked with DTSSP are separated by cleavage of the disulfide bridge and identified by electrophoresis. Complexes of PDE alpha (PDE beta) with 1 and 2 molecules of activator G alpha GTP gamma S are observed, providing direct evidence for an interaction or at least a close proximity between 2 molecules of activator G alpha and each of the catalytic PDE subunits in the activated state of PDE. The results also reveal symmetrical roles of PDE alpha and PDE beta, with the existence of one site for PDE gamma and one site for G alpha on each catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1576555245,"The effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the expression of the receptor for platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; AGEPC) was examined in cultured IC-21 peritoneal macrophages. AGEPC binding to its receptors reached saturation within 20 min at 25 degrees C and was reversible. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of AGEPC receptors with a Bmax of approximately 170 fmol/mg cellular protein and a Kd of 0.25 nM. Preincubation of IC-21 cells with LPS (0.01-1,000 ng/ml) induced an increase in the surface expression of AGEPC receptors in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. The maximal effect of LPS on the AGEPC receptor was observed between 5 and 8 h, with a typical increase between 150 and 200%. Scatchard analysis indicated that LPS treatment of IC-21 cells increased the number of AGEPC receptors on the cell surface without any apparent change in the affinity of the receptor for the ligand. The effect of LPS on the surface expression of the AGEPC receptor was nearly abolished by cycloheximide (0.1 mM) and by actinomycin D (3 microM), suggesting the involvement of enhanced receptor protein synthesis and mRNA production in this event. Moreover, LPS treatment increased the capability of the IC-21 cell to respond to AGEPC addition by elevating intracellular free Ca2+ without causing an increase in the basal level of intracellular Ca2+. The present study demonstrates that IC-21 peritoneal macrophages possess high affinity AGEPC receptors and provides the evidence that the number of functional AGEPC receptors on a cell can be increased significantly upon exposure to LPS."

In contrast to hitherto known Ty elements from yeast, Ty4 is flanked by long terminal tau-element repeats instead of delta or sigma sequences. Ty4 contains two overlapping open reading frames. The first open reading frame, TYA4, is 1230 base pairs long and encodes a protein with a motif found in the nucleic acid-binding gag-protein of retroviruses. The second 4395-base pair open reading frame, TYB4, encodes a polyprotein that has domains with significant homology to retroviral protease, integrase, reverse transcriptase, and RNase H, structurally arranged in that order. The deduced amino acid sequence shows the greatest similarity with Ty2 and Ty1. The overall identity of the deduced functional protein domains is 28% with Ty2, 25% with Ty1, 19% with copia from Drosophila, and 18% with Ty3. Examination of genomic DNA from several laboratory strains indicates that Ty4 is present in two to four copies. Ty4 mRNA is of low abundance as compared to other Ty retrotransposons. At the 3' end of Ty4, two solo delta-elements, a full length and an overlapping, truncated one, are associated."
https://openalex.org/W1608888841,"We have studied the effects of thrombin (alpha-thrombin) and Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asn-Pro-Asn-Asp-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Phe (SFLL), a peptide agonist of the platelet thrombin receptor in cultured human mesangial cells, and find that SFLL can reproduce the biochemical and morphological effects of thrombin. Treatment of mesangial cells with cAMP-elevating agents causes fragmentation of stress fibers, loss of the vitronectin receptor from sites of focal adhesion, and produces a change in shape from a flat to a more arborized configuration. These effects are prevented by both thrombin and SFLL. Thrombin and SFLL also initiate biochemical signaling events in mesangial cells by stimulating the metabolism of phospholipids. Both thrombin and SFLL stimulate release of inositol phosphates from [3H]inositol-labeled cells, elevation of cytosolic calcium, the formation of [3H]myristic acid-labeled diacylglycerol, an increase in the mass of diacylglycerol, 32P incorporation into phospholipids, and release of unesterified [3H]arachidonic acid from cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid. When present together, the effects of SFLL and thrombin on diacylglycerol formation, arachidonic acid production, and inositol phosphate production were not additive. This suggested that SFLL and thrombin were acting on the same receptor. This was further supported by our observations that cells pretreated with SFLL and subsequently exposed to thrombin (or vice versa) did not show elevated cytosolic calcium. We also show that phospholipase D is activated by demonstrating production of radiolabeled phosphatidylethanol when cells are treated with SFLL in the presence of ethanol. These findings indicate that SFLL can be used to study the receptor-mediated effects of thrombin in mesangial cells, thereby avoiding thrombin's proteolytic actions."
https://openalex.org/W2167416257,"In order to determine the role of fructose (Fru) 2,6-P2 in stimulation of phosphofructokinase in ischemic liver, tissue contents of Fru-2,6-P2, hexose-Ps, adenine nucleotides, and Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase were investigated during the first few minutes of ischemia. The Fru-2,6-P2 concentration in the liver changed in an oscillatory manner. Within 7 s after the initiation of ischemia, Fru-2,6-P2 increased from 6 to 21 nmol/g liver and decreased to 5 nmol/g liver within 30 s. Subsequently, it reached the maximum value at 50, 80, and 100 s and decreased to the basal concentration at 60, 90, and 120 s. Oscillatory patterns were also observed with Glc-6-P and Fru-6-P, but the ATP/ADP ratio decreased monotonically. Determination of Fru-6-P,2-kinase activity and the phosphorylation states of Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase demonstrated that at 7 and 50 s, where Fru-2,6-P2 was the highest, the enzyme was activated and mostly in a dephosphorylated form. On the other hand, at 0, 30, and 300 s, the enzyme was predominantly in the phosphorylated form. The concentration of cAMP in the liver also changed in an oscillatory manner between 0.5 to 1.3 nmol/g with varying frequency of 10 to 40 s. These results indicated that: (a) Fru-2,6-P2 was important in rapid activation of phosphofructokinase in the first few seconds and up to 2-3 min, and (b) the oscillation of Fru-2,6-P2 concentration was the result of activation and inhibition of Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase, which was caused by changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1487391389,"Abstract Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PtdIns-PLC) of Bacillus cereus catalyzes the conversion of PtdIns to inositol cyclic 1:2-phosphate and diacylglycerol. NIH 3T3, Swiss mouse 3T3, CV-1, and Cos-7 cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding this enzyme, and the metabolic and cellular consequences were investigated. Overexpression of PtdIns-PLC enzyme activity was associated with elevated levels of inositol cyclic 1:2-phosphate (2.5-70-fold), inositol 1-phosphate (2-20-fold), and inositol 2-phosphate (3-20-fold). The increases correlated with the levels of enzyme expression obtained in each cell type. The turnover of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) was also increased in transfected CV-1 cells by 13-fold 20 h after transfection. The levels of PtdIns, phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, or other inositol phosphates were not detectably altered. Expression of bacterial PtdIns-PLC decreased rapidly after 20 h implying that either the increased PtdIns turnover or the accumulation of inositol phosphates was detrimental to cells and that by some adaptive mechanism enzyme expression was suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W1510860180,"Inositol 2-phosphate (Ins(2)P) has been identified in several cell types. The cellular levels of Ins(2)P appear to be directly correlated with the levels of inositol 1:2-cyclic phosphate (cIns(1:2)P) (Ross, T. S., Wang, F. P., and Majerus, P. W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19919-19923). In this study we have detected an enzyme in extracts from CV-1 cells and rat cerebellum that converts cIns(1:2)P to Ins(2)P and inositol 1-phosphate. This enzyme (designated cyclic hydrolase II) is not the same protein previously designated cIns(1:2)P 2-phosphohydrolase (cyclic hydrolase I). The products, heat inactivation curves, pH optima, and metal dependence of these two activities are different, and the two activities were separated by DEAE and gel filtration chromatography. Mixing of cyclic hydrolase I with cyclic hydrolase II does not effect the activity of either. The Km of the CV-1 cyclic hydrolase II for D-cIns(1:2)P is 10 microM. The enzyme is approximately 55 kDa as estimated by gel filtration analysis in the presence of sodium chloride and 120 kDa in its absence."
https://openalex.org/W2264076206,"A protein doublet (M(r) = 68,000) that copurifies with chicken cardiac collagen types I and III is purified and characterized in the present study. Peptide mapping and amino terminus sequencing for both 68-kDa polypeptides show they have similar structures. This is supported by amino terminus sequencing of a 39-kDa proteolytic fragment of each polypeptide. The 68-kDa polypeptides appear at pI 6.7-6.8 in two-dimensional gels. Under nonreducing, electrophoretic conditions, the doublet appears as a large multimer or aggregate. Amino acid sequencing of the protein shows that its amino terminus contains a heptapeptide (VCLXXGK) that appears in the heparin/fibrin-binding domain of fibronectin and the collagen-binding domain of laminin. Cardiac myocytes synthesize and secrete the protein in vitro onto cell surfaces and onto the substratum. Indirect immunofluorescence shows the protein first appears in the chicken subepicardium at approximately 10 days following fertilization. As collagen accumulates in the subepicardium and the volume of the subepicardial space increases, the 68-kDa protein is found predominantly at the interface between myocardial cells and the connective tissue and between epicardial cells and the connective tissue. In adult hearts, the protein is also present at lower concentrations in endomysial connective tissue. The 68-kDa protein is also present in the skeletal muscle endomysium of embryonic chickens. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry shows the 68-kDa protein is located at the surface of subepicardial collagen fibers. In addition, a direct interaction between the 68-kDa protein and collagen are indicated by: 1) equilibrium gel filtration of the 68-kDa protein in the presence of gelatin, 2) gelatin affinity chromatography of the 68-kDa protein, and 3) comigration of type I collagen and the 68-kDa protein during gel filtration under reducing conditions. The 68-kDa protein exhibits no collagenase activity under native conditions or in zymograms. Together, the data indicate that the 68-kDa protein is a novel collagen-associated protein appearing in late epicardial development."
