https://openalex.org/W2161798777,"A tumor-promoting phorbol ester, [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, may bind to a homogeneous preparation of Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) in the simultaneous presence of Ca2+ and phospholipid. This tumor promoter does not bind simply to phospholipid nor to the enzyme per se irrespective of the presence and absence of Ca2+. All four components mentioned above appear to be bound together, and the quaternary complex thus produced is enzymatically fully active for protein phosphorylation. Phosphatidylserine is most effective. Various other phorbol derivatives which are active in tumor promotion compete with [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate for the binding, and an apparent dissociation binding constant of the tumor promoter is 8 nM. This value is identical with the activation constant for protein kinase C and remarkably similar to the dissociation binding constant that is described for intact cell surface receptors. The binding of the phorbol ester is prevented specifically by the addition of diacylglycerol, which serves as activator of protein kinase C under physiological conditions. Scatchard analysis suggests that one molecule of the tumor promoter may bind to every molecule of protein kinase C in the presence of Ca2+ and excess phospholipid. It is suggestive that protein kinase C is a phorbol ester-receptive protein, and the results presented seem to provide clues for clarifying the mechanism of tumor promotion."

https://openalex.org/W1964577086,"The concentration of cytosolic ionized calcium, [Ca2+]i, was measured in intact neutrophils by use of a fluorescent indicator trapped in the cytoplasm. A given rise of [Ca2+]i elicited by the chemotactic peptide formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP) was associated with a much greater degree of superoxide generation and myeloperoxidase secretion than was the same or larger [Ca2+]i produced by a specific calcium ionophore, ionomycin, which bypasses cell surface receptors. Thus, FMLP appears to generate some important excitatory signal in addition to a rise in [Ca2+]i, and exocytosis and superoxide generation in neutrophils may not be simply dependent on [Ca2+]i as is widely supposed."

https://openalex.org/W2013002258,"We present genetic evidence that insertion sequence IS10, the active element in transposon Tn10, can negatively control expression of its own transposase protein at the translational level. This control process is manifested in trans in a phenomenon called ""multicopy inhibition"": the presence of a multicopy plasmid containing IS10 inhibits transposition of a single copy chromosomal Tn10 element by reducing its ability to express transposition functions. Fusion analysis suggests that expression is reduced at the translational and not the transcriptional level. Only the outer 180 bp of IS10-Right are required on the plasmid for full inhibition. Plasmid-encoded transposase protein is not involved. The genetic structure of the essential plasmid region and the effects of point and deletion mutations on multicopy inhibition lead us to propose that inhibition of transposase translation occurs by direct pairing between the transposase messenger RNA and a small, complementary, regulatory RNA specified by the IS10-encoded pOUT promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1996831855,"E. coli bacteria respond to a sudden upward shift in temperature by transiently overproducing a small subset of their proteins, one of which is the product of the dnaK gene. Mutations in dnaK have been previously shown to affect both DNA and RNA synthesis in E. coli. Bacteria carrying the dnaK756 mutation fail to turn off the heat-shock response at 43 degrees C. Instead, they continue to synthesize the heat-shock proteins in large amounts and underproduce other proteins. Both reversion and P1 transduction analyses have shown that the failure to turn off the heat-shock response is the result of the dnaK756 mutation. In addition, bacteria that overproduce the dnaK protein at all temperatures undergo a drastically reduced heat-shock response at high temperature. We conclude that the dnaK protein is an inhibitor of the heat-shock response in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1562879210,"The nucleotide sequence of the leader peptidase structural gene from Escherichia coli has been determined. The gene codes for a protein of 323 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr = 35,994, in agreement with the apparent molecular weight of leader peptidase (37,000) determined from gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. In addition, the amino acid composition predicted from the DNA sequence matches that of the purified enzyme. Leader peptidase synthesized in a cell-free transcription-translation system and isolated from cell membranes have identical apparent molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The presence of methionine and cysteine in the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide shows that no more than three amino acid residues have been removed from the primary translation product predicted from the DNA sequence. These results indicate that leader peptidase is synthesized and assembled into the membrane without proteolytic removal of a leader peptide. Leader peptidase is shown to be largely found in the inner membrane of overproducing strains. The majority of the polypeptide chain is exposed on the outer surface of the inner membrane. It is anchored by a membrane-spanning segment near the NH2 terminus. This orientation agrees with the functional orientation of leader peptidase observed in artificial membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W2116346773,"We have used molecular hybridization and cDNA cloning techniques to isolate mouse cellular genes activated in SV40-transformed cells and we show that many of the clones belong to one of four sets. We characterize the cytoplasmic transcripts and genomic sequences homologous to two of these sets. The Set 1 transcription unit(s) is activated in all SV40-transformed cell lines analyzed, and experiments with tsA-mutant-transformed lines show that activation appears to require functional large T-antigen. This transcription unit(s) is also activated in mouse fibroblasts transformed by other agents, including retroviruses and chemical carcinogens. Activation of the Set 2 transcription unit(s) is more restricted, being confined to cell lines transformed by SV40 and retroviruses with distinctive biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W2068348059,"The near identity of the partial amino acid sequence of human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and that predicted for p28sis, the putative transforming protein of the simian sarcoma virus (SSV), suggests expression of a growth factor activity may be central for transformation by SSV. It is now reported that SSV-transformed cells but not control cells contain a growth factor activity that is identical to PDGF in immunoassay, in mitogenic dose response, and in specific mitogenic activity. The protein immunoprecipitated by antiserum to human PDGF has an apparent molecular weight of 20,000, identical to that of p20sis, the putative intracellular degradation product of p28sis. The results support the concept that expression of a PDGF-like molecule, which appears to be the product of the viral-sis gene, is responsible for the abnormal regulation of growth is SSV-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980613202,"The potent α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl pyrethroids, including cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fenvalerate, act stereospecifically to inhibit binding to rat brain synaptic membranes of sulfur-35-labeled t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, a new radioligand for the picrotoxinin binding site. Scatchard analysis indicates that picrotoxinin inhibition of t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding is competitive whereas cypermethrin inhibition possibly involves a closely associated site in the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-ionophore complex. Studies with 37 pyrethroids reveal an absolute correlation, that is, no false positives or negatives, between mouse intracerebral toxicity and in vitro inhibition: all toxic cyano compounds but none of their nontoxic stereoisomers are inhibitors; cis isomers are more potent than trans isomers as both toxicants and inhibitors; and noncyano pyrethroids are much less potent or are inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1980866260,"We have determined the precise point of transcription initiation for five nif (nitrogen fixation) operons of Klebsiella pneumoniae and sequenced the promoters. Our results show that nifF is transcribed in the opposite direction to that previously proposed for nif genes, that nifM is transcribed from two promoters, and that there is a promoter preceding nifU but not nifX, and we present a revised map of nif transcripts. The nif promoters have a characteristic structure of 26 bp located between positions--1 and --26 upstream of the site of transcription initiation: CTGG..8bp...TTGCA...9bp...Py(+1). This structure, which has two regions of conserved sequence, shows no homology to the ""consensus promoter"" of enteric bacteria. Our results suggest that the--10 homology is equivalent to a ""Pribnow box"" for promoters expressed under nitrogen-starved conditions and that the--23 homology confers activator specificity on the nif promoters."

https://openalex.org/W2047814541,A novel human retrovirus (HTLV-II) was previously found associated with a T-cell variant of hairy-cell leukaemia. Molecular cloning demonstrates that the complete provirus genome is 8.8 kilobase pairs in size and is transmissible to uninfected cells. Two types of infectious deleted provirus were also characterized. The sequences of HTLV-II are distinct from those of HTLV-I.
https://openalex.org/W2057902888,"We have constructed mutants of Rous sarcoma virus expressing p60src that are underphosphorylated on serine or tyrosine, by linker insertion or insertion/ deletion into cloned Rous sarcoma virus DNA, and recovery of mutant virus by transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts. Cells infected with mutants whose p60src lack the major site of either serine or tyrosine phosphorylation were morphologically transformed and formed colonies in soft agar. The tyrosine kinase activities of the mutant p60src measured in vivo and in vitro were close to the wild type activity. Peptide mapping showed that phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine of p60src is independent: the major phosphorylated tyrosine and the major phosphorylated serine can each be phosphorylated in the absence of phosphorylation of the other."

https://openalex.org/W1565287219,"Pertussis toxin (islet-activating protein) activates adenylate cyclase in susceptible cells by ADP-ribosylating an inhibitory component of the cyclase system. This toxin, assayed in a cell-free system in the presence of high concentrations of thiol, catalyzed the hydrolysis of NAD to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. This NAD glycohydrolase activity co-chromatographed on Sephacryl G-200 in 6.5 M urea, pH 3.2, 0.1 M glycine with the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin, as monitored by the transfer of [32P]ADP-ribose from [32P]NAD to a 41,000-Da protein in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cells. In the absence of thiol, the native holotoxin was enzymatically inactive. Following addition of 250 mM dithiothreitol to the assay, maximal enzymatic activity was evident after a delay of approximately 1 h; with 20 mM thiol, the delay was longer. The Km for NAD with the fully activated enzyme was 25 microM; the Km did not appear to vary with the extent of activation. Thiol was necessary in a cell-free system to demonstrate NAD glycohydrolase activity. When extensively washed membranes were used as a source of 41,000-Da substrate, thiol was necessary to observe ADP-ribosylation in some cases (human erythrocytes) and significantly stimulated activity in others (NG108-15 cells). In contrast to the bacterial toxins choleragen and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin that ADP-ribosylate stimulatory components of the cyclase system, pertussis toxin did not transfer ADP-ribose to low molecular weight guanidino compounds, such as arginine or agmatine."
https://openalex.org/W2071872098,"We have identified three IS10-encoded promoters, pIN, the promoter for IS10's transposase gene, is intrinsically weak, contributing to the low frequency of IS10 transposition in vivo. Its transcripts begin near the “outside” end of IS10 and extend inward across the element. pOUT, a strong promoter just internal to and opposing pIN, directs transcription outward. Its transcripts are proposed to inhibit translation of the transposase gene in trans (accompanying paper). pOUT may also inhibit transcription from pIN in cis. pIII, a weak promoter near the “inside” end of IS10, is of unknown genetic importance. Many transposable elements activate, by adjacent insertion, silent genes lacking normal promoters. Such IS10-promoted turn-on is mediated by pOUT and results from continuation of pOUT-initiated transcripts past the IS10 terminus, into adjoining chromosomal material. Wild-type and mutant IS10 promoters have been analyzed in vitro. pIN is weaker than pOUT because of inefficient isomerization from closed to open complexes. Despite their proximity, pIN and pOUT do not interact before or during open complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1519321866,"The continuous DNA sequence of a 16.5-kilobase pair region encompassing the linked delta beta-globin gene cluster in humans is presented with a detailed restriction endonuclease map. There are 38 differences (0.5%) in comparison with published sequence data, corrected for errors in sequencing, resulting in polymorphic rates of 0.2% in exons and 0.76% in 5'-gene flanking regions. Fifteen changes result in the generation or elimination of restriction sites which may be useful in linkage disequilibrium studies. Two pairs of inverted Alu repeats, a pyrimidine-rich region 5' to delta, and (TG)n, (Pu/Py)n, and (ATTTT)n tracts 5' to beta are described. Dinucleotide frequencies and deviation from expected values approximated those found in total human genomic DNA. Regions of less than 50% A + T content were found associated with Alu sequences, a 150-base pair region immediately 5' to the beta gene, exon regions from both genes, and an area 3' to the beta gene. These regions also contained significantly lower than expected CpG levels compared to other regions, suggesting a possible relationship between DNA organizational patterns and functionally important regions. In addition, strand asymmetries in base composition in this region differ from those associated with the fetal globin genes."
https://openalex.org/W2154138181,"Addition of homogeneous rat liver sterol carrier protein2 (SCP2) or an adrenal cytosolic fraction enhanced pregnenolone production by adrenal mitochondria. Pretreatment of SCP2 or adrenal cytosol with anti-SCP2 IgG abolished the stimulatory effect of both preparations on mitochondrial pregnenolone output. Incubation of mitochondria with aminoglutethimide, which blocks interaction of cholesterol with inner membrane cytochrome P-450scc, resulted in decreased pregnenolone production and a decreased level of mitoplast cholesterol. Addition of SCP2 to the incubation media caused an almost 2-fold increase in cholesterol associated with the mitoplast, but did not enhance mitochondrial pregnenolone production. Studies with reconstituted cytochrome P-450scc in phospholipid vesicles also suggested that SCP2 did not affect interaction of cholesterol with the hemoprotein. Treatment of rats with cycloheximide alone or with adrenocorticotropic hormone resulted in a dramatic increase in mitochondrial cholesterol. However, these mitochondria did not exhibit increased levels of pregnenolone output under control incubation conditions. When SCP2 was included in the mitochondrial incubation media, pregnenolone production was significantly increased over that observed with adrenal mitochondria from untreated or adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated rats. The results imply that SCP2 enhances mitochondrial pregnenolone production by improving transfer of mitochondrial cholesterol to cytochrome P-450scc on the inner membrane, but does not directly influence the interaction of substrate with the hemoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1502517254,"The biosynthesis of type V collagen and its regulation were studied using diploid human gingival fibroblasts. Cells were metabolically labeled with radioactive amino acids and labeled proteins were subjected to limited pepsin digestion, DEAE-cellulose chromatography at 15 degrees C, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins eluted from DEAE-cellulose columns by 0.25 M NaCl contained a collagen species which was resistant to mammalian collagenase and had alpha chains with hydroxylysine/lysine ratios and CNBr peptide patterns similar to alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V). Procollagen(V) fractions obtained by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and immunoprecipitates of type V collagen antibody contained polypeptides with Mr = 239,000, 219,000, 198,000, 174,000, 157,000, and 132,000. By comparing the CNBr peptide maps of these proteins with those of standard alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V) chains, the first three polypeptides were shown to be related to alpha 1(V) and the others to alpha 2(V). It was concluded that the gingival fibroblasts synthesize type V collagen, that the pro alpha 1(V) and the pro alpha 2(V) chains have Mr = 239,000 and 174,000, respectively, and that the alpha 1(V) and alpha 2(V) chains laid in the form of fibrils have Mr = 198,000 and 132,000, respectively. A detectable amount of type V collagen was synthesized only at high cell density, and it was associated with the cell layer. The amount and proportion of type V synthesized were increased when the cells were labeled in the presence of serum, and the increase was accompanied by a decrease in type III. This effect was dependent on serum concentration. Serum obtained from platelet-poor plasma failed to elicit this effect, and it was restored by the addition of platelet-derived growth factor. Platelet-derived growth factor was effective in medium with and without platelet-poor serum. Thus, it appears that platelet-derived growth factor may be an important regulatory factor in the synthesis of types V and III collagens."
https://openalex.org/W1601327747,"Abstract Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) inhibits markedly (90%) the binding of a low concentration (0.5 ng/ml) of 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) to Swiss 3T3 cells in a dose, time, and temperature-dependent manner. In contrast, PDGF inhibits the binding of a high concentration (20 ng/ml) of 125I-EGF by only 20%. Detailed Scatchard analysis of 125I-EGF binding to Swiss 3T3 cells at 4 degrees C, after a 2-h incubation with a saturating level of PDGF at 37 degrees C, demonstrates that this PDGF pretreatment does not change the number of EGF receptors (70,000 sites/cell), but causes a large decrease in the affinity of the receptors, from a mixed population of 0.5-12 ng/ml, to an affinity of 13 ng/ml. A parallel treatment at 37 degrees C with EGF itself causes a 70% decrease in the number of EGF receptors. Therefore, we conclude, in contrast to previous reports, that PDGF (unlike EGF) does not cause down-regulation of EGF receptors. Rather PDGF induces a potent, temperature-dependent change in the affinity of the EGF receptor population (transmodulation)."
https://openalex.org/W1966825642,"The chicken transferrin gene was microinjected into the male pronucleus of fertilized mouse eggs, and the eggs were then implanted into foster mothers. Approximately 15%-30% of the offspring from the injected eggs carried chicken DNA sequences; restriction mapping indicated that multiple copies of the chicken gene had integrated into the genome in a tandem arrangement in most of the mice. Six of the seven mice studied expressed the chicken gene, and in five mice there was a 5 to 10 fold preferential expression of chicken transferrin mRNA in liver compared to that in other tissues. Chicken transferrin was secreted into the serum of five of the mice, where it reached steady state concentrations up to 67 micrograms/ml. Offspring from transgenic parents also expressed the chicken gene; in some cases the expression in offspring was very similar to the parent, but in one line expression in offspring had increased 2 to 4 fold."
https://openalex.org/W1589185295,"The microviscosity of human platelet membranes was changed by incubating platelets with liposomes containing various ratios of cholesterol and lecithin. Binding of 125I-thrombin to the modified platelets was measured together with platelet aggregation and secretion. In cholesterol-normal platelets (mole ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid (C:PL) = 0.553; eta = 2.40 poise), weighted nonlinear least squares curve fitting indicated that a model involving two classes of sites was adequate to describe the binding isotherm (K1 = 8.3 X 10(8) M-1; R1 = 150 sites/platelet; K2 = 6.4 X 10(6) M-1; R2 = 16,000 sites/platelet). In cholesterol-enriched platelets (C:PL = 0.857; eta = 3.05 poise), the apparent affinities for the two classes of sites decreased to 55 and 53%, respectively, while the binding capacities increased to 170 and 160%, respectively. In contrast, in the cholesterol-depleted platelets (C:PL = 0.435; eta = 2.03 poise), the affinities increased to 220 and 180%, respectively, while the binding capacities decreased to 53 and 46%, respectively. In cholesterol-enriched, cholesterol-normal, and cholesterol-depleted platelets, the thrombin concentrations required for half-maximal aggregation were 0.17, 0.35, and 0.52 nM, respectively, while the values for half-maximal secretion of [14C]serotonin were 0.17, 0.40, and 0.55 nM, respectively. Plots of receptor occupancy versus biological response showed that maximum response in cholesterol-enriched, cholesterol-normal, and cholesterol-depleted platelets occurred with occupancy of 30, 50, and 70% of the high affinity sites, respectively. In all three treatment groups, occupancy of 40-50 high affinity sites results in 50% aggregation. These results show that (i) modification of platelet membrane microviscosity results in changes in the number and affinity of both high and low affinity thrombin receptors, (ii) the change in receptor number rather than affinity is the determinant for platelet responsiveness, and (iii) the changes in membrane microviscosity do not appear to alter the coupling between occupied receptor and subsequent bioresponse."
https://openalex.org/W1528298906,"Previous studies have established that human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G2) secrete into serum-free medium the pro form of apolipoprotein A-I (proapo-A-I) suggesting that its conversion to mature apo-A-I occurs after secretion. In order to assess the mode and site of proapo-A-I to apo-A-I conversion, we incubated the medium from [3H]proline-labeled Hep G2 cells with either human plasma, serum, lymph, or fractions thereof obtained by density gradient ultracentrifugation. The conversion was monitored by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by Edman degradation. Human plasma, serum, or mesenteric lymph all induced proapo-A-I to apo-A-I conversion; this was time dependent, unaffected by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and inhibited by EDTA. Purified radiolabeled proapo-A-I bound to lymph chylomicrons and plasma high density lipoproteins. The converting enzyme was associated with both of these particles. Activity was also found in the d greater than 1.21-g/ml fraction and may have been derived from high density lipoprotein after displacement by high salts and/or ultracentrifugal force. We conclude that the conversion of proapo-A-I to apo-A-I occurs extracellularly and is probably effected by a metallo-enzyme which may act at the amphiphilic surface of either chylomicrons or high density lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2015376365,"We have analyzed the structure of the Shrunken (Sh) locus in a strain containing an unstable recessive mutation, sh-m5933, caused by the transposable controlling element Dissociation (Ds). We have also analyzed nine spontaneous Sh revertant alleles. The sh-m5933 allele contains a 30 kb insertion at the Sh locus, as well as a duplication that includes part of the insertion and the Sh locus sequence on the 5' side of the insertion site. The revertants continue to show Ds-mediated chromosome breakage at the Sh locus, have an intact Sh locus from which the insertion has been excised, and retain the duplication. One of the nine revertant alleles has a 2 kb deletion at the junction between the Sh locus and the insertion sequence in the duplicated segment of the locus. The revertant also shows a temporal change in the pattern of somatic chromosome breakage, implicating the junction sequence as the site of Ds-mediated chromosome breakage."
https://openalex.org/W1495883658,"Abstract Single strand DNA-binding endo-exonucleases purified from mitochondria, vacuoles, or a mixture of these organelles had the same high specific single strand DNase activity (910 mumol of nucleotides/min/mg), and each contained a polypeptide of Mr = 31,000-33,000 which was found to be active by sodium dodecyl sulfate-DNA-gel electrophoresis. The properties of the three preparations were identical in all respects tested. The enzyme showed distributive endonuclease activity with single strand DNA, but processive exonuclease activity with double strand DNA. In the former case, 5'-phosphoryl-terminated fragments were released at early times, while in the latter case, short 5'-oligonucleotides (n = 2-4) were released. Both activities were dependent on Mg2+ (or Mn2+), but to different extents. In 0.1 mM Mg2+, superhelical bacteriophage phi X174 (replicative form (RF II) DNA and, at converted to relaxed circular (RF II) DNA and, at higher enzyme concentrations, to unit length linear (RF III) DNA. In 10 mM Mg2+, these same conversions took place rapidly, and the RF III DNA which formed was degraded to pieces shorter than unit length. At very low enzyme concentrations, long single strand tails and gaps were detected in bacteriophage T7 linear double strand DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1516716285,"The regulation of receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the homologous decapeptide ligand was analyzed in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. Assay of GnRH receptors in both intact and disrupted cells showed that GnRH binding to gonadotrophs was rapidly followed by dose-dependent loss of sites that was maximal within 1 h. This early loss of GnRH receptors was not dependent on protein synthesis, and was attributable to ligand-induced processing of the peptide binding sites. No loss of GnRH sites was observed after receptor occupancy by a GnRH antagonist, or after target cell activation by exposure to a depolarizing concentration of KCl to stimulate luteinizing hormone release. After their initial down-regulation, GnRH receptors returned to normal and subsequently increased in concentration after 6 h of incubation. The delayed phase of receptor up-regulation was prevented by treatment with cycloheximide or actinomycin D and was calcium-dependent, being induced by 50 mM KCl and by low concentrations of the calcium ionophore, A23187. Conversely, calcium antagonists such as verapamil and MgCl2 impaired the agonist-induced increase of GnRH receptor sites. These findings have demonstrated that pituitary GnRH receptors undergo two distinct phases of regulation after interaction with the homologous ligand. The initial phase of agonist-dependent receptor loss is followed by a postsecretory phase of receptor recruitment that is dependent on protein synthesis. The expression of GnRH receptors can be completely dissociated from gonadotropin secretion, indicating that fusion of luteinizing hormone secretory granules with the plasma membrane is not a major pathway for transport of GnRH receptors to the cell surface in cultured gonadotrophs. Such changes in cell surface GnRH receptors during activation by the peptide agonist are relevant to the alterations in gonadotroph sensitivity that occur in vivo during physiological regulation of the pituitary gland by GnRH."

https://openalex.org/W1525883680,"S1 nuclease mapping was used to assess rRNA processing in Escherichia coli. Single-stranded DNA probes complementary to the sequences bordering each terminus of 16 S and 23 S rRNA were end-labeled, hybridized to total E. coli RNA, and treated with S1 nuclease. The resultant DNA fragments were then displayed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Measurements of steady state levels of precursor rRNA species and measurements of the rates of decay of precursors after transcription arrest by rifampicin gave consistent results. 1) The rRNA precursor species identified in wild type cells corresponded to those previously identified by other means. 2) In RNase III-deficient strains, mature 16 S rRNA termini form at the same rate as in wild type cells; but the normal mature termini of 23 S rRNA are never generated. 3) RNase III cleavage at the 5' end of 23 S rRNA can occur before the 3' end of the same molecule is synthesized. 4) The cleavages that generate the mature termini of 16 S rRNA are interdependent; in the BUMMER strain, slow processing at the 5' end is accompanied by slow processing at the 3' end. Thus, the kinetically observed order of processing reactions is obligate for some cleavages but not for others, and the assumption that complete rRNA processing is required for function fails for 23 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1981834860,"Isotype switching at the pre-B cell stage was studied by employing A-MuLV-transformed cell lines. Two γ2b-producing cell lines that did not have other cytoplasmic heavy chains or light chains were established from A-MuLV-transformed cell lines. One clone (SL2-1-52) arose spontaneously from a non-Ig-producing cell line (SL2-1) during in vitro culture. Another clone (AT11-2-24-6-99) underwent isotype switching from a μ-producing cell line (AT11-2-24-6), which had been derived from another non-lg-producing line (AT11-2). Southern blot analysis of two γ2b-producing clones was performed in comparison to that of their respective parent clones. The results showed that isotype switching can operate at the stage of pre-B cells by a CH gene deletion mechanism without utilizing the switch region. In addition, the possibility is presented that deletion of the intervening CH genes could occur prior to the formation of the functional V region-coding DNA segment. This indicates that the prior expression of μ chains is not obligatory for the expression of other isotypes and that isotype commitment could occur in pre-B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526535713,"A rat medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line, CA-77, has been established as a model system for investigating calcitonin biosynthesis and secretion. Growth of this cell line in serum-free defined medium provided suitable conditions for studying steroid hormone effects on the production of calcitonin and related peptides. After exposure for 5 days to a variety of steroids, only dexamethasone and corticosterone increased cellular content of calcitonin and a second secretory peptide (CCAP) derived from the same mRNA translation product as calcitonin. Glucocorticoids had no effect on cellular somatostatin, another secretory product of these cells. Increasing doses of dexamethasone progressively elevated cellular calcitonin and CCAP, with a maximal effect at 10(-8) M; 10(-9) M and lower doses were ineffective. On a molar basis, corticosterone was approximately 50-fold less potent than the synthetic glucocorticoid. An increase in cellular calcitonin content was observed only after 48 h of glucocorticoid treatment; a maximum increase (13-fold) occurred after 7 days. Glucocorticoids also increased basal calcitonin secretion. Similar effects were observed for cellular and secreted CCAP. Withdrawal of dexamethasone after 4 days of treatment lowered cellular calcitonin toward the level of control cultures. Dexamethasone pretreatment potentiated the acute secretory response to calcium for both calcitonin and CCAP, while no such enhancement was noted for calcium stimulation of somatostatin secretion. We conclude that the glucocorticoids specifically stimulate the production and secretion of calcitonin and CCAP, two secretory peptides derived from preprocalcitonin."
https://openalex.org/W2051057409,"The expression of several trypanosome surface antigen genes proceeds by duplication of a basic copy (BC) of the gene and transposition of the expression-linked copy (ELC) into an expression site. This site, which seems to be the same for different genes of the same repertoire, is located near a chromosome end. In the AnTat 1.1 antigen gene expression site, the ELC is found associated with another sequence that we have called the ""companion."" We found that this companion is the transposed copy of another sequence also located in an unstable DNA terminus, and that it is conserved in the expression site of AnTat 1.10 and AnTat 1.1B, two clones successively derived from AnTat 1.1. The companion sequence is not part of the surface antigen gene, but we may infer from extensive homologies with another ELC sequence (IoTat 1.3, J. E. Donelson, personal communication) that it represents a 5' residual fragment of a former ELC. In three other AnTat 1.1-like clones, the companion sequence was not found associated with the ELC. It is concluded that the expression-linked duplicative transposition of variable antigen genes is a flexible mechanism, which can apply to variably sized stretches of the same BC."
https://openalex.org/W1550982355,"An enzyme system catalyzing the synthesis of thiamin triphosphate consists of an enzyme (protein-bound thiamin diphosphate:ATP phosphoryltransferase), thiamin diphosphate bound to a macromolecule as substrate, ATP, Mg2+, and a low molecular weight cofactor. This system was established by combining a purified enzyme and an essentially pure, macromolecule-bound substrate prepared from rat livers. This macromolecule was found to be a protein, and the transphosphorylation of thiamin diphosphate to thiamin triphosphate with ATP and enzyme was shown to occur on this macromolecule which binds thiamin diphosphate. Free thiamin, thiamin monophosphate, thiamin diphosphate, and thiamin triphosphate have no effect on this reaction. Thus, the overall reaction is: thiamin diphosphate-protein + ATP in equilibrium thiamin triphosphate-protein + ADP. So-called thiamin diphosphate:ATP phosphoryltransferase (EC 2.7.4.15) activity was not detected in rat brain or liver. The enzyme was extracted from acetone powder of a crude mitochondrial fraction of bovine brain cortex and purified to homogeneity with a 0.6% yield after DEAE-cellulose chromatography, a first gel filtration, hydroxylapatite chromatography, chromatofocusing, and a second gel filtration. The purified enzyme showed a single protein band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 103,000. The pH optimum was 7.5, and the Km was determined to be 6 X 10(-4) M for ATP. ATP was found to be the most effective phosphate donor among the nucleoside triphosphates. Amino acid analysis of the purified enzyme revealed an abundance of glutaminyl, glutamyl, and aspartyl residues. Sulfhydryl reagents inhibited the enzyme reaction. Metals such as Fe2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ strongly inhibited the activity. The enzyme was unstable, and glycerol (20%) and dithiothreitol (1.0 mM) were found to preserve the enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1566863343,"The effects of a single molecularly cloned subspecies of human leukocyte interferon (IFN-alpha A) on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) macromolecular synthesis in human amnion U cells were examined. IFN-alpha A was found to uniformly inhibit VSV protein synthesis to an extent sufficient to account for the overall inhibition of viral infectivity. IFN-alpha A treatment also prevented the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis observed in untreated, VSV-infected U cells. By use of the VSV mutant tsG41, which is competent in RNA transcription but defective in RNA replication at 40 degrees C, it was shown that IFN did not significantly inhibit the accumulation of VSV primary transcripts, although the in vivo translation of primary viral transcripts was greatly impaired as a function of IFN treatment. Thus, the major, and possibly only, effect of IFN-alpha A on VSV replication was translation inhibition. Analysis of RNA, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis after denaturation with glyoxal, with cDNA probes to individual VSV mRNAs, did not reveal any detectable difference in the structural integrity of VSV mRNA isolated from IFN-treated as compared to untreated cells. Likewise, in vitro protein synthesis did not reveal any major difference in the functional integrity of VSV mRNA isolated from IFN-treated as compared to untreated U cells. Viral mRNA isolated from either wild type or tsG41-infected U cells treated with IFN was translated only slightly less efficiently in vitro than viral mRNA from untreated cells. Thus, the principal cause of the IFN-induced inhibition of viral protein synthesis observed in vivo appears to be an alteration of a component of the translational machinery other than the mRNA template."
https://openalex.org/W1574934339,"The structural gene for herpes simplex virus (type 1) thymidine kinase was cloned downstream from the lambda phage high efficiency leftward promotor in a plasmid (pHETK2) also containing the gene for the lambda cI857 temperature-sensitive repressor. Thymidine kinase is synthesized as a run-on product containing the NH2 terminus of the lambda N protein. Heat inactivation of the lambda repressor by growth at 42 degrees C results in the accumulation of thymidine kinase as approximately 4% of the total soluble cellular protein. Thymidine kinase has been purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by high speed centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and Sephadex G-100 and hydroxylapatite column chromatography. Thymidine kinase has a subunit Mr = 42,000 determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and behaves as a dimer during Sephadex G-100 chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation. Thymidine kinase is enzymatically active from pH 6 to 10 with maximum activity at pH 8.5. The enzyme is protected from heat inactivation by thymidine and has a half-life at 40 degrees C of 30 min in the presence of thymidine and 3 min in its absence. Thymidine kinase displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent Michaelis constants of 0.6 and 118 microM for thymidine and ATP, respectively. Iododeoxycytidine is a competitive inhibitor of thymidine with an apparent Ki of 14 microM. The anti-herpes drug acyclovir (9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine) also appears to be a competitive inhibitor of thymidine (Ki of approximately 300 microM) but requires 3,000-fold higher concentrations than thymidine to give 50% inhibition. Other nucleoside triphosphates can substitute for ATP in the kinase reaction with the exception of dTTP which appears to inhibit thymidine kinase activity by about 50% when present in concentrations equal to that of thymidine."
https://openalex.org/W1586632187,"There are two functionally and physically distinct types of guanyl nucleotide site associated with the adenylate cyclase system of pigeon erythrocytes. One is on the well known regulatory protein, N, that mediates the adenylate cyclase response to hormones, guanyl nucleotides and fluoride, and is the substrate for ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin. We now describe a second site that must be occupied by GTP or an analog of GTP before N can be ADP-ribosylated. We call this second site S. It differs from the site on N in many respects. GTP appears to be rapidly hydrolyzed when it is bound to N but not when bound at S. GTP analogs such as guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) bind stably to both sites but the binding of GTP gamma S to N is more sensitive to EDTA and is more easily prevented by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). The nucleotide binding only to S is promoted by the cytosolic protein required by cholera toxin. Isoproterenol decreases GTP gamma S binding to S while indirectly increasing GTP gamma S binding to N. By adjusting the binding conditions, the nucleotides bound functionally to N and S can be varied independently and then the effect of ADP-ribosylation upon the adenylate cyclase activity can be seen to depend on the type of nucleotide bound to N. This activity rises, falls slightly, or remains at zero, if N is occupied by GTP, GTP gamma S, or guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1547489092,"The studies presented in this communication describe the existence of a pH-dependent kinetic barrier in amine translocation in membrane vesicles isolated from chromaffin granules from bovine adrenal medulla. This barrier prevents efflux of amines previously accumulated in the membrane vesicles. In these preparations, once the amine is accumulated, there is no further need for ATP. This would suggest a low permeability of the membrane, both to ions and to the amine. In addition, we show that under conditions which thermodynamically favour efflux this is kinetically blocked. This block is due to a rapid protonation of the transporter in the interior of the vesicle. Net efflux can be induced by agents that bring upon an alkalinization of the internal pH such as ammonium salts or nigericin. On the other hand, the rate of exchange with extravesicular substrate is almost identical at the various pH values tested. The physiological implications of this mechanism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1589462468,"A segment of the type II procollagen gene has been isolated by screening a lambda Charon 4A library containing fragments of chicken genomic DNA. The specific clone, LgCOL(II), was selected by hybridization using overlapping inserts from two cDNA clones which are specific for a cartilage procollagen (Vuorio, E., Sandell, L., Kravis, D., Sheffield, V. C., Vuorio, T., Dorfman, A., and Upholt, W. B. (1982) Nucleic Acids Res. 10, 1175-1192). DNA sequence analysis of LgCOL(II) in the COOH-telopeptide region of the protein, shows conclusively that this DNA corresponds to the chicken type II procollagen gene. Hybridization of cDNA probes to restriction fragment gel blots together with DNA sequence analysis have established the orientation and position of the procollagen gene within the lambda Charon 4A vector and indicate that LgCOL(II) contains approximately 6 kilobase pairs of the type II procollagen gene plus additional DNA flanking the 3' end of the gene. DNA sequence analysis shows directly that LgCOL(II) contains DNA sequences identical with those in the cDNA clones. The portion of the gene from amino acid 578 of the triple helical region to the COOH-terminal end of the protein (approximately 700 amino acids) is contained within the clone, corresponding to approximately 50% of the amino acid coding sequence of the gene. This region of the chicken alpha 1 (type II) procollagen gene is encoded within a shorter segment of the chicken genome than is the corresponding region of the alpha 2(type I) procollagen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1524085286,"We examined effects of ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide on the regulation and apparent thermodynamic properties of moderate affinity Na+ and K+ binding that regulates the K+-dependent phosphatase activity of (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Ethanol and other alcohols reduced the apparent affinity for Na+ and K+ at their moderate affinity sites and increased the negative delta H and delta S of cation binding. Dimethyl sulfoxide had the opposite effects. Inhibition by ethanol was favored by high temperature or low K+. Ethanol potentiated inhibition of K+ binding by ATP or Mg2+. Ethanol also shifted the equilibrium between K+-sensitive and -insensitive forms of (Na+,K+)-ATPase toward the K+-sensitive form; in this case, it reduced the negative delta H and delta S for the transition to K+-sensitive enzyme. Again, dimethyl sulfoxide had the opposite effects. These data indicate that ethanol and other agents considered to affect membrane fluidity act by a combination of membrane (on cation binding) and solvent (on conformation) effects. The most important effect of ethanol and similar agents on the enzyme is to prevent the formation of K+-sensitive enzyme by cation binding and to destabilize K+-sensitive enzyme in the presence of ATP. These results also add further evidence that the sites by which Na+ and K+ produce K+-sensitive enzyme are similar or identical."
https://openalex.org/W1599498288,"Fluorescent derivatives of scorpion toxin V from Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus have been prepared so that the topographical, dynamic, and cellular properties of the neurotoxin receptor site on the voltage-dependent sodium channel could be studied. Four different modification strategies have been pursued in which acylated, amidinylated, thio-amidinylated, and reductively alkylated scorpion toxins were prepared. Acylation induces a loss of net positive charge on the toxin and these derivatives are purified by preparative isoelectric focusing and ion-exchange chromatography. Amidinylation and reductive alkylation preserve the protonation state of the toxin and maintain the native tertiary structure of the toxin. Because the native toxin does not contain cysteine, we have introduced new sulfhydryls through modification with the cyclic imidoester 2-iminothiolane which also preserves the net charge on the toxin. Novel purification methods with small amounts of toxin by immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed against the chromophores or through covalent thiol-disulfide exchange chromatography have been utilized. The biological activities, equilibrium binding, and spectroscopic properties indicate that these derivatives retain high affinity for the sodium channel and are as active or only 2-3 times less active than L. quinquestriatus V toxin itself. The spectroscopic properties of these fluorescent derivatives cover the absorption range from 290 to 470 nm, and fluorescence emissions range from 360 to 550 nm where suitable filters and spectral overlap with previously synthesized fluorescent tetrodotoxin can be found. The fluorescent properties in particular show excellent environmental sensitivity and are suitable for probing the molecular dynamics of the toxin receptor and for topographic mapping of the sodium channel by fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1511136758,"The molecular basis of the inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication by pure recombinant gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) in human amnion U cells was examined. A saturating concentration of IFN-gamma induced, at maximum, about a two log10 reduction in infectious VSV yield. The kinetics of induction of the antiviral activity by IFN-gamma were first order over the period of about 6-18 h, following a lag of about 3 h, after treatment with a saturating concentration of IFN-gamma. The relationship of the inhibition in VSV infectivity to the early and late events of the VSV multiplication cycle was investigated. IFN-gamma treatment had no detectable effect on the adsorption and penetration of VSV virions or on their uncoating to yield viral nucleocapsids. The polypeptides of adsorbed or uncoated VSV particles were neither preferentially degraded nor detectably altered in IFN-gamma-treated U cells, as compared to untreated U cells. Progeny virions isolated from IFN-gamma-treated U cells, although greatly reduced in number, were found to be equally as infectious as those isolated from untreated U cells. Progeny virions from IFN-gamma-treated cells also possessed the same composition of viral proteins as was observed for virions from untreated cells. These results suggest that conditions of IFN-gamma treatment sufficient to reduce the yield of infectious VSV progeny 100-fold do not detectably affect either the early or the late stages of the VSV multiplication cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1588499217,"Abstract The Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus receptor site of the voltage-dependent sodium channel has been characterized using several fluorescent scorpion toxins. The derivatives show fluorescence enhancements upon binding to the receptor site on the channel together with blue shifts. The fluorescence properties of the bound probes indicate a conformationally flexible, hydrophobic site. Binding of tetrodotoxin has no effect on the fluorescence spectra of the bound derivatives, whereas binding of the allosteric activator batrachotoxin enhances the fluorescence about 2-fold and causes a red shift in the emission spectra, suggesting a batrachotoxin-induced conformational change in the scorpion toxin receptor. The distance between the tetrodotoxin receptor and the Leiurus scorpion toxin receptor on the channel was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Five different chromophoric scorpion toxin derivatives were used as energy transfer acceptors or donors with anthraniloyltetrodotoxin or N-methylanthraniloylglycine-tetrodotoxin as the energy donor or acceptor. Because of the presence of three tetrodotoxin receptors for each Leiurus receptor, the positions of the donors and acceptors were exchanged. Efficiencies of transfer were measured by both donor quenching and sensitized emission. The average distance of separation between these sites is 35 A. Upon batrachotoxin addition, this distance changes to 42 A indicating a conformational change in one subunit of the channel or a change in the interaction between two subunits coupled to the batrachotoxin-binding site. On the basis of these studies, we present a model suggesting that tetrodotoxin binds to a subunit/site which is extracellularly placed and is 35 A from the Leiurus subunit/site which is located in a protein cleft of the channel which extends partly into the membrane, and undergoes a neurotoxin and voltage-dependent conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1545618568,"We have purified the arrow poison extracted from Diamphidia nigro-ornata pupae by the !Kung Bushmen of Southern Africa, and named it diamphotoxin. The toxin is a single chain polypeptide of Mr = 60,000 with an isoelectric point of pH 9.5. It blocks neuromuscular function and is cardiotoxic and hemolytic, and the minimum lethal dose for mice is 25 pg (less than 0.5 fmol). The toxin binds tightly to cells, permitting the resolution of two distinct phases. Erythrocytes exposed to toxin in the absence of divalent cations show no apparent lesion (phase I). After washing and addition of 1 mM Ca2+, there occurs a rapid efflux of K+ followed by the loss of hemoglobin (phase II). The pH optimum for phase I is pH 6.7 and for phase II pH 8.6. The action of the toxin is noncatalytic, requiring a solution concentration of approximately 65 toxin molecules/cell for hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes under standard conditions. Ca2+ ions induce a conformational change in the free, purified toxin molecule. We propose that this change also occurs in membrane-bound toxin. Hemolysis would result from the formation of channels permitting the diffusion of small cations."
https://openalex.org/W1606153755,"Fatty acid synthetase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a multifunctional enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of long chain fatty acids from acetyl- and malonyl-CoA. The enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits, alpha (Mr = 212,000) and beta (Mr = 203,000), which are coded for by two unlinked genes FAS2 and FAS1, respectively. Individual yeast strains containing mutations in either of the FAS genes were transformed with a bank of yeast DNA sequences in the vector YEp13. Plasmids YEpFAS1 and YEpFAS2 were selected by their ability to complement the fas1 or fas2 mutations, respectively. Additionally, we utilized an immunologic screening of a second yeast DNA bank and selected two clones 33F1 and 102B5 which produce antigenically reactive material to anti-yeast fatty acid synthetase antibodies. Through Southern hybridization experiments and restriction endonuclease mapping, a region of 5.3 kilobase pairs of 33F1 was shown to be homologous with YEpFAS1, and a span of 3.4 kilobase pairs of 102B5 was homologous with YEpFAS2. These experiments identify the yeast DNA sequences cloned into 33F1 as originating from the FAS1 gene and those DNA sequences in 102B5, from the FAS2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2153468978,"Heteroduplexes were formed between SV40 replication origin-containing DNA fragments derived from wild-type genomic DNA and a viral deletion mutant (dl295) lacking 18 base pairs from a 27 bp inverted repeat that is imbedded within the minimal replication origin sequence. Among these structures were molecules bearing a 7 bp stem and a 3 nucleotide loop on the wild-type strand between nucleotides 5230 and 6. By nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, heteroduplex molecules bearing such a structure on the E-strand could be separated from those with the complementary structure on the L-strand, and either heteroduplex could be so separated from either the wild-type or dl295 homoduplex fragment. Each of these forms was singly 5' or 3' end-labeled and then evaluated as a target for specific binding to purified SV40 large T antigen isolated from wild-type virus-infected cells. The results of DNAase footprint protection analyses showed that the existence of both the E- and L-strand stem-loop structures inhibited T binding to site 2 which composes much of the minimal origin sequence. By contrast, T bound readily to this site in both homoduplexes. Furthermore, T protected both E- and L-strand sequences of its strongest binding site (site 1)--which abuts the early side of site 2--when the site 2 stem-loop was on the L-strand, and protected L-strand site 1 sequences normally when the stem-loop was on the E-strand. However, a marked alteration of binding to site 1 E-strand sequences was noted when the stem-loop was on the E-strand. Thus this alteration in replication origin secondary structure resulted in discrete local and vicinal effects on T binding. Furthermore, the results suggest that within site 1--a sequence employed as an early transcriptional regulatory locus--T antigen can bind specifically and tightly to one strand without exhibiting similar behavior on the other strand."

To analyze the fidelity of intranuclear ligations, DNA molecules with a variety of protruding ends or flush ends were co-injected into env-deficient Rous sarcoma virus-infected (RSV(-] cells. Two fragments were chosen which could complement the RSV(-) env deficiency upon ligation. This sensitive biological assay indicated that intracellular ligation between molecules with complementary protruding ends or flush ends was relatively efficient. Ligation was not observed with non-complementary termini. Furthermore, when multiple DNA molecules possessing a variety of protruding termini were introduced into the cells, complementary termini were selectively joined. Finally, when viral DNAs which expressed separate genetic markers were co-injected, almost 50% of the virus subsequently released were recombinants, indicating that ligations generally involved multiple molecules."
