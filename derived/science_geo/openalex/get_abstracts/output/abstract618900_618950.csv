https://openalex.org/W2892789302,"Mammals represent the largest-bodied elements of the world’s surviving megafauna and provide several key ecosystems services, yet their populations are often under steep decline throughout the tropics. Anthropogenic defaunation is one the most important contemporary threats to modern mammal faunas. Although the Atlantic Forest biome of South America shows several clear signs of defaunation, the extent to which this biome has lost its mammal fauna remains poorly understood. Here, we collate and analyze a comprehensive body of secondary data to quantitatively assess the spatial patterns of defaunation of all medium- to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals which were then classed by morpho-ecological traits. We used a Defaunation Index, which was scaled-up to the entire biome using kriging interpolation, to examine the integrity of site-specific mammal faunas. We further use environmental and socioeconomic predictors to explain the drivers of defaunation. Our results show high levels of defaunation (>0.5) for most of the Atlantic Forest. Apex predators, other carnivores, large-bodied mammals and large herbivores were among the most defaunated functional groups. Remaining native vegetation cover, forest fragment size, and the largest neighboring forest remnant were the main negative predictors of defaunation. We conclude that medium- to large-bodied Atlantic Forest mammals are under high levels of threat due to historical population losses that continue today. A conservation action plan thus becomes imperative to prevent this biome from becoming an even “emptier forest”, severely compromising patterns of diversity, ecological processes and ecosystem functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2893778871,"Epilepsy is often associated with modifications in autonomic nervous system, which usually precede the onset of seizures of several minutes. Thus, there is a great interest in identifying these modifications enough time in advance to prevent a dangerous effect and to intervene. In addition, these changes can be a risk factor for epileptic patients and can increase the possibility of death. Notably autonomic changes associated to seizures are highly depended of seizure type, localization and lateralization. The aim of this study was to develop a patient-specific approach to predict seizures using electrocardiogram (ECG) features. Specifically, from the RR series, both time and frequency variables and features obtained by the recurrence quantification analysis were used. The algorithm was applied in a dataset of 15 patients with 38 different types of seizures. A feature selection step, was used to identify those features that were more significant in discriminating preictal and interictal phases. A preictal interval of 15 minutes was selected. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was then built to classify preictal and interictal phases. First, a classifier was set up to classify preictal and interictal segments of each patient and an average sensibility of 89.06% was obtained, with a number of false positive per hour (FP/h) of 0.41. Then, in those patients who had at least 3 seizures, a double-cross-validation approach was used to predict unseen seizures on the basis of a training on previous ones. The results were quite variable according to seizure type, achieving the best performance in patients with more stereotypical seizure. The results of the proposed approach show that it is feasible to predict seizure in advance, considering patient-specific, and possible seizure specific, characteristics."

However, the actual risks for healthcare-seeking for these stress-related mental health problems among nurses are still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the risks and influencing factors of treated anxiety, depression, and insomnia among nurses. We used claims data obtained from the 2010 National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. Hospital nurses who had at least 3 coded ambulatory care claims or 1 inpatient claim with a principal diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or insomnia were identified. A cohort of 46,120 nurses and 92,240 matched controls were included. All the study subjects were followed up until the onset of any of the aforementioned outcomes, death, or the end of 2012. Results showed that the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for treated anxiety, depression, and insomnia among all the nurses were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88–0.95), 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55–0.63), and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.38–1.48), respectively. Furthermore, the risks of these psychiatric problems in healthcare-seeking nurses were affected by age, gender, hospital level, and job tenure. Our findings suggest that hospital nurses have lower hazards of treated anxiety and depression than the general population, although they have a higher hazard of treated insomnia. There may be undertreatment in some subgroups of nurses with different demographic and working characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2893314247,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are currently used for the therapeutic management of cholestatic diseases, but their use and molecular mechanism remain controversial. The aims of this study were 1) to assess the therapeutic effect of a 2-week treatment with the GC dexamethasone on hepatic damage in bile duct-ligated rats; 2) to investigate its effect on the activation of the nuclear receptors (NRs) pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and GC receptor (GR), and NF-kB, as well as on oxidative stress and bile acid (BA) hepatic composition. Cholestasis was induced by ligation of bile duct (BDL animals) in 16 male Wistar-Kyoto rats, and eight of them were daily treated by oral gavage with 0.125 mg/ml/kg DEX for 14 days. Eight Sham-operated rats were used as controls. Severity of cholestasis was assessed histologically and on plasma biochemical parameters. The nuclear expression of NF-kB (p65), GR, PXR and CAR was measured in hepatic tissue by Western Blot. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde, carbonylated proteins, GHS and ROS content in rat livers. LC-MS was used to measure the plasma and liver concentration of 7 BAs. Histological findings and a significant drop in several markers of inflammation (p65 nuclear translocation, mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) showed that DEX treatment reversed cholestasis-induced inflammation, and similar results have been obtained with oxidative stress markers. The nuclear expression of p65 and CAR were inversely correlated, with the latter increasing significantly after DEX treatment (p<0.01 vs vehicle). Hepatic BA levels tended to drop in the untreated cholestatic rats, whereas they were similar to those of healthy rats in DEX-treated animals. Plasma BAs decreased significantly in DEX-treated animals with respect to untreated cholestatic rats. In conclusion, DEX reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in BDL rats, and probably CAR is responsible for this effect. Therefore, this NR represents a promising pharmacological target for managing cholestatic and inflammatory liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2893045577,"Our understanding of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions improved substantially during the last years. Nevertheless, there are still large uncertainties of processes controlling plant carbon investment into BVOCs, of some biosynthetic pathways and their linkage to CO2 decarboxylation at central metabolic branching points. To shed more light on carbon partitioning during BVOC biosynthesis, we used an innovative approach combining δ13CO2 laser spectroscopy, high-sensitivity proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry and a multiple branch enclosure system in combination with position-specific 13C-metabolite labelling. Feeding experiments with position-specific 13C-labelled pyruvate, a central metabolite of BVOC synthesis, enabled online detection of carbon partitioning into 13C-BVOCs and respiratory 13CO2. Measurements of trace gas emissions of the Mediterranean shrub Halimium halimifolium revealed a broad range of emitted BVOCs. In general, [2-13C]-PYR was rapidly incorporated into emitted acetic acid, methyl acetate, toluene, cresol, trimethylbenzene, ethylphenol, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, indicating de novo BVOC biosynthesis of these compounds. In contrast, [1-13C]-pyruvate labelling substantially increased 13CO2 emissions in the light indicating C1-decarboxylation. Similar labelling patterns of methyl acetate and acetic acid suggested tightly connected biosynthetic pathways and, furthermore, there were hints of possible biosynthesis of benzenoids via the MEP-pathway. Overall, substantial CO2 emission from metabolic branching points during de novo BVOC biosynthesis indicated that decarboxylation of [1-13C]-pyruvate, as a non-mitochondrial source of CO2, seems to contribute considerably to daytime CO2 release from leaves. Our approach, combining synchronised BVOC and CO2 measurements in combination with position-specific labelling opens the door for real-time analysis tracing metabolic pathways and carbon turnover under different environmental conditions, which may enhance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms in plant carbon metabolism and BVOC biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2893143447,"Frequently, port scans are early indicators of more serious attacks. Unfortunately, the detection of slow port scans in company networks is challenging due to the massive amount of network data. This paper proposes an innovative approach for preprocessing flow-based data which is specifically tailored to the detection of slow port scans. The preprocessing chain generates new objects based on flow-based data aggregated over time windows while taking domain knowledge as well as additional knowledge about the network structure into account. The computed objects are used as input for the further analysis. Based on these objects, we propose two different approaches for detection of slow port scans. One approach is unsupervised and uses sequential hypothesis testing whereas the other approach is supervised and uses classification algorithms. We compare both approaches with existing port scan detection algorithms on the flow-based CIDDS-001 data set. Experiments indicate that the proposed approaches achieve better detection rates and exhibit less false alarms than similar algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2893426323,"MYB transcription factors are important regulators of the plant response to abiotic stress. Their participation in the salinity stress of the key forage legume species alfalfa (Medicago sativa) was investigated here by comparing the transcriptomes of the two cultivars Dryland (DL) and Sundory (SD), which differed with respect to their ability to tolerate salinity stress. When challenged by the stress, DL plants were better able than SD ones to scavenge reactive oxygen species. A large number of genes encoding transcription regulators, signal transducers and proteins involved in both primary and secondary metabolism were differentially transcribed in the two cultivars, especially when plants were subjected to salinity stress. The set of induced genes included 17 MYB family of transcription factors, all of which were subsequently isolated. The effect of constitutively expressing these genes on the salinity tolerance expressed by Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. The introduction of MsMYB4 significantly increased the plants’ salinity tolerance in an abscisic acid-dependent manner. A sub-cellular localization experiment and a transactivation assay indicated that MsMYB4 was deposited in the nucleus and was able to activate transcription in yeast. Based on this information, we propose that the MsMYB4 products is likely directly involved in alfalfa’s response to salinity stress."
https://openalex.org/W2892405815,"Fibrillar type I collagen, the predominant organic component in bone, is stabilized by lysyl oxidase (LOX)-initiated covalent intermolecular cross-linking, an important determinant of bone quality. However, the impact of collagen cross-linking on the activity of bone cells and subsequent tissue remodeling is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of collagen cross-linking on bone cellular activities employing a loss-of-function approach, using a potent LOX inhibitor, β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). Osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) were cultured for 2 weeks in the presence of 0-2 mM BAPN to obtain low cross-linked collagen matrices. The addition of BAPN to the cultures diminished collagen cross-links in a dose-dependent manner and, at 1 mM level, none of the major cross-links were detected without affecting collagen production. After the removal of cellular components from these cultures, MC3T3-E1, osteoclasts (RAW264.7), or mouse primary bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) were seeded. MC3T3-E1 cells grown on low cross-link matrices showed increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The number of multinucleate tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells increased in RAW264.7 cells. Initial adhesion, proliferation, and ALP activity of BMSCs also increased. In the animal experiments, 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed with BAPN-containing diet for 8 weeks. At this point, biochemical analysis of bone demonstrated that collagen cross-links decreased without affecting collagen content. Then, the diet was changed to a control diet to minimize the direct effect of BAPN. At 2 and 4 weeks after the change, histological samples were prepared. Histological examination of femur samples at 4 weeks showed a significant increase in the number of bone surface osteoblasts, while the bone volume and surface osteoclast numbers were not significantly affected. These results clearly demonstrated that the extent of collagen cross-linking of bone matrix affected the differentiation of bone cells, underscoring the importance of collagen cross-linking in the regulation of cell behaviors and tissue remodeling in bone. Characterization of collagen cross-linking in bone may be beneficial to obtain insight into not only bone mechanical property, but also bone cellular activities."
https://openalex.org/W2952545524,"Influenza is a global problem infecting 5-10% of adults and 20-30% of children annually. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are attractive approaches to complement vaccination in the prevention and reduction of influenza. Strong cyclical reduction of absolute humidity has been associated with influenza outbreaks in temperate climates. This study tested the hypothesis that raising absolute humidity above seasonal lows would impact influenza virus survival and transmission in a key source of influenza virus distribution, a community school. Air samples and objects handled by students (e.g. blocks and markers) were collected from preschool classrooms. All samples were processed and PCR used to determine the presence of influenza virus and its amount. Additionally samples were tested for their ability to infect cells in cultures. We observed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the total number of influenza A virus positive samples (air and fomite) and viral genome copies upon humidification as compared to control rooms. This suggests the future potential of artificial humidification as a possible strategy to control influenza outbreaks in temperate climates. There were 2.3 times as many ILI cases in the control rooms compared to the humidified rooms, and whether there is a causal relationship, and its direction between the number of cases and levels of influenza virus in the rooms is not known. Additional research is required, but this is the first prospective study suggesting that exogenous humidification could serve as a scalable NPI for influenza or other viral outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2892891311,"Metformin use is restricted in patients with renal impairment due to potential excess systemic accumulation. This study evaluated the glycemic effects and safety of metformin delayed-release (Metformin DR), which targets metformin delivery to the ileum to leverage its gut-based mechanisms of action while minimizing systemic exposure.Participants (T2DM [HbA1c 7-10.5%], eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2, not taking metformin for ≥2 months) were randomized to QD placebo (PBO); QD Metformin DR 600, 900, 1200, or 1500 mg; or to single-blind BID Metformin immediate-release (IR) 1000 mg. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c for Metformin DR vs. PBO at 16 weeks in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (≥ 1 post-baseline HbA1c while on study drug), using a mixed-effects repeated measures model.571 subjects were randomized (56 years, 53% male, 80% white; BMI 32.2±5.5 kg/m2; HbA1c 8.6±0.9%; 51% metformin naive); 542 were in the mITT population. Metformin DR 1200 and 1500 mg significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.49±0.13% and -0.62±0.12%, respectively, vs. PBO -0.06±0.13%; p<0.05) and FPG (Caverage Weeks 4-16: -22.3±4.2 mg/dL and -25.1±4.1 mg/dL, respectively vs. -2.5±4.2 mg/dL p<0.05). Metformin IR elicited greater HbA1c improvement (-1.10±0.13%; p<0.01 vs. Placebo and all doses of Metformin DR) but with ~3-fold greater plasma metformin exposure. Normalizing efficacy to systemic exposure, glycemic improvements with Metformin DR were 1.5-fold (HbA1c) and 2.1-fold (FPG) greater than Metformin IR. Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal but these were less frequent with Metformin DR (<16% incidence) vs. Metformin IR (28%), particularly nausea (1-3% vs 10%).Metformin DR exhibited greater efficacy per unit plasma exposure than Metformin IR. Future studies will evaluate the effects of Metformin DR in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced renal disease.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02526524."
https://openalex.org/W2893120696,"In plant cells, many stresses, including low oxygen availability, result in a higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). These molecules can lead to redox-dependent post-translational modification of proteins Cys residues. Here, we studied the effect of different redox modifications on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Arabidopsis thaliana. ADH catalyzes the last step of the ethanol fermentation pathway used by plants to cope with energy deficiency during hypoxic stress. Arabidopsis suspension cell cultures showed decreased ADH activity upon exposure to H2O2, but not to the thiol oxidizing agent diamide. We purified recombinant ADH and observed a significant decrease in the enzyme activity by treatments with H2O2 and diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO). Treatments leading to the formation of a disulfide bond between ADH and glutathione (protein S-glutathionylation) had no negative effect on the enzyme activity. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that Cys47 and Cys243 could make a stable disulfide bond with glutathione, suggesting redox sensitivity of these residues. Mutation of ADH Cys47 to Ser caused an almost complete loss of the enzyme activity while the Cys243 to Ser mutant had increased specific activity. Incubation of ADH with NAD+ or NADH prevented inhibition of the enzyme by H2O2 or DEA/NO. These results suggest that binding of ADH with its cofactors may limit availability of Cys residues to redox modifications. Our study demonstrates that ADH from A. thaliana is subject to different redox modifications. Implications of ADH sensitivity to ROS and RNS during hypoxic stress conditions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2893268249,"Background Anemia is recognized as a major public health problem in childhood, especially in children under 24 months of age. Despite improvements in public health strategies to prevent and control anemia in Brazilian young children in the last decade, few studies have assessed the predictors for this condition in primary health care. Thus, this study aimed to assess the associated factors of anemia in young children who visited primary public health care facilities in Brazil. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 520 children aged 11 to 15 months who visited the primary health care in four Brazilian cities. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration < 110 g/L in venous blood samples. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to describe the associations between anemia and independent variables. Results The frequency of anemia was 23.1%. A higher frequency was observed in children who live with more than one other child younger than 5 years in the house (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 1.47; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.01–2.14), who started to receive fruits and vegetables after 8 months of age (PR 1.92; 95% CI 1.19–3.10), who were stunted (PR 2.44; 95% CI 1.32–4.50), who were hospitalized at least once in their life (PR 1.55; 95% CI 1.03–2.33) and who were in the lower tertile of serum folate concentration (PR 2.24; 95% CI 1.30–3.85). Conclusions Inadequate complementary feeding practices and morbidity were the main predictors for anemia in early childhood in this population. Improvements in current strategies to promote healthy complementary feeding along with better control of morbidities are recommended to reduce anemia in Brazilian young children."
https://openalex.org/W2892485105,"Background Early diagnosis and adequate treatment of Group A streptococcal throat infection is an important initial stage in the primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. This preventable condition associated with high mortality rates mandates a thorough understanding by the general public and the health. Objective The aim of the study was to assess the level of awareness about different aspects of rheumatic heart disease in patients coming to the outpatient department of the Buea regional Hospital, South West region of Cameroon. Methods This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried in the outpatient department of the Buea Regional Hospital, Cameroon. The study population was adults and children aged 9 years and above. Data collection was done by using a self-administered questionnaire addressed to assess awareness on rheumatic heart disease. Results A total of 256 participants were interviewed, of which 70 (27.3%) were males. Their mean age was 34.4 ± 11.9 years (males: 36.2 ± 12.7 years versus females: 33.7 ± 11.6 years, p = 0.129). Most of the participants were in the 20 to 29 year old group (37.9%). More than two thirds (71.1%) of the participants reported having had sore throat at least once. The disease was treated with antibiotics in only 45.4%, with the treatment prescribed by a health care professional in 35.8% of the cases. About 73% of the respondents did not know what causes sore throat, and most (71.1%) were unaware of any complications that could arise from poorly treated sore throat. More than 70% of the participants did not know that sore throat can be associated with heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease was unknown to 82% of the participants and 95% of them did not know what causes RHD. Only 5.1% percent of the participants had an adequate knowledge of RHD. Age ≤ 35 years, post-secondary level of education, and having heard of RHD were significantly associated with an adequate knowledge. After adjusting for age, post-secondary education (aOR: 9, [95% C: 1.2–67.5], p = 0.019), and having heard of RHD (aOR: 18.1, [95% CI: 4.7–70.3], p<0.001) were still associated with a fair knowledge. Conclusions Levels of knowledge and awareness on rheumatic heart disease is low. This study provides important insight into the perception and practices related to sore throat that can be used in the design of awareness activities aimed reducing the risk of RHD in Cameroon. The appropriateness of antibiotics prescribed, and the health care provider awareness and knowledge levels regarding RHD in Cameroon has not been reported yet in the literature. This grey area deserves more research."

This study investigated the perspectives and practices of stakeholders in low and lower-middle income countries towards oxytocin, its storage requirements and associated barriers, and the quality of product available.Qualitative inquiries were undertaken in Ethiopia, India and Myanmar, where data was collected through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and In-Depth Interviews (IDIs). A total of 12 FGDs and 106 IDIs were conducted with 158 healthcare providers (pharmacists, midwives, nurses, doctors and obstetricians) and 40 key informants (supply chain experts, program managers and policy-makers). Direct observations of oxytocin storage practices and cold chain resources were conducted at 51 healthcare facilities. Verbatim transcripts of FGDs and IDIs were translated to English and analysed according to a thematic content analysis framework.Stakeholder awareness of oxytocin heat sensitivity and the requirement for cold storage of the drug was widespread in Ethiopia but more limited in Myanmar and India. A consistent finding across all study regions was the significant barriers to maintaining a consistent cold chain, with the lack of refrigeration facilities and unreliability of electricity cited as major challenges. Perceptions of compromised oxytocin quality were expressed by some stakeholders in each country.Knowledge of the heat sensitivity of oxytocin and the potential impacts of inconsistent cold storage on product quality is not widespread amongst healthcare providers, policy makers and supply chain experts in Myanmar, Ethiopia and India. Targeted training and advocacy messages are warranted to emphasise the importance of cold storage to maintain oxytocin quality."
https://openalex.org/W2798825846,"The Colless index is one of the most popular and natural balance indices for bifurcating phylogenetic trees, but it makes no sense for multifurcating trees. In this paper we propose a family of Colless-like balance indices $\mathfrak{C}_{D,f}$, which depend on a dissimilarity $D$ and a function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, that generalize the Colless index to multifurcating phylogenetic trees. We provide two functions $f$ such that the most balanced phylogenetic trees according to the corresponding indices $\mathfrak{C}_{D,f}$ are exactly the fully symmetric ones. Next, for each one of these two functions $f$ and for three popular dissimilarities $D$ (the variance, the standard deviation, and the mean deviation from the median), we determine the range of values of $\mathfrak{C}_{D,f}$ on the sets of phylogenetic trees with a given number $n$ of leaves. We end the paper by assessing the performance of one of these indices on TreeBASE and using it to show that the trees in this database do not seem to follow either the uniform model for multifurcating trees or the $\alpha$-$\gamma$-model, for any values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$."
https://openalex.org/W2893078733,"Human-lion conflict is one of the leading threats to lion populations and while livestock loss is a source of conflict, the degree to which livestock depredation is tolerated by people varies between regions and across cultures. Knowledge of local attitudes towards lions and identification of drivers of human-lion conflict can help formulate mitigation measures aimed at promoting coexistence of humans with lions. We assessed locals’ attitudes towards lions in and around Gambella National Park and compared the findings with published data from Kafa Biosphere Reserve, both in western Ethiopia. We used household interviews to quantify livestock loss. We found that depredation was relatively low and that disease and theft were the top factors of livestock loss. Remarkably, however, tolerance of lions was lower around Gambella National Park than in Kafa Biosphere Reserve. Multivariate analysis revealed that education level, number of livestock per household, livestock loss due to depredation, and livestock loss due to theft were strong predictors of locals’ attitude towards lion population growth and conservation. We show that the amount of livestock depredation alone is not sufficient to understand human-lion conflicts and we highlight the importance of accounting for cultural differences in lion conservation. The low cultural value of lions in the Gambella region corroborate the findings of our study. In combination with growing human population and land-use change pressures, low cultural value poses serious challenges to long-term lion conservation in the Gambella region. We recommend using Arnstein’s ladder of participation in conservation education programs to move towards proactive involvement of locals in conservation."

The goal of the study was to examine the prevalence and severity of AD pathology in older adults without dementia who fall and sustain hip fracture. Methods Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from 168 hip fracture patients. CSF Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau, and t-tau measures were dichotomized into normal vs. abnormal, and categorized according to the A/T/N classification. Results Among the hip fracture patients, 88.6% of the cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating-CDR 0; n = 70) and 98.8% with mild cognitive impairment (CDR 0.5; n = 81) fell in the abnormal biomarker categories by the A/T/N classification. Conclusions A large proportion of older hip fracture patients have CSF evidence of AD pathology. Preoperative determination of AD biomarkers may play a crucial role in identifying persons without dementia who have underlying AD pathology in perioperative settings."
https://openalex.org/W2892447431,"The motivation to perform physical activity is a crucial factor in achieving a persistent active lifestyle. However, motivation decreases with increasing age from childhood to adolescence. The promotion of physical activity in educational settings might be an important tool to increase motivation and, consequently, to decrease sedentary behavior. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of a 4-month school-based walking intervention on motivation to participate in physical activity among Italian middle-school students. This study included 276 students (mean age 13 ± 1 years, 41.3% female). A total of 138 students (intervention group) participated in a brief walking intervention that was added to their routine daily school activity, while a convenience sample of 138 students performed the routine daily school activity. The activity consisted of walking one kilometer outside of school buildings during the morning break. Motivation data were collected before and after the walking breaks using the Participation Motivation Questionnaire (PMQ). Controlling for age, significant interactions between group and time were observed in the “Social Status” [F(1,273) = 4.851; p = 0.028], “Team” [F(1,273) = 6.015; p = 0.015] and “Energy Release” components [F(1,273) = 8.527; p = 0.038]. Specifically, a significant decrease in the “Social Status” components of the PMQ and an increase in the “Team” and “Energy Release” components were observed in the intervention group. On the contrary. control group showed an increase in “Social Status” and a decrease in the “Team” and “Energy Release” components. Within this developmental context, incorporation of the walking activity helped to modify the motivational orientation towards physical activity to include more intrinsic factors, which were related to the possibility of remaining with classmates and peer groups and releasing a surplus of energy."
https://openalex.org/W2893419375,"Viral infections cause large problems in the world and deeper understanding of the disease mechanisms is needed. Here we present an analytical strategy to investigate the host cell protein changes during human adenovirus type 2 (HAdV-C2 or Ad2) infection of lung fibroblasts by stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and nanoLC-MS/MS. This work focuses on early phase of infection (6 and 12 h post-infection (hpi)) but the data is combined with previously published late phase (24 and 36 hpi) proteomics data to produce a time series covering the complete infection. As many as 2169 proteins were quantitatively monitored from 6 to 36 hpi, while some proteins were time-specific. After applying different filter criteria, 2027 and 2150 proteins were quantified at 6 and 12 hpi and among them, 431 and 544 were significantly altered at the two time points. Pathway analysis showed that the De novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, Glycolysis and Cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPase pathways were activated early during infection while inactivation of the Integrin signalling pathway started between 6 and 12 hpi. Moreover, upstream regulator analysis predicted MYC to be activated with time of infection and protein and RNA data for genes controlled by this transcription factor showed good correlation, which validated the use of protein data for this prediction. Among the identified phosphorylation sites, a group related to glycolysis and cytoskeletal reorganization were up-regulated during infection. The results show specific aspects on how the host cell proteins, the final products in the genetic information flow, are influenced by Ad2 infection, which would be overlooked if only knowledge derived from mRNA data is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2892419479,"Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is an interventional treatment modality for inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Therapy monitoring, based on non-invasive biomarkers, is a clinical challenge. This post-hoc study aimed to assess dynamics of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) as a marker for myocardial damage and its relation to N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels as a marker for cardiac wall stress.This study included 51 consecutive patients who underwent BPA treatment and completed a 6-month follow-up (6-MFU) between 3/2014 and 3/2017. Biomarker measurement was performed consecutively prior to each BPA and at 6-MFU. In total, the 51 patients underwent an average of 5 BPA procedures. The 6-month survival rate was 96.1%. The baseline (BL) meanPAP (39.5±12.1mmHg) and PVR (515.8±219.2dyn×sec×cm-5) decreased significantly within the 6-MFU (meanPAP: 32.6±12.6mmHg, P<0.001; PVR: 396.9±182.6dyn×sec×cm-5, P<0.001). At BL, the median hs-cTnT level was 11 (IQR 6-16) ng/L and the median NT-proBNP level was 820 (IQR 153-1872) ng/L. The levels of both biomarkers decreased steadily after every BPA, showing the first significant difference after the first procedure. Within the 6-MFU, hs-cTnT levels (7 [IQR 5-12] ng/L; P<0.001) and NT-proBNP levels (159 [IQR 84-464] ng/l; P<0.001) continued to decrease. The hs-cTnT levels correlated with the PVR (rrs = 0.42; p = 0.005), the meanPAP (rrs = 0.32; p = 0.029) and the NT-proBNP (rrs = 0.51; p<0.001) levels at BL.Non-invasive biomarker measurement provides valuable evidence for the decreasing impairment of myocardial function and structure during BPA therapy. Changes in hs-cTNT levels are suggestive for a reduction in ongoing myocardial damage."
https://openalex.org/W2893475285,"Background Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well characterized among African immigrants with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We conducted a case-control study to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with HCC among a diverse cohort of patients with chronic HBV infection seen in a large academic health setting. Methods We identified a total of 278 patients with HCC and chronic HBV seen at two medical centers in a 14-year span from January 2002 to December 2015. These cases were age- and sex-matched in a 1:3 ratio with 823 non-cancer control subjects with chronic HBV. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of HCC by race, with black race stratified by African-born status, after adjusting for diabetes, HIV or HCV coinfection, alcohol misuse and cirrhosis. Results Of the 278 HCC cases, 67% were 60 years of age or older, 78% were male, 87% had cirrhosis and 72% were Asian. HIV infection was present in 6% of cases. Only 7% (19 of 278) of HCC cases were black, of whom 14 were African immigrants. The median age at HCC diagnosis was 44 years in Africans. Notably, nearly all (93%) of the African-born patients with HCC were diagnosed at an age younger than 60 years compared with 52% of Asian cases (P<0.001). The main factors independently associated with greater odds of HCC overall were Asian race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9–5.5) and cirrhosis (aOR 19.7, 95% CI 12.2–31.8). Conclusion African immigrants accounted for a small proportion of HBV-associated HCC cases overall compared with Asians but appeared to have greater likelihood of early-onset HCC. Optimal strategies for HCC prevention in these key subroups with chronic HBV warrant further study."
https://openalex.org/W2892416425,"Background Parkinson’s disease is caused by dopaminergic neurodegeneration resulting in motor impairments as slow movement speed and impaired balance and coordination. Pulsed electromagnetic fields are suggested to have neuroprotective effects, and could alleviate symptoms. Objective To study 1) effects of 8-week daily transcranial pulsed electromagnetic field treatment on functional rate of force development and movement speed during two motor tasks with different levels of complexity, 2) if treatment effects depend on motor performance at baseline. Methods Ninety-seven persons with Parkinson’s disease were randomized to active transcranial pulsed electromagnetic field (squared bipolar 3 ms pulses, 50 Hz) or placebo treatment with homebased treatment 30 min/day for 8 weeks. Functional rate of force development and completion time of a sit-to-stand and a dynamic postural balance task were assessed pre and post intervention. Participants were sub-grouped in high- and low-performers according to their baseline motor performance level. Repeated measure ANOVAs were used. Results Active treatment tended to improve rate of force development during chair rise more than placebo (P = 0.064). High-performers receiving active treatment improved rate of force development during chair rise more than high-performers receiving placebo treatment (P = 0.049, active/placebo: 11.9±1.1 to 12.5±1.9 BW/s ≈ 5% / 12.4±1.3 to 12.2±1.3 BW/s, no change). No other between-treatment-group or between-treatment-subgroup differences were found. Data on rate of force development of the dynamic balance task and completion times of both motor tasks improved but did not allow for between-treatment differentiation. Conclusion Treatment with transcranial pulsed electromagnetic fields was superior to placebo regarding functional rate of force development during chair rise among high-performers. Active treatment tended to increase functional rate of force development while placebo did not. Our results suggest that mildly affected persons with Parkinson’s disease have a larger potential for neural rehabilitation than more severely affected persons and indicate that early treatment initiation may be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2894288997,"Small-holding farmers in the developing world suffer from sub-optimal crop yields because they lack a soil diagnostic system that is affordable, usable, and actionable. This paper details the fabrication and characterization of an integrated point-of-use soil-testing system, comprised of disposable ion-selective electrode strips and a handheld electrochemical reader. Together, the strips and reader transduce soil ion concentrations into to an alphanumeric output that can be communicated via text message to a central service provider offering immediate, customized fertilizer advisory. The solid-state ion-selective electrode (SS-ISE) strips employ a two-electrode design with screen-printable carbon nanotube ink serving as the electrical contacts for the working and reference electrodes. The working electrode comprises a plasticizer-free butyl acrylate ion-selective membrane (ISM), doped with an ion-selective ionophore and lipophilic salt. Meanwhile, the reference electrode includes a screen-printed silver-silver chloride ink and a polyvinyl-butyral membrane, which is doped with sodium chloride for stable reference potentials. As a proof of concept, potassium-selective electrodes are studied, given potassium’s essential role in plant growth and reproduction. The ISE-based system is reproducibly manufactured to yield a Nernstian response with a sub-micromolar detection limit (pK+ of 5.18 ± 0.08) and near-Nernstian sensitivity (61 mV/decade) in the presence of a 0.02 M strontium chloride extraction solution. Analysis of soil samples using the printed electrodes and reader yielded a correlation coefficient of 𝑅2 = 0.89 with respect to values measured via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The reliable performance of this system is encouraging toward its deployment for soil nutrient management in resource-limited environments."
https://openalex.org/W2892459374,"Ilex paraguariensis is a well-known plant that is widely consumed in South America, primarily as a drink called mate. Mate is described to have stimulant and medicinal properties. Considering the potential anti-lipid effects of I. paraguariensis infusion, we used an extract of this plant as a possible modulator of fat storage to control lipid metabolism in worms. Herein, the I. paraguariensis-dependent modulation of fat metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated. C. elegans were treated with I. paraguariensis aqueous extract (1 mg/ml) from L1 larvae stage until adulthood, to simulate the primary form of consumption. Expression of adipocyte triglyceride lipase 1 (ATGL-1) and heat shock protein 16.2, lipid accumulation through C1-BODIPY-C12 (BODIPY) lipid staining, behavioral parameters, body length, total body energy expenditure and overall survival were analyzed. Total body energy expenditure was determined by the oxygen consumption rate in N2, nuclear hormone receptor knockout, nhr-49(nr2041), and adenosine receptor knockout, ador-1(ox489) strains. Ilex paraguariensis extract increased ATGL-1 expression 20.06% and decreased intestinal BODIPY fat staining 63.36%, compared with the respective control group, without affecting bacterial growth and energetic balance, while nhr-49(nr2041) and ador-1(ox489) strains blocked the worm fat loss. In addition, I. paraguariensis increased the oxygen consumption in N2 worms, but not in mutant strains, increased N2 worm survival following juglone exposure, and did not alter hsp-16.2 expression. We demonstrate for the first time that I. paraguariensis can decrease fat storage and increase body energy expenditure in worms. These effects depend on the purinergic system (ADOR-1) and NHR-49 pathways. Ilex paraguariensis upregulated the expression of ATGL-1 to modulate fat metabolism. Furthermore, our data corroborates with other studies that demonstrate that C. elegans is a useful tool for studies of fat metabolism and energy consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2893860636,"Citrobacter rodentium infection is a model for infection with attaching and effacing pathogens, such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has emerged as an anti-inflammatory agent, documented to inhibit Th1 immune responses and successfully treat animal models of inflammation. VIP is also a mucus secretagogue. Here, we found that colonic levels of VIP decrease during murine C. rodentium infection with a similar time dependency as measurements reflecting mitochondrial function and epithelial integrity. The decrease in VIP appears mainly driven by changes in the cytokine environment, as no changes in VIP levels were detected in infected mice lacking interferon gamma (IFNγ). VIP supplementation alleviated the reduction of activity and levels of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and IV, mitochondrial phosphorylation capacity, transmembrane potential and ATP generation caused by IFNγ, TNFα and C. rodentium infection, in an in vitro mucosal surface. Similarly, VIP treatment regimens that included the day 5–10 post infection period alleviated decreases in enzyme complexes I and IV, phosphorylation capacity, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ATP generation as well as increased apoptosis levels during murine infection with C. rodentium. However, VIP treatment failed to alleviate colitis, although there was a tendency to decreased pathogen density in contact with the epithelium and in the spleen. Both in vivo and in vitro, NO generation increased during C. rodentium infection, which was alleviated by VIP. Thus, therapeutic VIP administration to restore the decreased levels during infection had beneficial effects on epithelial cells and their mitochondria, but not on the overall infection outcome."

A series of linear regressions modes were used to assess these associations adjusting for a range of factors known to be associated with blood cell counts, including age, body mass index, dietary factors, and previous infections.Higher levels of moderate-vigorous physical activity (ptrend<0.001) and lower sedentary time (ptrend = 0.040) were associated with lower white blood cell counts.These results suggest that modifiable health behaviors, such as physical activity and sedentary time, may be associated with inflammatory status through white blood cell counts, which may be important for future disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W2892482494,"Muscle proteins with ankyrin repeats (MARPs) ANKRD1 and ANKRD2 are titin-associated proteins with a putative role as transcriptional co-regulators in striated muscle, involved in the cellular response to mechanical, oxidative and metabolic stress. Since many aspects of the biology of MARPs, particularly exact mechanisms of their action, in striated muscle are still elusive, research in this field will benefit from novel animal model system. Here we investigated the MARPs found in zebrafish for protein structure, evolutionary conservation, spatiotemporal expression profiles and response to increased muscle activity. Ankrd1 and Ankrd2 show overall moderate conservation at the protein level, more pronounced in the region of ankyrin repeats, motifs indispensable for their function. The two zebrafish genes, ankrd1a and ankrd1b, counterparts of mammalian ANKRD1/Ankrd1, have different expression profiles during first seven days of development. Mild increase of ankrd1a transcript levels was detected at 72 hpf (1.74±0.24 fold increase relative to 24 hpf time point), while ankrd1b expression was markedly upregulated from 24 hpf onward and peaked at 72 hpf (92.18±36.95 fold increase relative to 24 hpf time point). Spatially, they exhibited non-overlapping expression patterns during skeletal muscle development in trunk (ankrd1a) and tail (ankrd1b) somites. Expression of ankrd2 was barely detectable. Zebrafish MARPs, expressed at a relatively low level in adult striated muscle, were found to be responsive to endurance exercise training consisting of two bouts of 3 hours of forced swimming daily, for five consecutive days. Three hours after the last exercise bout, ankrd1a expression increased in cardiac muscle (6.19±5.05 fold change), while ankrd1b and ankrd2 were upregulated in skeletal muscle (1.97±1.05 and 1.84±0.58 fold change, respectively). This study provides the foundation to establish zebrafish as a novel in vivo model for further investigation of MARPs function in striated muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2892970090,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by sustained mucosal inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, loss of cilia and epithelial barrier breakdown, and tissue remodeling. Certain glycosaminoglycans inhibit various inflammatory mediators, suppress bacterial growth, and provide important functions in mucosal tissue repair and mucociliary clearance. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a synthetic glycosaminoglycan, GM-1111, on the clinical signs and inflammatory tissue changes associated with CRS in mice. CRS was generated by repeated intranasal applications of Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) extracts over 4 weeks. Mice were then intranasally administered GM-1111 (600 μg per dose, 5 times a week) or vehicle (phosphate buffered saline, PBS) for an additional 4 weeks while still being given A. fumigatus extracts to maintain a chronic inflammatory environment with acute exacerbations. Clinical signs indicative of sinonasal inflammation were recorded throughout the study. After 9 weeks, whole blood and sinonasal tissues were harvested for hematological, histological, and biochemical examination. The clinical signs, white blood cell counts, tissue markers of sinonasal inflammation, and histological changes caused by A. fumigatus extract administration were compared to the healthy (PBS vehicle) and GM-1111-treated groups (n = 12 per treatment group). Compared to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with GM-1111 demonstrated significant reductions in clinical signs (p<0.05), degenerative tissue changes, goblet cell hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration (p<0.01), innate immunity- (tlr2, tlr4, myd88, il1b, tnfa, il6, and il12) and adaptive immunity-associated (ccl11, ccl24, ccl5, il4, il5, and il13) cytokine gene expression (p<0.05 to p<0.0001) in sinonasal tissues, and serum IgE levels (p<0.01). Our data suggest that GM-1111 significantly reduces local and systemic effects of CRS-associated sinonasal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2893109721,"In healthy subjects, emotional stimuli, positive stimuli in particular, are processed in a facilitated manner as are stimuli related to the self. These preferential processing biases also seem to hold true for self-related positive stimuli when compared to self-related negative or other-related positive stimuli suggesting a self-positivity bias in affective processing. The present study investigates the stability of this self-positivity bias and its possible extension to the emotional other in a sample of N = 147 participants including single participants (n = 61) and individuals currently in a romantic relationship (n = 86) reporting moderate to high levels of passionate love. Participants were presented a series of emotional and neutral words that could be related to the reader’s self (e.g., “my pleasure”, “my fear”), or to an insignificant third person, unknown to the reader (e.g., “his pleasure”, “his fear”) or devoid of any person reference (e.g., “the pleasure”, “the fear”). The task was to read the words silently and to evaluate the word pairs in reference to one’s own feelings elicited during reading. Results showed a self-positivity bias in emotional judgments in all participants, particularly in men. Moreover, participants in a romantic relationship (women and men) evaluated positive, other-related stimuli more often as valence-congruent with one’s own feelings than single participants. Taken together, these findings support the idea of a self-positivity bias in healthy subjects and an expansion of this bias while being in a romantic relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2893916157,"Background There has been a noticeable increase in the prevalence of allergy-related disorders (ARDs) in the modern era. Urbanization is believed to be a major environmental risk factor for the onset of ARDs but data from low- to middle-income countries is limited. Objective Our purpose was to assess the prevalence of ARDs and atopy among a population of rural Ethiopian school children and identify environmental and lifestyle factors associated with such disorders. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study on 541 school-children. An interviewer-led questionnaire administered to the mothers of each participant provided information on demographic and lifestyle variables. Questions on allergic disease symptoms were based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) core allergy and environmental questionnaire. Skin prick test for common allergens German cockroach (Blattella germanica) and dust mite (Dermatophagoides) was performed to define atopy. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the odds ratio between ARDs and atopy with specific environmental and lifestyle habits. Results 541 children responded to the survey questions: the majority of participants were female (60.3%) and aged 10–15 years-old. The prevalence of any ARD was 27%, while the rates of ever-having eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze was found to be 16.8%, 9.6%, and 8.6% respectively. Only 3.6% (19 school-children) tested positive for any skin sensitization. Analysis of associated factors for ARDs found that a family history of allergic disorders (AOR: 2.80; p-value<0.01), use of insecticides (AOR: 2.05; p-value<0.01), and wearing open-toed shoes (AOR: 2.19; p-value = 0.02) were all significantly associated factors. Insecticide use, river-bathing, and infection with intestinal parasites were found to be significantly associated factors for atopy. Other potential risk factors such as frequent use of soap, bacterial infection, and household crowding had no statistical significance. Conclusion Our study suggests that the prevalence of skin sensitization and ARDs in rural populations of developing countries is still relatively low. We identified several possible risk factors for further investigation. Overall, the significance of identified risk factors appears to indicate that genetic predisposition and exposure to environmental pollution are more important to the etiology of ARDs and atopy than specific lifestyle behaviors."

This study contributes to this area of work by examining men's exposure to family planning (FP) program activities in urban Senegal and determining whether exposure is associated with reported FP use and discussion of family planning with female partners.This study uses data from two cross-sectional surveys of men in four urban sites of Senegal (Dakar, Pikine, Guédiawaye, Mbao). In 2011 and 2015, men ages 15-59 in a random sample of households from study clusters were approached and asked to participate in a survey about their fertility and family planning experiences. These data were used to determine the association between exposure to the Initiative Sénégalaise de Santé Urbaine (in English: Senegal Urban Reproductive Health Initiative) family planning program interventions with men's reported modern family planning use and their reported discussion of FP with their partners. Since data come from the same study clusters at each time period, fixed effects methods at the cluster level allowed us to control for possible program targeting by geographic area.Multivariate models demonstrate that religious leaders speaking favorably about family planning, seeing FP messages on the television, hearing FP messages on the radio, and exposure to community outreach activities with a FP focus (e.g., house to house and community religious dialogues) are associated with reported modern family planning use and discussion of family planning with partners among men in the four urban sites of Senegal.This study demonstrates that it is possible to reach men with FP program activities in urban Senegal and that these activities are positively associated with reported FP behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2893077714,"Unclassified tailings are the main backfilling aggregates in mines and their settling is the first step in the utilization of tailings; thus, it is very important to determine their settling behavior. The aim of this study was to understand the flocculating settling behavior of unclassified tailings with different factors. The combination of property detection, laboratory experiments and industrial tests were used to assess the flocculating settling behavior of unclassified tailings; the orthogonal experimental design and the control variate method were used for an experimental design. The results show that the flocculating settling velocity of unclassified tailings decreases with the increase of slurry concentration and that this settling velocity increases first and then decreases with the increase of flocculant unit consumption. The underflow concentration is positively correlated with the slurry concentration and negatively correlated with the flocculant unit consumption and flocculant concentration. Slower feed velocity could produce higher concentration underflow but lower clarity overflow water. The greater the mud height, the higher the underflow concentration and the suspended solids concentration in the overflow water. The underflow concentration has a maximum at the rake speed of 0.3 r/min, and the rake speed has little effect on the suspended solids concentration in the overflow water. By analyzing the settling velocity, the underflow concentration, the suspended solids concentration in the overflow water and the solid flux, the following parameters of the flocculating settling experiments were determined: the flocculant type is APAM with a molecular weight of 12 million, the flocculant unit consumption is 30 g/t, the slurry concentration is 6 vol.%, the flocculant concentration is 0.1 wt.%, the rake speed is 0.3 r/min, and the feed velocity is 0.4 L/min (its solid flux is 0.523 t/(m2·h)). The industrial tests were carried out based on the laboratory settling data, and the appropriate selection parameters of the industrial tests were estimated."

The current study introduces a new approach of measuring vulnerability among female sex workers (FSWs) by adopting a multidimensional poverty measurement framework. A multidimensional vulnerability index was created from four dimensions and 16 indicators using a dual cut-off approach. The study found that 55% of FSWs were multidimensionally vulnerable with 48% of intensity in vulnerability. The overall value of multidimensional vulnerability index was 0.265. FSWs in Maharashtra were most vulnerable (82%). Lack of financial security contributed mostly to FSWs' vulnerability. Further, compared to less vulnerable FSWs, multidimensionally vulnerable ones were more to engage in behaviors that put them at risk such as inconsistent use of condoms with clients, alcohol consumption, engaging in anal sex with clients and experiencing sexually transmitted infections. Findings suggest that structural, social and financial vulnerabilities of FSWs need to be addressed concurrently."
https://openalex.org/W2893023459,"Painting is an art form that has long functioned as a major channel for the creative expression and communication of humans, its evolution taking place under an interplay with the science, technology, and social environments of the times. Therefore, understanding the process based on comprehensive data could shed light on how humans acted and manifested creatively under changing conditions. Yet, there exist few systematic frameworks that characterize the process for painting, which would require robust statistical methods for defining painting characteristics and identifying human’s creative developments, and data of high quality and sufficient quantity. Here we propose that the color contrast of a painting image signifying the heterogeneity in inter-pixel chromatic distance can be a useful representation of its style, integrating both the color and geometry. From the color contrasts of paintings from a large-scale, comprehensive archive of 179 853 high-quality images spanning several centuries we characterize the temporal evolutionary patterns of paintings, and present a deep study of an extraordinary expansion in creative diversity and individuality that came to define the modern era."
https://openalex.org/W2893228163,"Introduction Online surveys are a valuable tool for social science research, but the perceived anonymity provided by online administration may lead to problematic behaviors from study participants. Particularly, if a study offers incentives, some participants may attempt to enroll multiple times. We propose a method to identify clusters of non-independent enrollments in a web-based study, motivated by an analysis of survey data which tests the effectiveness of an online skin-cancer risk reduction program. Methods To identify groups of enrollments, we used a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the Euclidean distance matrix formed by participant responses to a series of Likert-type eligibility questions. We then systematically identified clusters that are unusual in terms of both size and similarity, by repeatedly simulating datasets from the empirical distribution of responses under the assumption of independent enrollments. By performing the clustering algorithm on the simulated datasets, we determined the distribution of cluster size and similarity under independence, which is then used to identify groups of outliers in the observed data. Next, we assessed 12 other quality indicators, including previously proposed and study-specific measures. We summarized the quality measures by cluster membership, and compared the cluster groupings to those found when using the quality indicators with latent class modeling. Results and conclusions When we excluded the clustered enrollments and/or lower-quality latent classes from the analysis of study outcomes, the estimates of the intervention effect were larger. This demonstrates how including repeat or low quality participants can introduce bias into a web-based study. As much as is possible, web-based surveys should be designed to verify participant quality. Our method can be used to verify survey quality and identify problematic groups of enrollments when necessary."

This study assessed early death within 6 months and attrition (death and loss to follow-up, LTFU) after ART initiation and their associated factors. Design A retrospective cohort study on people living with HIV (PLHIV >15 year of age) enrolled at three specialist hospitals in Yangon from 1st June 2013 to 30th June 2016. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of early death and attrition. Results Of 11,727 adults enrolled, 11,186 (95%) were initiated on ART, providing 15,964 person-years of follow-up. At baseline, median age was 36 years [IQR: 30–43], 58% were men and median CD4 count was 151 cells/mm3 (IQR: 54–310). There were 733(6%) early deaths, 961(9%) total deaths and 1371 (12%) LTFU during the study period. Independent risk factors for early death were older age (41–50 and ≥51 years) [aHR 1.38, 1.07–1.78 and 1.68, 1.21–2.34], male (1.84, 1.44–2.35), low weight (2.06, 1.64–2.59), bedridden, (3.81, 2.57–5.66) and CD4 count ≤ 50 cells/mm3 (6.83, 2.52–18.57). In addition to above factors, high attrition was associated with an abacavir-based regimen. Conclusion Although there was a low rate of early deaths, patients were being diagnosed late and there was a high attrition rate from specialist hospitals. Concerted effort is required to increase early diagnosis and ART initiation, and strengthen community systems for HIV care to achieve ambitious goal of ending AIDS epidemic by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W2893861328,"Sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer) are a major ectoparasite affecting farmed Atlantic salmon in most major salmon producing regions. Substantial resources are applied to sea lice control and the development of new technologies towards this end. Identifying and understanding how sea lice population patterns vary among cages on a salmon farm can be an important step in the design and analysis of any sea lice control strategy. Norway’s intense monitoring efforts have provided salmon farmers and researchers with a wealth of sea lice infestation data. A frequently registered parameter is the number of adult female sea lice per cage. These time-series data can be analysed descriptively, the similarity between time-series quantified, so that groups and patterns can be identified among cages, using clustering algorithms capable of handling such dynamic data. We apply such algorithms to investigate the pattern of female sea lice counts among cages for three Atlantic salmon farms in Norway. A series of strategies involving a combination of distance measures and prototypes were explored and cluster evaluation was performed using cluster validity indices. Repeated agreement on cluster membership for different combinations of distance and centroids was taken to be a strong indicator of clustering while the stability of these results reinforced this likelihood. Though drivers behind clustering are not thoroughly investigated here, it appeared that fish weight at time of stocking and other management practices were strongly related to cluster membership. In addition to these internally driven factors it is also possible that external sources of infestation may drive patterns of sea lice infestation in groups of cages; for example, those most proximal to an external source. This exploratory method proved useful as a pattern discovery tool for cages in salmon farms."
https://openalex.org/W2893918980,"The impact of a laser pulse onto a liquid metal droplet is numerically investigated by utilising a weakly compressible single phase model; the thermodynamic closure is achieved by the Tait equation of state (EoS) for the liquid metal. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, which has been employed in the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework, offers numerical efficiency, compared to grid related discretization methods. The latter would require modelling not only of the liquid metal phase, but also of the vacuum, which would necessitate special numerical schemes, suitable for high density ratios. In addition, SPH-ALE allows for the easy deformation handling of the droplet, compared to interface tracking methods where strong mesh deformation and most likely degenerate cells occur. Then, the laser-induced deformation of the droplet is simulated and cavitation formation is predicted. The ablation pattern due to the emitted shock wave and the two low pressure lobes created in the middle of the droplet because of the rarefaction waves are demonstrated. The liquid metal droplet is subject to material rupture, when the shock wave, the rarefaction wave and the free surface interact. Similar patterns regarding the wave dynamics and the hollow structure have been also noticed in prior experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W2549212445,"In genetic diseases with variable age of onset, survival function estimation for the mutation carriers as well as estimation of the modifying factors effects are essential to provide individual risk assessment, both for mutation carriers management and prevention strategies. In practice, this survival function is classically estimated from pedigrees data where most genotypes are unobserved. In this article, we present a unifying Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework combining probabilistic computations in Bayesian networks with standard statistical survival procedures in order to provide mutation carrier survival estimates. The proposed approach allows to obtain previously published parametric estimates (e.g. Weibull survival) as particular cases as well as more general Kaplan-Meier non-parametric estimates, which is the main contribution. Note that covariates can also be taken into account using a proportional hazard model. The whole methodology is both validated on simulated data and applied to family samples with transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis (a rare autosomal dominant disease with highly variable age of onset), showing very promising results."
https://openalex.org/W2892429223,"Although an extensive research is being undertaken, the ideal bone graft and evaluation method of the bone formation draw still a warranted attention. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel multimodal radiomics evaluation method, utilizing X-ray computed tomography (CT) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-99m-Methyl diphosphonate (Tc-99m-MDP) tracer. These modalities are intended to provide quantitative data concerning the mineral bone density (after evaluation it is referred to as opacity) and the osteoblast activity, at the same time. The properties of bone formation process within poly (methyl methacrylate)-based bone cement graft (PMMA) was compared to that of albumin coated, sterilized, antigen-extracted freeze-dried human bone grafts (HLBC), in caudal vertebrae (C5) of rats. The animals were scanned at 3 and 8 weeks after surgery. In both groups, the mean opacity increased, while the mean Tc-99m-MDP activity decreased. The later parameter was significant (n = 4, p = 0.002) only in HLBC group. The linear regression analysis of PMMA-treated group variables (mean opacity increase; mean Tc-99m-MDP activity decrease), revealed a negative correlation with the medium strength (r = 0.395, p = 0.605). Whereas, it showed strong positive correlation when HLBC group variables were analyzed (r = 0.772, p = 0.012). These results indicate that using HLBC grafts is advantageous in terms of the osteoblast activity and bone vascularization over PMMA cement. Using this regression analysis method, we were able to distinguish characteristics that otherwise could not be distinguished by a regular data analysis. Hence, we propose utilizing this novel method in preclinical tests, and in clinical monitoring of bone healing, in order to improve diagnosis of bone-related diseases."

The cecal microbiota composition of geese and their adaptation to fiber inclusion and feeding timeswere investigated in this study. A total of 116 Wanxi white geese were randomly selected at 70 days old. Eight geese were subjected to cecal sampling at 70 d of age, and the remaining 108 geese were divided into four groups with three replicates each (9 geese in each replicate). The geese in the four groups were fed 0, 15, 30, and 45% green forage (relative to dry matter), respectively. Three birds from each replicate were selected for cecal sampling at 80, 90, and 100 days old. All samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the Illumina Ion Personal Genome Machine platform. Bacterial abundance was analyzed using two-way ANOVA analysis, and the relationship between the relative abundance of bacteria (phylum level) and fatty acids was analyzed using acanonical correspondence analysis. Cecal microbiota in geese were mainly composed of Bacteroidetes (68.46%), Firmicutes (20.04%), and Proteobacteria (7.89%). Dietary treatments had no significant effect on the α-diversity indices of the cecal bacterial community (P > 0.05), but a numerical increase occurred with increased fattening duration and green forage inclusion. The Selenomonadales order (P = 0.024), Negativicutes class (P = 0.026), and Megamonas (P = 0.012) and Oscillospira (P = 0.042) genera were affected by green forageinclusion level, and microflora abundance was mainly influenced by the fattening duration. Bacteria phyla were mostly set along the line of linolenic acid and oleic acid. Finally, Bacteroidales might be an intestinal promoter that improves unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in geese."
https://openalex.org/W2893689078,"Strategies are needed to mitigate the high rates and related risks of musculoskeletal complaints and injuries (MSCI) in the military aviator community. Previous work on Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF) soldiers have shown that proper screening methods have been successful in reducing early discharge from military training. Research has pointed at the importance of optimal spinal movement control in military aviators. The aim of this work was to investigate the inter-rater and test-retest reliability of a battery of clinical tests for evaluating movement control in the neck, shoulders, thoracic, lumbar, and hip regions in a population of SwAF military personnel. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability of 15 movement control tests were assessed by crude and prevalence-adjusted kappa coefficient. The study included 37 (inter-rater) and 45 (test-retest) SwAF personnel and was performed with two physiotherapists simultaneously observing and rating the movements on the first occasion and repeated with one physiotherapist on the second occasion. For inter-rater reliability, the kappa coefficient ranged from .19 to .95. Seven tests showed substantial to almost perfect agreement (kappa > .60). With the adjusted kappa, three more tests reached the level of substantial agreement. The corresponding values for test-retest reliability ranged from .26 to .65. Substantial agreement was attained for two tests, three with adjusted kappa. The following tests can reliably be used when screening for biomechanically less advantageous movement patters in military aviators: Shoulder flexion, and rotation, Neck flexion in sitting and supine, Neck extension and rotation in sitting, Pelvic tilt, Forward lean and Single and Double knee extension tests. Grading criteria for tests in supine and quadruped positions need to be further elaborated."
https://openalex.org/W2892545894,"Background Behçet’s disease (BD) is a polygenic immune-mediated disorder characterized by a close association with the HLA-B*51 allele. The HLA region has a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and carries several genetic variants (e.g. MIC-A, TNF-α genes) identified as associated to BD because of their LD with HLA-B*51. In fact, the HLA-B*51 is inherited as part of extended HLA haplotypes which are well preserved in patients with BD. Sardinian population is highly differentiated from other Mediterranean populations because of a distinctive genetic structure with very highly preserved HLA haplotypes. Patients and methods In order to identify other genes of susceptibility to BD within the HLA region we investigated the distribution of human Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1) gene variants among BD patients and healthy controls from Sardinia. Six (rs2736182; rs2259571; rs2269475; rs2857597; rs13195276; rs4711274) AIF-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and related extended haplotypes have been investigated as well as their LD within the HLA region and with HLA-B*51. Overall, 64 BD patients, 43 HLA-B*51 positive healthy controls (HC) and 70 random HC were enrolled in the study. Results HLA-B*51 was the only allele with significantly higher frequency (pc = 0.0021) in BD patients (40.6%) than in HC (9.8%). The rs2259571T AIF-1 variant had a significantly reduced phenotypic, but not allelic frequency in BD patients (72.1%; pc = 0.014) compared to healthy population (91.3%). That was likely due to the LD between HLA-B*51 and rs2259571G (pc = 9E-5), even though the rs2259571G distribution did not significantly differ between BD patients and HC. Conclusion No significant difference in distribution of AIF-1 SNPs haplotypes was observed between BD patients and HC and between HLA-B*51 positive BD patients and HLA-B*51 positive HC. Taken together, these results suggest that AIF-1 gene is not associated with susceptibility to BD in Sardinia."
https://openalex.org/W2892698114,"The largely semi-deserted and deserted Dzungharian Basin sites in the northwest of China geologically represent an extension of the Paleozoic Kazakhstan Block and were once part of an independent continent. For reasons of overdevelopment and unreasonable operations during the process of exploitation and transportation, oil pollutants that were discharged into the soil environment caused serious pollution in this weak ecosystem. To explore the bacterial community composition in detail and their possible origination and potential during the natural attenuation of petroleum contaminants in this type of ecologic niche, GC-MS and high-throughput sequencing techniques were used to resolve the organic compounds and bacterial communities in vertical soil layers. The degradation of petroleum contaminants in semi-deserted and deserted soils mainly occurred in the layer at a depth of 45–55 cm. During this process, aromatic and heterocyclic compounds were significantly enriched in soils. The bacterial communities in this basin exhibited a distinct vertical stratification from the surface layer down to the bottom soil layer. Considering the interaction between the community composition and the geochemical properties, we speculate that the degradation of petroleum contaminants in this semi-deserted and deserted soil might represent a microorganism-mediated process and mainly occur in the deeper soil layer."
https://openalex.org/W2893234529,"The success of driver graduated licensing systems (GLS) is demonstrated primarily in jurisdictions that licence at young ages with requirements expiring at age 18. In Australia, GLS requirements typically apply for all applicants aged under 25. In 2007, the Queensland licensing system was strengthened, extending the learner and introducing a 100-hour supervised driving requirement, introducing restrictions on passenger carriage at night and high-powered vehicles for provisional drivers, and on phone use for all novice drivers (learner and provisional). The objective of the current research was to evaluate whether these changes were associated with reductions in crashes (all) and killed-and-serious-injury (KSI) crashes involving novice drivers, and respective casualties. Government licensing and police crash records were linked and interrupted time series analysis was used to examine potential shifts in crash trends by rates of licensed drivers per month. Substantial declines were found in novice driver crashes (13.1% per year; 95%CI -0.0130, -0.0096), crash casualties (13.9% per year; 95%CI -0.0137, -0.0101), KSI crashes (5.4% per year; 95%CI -0.0080, -0.0046) and associated casualties (5.2% per year; 95%CI -0.0075, -0.0039). Compared to the total licensed driver population, declines in crashes (3.0% per year; 95%CI -0.0027, -0.0007) and crash casualties (2.9% per year; 95%CI -0.0029, -0.0006) but not KSI outcomes were observed. More narrowly, declines were found for provisional-licensed driver crashes (9.3% per year; 95%CI -0.0096, -0.0063) and KSI crashes (3.6% per year; 95%CI -0.0004, -0.0128) that were approximately 2.6% and 1.2% greater than respective declines for 25-29-year-old open-licensed drivers. Substantial declines also were observed in novice driver single-vehicle, night, passenger and alcohol crashes. Overall, these results demonstrate that GLS can be effective in a later age licensing jurisdiction. However, KSI outcomes were limited. Modelling research is recommended on ways to further strengthen Queensland’s GLS to achieve greater trauma reductions."
https://openalex.org/W2893286741,"Rhodococcus equi (R. hoagii) is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in foals up to 6 months old and animal environment. The R. equi genome contains genetically stable chromosomal DNA and an 80-90 kb plasmid containing vapA gene, responsible for virulence. Most reports from around the world focus on the determination of R. equi plasmid profiles. Few studies have attempted to determine differences in nucleotide sequences between virulent strains of R. equi isolated from foals and breeding environment. The aim of the study was to perform a molecular analysis of a fragment of the chromosomal gene encoding the 16S rRNA subunit and the vapA plasmid gene of virulent R. equi strains isolated on Polish studs from foals and from the breeding environment of horses. The sequencing method was used to compare the primary structure of fragments of the chromosomal and plasmid DNA of the virulent R. equi strains. The sequences of 22 clinical and 18 environmental R. equi isolates were compared with the sequences of the gene fragments of reference strains available in the NCBI GenBank database. All sequenced 16S rRNA amplicons of Polish field strains were identical and showed 99.5% similarity to the four randomly selected sequences of this gene fragment in the GenBank database. The results confirm that fragments of the 16S rRNA gene of R. equi strains are highly conserved and do not undergo variation in field conditions. Analysis of the sequencing results for the vapA gene fragment of the strains used in our study revealed two polymorphic variants and clear differences between the sequences of strains isolated from foals and from soil samples. Presumably, R. equi strains present in the breeding environment are more exposed than clinical strains to adverse external factors. This may result in changes in the DNA sequence due to natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W2893910614,"We introduce a random strategy update rule for the evolutionary public goods game on networks based on survival of the fittest. A survival cost parameter is introduced to public goods game. Players whose payoffs are below the survival cost will be deleted from the network. The same number of new nodes are randomly connected to the network and randomly designated cooperation or defection. Numerical results show that cooperation can flourish if the multiplication factor of the public goods game is greater than the network degree. We present a simple analytical method to explain this result. The fraction of cooperators reaches the maximum for a suitable survival cost. Furthermore, the initial random network has evolved into a heterogeneous network which facilitates the emergence of the cooperation. Our work could be helpful to understand how natural selection favors cooperation. It suggests a new method to investigate the impact of the survival cost on the evolution of cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2894351620,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is characterized by progressive glomerulosclerosis (GS). ROP mice have a sclerosis-prone phenotype. However, they develop severe, rapidly progressive GS when rendered diabetic. Since GS also develops in aged C57Bl6 mice, and can be reversed using bone marrow from young mice which have lower oxidative stress and inflammation (OS/Infl), we postulated that this might also apply to DKD. Therefore, this pilot study asked whether reducing OS/Infl in young adult sclerosis-prone (ROP) diabetic mice leads to resolution of existing GS in early DKD using safe, FDA-approved drugs.After 4 weeks of stable streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia 8-12 week-old female mice were randomized and treated for 22 weeks as follows: 1) enalapril (EN) (n = 8); 2) pyridoxamine (PYR)+EN (n = 8); 3) pentosan polysulfate (PPS)+EN (n = 7) and 4) PPS+PYR+EN (n = 7). Controls were untreated (non-DB, n = 7) and hyperglycemic (DB, n = 8) littermates. PPS+PYR+EN reduced albuminuria and reversed GS in DB. Treatment effects: 1) Anti-OS/Infl defenses: a) PPS+PYR+EN increased the levels of SIRT1, Nrf2, estrogen receptor α (ERα) and advanced glycation endproduct-receptor1 (AGER1) levels; and b) PYR+EN increased ERα and AGER1 levels. 2) Pro-OS/Infl factors: a) PPS+PYR+EN reduced sTNFR1, b) all except EN reduced MCP1, c) RAGE was reduced by all treatments. In summary, PYR+PPS+EN modulated GS in sclerosis-prone hyperglycemic mice. PYR+PPS+EN also decreased albuminuria, OS/Infl and the sclerosis-prone phenotype. Thus, reducing OS/Infl may reverse GS in early diabetes in patients, and albuminuria may allow early detection of the sclerosis-prone phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2893214649,"Mutation cluster analysis is critical for understanding certain mutational mechanisms relevant to genetic disease, diversity, and evolution. Yet, whole genome sequencing for detection of mutation clusters is prohibitive with high cost for most organisms and population surveys. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, like the Mouse Diversity Genotyping Array, offer an alternative low-cost, screening for mutations at hundreds of thousands of loci across the genome using experimental designs that permit capture of de novo mutations in any tissue. Formal statistical tools for genome-wide detection of mutation clusters under a microarray probe sampling system are yet to be established. A challenge in the development of statistical methods is that microarray detection of mutation clusters is constrained to select SNP loci captured by probes on the array. This paper develops a Monte Carlo framework for cluster testing and assesses test statistics for capturing potential deviations from spatial randomness which are motivated by, and incorporate, the array design. While null distributions of the test statistics are established under spatial randomness via the homogeneous Poisson process, power performance of the test statistics is evaluated under postulated types of Neyman-Scott clustering processes through Monte Carlo simulation. A new statistic is developed and recommended as a screening tool for mutation cluster detection. The statistic is demonstrated to be excellent in terms of its robustness and power performance, and useful for cluster analysis in settings of missing data. The test statistic can also be generalized to any one dimensional system where every site is observed, such as DNA sequencing data. The paper illustrates how the informal graphical tools for detecting clusters may be misleading. The statistic is used for finding clusters of putative SNP differences in a mixture of different mouse genetic backgrounds and clusters of de novo SNP differences arising between tissues with development and carcinogenesis."
