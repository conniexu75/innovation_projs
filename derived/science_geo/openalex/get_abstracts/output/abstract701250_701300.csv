https://openalex.org/W4297461792,"Myc is a powerful transcription factor implicated in epigenetic reprogramming, cellular plasticity, and rapid growth as well as tumorigenesis. Cancer in skeletal muscle is extremely rare despite marked and sustained Myc induction during loading-induced hypertrophy. Here, we investigated global, actively transcribed, stable, and myonucleus-specific transcriptomes following an acute hypertrophic stimulus in mouse plantaris. With these datasets, we define global and Myc-specific dynamics at the onset of mechanical overload-induced muscle fiber growth. Data collation across analyses reveals an under-appreciated role for the muscle fiber in extracellular matrix remodeling during adaptation, along with the contribution of mRNA stability to epigenetic-related transcript levels in muscle. We also identify Runx1 and Ankrd1 (Marp1) as abundant myonucleus-enriched loading-induced genes. We observed that a strong induction of cell cycle regulators including Myc occurs with mechanical overload in myonuclei. Additionally, in vivo Myc-controlled gene expression in the plantaris was defined using a genetic muscle fiber-specific doxycycline-inducible Myc-overexpression model. We determined Myc is implicated in numerous aspects of gene expression during early-phase muscle fiber growth. Specifically, brief induction of Myc protein in muscle represses Reverbα, Reverbβ, and Myh2 while increasing Rpl3, recapitulating gene expression in myonuclei during acute overload. Experimental, comparative, and in silico analyses place Myc at the center of a stable and actively transcribed, loading-responsive, muscle fiber-localized regulatory hub. Collectively, our experiments are a roadmap for understanding global and Myc-mediated transcriptional networks that regulate rapid remodeling in postmitotic cells. We provide open webtools for exploring the five RNA-seq datasets as a resource to the field."
https://openalex.org/W4296986169,"The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) facilitates the cotranslational installation of the 22nd amino acid pyrrolysine. Owing to its tolerance for diverse amino acid substrates, and its orthogonality in multiple organisms, PylRS has emerged as a major route to install noncanonical amino acids into proteins in living cells. Recently, a novel class of PylRS enzymes was identified in a subset of methanogenic archaea. Enzymes within this class (ΔPylSn) lack the N-terminal tRNA-binding domain that is widely conserved amongst PylRS enzymes, yet remain active and orthogonal in bacteria and eukaryotes. In this study, we use biochemical and in vivo UAG-readthrough assays to characterize the aminoacylation efficiency and substrate spectrum of a ΔPylSn class PylRS from the archaeon Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus. We show that, compared with the full-length enzyme from Methanosarcina mazei, the Ca. M. alvus PylRS displays reduced aminoacylation efficiency but an expanded amino acid substrate spectrum. To gain insight into the evolution of ΔPylSn enzymes, we performed molecular phylogeny using 156 PylRS and 105 pyrrolysine tRNA (tRNAPyl) sequences from diverse archaea and bacteria. This analysis suggests that the PylRS•tRNAPyl pair diverged before the evolution of the three domains of life, placing an early limit on the evolution of the Pyl-decoding trait. Furthermore, our results document the coevolutionary history of PylRS and tRNAPyl and reveal the emergence of tRNAPyl sequences with unique A73 and U73 discriminator bases. The orthogonality of these tRNAPyl species with the more common G73-containing tRNAPyl will enable future efforts to engineer PylRS systems for further genetic code expansion."
https://openalex.org/W4297251625,"Despite a recent increase in community engagement in health initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic, health inequalities and health inequities remain a serious problem for society, often affecting those in underserved communities the most. Often individualised incentives such as payment for vaccinations have been used to increase involvement in health initiatives but evidence suggests that these do not always work and can be ineffective. This paper addresses the real world problem of a lack of involvement of communities in health programmes and subsequent health inequalities. Using data from nine workshops with community members evaluating a large community health programme, we develop a socio-ecological model [SEM] of influences on community engagement in health programmes to identify holistic and systemic barriers and enablers to such engagement. To date SEM has not been used to develop solutions to improve community engagement in health programmes. Such an approach holds the potential to look beyond individualised conceptualisations of behaviour and instead consider a multitude of social and cultural influences. This knowledge can then be used to develop multi-faceted and multi-layered solutions to tackle the barriers to community engagement in health programmes. Our SEM highlights the overarching importance of the socio-cultural environment in influencing community engagement. Within the socio-cultural environment were factors such as trust, social support and community mindedness. We also found that other factors affecting community engagement fall within individual, economic, technological, political and physical environments. Such factors include engagement in community organisation governance and processes, access to and ability to use technology and access to safe outdoor spaces. We propose further testing our socioecological model in other communities."
https://openalex.org/W4296977420,"Although the abnormal expression of miRNAs in cancer cells is a widely accepted phenomenon, the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-3648 progression and metastasis in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. miR-3648 expression is downregulated and its ectopic expression in GC cells significantly suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistic analyses indicated that miR-3648 directly targets FRAT1 or FRAT2 and inhibits FRAT1- or FRAT2-mediated invasion and motility in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, FRAT1 physically interacted with FRAT2. Furthermore, FRAT1 overexpression promoted GC cell invasion, whereas siRNA-mediated repression of FRAT2 in FRAT1-overexpressing GC cells reversed its invasive potential. Besides, miR-3648 inactivated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway by downregulating FRAT1 and FRAT2 in GC. Interestingly, c-Myc, a downstream effector of Wnt/β-catenin signalling, was also downregulated by miR-3648 overexpression. In turn, c-Myc negatively regulated miR-3648 expression by binding to the miR-3648 promoter. In addition, miR-3648 expression levels were negatively correlated with c-Myc, FRAT1, and FRAT2 expression in fresh gastric samples. Our studies suggest that miR-3648 acts as a tumour-suppressive miRNA and that the miR-3648/FRAT1-FRAT2/c-Myc negative feedback loop could be a critical regulator of GC progression."
https://openalex.org/W4297255559,"Laboratory identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species is not regularly performed while, they have a public health importance with a prevalence of more than 5% among pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to identify the NTM species and their clinical significance among PTB patients. A retrospective study was conducted at the Ethiopian Public Health Institution's (EPHI's) national TB referral laboratory. Stored NTM isolates were genotyped using GenoType Mycobacterium CM/AS kit (Hain Life science, Germany). Data pertinent to the study was extracted from the EPHI's database and patients' medical records. Between January 2 & December 28 of 2017, a total of 3,834 samples were processed from 698 TB patients of whom 50% were female. Among 3,317 samples with mycobacterial culture results 7.3% were NTM and majority of them were identified from smear negative TB patients. M. simiae was the /predominant NTM among the genotyped isolates. All the studied NTM species were not clinically important however, considering the similarity of clinical and radiologic findings between NTM and MTBC infected patients, integrating NTM species identification in the routine TB laboratory diagnosis may augment clinicians' decision particularly in DR-TB patients. Additional similar prospective study with a larger sample size is recommended. Moreover, urgent improvements on patients' record keeping practice are required in the studied hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W4296520220,"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL97 protein is a conserved herpesvirus protein kinase (CHPK) and a viral cyclin-dependent kinase (v-CDK). However, mechanisms regulating its activity in the context of infection are unknown. Here, we identified several cellular regulatory 14-3-3 proteins as UL97-interacting partners that promote UL97 stability. Humans are known to encode seven isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins (β, ε, η, γ, σ, θ, and ζ) that bind phosphoserines or phosphothreonines to impact protein structure, stability, activity, and localization. Our proteomic analysis of UL97 identified 49 interacting partners, including 14-3-3 isoforms β, η, and γ. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation with Western blotting assays demonstrated that UL97 interaction with 14-3-3 isoforms β, ε, η, γ, and θ occurs in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Using mutational analysis, we determined the serine residue at amino acid 13 of UL97 is crucial for 14-3-3 interaction. We demonstrate UL97 S13A (serine to alanine substitution at residue 13) retains kinase activity but the mutant protein accumulated at lower levels than WT UL97. Finally, we show both laboratory (AD169) and clinical (TB40/E) strains of HCMV encoding UL97 S13A replicated with WT kinetics in fibroblasts but showed decreased UL97 accumulation. Taken together, we conclude that 14-3-3 proteins interact with and stabilize UL97 during HCMV infection.

Mechanisms that regulate the activity of cellular CDKs are well understood and include the phosphorylation of specific CDK residues, the interaction with cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs), and associations with chaperone complexes (14Malumbres M.

Despite the functional similarities between UL97 and cellular CDKs, our understanding of UL97 regulatory mechanisms is limited. UL97 is phosphorylated by CDK9/cyclin T1, but the significance of this event is unknown (15Graf L. Webel R. Wagner S. Hamilton S.T. Rawlinson W.D.

Any putative binding of UL97 to 14-3-3 σ or ζ was below the limit of detection of this assay. The steady state levels of the UL97-interacting 14-3-3 proteins did not change during HCMV infection (Fig. 1B). Of the five isoforms that interact with UL97, we found antibodies for two (ε and θ) that worked for IP and used them to examine the interaction between UL97 and 14-3-3 protein in HCMV-infected cells.

https://openalex.org/W4296888642,"Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare disorder caused by hemizygous microdeletion of ∼27 contiguous genes. Despite neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits, individuals with WBS have spared or enhanced musical and auditory abilities, potentially offering an insight into the genetic basis of auditory perception. Here, we report that the mouse models of WBS have innately enhanced frequency-discrimination acuity and improved frequency coding in the auditory cortex (ACx). Chemogenetic rescue showed frequency-discrimination hyperacuity is caused by hyperexcitable interneurons in the ACx. Haploinsufficiency of one WBS gene, Gtf2ird1, replicated WBS phenotypes by downregulating the neuropeptide receptor VIPR1. VIPR1 is reduced in the ACx of individuals with WBS and in the cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells with the WBS microdeletion. Vipr1 deletion or overexpression in ACx interneurons mimicked or reversed, respectively, the cellular and behavioral phenotypes of WBS mice. Thus, the Gtf2ird1-Vipr1 mechanism in ACx interneurons may underlie the superior auditory acuity in WBS."
https://openalex.org/W4296986541,"Plants and algae are faced with a conundrum: harvesting sufficient light to drive their metabolic needs while dissipating light in excess to prevent photodamage, a process known as nonphotochemical quenching. A slowly relaxing form of energy dissipation, termed qH, is critical for plants' survival under abiotic stress; however, qH location in the photosynthetic membrane is unresolved. Here, we tested whether we could isolate subcomplexes from plants in which qH was induced that would remain in an energy-dissipative state. Interestingly, we found that chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence lifetimes were decreased by qH in isolated major trimeric antenna complexes, indicating that they serve as a site for qH-energy dissipation and providing a natively quenched complex with physiological relevance to natural conditions. Next, we monitored the changes in thylakoid pigment, protein, and lipid contents of antenna with active or inactive qH but did not detect any evident differences. Finally, we investigated whether specific subunits of the major antenna complexes were required for qH but found that qH was insensitive to trimer composition. Because we previously observed that qH can occur in the absence of specific xanthophylls, and no evident changes in pigments, proteins, or lipids were detected, we tentatively propose that the energy-dissipative state reported here may stem from Chl-Chl excitonic interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4297253982,"Motivating children to lead a healthy and active lifestyle is a family mission and a responsibility shared by society. This study is important in developing the family's role in promoting children's active lifestyle. This study aims to develop the role of the family in promoting an active lifestyle for children in light of the Saudi vision 2030. The sample included 405 parents who filled out an online survey about their children aged 3-12 years. The results show families' lack of interest in applying the WHO standards and the guidelines of the Saudi Ministry of Health regarding children's regular daily physical activity. The families are reluctant to involve children in sports clubs. The parents desire to employ crews that enhance the movement and recreational activities of children in shopping centers and parks. The results also show that the presence of the father and mother together inside the house and their educational level have an impact on the effectiveness of the positive reinforcement of the active lifestyle of the children. To promote an active lifestyle for children, there is a need to determine why some families are hesitant to enroll their children in sports clubs. Additionally, there is a need to develop media and awareness campaigns for families in order to achieve the desired goals of developing an active lifestyle for children, which are approved by the WHO and Saudi Ministry of Health standards and are consistent with families' low educational levels."
https://openalex.org/W4297262173,"Epidemiological surveillance systems for pathogens in wild species have been proposed as a preventive measure for epidemic events. These systems can minimize the detrimental effects of an outbreak, but most importantly, passive surveillance systems are the best adapted to countries with limited resources. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the technical and infrastructural feasibility of establishing this type of scheme in Costa Rica by implementing a pilot program targeting the detection of pathogens of zoonotic and conservation importance in wildlife. Between 2018 and 2020, 85 carcasses of free-ranging vertebrates were admitted for post-mortem and microbiology analysis. However, we encountered obstacles mainly related to the initial identification of cases and limited local logistics capacity. Nevertheless, this epidemiological surveillance scheme allowed us to estimate the general state of health of the country's wildlife by establishing the causes of death according to pathological findings. For instance, 60% (51/85) of the deaths were not directly associated with an infectious agent. Though in 37.6% (32/85) of these cases an infectious agent associated or not with disease was detected. In 27.1% (23/85) of the cases, death was directly related to infectious agents. Furthermore, 12.9% (11/85), the cause of death was not determined. Likewise, this wildlife health monitoring program allowed the detection of relevant pathogens such as Canine Distemper Virus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Angiostrongylus spp., Baylisascaris spp., among others. Our research demonstrated that this passive surveillance scheme is cost-effective and feasible in countries with limited resources. This passive surveillance can be adapted to the infrastructure dedicated to monitoring diseases in productive animals according to the scope and objectives of monitoring wildlife specific to each region. The information generated from the experience of the initial establishment of a WHMP is critical to meeting the challenges involved in developing this type of scheme in regions with limited resources and established as hotspots for emerging infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4297263118,"Introduction Patients living with progressive chronic kidney disease may face a variety of ongoing physical, emotional, financial and/or social challenges along the disease pathway. In most UK renal units, psychosocial support has traditionally been provided by a renal social worker. However, in recent years, the numbers of renal social workers have been declining. The specialised role is poorly understood and there is no UK research about the profession. To inform future research and guide workforce planning, this study presents the first-ever exploration of the UK renal social worker role. It aimed to map the profession’s activities and reasons for involvement in patient care, as well as providing an initial evaluation of that involvement on patient wellbeing. Methods and analysis This mixed-method study recruited adult renal social workers (n = 14), who completed diaries over a 4-month period, participated in a focus group, and provided secondary data (caseload data and audit files where available) to give insight into their role. The evaluation of social work involvement on patient wellbeing used a pre-post intervention design. It measured distress, anxiety and depression levels as captured by the Distress Thermometer and Emotional Thermometers. A total of 161 patients completed the pre-involvement questionnaire, and 87 (55%) returned the post-involvement questionnaire. Results and conclusion The renal social worker role is creative, broad and fluid, with variations in roles linked to differences in employment and funding arrangements, configurations of the wider multidisciplinary renal team, level of standardisation of psychosocial care, availability of community services, and staff-to-patient ratios. Renal social work is different from statutory social work, and renal social workers are generally able to offer continuous rather than episodic care and support patients that would not meet strict local authority eligibility criteria. The findings showed that this support leads to significantly reduced distress and anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W4296977296,"Abstract Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) patients show poor survival rates and there are few targeted molecular therapies available. However, components of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) driven pathways are commonly mutated in OAC, typified by high frequency amplifications of the RTK ERBB2 . ERBB2 can be therapeutically targeted, but this has limited clinical benefit due to the acquisition of drug resistance. Here we examined how OAC cells adapt to ERBB2 inhibition as they transition to a drug resistant state. ERBB2 inhibition triggers widespread remodelling of the accessible chromatin landscape and the underlying gene regulatory networks. The transcriptional regulators HNF4A and PPARGC1A play a key role in this network rewiring. Initially, inhibition of cell cycle associated gene expression programmes is observed, with compensatory increases in the programmes driving changes in metabolic activity. Both PPARGC1A and HNF4A are required for the acquisition of resistance to ERBB2 inhibition and PPARGC1A is instrumental in promoting a switch to dependency on oxidative phosphorylation. Our work therefore reveals the molecular pathways that support the acquisition of a resistant state and points to potential new therapeutic strategies to combat cellular adaptation and ensuing drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4296984358,"Coronavirus disease represents a real threat to the global population, and understanding the biological features of the causative virus, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is imperative for mitigating this threat. Analyses of proteins such as primary receptors and coreceptors (cofactors), which are involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, will provide important clues to help control the virus. Here, we identified host cell membrane protein candidates present in proximity to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, using proximity labeling and proteomic analysis. The identified proteins represent key candidate factors that may be required for viral entry. We found SARS-CoV-2 host protein DPP4, cell adhesion protein Cadherin 17, and glycoprotein CD133 colocalized with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2 cells and thus showed potential as candidate factors. Additionally, our analysis of the experimental infection of HEK293T cells with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus indicated a 2-fold enhanced infectivity in the CD133-ACE2-coexpressing HEK293T cells compared to that in HEK293T cells expressing ACE-2 alone. The information and resources regarding these coreceptor labeling and analysis techniques could be utilized for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses."
https://openalex.org/W4296984758,"The great diversity in actin network architectures and dynamics is exploited by cells to drive fundamental biological processes, including cell migration, endocytosis, and cell division. While it is known that this versatility is the result of the many actin-remodeling activities of actin-binding proteins, such as Arp2/3 and cofilin, recent work also implicates posttranslational acetylation or arginylation of the actin N terminus itself as an equally important regulatory mechanism. However, the molecular mechanisms by which acetylation and arginylation alter the properties of actin are not well understood. Here, we directly compare how processing and modification of the N terminus of actin affects its intrinsic polymerization dynamics and its remodeling by actin-binding proteins that are essential for cell migration. We find that in comparison to acetylated actin, arginylated actin reduces intrinsic as well as formin-mediated elongation and Arp2/3-mediated nucleation. By contrast, there are no significant differences in cofilin-mediated severing. Taken together, these results suggest that cells can employ these differently modified actins to regulate actin dynamics. In addition, unprocessed actin with an N-terminal methionine residue shows very different effects on formin-mediated elongation, Arp2/3-mediated nucleation, and severing by cofilin. Altogether, this study shows that the nature of the N terminus of actin can promote distinct actin network dynamics, which can be differentially used by cells to locally finetune actin dynamics at distinct cellular locations, such as at the leading edge."
https://openalex.org/W4297265641,"Evaluation of the clinical performance of ultra-low-dose computed tomography (CT) images of the shoulder joint on image-based diagnosis and three-dimensional (3D) printing surgical planning.A total of 93 patients with displaced shoulder fractures were randomly divided into standard-dose, low-dose, and ultra-low-dose groups. Three-dimensional printing models of all patients' shoulder joints were fabricated. The subjective image quality and 3D-printing model were evaluated by two senior orthopedic surgeons who were blinded to any scanning setting. A 3-point scale system was used to quantitatively assess the image quality and 3D printing model, where more than 2 points meant adequate level for clinical application.Compared with the standard dose protocol, ultra-low-dose technique reduced the radiation dose by 99.29% without loss of key image quality of fracture pattern. Regarding the subjective image quality, the assessment scores for groups of standard, low, and ultra-low doses were 3.00, 2.76, 2.00 points on scapula and humerus, and 3.00, 2.73, 2.44 points on clavicle. Scores of the three groups for the assessment of 3D printing models were 3.00, 2.80, 1.34 on scapula and humerus, and 3.00, 2.90, 2.06 on clavicle. In the ultra-low-dose group, 24 out of 33 (72.7%) 3D printing models of scapula and humerus received lower than 2 points of the evaluation score, while nearly 94% of the clavicle models reached the adequate level.An ultra-low-dose protocol is adequate for the diagnosis of either displaced or non-displaced fractures of the shoulder joint even though minor flaws of images are present. Three-dimensional printing models of shoulder joints created from ultra-low-dose CT scans can be used for surgical planning at specific bone like the clavicle but perform insufficiently in the overall surgical planning for shoulder injuries due to the significant geometric flaws."
https://openalex.org/W4296641386,"The heme enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is one of the key players in the neutrophil-mediated killing of invading pathogens as part of the innate immune system. MPO generates antimicrobial oxidants, which indiscriminately and effectively kill phagocytosed pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus, however, is able to escape this fate, in part by secreting a small protein called SPIN (Staphylococcal Peroxidase Inhibitor), which specifically targets and inhibits MPO in a structurally complex manner. Here, we present the first crystal structures of the complex of SPIN-aureus and a truncated version (SPIN-truncated) with mature dimeric leukocyte MPO. We unravel the contributions of the two domains to the kinetics and thermodynamics of SPIN-aureus binding to MPO by using a broad array of complementary biochemical and biophysical methods. The C-terminal ""recognition"" domain is shown to mediate specific binding to MPO, while interaction of the N-terminal ""inhibitory"" domain is guided mainly by hydrophobic effects and thus is less sequence dependent. We found that inhibition of MPO is achieved by reducing substrate migration, but SPIN-aureus cannot completely block MPO activity. Its' effectiveness is inversely related to substrate size, with no discernible dependence on other factors. Thus, SPIN-aureus is an extremely high-affinity inhibitor and highly efficient for substrates larger than halogens. As aberrant MPO activity is implicated in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases, SPIN-aureus is the first promising protein inhibitor for specific inhibition of human MPO."

To address these problems, we propose an underwater image enhancement method by combining Retinex and transmittance optimized multi-scale fusion framework. Firstly, the grayscale of R, G, and B channels are quantized to enhance the image contrast. Secondly, we utilize the Retinex color constancy to eliminate the negative effects of scene illumination and color distortion. Next, a dual transmittance underwater imaging model is built to estimate the background light, backscattering, and direct component transmittance, resulting in defogged images through an inverse solution. Finally, the three input images and corresponding weight maps are fused in a multi-scale framework to achieve high-quality, sharpened results. According to the experimental results and image quality evaluation index, the method combined multiple advantageous algorithms and improved the visual effect of images efficiently."

There were 151 residents aged 18 years or above recruited for this study. Information regarding exposure to messages about risk factors of NCDs, and activities of VHWs was collected via face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify associated factors with exposing messages about NCD-related risk factors.The majority of participants heard about messages related to risk factors of NCDs in the last 30 days, from 56.3% (physical inactivity message), 59.6% (diet message), 75.5% (alcohol use message) to 79.5% (smoking message). Radio/television was the most common source of the messages (from 91.8% to 95.8%) and the majority of participants heard these messages from one source (from 77.1% to 80.9%). Most of sample reported the unavailability of VHWs in their locals (53.6%). Among locals having VHWs, health communication and education was the most common service provided (54.3%); however, only 30% received NCD management services. Participants who had other jobs were less likely to hear about diet-related messages (OR = 0.32; 95%CI = 0.11-0.92), and those ever smoking were more likely to hear these messages in the last 30 days (OR = 6.86; 95%CI = 1.06-44.51). People who had diabetes mellitus were more likely to hear physical activity-related messages in the last 30 days (OR = 2.55; 95%CI = 1.20-5.41).Our findings indicated that health communication regarding risk factors of NCDs in mountainous areas in Vietnam was insufficient, and the role of health workers as formal information source was not recognized. Efforts should be made to increase the capacity and involvement of VHWs in health education and NCD prevention in mountainous regions."
https://openalex.org/W4297253608,"Pest control by biological means is an effective, eco-friendly, and promising method that typically involves compounds naturally derived from actinomycetes. Thus, the present study aimed to screen, characterize, and identify the structure of insecticidal compounds from Streptomyces sp. KR0006 and increase the activity through mutagenesis. In the examination of the insecticidal activity level of the isolates, Streptomyces sp. KR0006 metabolite showed significant activity against larvae and moths of Plutella xylostella . Taxonomic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolated KR0006 strain tended to be 99% consistent with Streptomyces cinereoruber strain NBRC 12756. Three active compounds isolated from the culture filtrate of KR0006 were purified by solvent partition, mid-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC), Sephadex LH20 column chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). By performing 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, and 2D-NMR experiments, and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis, the 316-HP2, 316-HP3, and 316-HP5 compounds were inferred as antimycin A3a (MW, 519.; C 26 H 36 N 2 O 9 ), antimycin A8a (MW, 534; C 27 H 38 N 2 O 9 ), and antimycin A1a (MW, 548; C 28 H 40 N 2 O 9 ) respectively. Mutant U67 obtained from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (254 nm, height 17 cm) for 70 seconds resulted in a 70% more larval mortality than that of the initial wild culture. The second mutation of the culture broth enhanced insecticidal activity by 80 and 100% compared with the first mutation and initial medium, respectively. Our study found that Streptomyces sp. KR0006 strain produces insecticidal active compounds and could be used for practical pest management."
https://openalex.org/W4297253939,"The microbiota gut-brain-axis is a bidirectional circuit that links the neural, endocrine, and immunological systems with gut microbial communities. The gut microbiome plays significant roles in human mind and behavior, specifically pain perception, learning capacity, memory, and temperament. Studies have shown that disruptions in the gut microbiota have been associated with substance use disorders. The interplay of gut microbiota in substance abuse disorders has not been elucidated; however, postmortem microbiome profiles may produce promising avenues for future forensic investigations. The goal of the current study was to determine gut microbiome composition in substance abuse disorder cases using transverse colon tissues of 21 drug overdose versus 19 non-overdose-related cases. We hypothesized that postmortem samples of the same cause of death will reveal similar microbial taxonomic relationships. We compared microbial diversity profiles using amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 hypervariable region. The results demonstrated that the microbial abundance in younger-aged cases were found to have significantly more operational taxonomic units than older cases. Using weighted UniFrac analysis, the influence of substances in overdose cases was found to be a significant factor in determining microbiome similarity. The results also revealed that samples of the same cause of death cluster together, showing a high degree of similarity between samples and a low degree of similarity among samples of different causes of death. In conclusion, our examination of human transverse colon microflora in decomposing remains extends emerging literature on postmortem microbial communities, which will ultimately contribute to advanced knowledge of human putrefaction."
https://openalex.org/W4297256708,"Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to infection. Furthermore, infection from pertussis, influenza and COVID-19 increases the likelihood of adverse consequences to the mother and developing baby such as stillbirth, ICU admission, and pre-term caesarean birth. Increased rates of transmission and risk of adverse consequences from infection justifies the provision of national maternal vaccination programmes. Additionally, maternal vaccination helps protect the infant until they are able to receive their own vaccinations; a time when they are most at risk of mortality from influenza and pertussis. Vaccination during pregnancy has been repeatedly demonstrated as safe and effective in reducing harm, although rates of uptake remain low compared to the general population. The current protocol describes the methodology for an umbrella review aiming to explore the barriers and facilitators of vaccination during pregnancy for pertussis, influenza, and COVID-19. Systematic reviews that investigate the barriers and facilitators of at least one of either pertussis, influenza, or COVID-19 will be included in this review. Multiple databases will be searched, and included reviews assessed for quality (using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) quality assessment for systematic reviews) and degree of overlap of included primary studies. Included reviews will be analysed according to the WHO SAGE model of determinants of vaccine hesitancy and separated by whether these explore influenza and pertussis, or COVID-19. The outcomes of this review will help inform the development of interventions to increase uptake of vaccination during pregnancy, and on whether interventions need to be tailored depending on the infectious disease. The key findings will identify the specific barriers and facilitators of vaccination hesitancy by considering contextual influences (e.g. sociodemographic variables), individual/social group influences (e.g. trust in the institutions), and vaccine-specific issues (e.g. safety and recommendations)."
https://openalex.org/W4297257121,"To compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom burden following meningioma resection in patients from two samples from Australia and India. This will add to the body of data on the longer-term consequences of living with a meningioma in two socio-economically and culturally different countries.The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), Brain Neoplasm Module (QLQ-BN20) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to 159 Australian and 92 Indian meningioma patients over 24 months postoperative. A linear mixed model analysis identified differences between groups over time.Australian patients reported better physical functioning in the early months after surgery (T1: mean diff: 19.8, p<0.001; T2: mean diff: 12.5, p = 0.016) whereas Indian patients reported better global HRQoL (mean: -20.3, p<0.001) and emotional functioning (mean diff:-15.6, p = 0.020) at 12-24 months. In general, Australian patients reported more sleep and fatigue symptoms while Indian patients reported more gastro-intestinal symptoms over the 2-year follow-up. Future uncertainty and symptoms common for brain tumour patients were consistently more commonly reported by patients in Australia than in India. No differences for depression and anxiety were identified.This is the first cross cultural study to directly compare postoperative HRQoL in meningioma patients. Some differences in HRQoL domains and symptom burden may be explained by culturally intrinsic reporting of symptoms, as well as higher care support from family members in India. Although there were differences in some HRQoL domains, clinically meaningful differences between the two samples were less common than perhaps expected. This may be due to an Indian sample with high literacy and financial resources to afford surgery and follow up care."
https://openalex.org/W4297258019,"Understanding the sensitivity of species-level responses to long-term warming will become increasingly important as we look towards a warmer future. Here, we examine photosymbiont associations in planktic foraminifera at Shatsky Rise (ODP Site 1209, Pacific Ocean) across periods of global warming of differing magnitude and duration. We compare published data from the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~55.9 Ma) with data from the less intense Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2; ~54.0 Ma), and H2 events (~53.9 Ma). We use a positive relationship between test size and carbon isotope value (size-δ13C) in foraminifera shells as a proxy for photosymbiosis in Morozovella subbotinae and Acarinina soldadoensis, and find no change in photosymbiont associations during the less intense warming events, in contrast with PETM records indicating a shift in symbiosis in A. soldadoensis (but not M. subbotinae). Declines in abundance and differing preservation potential of the asymbiotic species Subbotina roesnaesensis along with sediment mixing likely account for diminished differences in δ13C between symbiotic and asymbiotic species from the PETM and ETM2. We therefore conclude that photosymbiont associations were maintained in both A. soldadoensis and M. subbotinae across ETM2 and H2. Our findings support one or both of the hypotheses that 1) changing symbiotic associations in response to warming during the PETM allowed A. soldadoensis and perhaps other acarininids to thrive through subsequent hyperthermals or 2) some critical environmental threshold value was not reached in these less intense hyperthermals."
https://openalex.org/W4297258026,"Interventions that can help streamline and reduce gaps in the tuberculosis (TB) care cascade can play crucial roles in TB prevention and care, but are often operationally complex and resource intensive, given the heterogenous settings in which they are implemented. In this study, we present a comparative analysis on cost-effectiveness of TB REACH Wave 5 projects with diverse programmatic objectives to inform future decisions regarding funding, strategic adoption, and scale-up.We comprehensively reviewed project reports and financial statements from TB REACH Wave 5, a funding mechanism for interventions that aimed to strengthen the TB care cascade in diverse settings. Two independent reviewers abstracted cost (in 2017 US dollars) and key programmatic data, including project type (case-finding only; case-finding and linkage-to-care; or case-finding, linkage-to-care and patient support), operational setting (urban or rural), and project outputs (numbers of people with TB diagnosed, started on treatment, and successfully completing treatment). Cost-effectiveness ratios for each project were calculated as ratios of apportioned programmatic expenditures to corresponding project outputs.Of 32 case finding and patient support projects funded through TB REACH Wave 5, 29 were included for analysis (11 case-finding only; 9 case-finding and linkage-to-care; and 9 case-finding, linkage-to-care and patient support). 21 projects (72%) were implemented in either Africa or Southeast Asia, and 19 (66%) focused on serving urban areas. Average cost-effectiveness was $184 per case diagnosed (range: $30-$10,497), $332 per diagnosis and treatment initiation ($123-$10,608), and $40 per patient treatment supported ($8-$160). Cost per case diagnosed was lower for case-finding-only projects ($132) than projects including linkage-to-care ($342) or linkage-to-care and patient support ($254), and generally increased with the corresponding country's per-capita GDP ($543 per $1000 increase, 95% confidence interval: -$53, $1138).The costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions to strengthen the TB care cascade were heterogenous, reflecting differences in context and programmatic objective. Nevertheless, many such interventions are likely to offer good value for money. Systematic collection and analysis of cost-effectiveness data can help improve comparability, monitoring, and evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4297261082,"Cutibacterium acnes is a pathogenic bacterium that cause inflammatory diseases of the skin and intervertebral discs. The immune activation induced by C. acnes requires multiple cellular responses in the host. Silkworm, an invertebrate, generates melanin by phenoloxidase upon recognizing bacterial or fungal components. Therefore, the melanization reaction can be used as an indicator of innate immune activation. A silkworm infection model was developed for evaluating the virulence of C. acnes, but a system for evaluating the induction of innate immunity by C. acnes using melanization as an indicator has not yet been established. Here we demonstrated that C. acnes rapidly causes melanization of the silkworm hemolymph. On the other hand, Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium identical to C. acnes, does not cause immediate melanization. Even injection of heat-killed C. acnes cells caused melanization of the silkworm hemolymph. DNase, RNase, and protease treatment of the heat-treated C. acnes cells did not decrease the silkworm hemolymph melanization. Treatment with peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes, such as lysostaphin and lysozyme, however, decreased the induction of melanization by the heat-treated C. acnes cells. These findings suggest that silkworm hemolymph melanization may be a useful indicator to evaluate innate immune activation by C. acnes and that C. acnes peptidoglycans are involved in the induction of innate immunity in silkworms."
https://openalex.org/W4297263948,"Assessment of hip joint reaction force (JRF) is one of the analytical methods that can enable an understanding of the healthy walking index and the propensity towards disease. In this study, we have designed software, Analysis Q Hip Force (AQHF), to analyze the data retrieved from the mathematical equations for calculating the JRF and ground reaction force (GRF) that act on the hip joint during the early part of the stance phase. The stance phase is considered the least stable sub-phase during walking on level ground, and the gait stability is sequentially minimized during walking on elevated ramps. We have calculated the JRF and GRF values of walking stances on varied inclinations. The data obtained from these calculations during walking on elevated ramps were exported from mathematical equations to Q Hip Force software as two separate values, namely the JRF data and GRF data of the hip joint. The Q Hip Force software stores the two reaction force data in a text file, which allows the import and easy readability of the analyzed data with the AQHF application. The input and output data from the AQHF software were used to investigate the effect of different walking ramps on the magnitude of the hip JRF and GRF. The result of this study demonstrates a significant correlation between the JRF/GRF values and healthy walking indices till a ramp elevation of 70°. The software is designed to calculate and extrapolate data to analyze the possibility of stress in the hip joint. The framework developed in this study shows promise for preclinical and clinical applications. Studies are underway to use the results of JRF and GRF values as a diagnostic and prognostic tools in different diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4296984457,"Vi antigen is an extracellular polysaccharide produced by Salmonella enterica Typhi, Citrobacter freundii, and some soil bacteria belonging to the Burkholderiales. In Salmonella Typhi, Vi-antigen capsule protects the bacterium against host defenses, and the glycan is used in a current glycoconjugate vaccine to protect against typhoid. Vi antigen is a glycolipid assembled in the cytoplasm and translocated to the cell surface by an export complex driven by an ABC transporter. In Salmonella Typhi, efficient export and cell-surface retention of the capsule layer depend on a reducing terminal acylated-HexNAc moiety. Although the precise structure and biosynthesis of the acylated terminus has not been resolved, it distinguishes Vi antigen from other known glycolipid substrates for bacterial ABC transporters. The genetic locus for Vi antigen-biosynthesis encodes a single acyltransferase candidate (VexE), which is implicated in the acylation process. Here, we determined the structure of the VexE in vitro reaction product by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy to reveal that VexE catalyzes β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dependent acylation of the activated sugar precursor, uridine-5'-diphospho-GlcNAc, at C-6 to form UDP-6-O-[β-hydroxymyristoyl]-α-d-GlcNAc. VexE belongs to the lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase family, and comparison of an Alphafold VexE model to solved lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase structures, together with modeling enzyme:substrate complexes, led us to predict an enzyme mechanism. This study provides new insight into Vi terminal structure, offers a new model substrate to investigate the mechanism of glycolipid ABC transporters, and adds biochemical understanding for a novel reaction used in the synthesis of an important bacterial virulence factor."

However, the evidence base for effectively integrating HIV and NCD care is limited. The Chronic Health Care (CHC) checklist, designed to screen for multiple NCDs including a 6-item diabetes self-report screener, was implemented at two PEPFAR-supported HIV clinics in Kabwe and Kitwe, Zambia. Study objectives were to describe the HIV care and treatment population and their self-reported diabetes-related symptoms, and to evaluate provider-initiated screening and referral post-training on the CHC checklist. This cross-sectional study enrolled 435 adults receiving combination ART services. Clinic exit interviews revealed 46% self-reported at least one potential symptom, and 6% self-reported three or more symptoms to the study team, indicating risk for diabetes and need for further diagnostic testing. In comparison, only 8% of all participants reported being appropriately screened for diabetes by their health provider, with less than 1% referred for further testing. This missed opportunity for screening and referral indicates that HIV-NCD integration efforts need more fully resourced and multi-pronged approaches in order to ensure that PLWH who are already accessing ART receive the comprehensive, holistic care they need."
https://openalex.org/W4297249037,"Recent research has pointed to cross-cultural differences with regard to preferences for the directions that societies should take in their development. From an individual's perspective, these directions might be understood as 'goals', i.e., internal representations of desired end states. To date, research on individual differences that determine preferences for such directions is scarce. However, people's motivational concerns, i.e., what they fundamentally value, may shape their views about the desired paths for their country's future. The role of such motivational concerns has been described by regulatory focus theory, which distinguishes between promotion concerns related to advancement needs and prevention concerns linked with security needs. The overall aim of this project is to map the different pathways of societal development with regulatory focus concerns. This will be achieved in two studies. In Study 1, a group concept mapping method will be employed, and leading psychologists will assess the extent to which various societal development goals represent promotion and prevention goals. Based on these ratings, a two-dimensional map of the goals will be created and presented to the same experts, who will be asked to create goal clusters based on their proximity with regard to promotion and prevention ratings. This study will reveal which societal development directions have promotion concerns that outweigh prevention concerns (and vice versa) and which are both high (or low) on these dimensions. This initial mapping will be corroborated in correlational Study 2 with representative samples from two countries differing in dominating regulatory orientations (Poland vs. USA). Here, the roles of individual promotion and prevention orientations in preferences for specific societal development directions will be evaluated. This project will provide new insights into the roles of individual motivational systems in preferences for goals that might be pursued in country development."
https://openalex.org/W4297250186,"Device-based algorithms offer the potential for automated optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), but the process for accepting them into clinical use is currently still ad-hoc, rather than based on pre-clinical and clinical testing of specific features of validity. We investigated how the QuickOpt-guided VV delay (VVD) programming performs against the clinical and engineering heuristic of QRS complex shortening by CRT.A prospective, 2-center study enrolled 37 consecutive patients with CRT. QRS complex duration (QRSd) was assessed during intrinsic atrioventricular conduction, synchronous biventricular pacing, and biventricular pacing with QuickOpt-proposed VVD. The measurements were done manually by electronic calipers in signal-averaged and magnified 12-lead QRS complexes.Native QRSd was 174 ± 22 ms. Biventricular pacing with empiric AVD and synchronous VVD resulted in QRSd 156 ± 20 ms, a significant narrowing from the baseline QRSd by 17 ± 27 ms, P = 0.0003. In 36 of 37 patients, the QuickOpt algorithm recommended left ventricular preexcitation with VVD of 42 ± 18 ms (median 40 ms; interquartile range 30-55 ms, P <0.00001). QRSd in biventricular pacing with QuickOpt-based VVD was significantly longer compared with synchronous biventricular pacing (168 ± 25 ms vs. 156 ± 20 ms; difference 12 ± 11ms; P <0.00001). This prolongation correlated with the absolute VVD value (R = 0.66, P <0.00001).QuickOpt algorithm systematically favours a left-preexcitation VVD which translates into a significant prolongation of the QRSd compared to synchronous biventricular pacing. There is no reason to believe that a manipulation that systematically widens QRSd should be considered to optimize physiology. Device-based CRT optimization algorithms should undergo systematic mechanistic pre-clinical evaluation in various scenarios before they are tested in large clinical studies."

Machine learning methods also generate covariance and portfolio weight structures that are more difficult to assess. The least change portfolios outperform simpler benchmarks in minimizing risk.

However, there has been little empirical research on the lifestyles of elite athletes. Therefore, this study aimed to develop knowledge about the Iranian elite athletes' lifestyle. The study was conducted with a qualitative approach in two phases. Glaserian grounded theory was used in the first phase, and thematic analysis was used in the second phase. Participants of the first phase included 19 sports experts, such as sports sociologists, sports psychologists, and sports coaches, who were selected by purposive and snowball sampling methods for holding unstructured in-depth interviews. The data were simultaneously analyzed using a set of open, theoretical, selective coding and memos. The codes were grouped into three different categories with different natures. The emerged theory advanced our understanding of the lifestyle shaping structures of elite athletes, lifestyle indicators, and even professionalization of their lifestyles. According to the results, the Iranian elite athletes' lifestyles include indicators, such as professional mindset, competencies, life vision, financial literacy, responsibility, consumption, leisure, personal issues, and religious behavior. Subjects of the second phase were 44 Iranian athletes in the national levels who participated voluntarily in the study. The data were analyzed by thematic analysis method, and lifestyles typologies were identified. Based on results, five dominant lifestyles among the Iranian elite athletes were identified: consumerist, easy going, socially useful, profit-oriented, and professional.

Even though we can reach long-term response to this treatment in approximately 20% of patients with NSCLC, we are still not able to identify this cohort of patients based on predictive biomarkers. In our study we have focused on tumor mutation burden (TMB), one of the potential biomarkers which could predict effectiveness of check-point inhibitors, but has several limitations, especially in multiple approaches to TMB quantification and ununiform threshold. We determined the value of TMB in tumor tissue (tTMB) and blood (bTMB) in 20 patients with early stage NSCLC using original custom gene panel LMB_TMB1. We evaluated various possibilities of TMB calculation and concluded that TMB should be counted from both somatic non-synonymous and synonymous mutations. Considering various factors, we established cut-offs of tTMB in/excluding HLA genes as ≥22 mut/Mb and 12 mut/Mb respectively, and cut-offs of bTMB were defined as ≥21 mut/Mb and ≥5 mut/Mb, respectively. We also observed trend in correlation of somatic mutations in HLA genes with overall survival of patients."

The current study aimed to develop and validate (psychometric and psychological responses) audio-based GI and PMR techniques for bloating. Audio scripts were first developed from literature reviews and in-depth interviews of participants with bloating diagnosed based on the Rome IV criteria. Scripts were validated using psychometric (content &amp; face validity index) and physiological approaches (brain event-related potentials &amp; heart rate variability). 45/63 participants completed the in-depth interview, and ‘balloon’ emerged as the synonymous imagery description for bloating, of which inflation correlated with a painful sensation. The final tools consisted of narrated audio scripts in the background of a validated choice of music. Overall, the content and face validity index for PMR and GI ranged from 0.92 to 1.00. For ERP and HRV, 17/20 participants were analyzed. For ERP, there was a significant difference between GI and PMR for alpha waves (p = 0.029), delta waves (p = 0.029), and between PMR and control for delta waves (p = 0.014). For HRV, GI and PMR exhibited similar autonomic responses over controls (overall p&lt;0.05).

In the biopsy-first group, embryos were cultured to expanded blastocyst and proceed to TE biopsy on day 5 or day 6 followed by cryopreservation. In the freeze all-first, blastocysts were vitrified and warmed before biopsy. Rates of clinical pregnancy (52.3% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.09) and ongoing pregnancy (44.3% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.07) in biopsy-first were significantly higher than those in freeze all-first. Biopsy-first showed comparable miscarriage rate with freeze all-first (15.2% (33/217) vs.11.1% (10/90), respectively). Rate ratio (RR) for clinical pregnancy was lower in freeze all-first group (adjusted RR = 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.65, 0.93). The RRs for miscarriage and live birth was also lower but it did not reach statistical significance. Our result supported performing TE biopsy of blastocyst for PGT-A before vitrification and warming. This finding would contribute to more evidence-based decision in PGT-A cycles."
https://openalex.org/W4297256590,"Metabolomics provides a powerful tool to study physiological changes in response to various perturbations such as vaccination. We explored whether metabolomic changes could be seen after vaccination in a phase I trial where Gabonese adults living either in rural or semi-urban areas received the subunit hookworm vaccine candidates (Na-GST-1 and Na-APR-1 (M74) adjuvanted with Alhydrogel plus GLA-AF (n = 24) or the hepatitis B vaccine (n = 8) as control. Urine samples were collected and assayed using targeted 1H NMR spectroscopy. At baseline, a set of metabolites significantly distinguished rural from semi-urban individuals. The pre- and post-vaccination comparisons indicated significant changes in few metabolites but only one day after the first vaccination. There was no relationship with immunogenicity. In conclusion, in a small phase 1 trial, urinary metabolomics could distinguish volunteers with different environmental exposures and reflected the safety of the vaccines but did not show a relationship to immunogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W4297259792,"Maintaining critical care for non-Coronavirus-disease-2019 (non-COVID-19) patients is a key pillar of tackling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to reveal the medium-term impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on case volumes and quality of intensive care for critically ill non-COVID-19 patients.Administrative data were used to investigate the trends in case volumes of admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) compared with the previous years. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of non-COVID-19 ICU patients were calculated in each wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan.The ratios of new ICU admissions of non-COVID-19 patients to those in the corresponding months before the epidemic: 21% in May 2020, 8% in August 2020, 9% in February 2021, and 14% in May 2021, approximately concurrent with the peaks in COVID-19 infections. The decrease was greatest for new ICU admissions of non-COVID patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) on the first day of ICU admission: 26%, 15%, 19%, and 19% in the first, second, third, and fourth waves, respectively. No statistically significant change in SMR was observed in any wave of the epidemic; SMRs were 0.990 (95% uncertainty interval (UI), 0.962-1.019), 0.979 (95% UI, 0.953-1.006), 0.996 (95% UI, 0.980-1.013), and 0.989 (95% UI, 0.964-1.014), in the first, second, third, and fourth waves of the epidemic, respectively.Compared to the previous years, the number of non-COVID-19 ICU patients continuously decreased over the medium term during the COVID-19 epidemic. The decrease in case volumes was larger in non-COVID-19 ICU patients initially receiving IMV than those undergoing other initial treatments. The standardized in-hospital mortality of non-COVID-19 ICU patients did not change in any waves of the epidemic."

OR [95% CI]: 0.83 [0.71, 0.96]) and more likely to receive other steroids corticosteroids (adj. OR [95% CI]: 2.13 [1.90, 2.39]), relative to White patients. Hispanic/Latino patients were less likely to receive dexamethasone than Not Hispanic/Latino patients (adj. OR [95% CI]: 0.69 [0.58, 0.82]).Our findings suggest that COVID-19 treatments patients received in Optum varied by race and ethnicity after adjustment for other possible explanatory factors. In the face of rapidly evolving treatment landscapes, policies are needed to ensure equitable access to novel and repurposed therapeutics to avoid disparities in care by race and ethnicity."
https://openalex.org/W4297259956,"Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) targets for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes remain controversial. To evaluate whether baseline HbA1c and HbA1c trajectories are associated with the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and all-cause mortality, we recruited adult patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes from a ""Pre-ESKD Program"" at a medical center in Taiwan from 2003 to 2017. Group-based trajectory modeling was performed to identify distinct patient groups that contained patients with similar longitudinal HbA1c patterns. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of ESKD and mortality associated with baseline HbA1c levels and HbA1c trajectories. In the analysis related to baseline HbA1c (n = 4543), the adjusted HRs [95% confidence interval (CI)] of all-cause mortality were 1.06 (0.95-1.18) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46) in patients with an HbA1c level of 7%-9% (53-75 mmol/mol) and >9% (>75 mmol/mol), respectively, as compared with those with an HbA1c level < 7% (<53 mmol/mol). In the trajectory analysis (n = 2692), three distinct longitudinal HbA1c trajectories were identified: nearly optimal (55.9%), moderate to stable (34.2%), and poor control (9.9%). Compared with the ""nearly optimal"" HbA1c trajectory group, the ""moderate-to-stable"" group did not have significantly higher mortality, but the ""poorly controlled"" group had 35% higher risk of mortality (adjusted HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06-1.71). Neither baseline levels of HbA1c nor trajectories were associated with ESKD risk. In conclusion, in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, poor glycemic control was associated with an elevated risk of mortality but not associated with a risk of progression to ESKD."
https://openalex.org/W4297260888,"This research dealt with the problem of scheduling applied to the supercomputer’s execution. The goal is to develop an appreciated algorithm that schedules a group of several programs characterized by their time consuming very high on different supercomputers searching for an efficient assignment of the total running time. This efficient assignment grantees the fair load distribution of the execution on the supercomputers. The essential goal of this research is to propose several algorithms that can ensure the load balancing of the execution of all programs. In this research, all supercomputers are assumed to have the same hardware characteristics. The main objective is to minimize the gap between the total running time of the supercomputers. This minimization of the gap encompasses the development of novel solutions giving planning of the executable programs. Different algorithms are presented to minimize the gap in running time. The experimental study proves that the developed algorithms are efficient in terms of performance evaluation and running time. A comparison between the presented algorithms is discussed through different classes of instances where in total the number of instances reached 630. The experiments show that the efficient algorithm is the best-programs choice algorithm. Indeed, this algorithm reached the percentage of 72.86%, an average running time of 0.0121, and a gap value of 0.0545."
https://openalex.org/W4297261341,"This paper proposes Deep Semantic Mining based Recommendation (DSMR), which can extract user features and item attribute features more accurately by deeply mining the semantic information of review text and item description documents recommend. First, the proposed model uses the BERT pre-training model to process review texts and item description documents, and deeply mine user characteristics and item attributes, which effectively alleviates the problems of data sparseness and item cold start; Then, the forward LSTM is used to pay attention to the changes of user preferences over time, and a more accurate recommendation is obtained; finally, in the model training stage, the experimental data are randomly divided into 1 to 5 points, 1:1:1:1:1. Extraction ensures that the amount of data for each score is equal, so that the results are more accurate and the model is more robust. Experiments are carried out on four commonly used Amazon public data sets, and the results show that with the root mean square error as the evaluation index, the error of DSMR recommendation results is at least 11.95% lower on average than the two classic recommendation models based only on rating data. At the same time, it is better than the three latest recommendation models based on review text, and it is 5.1% lower than the best model on average."
https://openalex.org/W4297262528,"Parasite species richness is influenced by a range of drivers including host related factors (e.g. host size) and environmental factors (e.g. seawater temperature). However, identification of modulators of parasite species richness remains one of the great unanswered questions in ecology. The common cockle Cerastoderma edule is renowned for its diversity and abundance of parasites, yet drivers of parasite species richness in cockles have not been examined to investigate the association of both macro and microparasite communities. Using cockles as a model species, some of the key drivers of parasite prevalence and parasite species richness were investigated. Objectives of this 19-month survey were to determine the influence of the environment, host-parasite dynamics and parasite associations on parasite species richness and prevalence at two different geographic latitudes, chosen based on environmental differences. The highest parasite species richness was recorded in the northern sites, and this was potentially influenced by a range of interactions between the host, the pathogens and the environment. Parasite prevalence increased with host size and age, and parasite species richness increased with reduced salinity. A number of interactions between parasites, and between parasites and pathologies may be influencing parasite infection dynamics. New and concerning information is also presented regarding interactions between parasites and their environment. A number of parasites and potential pathogens (bacteria, Trichodina ciliates, metacercariae, trematode sporocysts) may be advantaged under climate change conditions (warming seas, increased precipitation), increasing disease incidence, which may prove detrimental not just for cockles, but for other bivalve species in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4297263254,"Habitat loss and fragmentation are two important drivers of biodiversity decline. Understanding how species respond to landscape composition and configuration in dynamic landscapes is of great importance for informing the conservation and management of grassland species. With limited conservation resources, prescribed management targeted at the appropriate landscape process is necessary for the effective management of species. We used pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) across South Dakota, USA as a model species to identify environmental factors driving spatiotemporal variation in population productivity. Using an emerging Hotspot analysis, we analyzed annual count data from 105 fixed pheasant brood routes over a 24-year period to identify high (HotSpot) and low (ColdSpot) pheasant population productivity areas. We then applied classification and regression tree modeling to evaluate landscape attributes associated with pheasant productivity among spatial scales (500 m and 1000 m). We found that the amount of grassland at a local spatial scale was the primary factor influencing an area being a HotSpot. Our results also demonstrated non-significant or weak effects of fragmentation per se on pheasant populations. These findings are in accordance with the habitat amount hypothesis highlighting the importance of habitat amount in the landscape for maintaining and increasing the pheasant population. We, therefore, recommend that managers should focus on increasing the total habitat area in the landscape and restoring degraded habitats. Our method of identifying areas of high productivity across the landscape can be applied to other species with count data."
https://openalex.org/W4297265935,"Background Diabetes causes the dysregulation of several organs, and these effects are often closely associated with changes in the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a group of non-coding RNAs, within these tissues. Previous studies have described a variety of changes in the expression profile of several lncRNAs from different organs in response to the pathogenesis of diabetes. However, none of these studies compared the expression profiles of these lncRNAs between these organs. This study was designed to identify common and specific lncRNAs involved in the progression of diabetes in the skeletal muscles and kidneys. Methods Publicly available RNA sequencing data of diabetic patients was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. By analyzing the expression of lncRNAs in these datasets, differentially expressed lncRNAs in each tissue between non-diabetic and diabetic patients were identified. To identify any lncRNAs changed in common in both kidney and muscle tissues, those lncRNAs that are significantly dysregulated in both datasets were selected. Results These evaluations identified a series of novel lncRNAs unique to each organ and several transcripts that were common to both skeletal muscle and kidney tissues in these patients. Interestingly, the genomic location of these lncRNAs suggests that they reside in close proximity to several protein-coding genes known to be related to diabetes suggesting that these lncRNAs may have a regulatory relationship with their neighboring genes. Conclusion These results offer valuable insights into the role of lncRNAs during the pathogenesis of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4297266309,"Background Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute to ongoing community transmission, however, the benefit of routine screening of asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations is unclear. Methods To identify SARS-CoV-2 infections 553 seronegative individuals were prospectively followed for 52 weeks. From 4/2020-7/2021, participants submitted weekly self-collected nasal swabs for rtPCR and completed symptom and exposure surveys. Results Incident SARS2-CoV-2 infections were identified in 9/553 (1.6%) participants. Comparisons of SARS2-CoV-2(+) to SARS2-CoV-2(-) participants revealed significantly more close contacts outside the household (median: 5 versus 3; p = 0.005). The incidence of infection was higher among unvaccinated/partially vaccinated than among fully vaccinated participants (9/7,679 versus 0/6,845 person-weeks; p = 0.004). At notification of positive test result, eight cases were symptomatic and one pre-symptomatic. Conclusions These data suggest that weekly SARS2-CoV2 surveillance by rtPCR did not efficiently detect pre-symptomatic infections in unvaccinated participants."
