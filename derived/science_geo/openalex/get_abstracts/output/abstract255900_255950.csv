https://openalex.org/W2097233732,"Here we report the genome sequence of the honeybee Apis mellifera, a key model for social behaviour and essential to global ecology through pollination. Compared with other sequenced insect genomes, the A. mellifera genome has high A+T and CpG contents, lacks major transposon families, evolves more slowly, and is more similar to vertebrates for circadian rhythm, RNA interference and DNA methylation genes, among others. Furthermore, A. mellifera has fewer genes for innate immunity, detoxification enzymes, cuticle-forming proteins and gustatory receptors, more genes for odorant receptors, and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, consistent with its ecology and social organization. Compared to Drosophila, genes in early developmental pathways differ in Apis, whereas similarities exist for functions that differ markedly, such as sex determination, brain function and behaviour. Population genetics suggests a novel African origin for the species A. mellifera and insights into whether Africanized bees spread throughout the New World via hybridization or displacement."
https://openalex.org/W2103211592,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22 nucleotide non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Although aberrant expression of miRNAs in various human cancers suggests a role for miRNAs in tumorigenesis, it remains largely unclear as to whether knockdown of a specific miRNA affects tumor growth. In this study, we profiled miRNA expression in matched normal breast tissue and breast tumor tissues by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction miRNA array methods. Consistent with previous findings, we found that miR-21 was highly overexpressed in breast tumors compared to the matched normal breast tissues among 157 human miRNAs analysed. To better evaluate the role of miR-21 in tumorigenesis, we transfected breast cancer MCF-7 cells with anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides and found that anti-miR-21 suppressed both cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, this anti-miR-21-mediated cell growth inhibition was associated with increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation, which could be in part owing to downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in anti-miR-21-treated tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that miR-21 functions as an oncogene and modulates tumorigenesis through regulation of genes such as bcl-2 and thus, it may serve as a novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2077991483,"The mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose triacylglycerol (TG) stores requires the activities of triacylglycerol lipases. In this study, we demonstrate that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) are the major enzymes contributing to TG breakdown in in vitro assays and in organ cultures of murine white adipose tissue (WAT). To differentiate between ATGL- and HSL-specific activities in cytosolic preparations of WAT and to determine the relative contribution of these TG hydrolases to the lipolytic catabolism of fat, mutant mouse models lacking ATGL or HSL and a mono-specific, small molecule inhibitor for HSL (76-0079) were used. We show that 76-0079 had no effect on TG catabolism in HSL-deficient WAT but, in contrast, essentially abolished free fatty acid mobilization in ATGL-deficient fat. CGI-58, a recently identified coactivator of ATGL, stimulates TG hydrolase activity in wild-type and HSL-deficient WAT but not in ATGL-deficient WAT, suggesting that ATGL is the sole target for CGI-58-mediated activation of adipose lipolysis. Together, ATGL and HSL are responsible for more than 95% of the TG hydrolase activity present in murine WAT. Additional known or unknown lipases appear to play only a quantitatively minor role in fat cell lipolysis.

In periods of increased energy demand, TG is hydrolyzed, and free fatty acids (FFA) are released into the circulation. The hydrolysis of TG is catalyzed by adipose tissue lipases in sequential steps leading to the formation of FFA and glycerol. The first step within the hydrolysis cascade generating FFA and diacylglycerol (DG) is rate-limiting for subsequent reactions. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) has long been considered as catalyzing this initial step. However, in recent years it became evident that at least one additional lipase must exist capable of hydrolyzing TG. Observations that HSL-deficient (HSL-ko) mice are not obese (1Osuga J.

In addition to HSL, three other lipases have been reported to be involved in adipose TG hydrolysis. Triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) is highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue and has been suggested to represent a major adipocyte lipase (5Soni K.G. Lehner R. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P.

The recently identified TGH-2 exhibits high homology to TGH and a similar tissue distribution pattern (6Okazaki H. Igarashi M. Nishi M. Tajima M. Sekiya M. Okazaki S. Yahagi N. Ohashi K. Tsukamoto K.

However, they are much more efficient in hydrolyzing substrates esterified with short-chain fatty acids compared with TG esterified with long-chain fatty acids (6Okazaki H. Igarashi M. Nishi M.

The drastic impairment of adipocyte lipolysis in ATGL inhibition studies in vitro indicates that the enzyme is responsible for most of the HSL-independent lipolytic activity (10Zimmermann R.

Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). ATGL-ko mice exhibited enlarged fat deposits and TG accumulation in multiple tissues. FFA release in response to isoproterenol is drastically reduced in ATGL-ko WAT, suggesting a key role of the enzyme in hormone-stimulated lipolysis. The most important activators of lipolysis are catecholamines, which increase cellular cAMP levels followed by the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (13Holm C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylates cytosolic HSL and the lipid droplet-associated protein, perilipin A. This process leads to the translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet where the enzyme gains access to TG stores (14Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both proteins is necessary for the initiation of HSL-mediated lipolysis (15Su C.L.

The regulation of ATGL activity appears to be quite different compared with that described for HSL. ATGL is not a target for PKA-mediated phosphorylation and is localized on the lipid droplet in the basal and hormone-stimulated state of the cell (10Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ATGL is not activated by translocation to the lipid substrate as demonstrated for HSL. Instead, ATGL activity is regulated by an activator protein annotated as α/β-fold domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5) (16Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M.

Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), also known as CGI-58 (comparative gene identification 58). Mutant forms of CGI-58 carrying point mutations or protein truncations have been identified as causative for Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) (17Lefevre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A.

Affected individuals accumulate TG in multiple tissues leading to the alternative designation, “neutral lipid storage disease” (18Chanarin I. Patel A. Slavin G. Wills E.J. Andrews T.M. Stewart G. Br.

Mutant forms of CGI-58 associated with CDS lose their ability to activate ATGL (16Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G.

Omatsu N. Matsushita S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30490-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These data indicate that TG accumulation in CDS is caused by defective ATGL activation (16Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the multi-systemic TG accumulation observed in ATGL-ko mice (12Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and in CDS suggests a similar function of CGI-58 and ATGL in humans and mice. To further define the contribution of ATGL and HSL to murine adipose lipolysis, we determined whether additional lipases are involved in the hydrolysis of TG and whether CGI-58 is capable of activating lipolysis in the absence of ATGL. Our results demonstrate that TG hydrolysis is almost abolished when both ATGL and HSL are inactivated. CGI-58 failed to activate lipolysis in ATGL-deficient WAT, suggesting that ATGL represents the sole lipase activated by CGI-58. Animals—Mice were maintained on a regular light-dark cycle (14 h light, 10 h dark) and kept on a standard laboratory chow diet (4.5% w/w fat). HSL-deficient and ATGL-deficient mice were generated by targeted homologous recombination as described (4Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M.

Animals used for experiments were 12 to 16 weeks of age. Mice kept ad libidum were killed by cervical dislocation between 8 and 10 a.m. Expression of Recombinant Proteins—GST-tagged murine CGI-58 (GST-CGI) was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified as described previously (16Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R.

Preparation of Tissue Cytosolic Extracts—Gonadal WAT of wild-type (WT), ATGL-ko, and HSL-ko mice was surgically removed and washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. Homogenization was performed on ice in lysis buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.0) using an Ultra Turrax (IKA, Staufen, Germany). The WAT lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The lipid-free infranatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected and used for TG hydrolase assays. In Vitro Lipolysis of Isolated Gonadal WAT—Gonadal fat pads were surgically removed and washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline. Tissue pieces (∼20 mg) were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) either in the presence or absence of 10 μm forskolin and/or the HSL inhibitor 76-0079 (NNC 0076-0000-0079, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) at 37 °C for 1 h. After this preincubation period, the fat pads were transferred into identical, fresh medium and incubated for a further 60 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, aliquots of the medium were removed and analyzed for FFA and glycerol content using commercial kits (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany; Sigma). For protein determinations, fat pads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.3 n NaOH, 0.1% SDS. Protein measurements were performed using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Assay for Tissue TG Hydrolase Activities and Analysis of Lipolytic Reaction Products—The substrate for the measurement of TG hydrolase activity containing triolein and [9,10-3H]triolein (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as radioactive tracer was emulsified with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol using a sonicator (Virsonic 475, Virtis, Gardiner, NJ). The final substrate concentration was 167 nmol of triolein/assay (8000 cpm of [9,10-3H]triolein/nmol). The cytosolic fractions (0.1 ml) supplemented with different concentrations of purified GST-CGI-58 and/or with a specific inhibitor of HSL were incubated with 0.1 ml of the substrate in a water bath at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9:7) and 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium carbonate, 0.1 m boric acid, pH 10.5. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 20 min, the radioactivity in 1 ml of the upper phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For the analysis of lipolytic reaction products, the reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of CHCl3/methanol (2:1) containing 1% acetic acid, 10 μg/ml oleic acid, and 10 μg/ml standards for tri-, di-(sn-1,2 and sn-1,3), and monoolein (Sigma). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged (4000 × g, 10 min). The lower phase was quantitatively collected and evaporated. The lipid pellet was dissolved in CHCl3 and applied to thin layer chromatography (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with chloroform/acetone/acetic acid (96:4:1) as solvent. Lipids were visualized with iodine vapor, and the bands corresponding to mono-, di-, triolein and triglycerides and FFA were cut out. The co-migrating radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (4Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was determined by Student's unpaired t test (two-tailed). Group differences were considered significant for p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. ATGL and HSL Are the Major Lipases in Murine WAT Cytosol—To test the specificity of the HSL inhibitor 76-0079, we determined TG hydrolase activities in cytosolic preparations of WAT of ATGL-ko and HSL-ko mice in the absence and presence of 76-0079. As shown in Fig. 1A, 76-0079 reduced the TG hydrolase activity in WAT of ATGL-ko mice in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum inhibition was achieved at a concentration of ∼2.5 μm. In contrast, 76-0079 had no effect on activity in HSL-ko cytosol, demonstrating that the inhibitor does not affect ATGL or other lipases. HSL is thought to represent the rate-limiting DG hydrolase in WAT (4Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To determine whether 76-0079 causes DG accumulation in WT WAT, the lipolytic products were applied to TLC analysis, and the radioactivity present in DG, MG, and FFA bands was determined. As shown in Fig. 1B, 76-0079-mediated inhibition of FFA release was associated with increased DG levels. The DG/FFA ratio increased from 1:48 to 1:2.4 in the absence and presence of 76-0079, respectively, indicating severely reduced DG catabolism. MG did not accumulate, presumably because of reduced DG hydrolysis and of the high MG lipase activity present in WAT. Fig. 1C shows the specific TG hydrolase activities obtained in cytosolic preparations of WT, ATGL-ko, and HSL-ko WAT. Compared with WT, HSL-ko and ATGL-ko WAT exhibited decreased TG hydrolase activities (-65 and -72%, respectively). In the presence of 76-0079, the activities in WT and ATGL-ko WAT were reduced by 70 and 84%, respectively. The activity in HSL-ko WAT was not affected. In comparison with WT conditions, where both ATGL and HSL are active, inhibition of both enzymes resulted in more than 95% reduction of TG hydrolase activity. Thus, TG hydrolase activities in cytosolic preparations of murine adipose tissue are mainly composed of ATGL and HSL activity. CGI-58 fails to Activate lipolysis in the Absence of ATGL— ATGL activity is stimulated by the presence of CGI-58 (16Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of CGI-58 to WT cytosol increased TG hydrolase activity in a dose-dependent manner up to ∼100%, indicating that endogenously produced CGI-58 in the cytosolic fraction is not sufficient to obtain maximum ATGL activity. To determine the effect of CGI-58 on TG hydrolase activity in WT, HSL-ko, and ATGL-ko mice, cytosolic fractions were incubated with the TG substrate in the absence and presence of purified GST-tagged CGI-58. CGI-58 increased TG hydrolase activity in WT and HSL-ko preparations by 1.7- and 2.1-fold (Fig. 2B), respectively, but was not capable of stimulating the activity in ATGL-ko WAT. Similar data were obtained in the presence of 76-0079. CGI-58 stimulated TG hydrolase activity in cytosol of WT and HSL-ko WAT by 1.9- and 2.2-fold, respectively, and had no effect in ATGL-ko WAT. These data demonstrate that ATGL is the sole target for CGI-58-mediated activation of adipose lipolysis. In contrast, incubation of ATGL-deficient samples with CGI-58 inhibited TG hydrolase activity by 25%, suggesting a moderate inhibitory effect of CGI-58 on HSL activity in in vitro assays. FFA Mobilization in WAT Is Ablated in the Absence of ATGL and HSL Activity—The measurement of lipolytic activity in tissue preparations in vitro does not necessarily reflect the situation in living cells. Therefore we tested the implication of ATGL and HSL in lipolysis in organ cultures of WAT. To determine the effect of 76-0079 on lipolysis, fat pads from WT mice were incubated with various amounts of the inhibitor in the presence or absence of forskolin. As shown in Fig. 3A, 76-0079 reduced the forskolin-stimulated glycerol release in WAT of WT mice to basal levels even at the lowest inhibitor concentration used (1 μm). Maximum inhibition of FFA release was achieved at ∼25 μm 76-0079 (-65%). Fig. 3B compares the FFA release obtained with fat pads of WT, HSL-ko, and ATGL-ko mice. The treatment of fat pads with forskolin increased basal FFA release severalfold in all genotypes. Compared with WT, forskolin-stimulated FFA release in HSL-ko and ATGL-ko WAT was reduced by 38 and 70%, respectively. The addition of 76-0079 had no effect on FFA release in HSL-ko WAT, again demonstrating that the inhibitor is specific for HSL. In fat pads of WT and ATGL-ko mice, 76-0079 inhibited forskolin-stimulated FFA release by 68 and 94%, respectively. The remaining FFA mobilization from ATGL-ko fat was ∼2% of the release obtained in WAT expressing functional enzymes. WAT stores and releases FFA according to the requirements of the body. An imbalance of TG synthesis and hydrolysis may result in metabolic disorders such as lipodystrophy, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The availability of FFA is determined predominantly by the lipase-dependent hydrolysis of TG stores in WAT. In obesity, plasma FFA levels are increased, and a clear relationship exists between sustained elevated plasma FFA levels and the development of insulin resistance (21Boden G. Shulman G.I. Eur J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 32: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice with targeted ablation of ATGL suggest that a reduction of adipose lipolysis may result in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (12Haemmerle G. Lass A.

Thus, lipolysis is linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes in obesity and related disorders, and adipose tissue lipases might represent molecular targets for the development of novel anti-diabetic drugs. ATGL-ko and HSL-ko mice exhibit a decreased capacity to mobilize FFA from adipose stores, demonstrating that both enzymes contribute to the hydrolysis of TG (1Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H.

However, it remained obscure whether additional lipases existed that were capable of hydrolyzing TG. The present study demonstrates that ATGL and HSL are the rate-limiting enzymes in FFA mobilization. The drastically reduced TG hydrolase activity in vitro and the ablated FFA release from organ cultures of WAT in the absence of both ATGL and HSL activity demonstrate that other enzymes cannot compensate for these lipases. According to their specific activities, ATGL and HSL act coordinately in hydrolyzing TG stores. ATGL predominantly performs the initial hydrolysis and provides DG for subsequent reactions. HSL efficiently degrades DG into MG and FFA (10Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in this study, forskolin-activated FFA mobilization is present in organ cultures of ATGL-ko and HSL-ko WAT, indicating that both enzymes are capable of mobilizing TG and that both enzymes are sensitive to hormonal stimulation. FFA mobilization in ATGL-ko WAT is severely reduced, suggesting that HSL is less efficient in initiating TG hydrolysis compared with ATGL. Conversely, ATGL or other enzymes are not capable of compensating for HSL-mediated DG hydrolysis. Thus, efficient lipolysis in murine WAT is dependent on the provision of DG by ATGL and subsequent hydrolysis of DG by HSL. The inhibition of lipolysis in WAT of WT mice using an HSL-specific inhibitor resulted in severely reduced DG catabolism and DG accumulation similar to that observed in HSL-ko mice. FFA release from WAT cultures was reduced by approximately two-thirds. This value would be expected when DG hydrolysis is blocked, because two fatty acids remain trapped within the DG molecule. Similar results were obtained in a previous study using a specific HSL inhibitor in isolated WT mouse adipocytes (23Langin D. Dicker A. Tavernier G. Hoffstedt J. Mairal A. Ryden M. Arner E. Sicard A. Jenkins C.M. Viguerie N. van Harmelen V. Gross R.W. Holm C. Arner P. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3190-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In comparison, the FFA release from HSL-ko WAT was less affected. This discrepancy is consistent with a previously observed reduction in TG synthesis in HSL-ko WAT. This compensatory mechanism results in less efficient re-esterification of mobilized FFA and might therefore be responsible for the unexpectedly moderate decrease in FFA release in HSL-ko adipose tissue (24Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Wagner E.M. Strauss J.G. Kratky D. Zechner R. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2089-2099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CGI-58 and ATGL are essential components of the lipolytic system, yet the molecular mechanism leading to ATGL activation remains to be elucidated. Our data demonstrate that CGI-58 is not capable of increasing TG hydrolase activity in ATGL-deficient WAT, suggesting that ATGL is the major target for CGI-58-mediated activation of lipolysis. Lipolysis in adipocytes is primarily stimulated by signals that activate PKA (13Holm C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast to HSL, ATGL is not a target for PKA-mediated phosphorylation, and its presence on lipid droplets in the basal and the activated state excludes an activation mechanism comparable with the PKA-driven translocation of HSL (10Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). However, the localization of CGI-58 is influenced by PKA. In the basal state, CGI-58 is present on adipose lipid stores and reversibly interacts with perilipin A (25Subramanian V. Rothenberg A. Gomez C. Cohen A.W. Garcia A. Bhattacharyya S. Shapiro L. Dolios G. Wang R. Lisanti M.P. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42062-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Perilipin A is abundantly present on lipid droplets and protects TG stores from hydrolysis. Although it has been suggested that this is mostly protection from HSL-mediated lipolysis, several studies indicate that perilipin A has a protective effect independently of the presence of HSL (26Sztalryd C.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8401-8406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In response to PKA stimulation, perilipin A is phosphorylated and CGI-58 is released from the lipid droplet (25Subramanian V. Rothenberg A. Gomez C. Cohen A.W. Garcia A. Bhattacharyya S. Shapiro L. Dolios G. Wang R. Lisanti M.P. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42062-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This reversible binding of CGI-58 to perilipin A could potentially represent an indirect, PKA-dependent mechanism controlling ATGL activity. It is conceivable that, in the basal state, CGI-58 is bound to perilipin A, resulting in incomplete or absent activation of ATGL. Upon lipolytic stimulation, CGI-58 is released from perilipin A and becomes available for ATGL resulting in increased TG hydrolysis. However, additional experiments are required to unfold the molecular mechanisms regulating ATGL activity and the role of perilipin in this process. Notably, CGI-58 is capable of activating TG hydrolase activity not exclusively in WAT but also in brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, testes, and liver (16Lass A. Zimmermann R.

CGI-58 appears to be expressed ubiquitously, and the tissue distribution pattern of CGI-58 mRNA differs from that of ATGL (16Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M.

These observations raise the possibility that CGI-58 possesses an additional function in lipid metabolism or activates other lipases than ATGL in specific tissues. Our findings in mouse adipose tissue may not reflect the situation in human adipose tissue. Next to ATGL, another member of the adiponutrin familiy, GS-2 (PNPLA4), has been reported to possess TG and retinyl ester hydrolase activity as well as transacylase activity (29Gao J. Simon M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 1259-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mouse ortholog of GS2 is unknown (30Zechner R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that additional lipases contribute to human adipose lipolysis. Langin et al. (23Langin D. Dicker A. Tavernier G. Hoffstedt J. Mairal A. Ryden M. Arner E. Sicard A. Jenkins C.M. Viguerie N. van Harmelen V. Gross R.W. Holm C. Arner P. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3190-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) interpreted their findings in human adipocytes using a specific HSL inhibitor to mean that HSL is the major lipase for hormone-stimulated lipolysis, whereas ATGL might participate in basal lipolysis. However, human ATGL (hATGL) is highly expressed in human adipocytes (10Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3190-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and hATGL as well as human CGI-58 (hCGI-58) exhibit the same biological activity as demonstrated for their mouse orthologs. hATGL hydrolyzes TG and is stimulated by hCGI-58 (16Lass A.

Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Mutants of hCGI-58 present in subjects suffering from CDS lose their ability to activate ATGL, and a systemic TG accumulation is observed in CDS as well as in ATGL-ko mice (12Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R.

Together, these observations suggest that CGI-58 and ATGL exert similar functions in lipolysis in humans and mice. Earlier studies suggested that TG accumulation in CDS occurs because of abnormalities in phospolipid (PL) metabolism. Igal and Coleman (31Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported defective acylglycerol recycling from TG stores to PL as well as increased de novo PL synthesis in skin fibroblasts obtained from a CDS patient. These alterations in PL metabolism may be explained by the specific activities of ATGL and HSL. ATGL generates DG from TG, which can be utilized for PL synthesis. In contrast, HSL-mediated lipolysis of TG does not result in DG accumulation because of the high specific activity of HSL against DG (10Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Thus, defective ATGL activation as observed in CDS fibroblasts (16Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) could reduce the availability of DG for PL synthesis, resulting in decreased acylglycerol recycling and, as a compensatory process, in increased de novo PL synthesis. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ATGL and HSL are quantitatively the most important lipases in murine adipose tissue. Additional known or unknown lipases appear to play only a minor role in TG hydrolysis. The absence of CGI-58-mediated stimulation of TG hydrolysis in ATGL-deficient WAT suggests that ATGL represents the only adipose lipase activated by CGI-58. We thank Dr. E.

Here, we report that the protein accumulates in mitochondria during apoptosis, and induces the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, a decisive event of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. GAPDH was localized by immunogold labeling and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and nano liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy in the mitochondrion of various tissues and origins. In isolated mitochondria, GAPDH can be imported and interact with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1), but not the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). The protein mediates a cyclosporin A-inhibitable permeability transition, characterized by a loss of the inner transmembrane potential, matrix swelling, permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and the release of two pro-apoptotic proteins, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). This novel function of GAPDH might have implications for the understanding of mitochondrial biology, oncogenesis and apoptosis."

Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that represses protein synthesis, acts to inhibit mTOR signaling as assessed by reduced phosphorylation of the downstream targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Dexamethasone has also been shown in one study to up-regulate the expression of REDD1 (also referred to RTP801, a novel stress-induced gene linked to repression of mTOR signaling) in lymphoid, but not nonlymphoid, cells. In contrast to the findings of that study, here we demonstrate that REDD1, but not REDD2, mRNA expression is dramatically induced following acute dexamethasone treatment both in rat skeletal muscle in vivo and in L6 myoblasts in culture. In L6 myoblasts, the effect of the drug on mTOR signaling is efficiently blunted in the presence of REDD1 RNA interference oligonucleotides. Moreover, the dexamethasone-induced assembly of the mTOR regulatory complex Tuberin·Hamartin is disrupted in L6 myoblasts following small interfering RNA-mediated repression of REDD1 expression. Finally, overexpression of Rheb, a downstream target of Tuberin function and a positive upstream effector of mTOR, reverses the effect of dexamethasone on phosphorylation of mTOR substrates. Overall, the data support the conclusion that REDD1 functions upstream of Tuberin and Rheb to down-regulate mTOR signaling in response to dexamethasone.

In contrast to the anabolic actions of growth-promoting hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1, glucocorticoids act to repress protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of animals in vivo (1Rannels D.E.

In part, the repression of protein synthesis in response to glucocorticoids is a result of decreased signaling through a protein kinase referred to as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). 2The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; siRNA, short interfering RNA; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PKB, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular-signal regulated kinase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase. mTOR phosphorylates at least two proteins involved in the regulation of mRNA translation, the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) (6Richardson C.J. Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 acts to repress mRNA translation by sequestering the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E into an inactive complex (7Lin T.-A.

Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR initiates a series of phosphorylation events that ultimately result in the release of eIF4E from the inactive 4E-BP1·eIF4E complex, allowing it to bind to eIF4G to form the active eIF4F complex. Phosphorylation of S6K1 by mTOR generates a docking site for a second protein kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), allowing PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate S6K1 (9Alessi D.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, repression of mTOR signaling results in a reduction in both the initiation and elongation phases of mRNA translation, resulting in a down-regulation of protein synthesis. Previous studies have shown that the down-regulation of protein synthesis caused by dexamethasone administration to rats in vivo (15Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E76-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the addition of the drug to the culture medium of L6 myoblasts (16Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J.

J. 2000; 347: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) temporally correlates with reduced phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates 4E-BP1 and S6K1, suggesting that glucocorticoids might decrease protein synthesis through repression of mTOR. The dexamethasone-induced reduction in 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation is attenuated both by inhibitors of glucocorticoid receptor function and inhibitors of transcription and translation (16Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E74-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the glucocorticoid receptor is both necessary and sufficient for the dexamethasone-induced dephosphorylation of S6K1 (18Shah O.J. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Romanelli A. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2525-2533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the glucocorticoid receptor reveals that the DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions, but not the transcriptional repression function, of the receptor are required for S6K1 regulation (18Shah O.J.

Overall, the available evidence strongly suggests that the repression of mTOR signaling in response to glucocorticoids is a result of enhanced transcription of a gene that encodes a repressor of mTOR signaling. However, the identity of the putative mTOR repressor is unknown. Recent studies have identified two novel repressors of mTOR signaling; proteins referred to as REDD1 and REDD2 (regulated in development and DNA damage responses; also known as RTP801 and RTP801l, respectively). REDD1 and REDD2 were originally identified as genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated in response to a variety of cellular stresses, including hypoxia (19Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3909-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recent studies show that REDD1-induced repression of mTOR signaling requires Tuberin, the product of the TSC2 gene (19Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L. Manning B.D. Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Witters L.A. Ellisen L.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2893-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 20Reiling J.H. Hafen E.

Tuberin in a complex with Hamartin, the product of the TSC1 gene, functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) toward a small G protein referred to as Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), a positive upstream effector of mTOR (26Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.-L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Binding of Rheb·GTP to mTOR enhances, whereas binding of Rheb·GDP inhibits, mTOR activity (27Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr.

However, although it is clear that REDD1 requires Tuberin to repress mTOR signaling, the mechanism through which REDD1 might act to enhance Tuberin function is as yet undefined. A recent study (33Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that dexamethasone induces the expression of a gene referred to as dig2 (dexamethasone-induced gene-2). Sequencing of the dig2 mRNA revealed that it is identical to REDD1 (33Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible link between induction of Dig2 expression and repression of signaling through mTOR. However, in that study, dexamethasone was found to induce REDD1 expression only in lymphoid cells and not in nonlymphoid cells, bringing into question the role of REDD1 in mediating the actions of glucocorticoids on mTOR signaling in other types of cells or tissues. In the present study, the hypothesis that glucocorticoids repress mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle through induction of REDD1 and/or REDD2 was examined. In contrast to an earlier study (33Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggesting a lymphoid-specific up-regulation of REDD1 by dexamethasone, our results show that expression of REDD1 is enhanced by dexamethasone both in skeletal muscle in vivo and L6 myoblasts in culture. Moreover, REDD2 expression is repressed by dexamethasone in skeletal muscle and L6 myoblasts. Importantly, dexamethasone promotes the assembly of the active Tuberin·Hamartin complex, and complex assembly requires increased REDD1 expression. Finally, overexpression of Rheb attenuates the dexamethasone-induced repression of mTOR signaling. Overall, the results are consistent with a model wherein dexamethasone up-regulates REDD1 expression in muscle and REDD1 subsequently activates the Tuberin·Hamartin complex, resulting in repression of mTOR signaling. Reagents—Dexamethasone (cell culture tested) and dexamethasone-sodium phosphate were purchased from Sigma. Anti-S6K1, anti-4E-BP1, and goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-Tuberin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-Hamartin antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies. The antibody to REDD1 was purchased from ProteinTech Group (Chicago). Mouse monoclonal anti-eIF4E antibody was raised against recombinant human eIF4E by the method described earlier (34Kimball S.R. Karinch A.M. Feldhoff R.C. Mellor H. Jefferson L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). BioMag goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse polyclonal IgG beads were purchased from Qiagen. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were purchased from GE Healthcare. Predesigned REDD1 short interfering RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion (product numbers 193200, 193201, and 193202) as was the scrambled control oligonucleotide (product number 4635). Animal Protocol—The animal experimental protocol used for the studies described herein was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) were maintained on a 12 h light-12 h dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with dexamethasone-sodium phosphate (100 μg/100 mg of body wt) in sterile saline (0.15 m NaCl) (15Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E76-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control group received an equal volume of saline. Three hours later, half of the animals in each group were administered leucine (1.35 mg/kg of body weight) by oral gavage (35Anthony J.C. Yoshizawa F. Anthony T.G. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Kimball S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 2413-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Four hours after drug administration, rats were killed by decapitation. The left gastrocnemius and plantaris were rapidly excised as a unit and frozen between aluminum blocks precooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The contralateral muscles were similarly excised, weighed, and homogenized in 7 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged immediately at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for analysis. Cell Culture, RNA Interference, and Transfection—L6 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells (1 × 106) were electroporated using a Nucleofector™ device (Amaxa Biosystems) in the presence of 100 μl of Nucleofector Solution V and a mixture of three siRNAs (each at 1 μm) directed against REDD1. 48 h later, cells were deprived of serum for ∼18 h and then treated with dexamethasone (1 μm) for 4 h prior to harvesting. Rat2 fibroblasts also were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlas). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—The supernatants derived from muscle homogenates and cell lysates were combined with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with primary antibody as indicated in the figure legends. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using a GeneGnome HR bioimaging system (Syngene). Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 1000 × g supernatants of muscle homogenate or cell lysate overnight with anti-eIF4E antibody or anti-Tuberin antibody followed by isolation of the immune complexes using BioMag IgG beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with immunoprecipitation buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (36Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C221-C228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yoshizawa F. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Isolation of total RNA and Reverse Transcription—RNA was extracted from muscle and cells using Trizol reagent according to the manufacture's protocol (Invitrogen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed spectrophotometrically using a Beckman Coulter DU 640 (Fullerton, CA). RNA (1 μg) was reversed transcribed using 50 units of Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 21-μl reaction volume containing 0.5 μg/μl oligo(dT), 10 mm dNTP mix, 10× RT buffer (25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m dithiothreitol), and RNaseOUT recombinant RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen). The mixture of RNA and oligo(dT) was heated at 65 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice; then all other reagents were added, and RT-PCR was conducted at 42 °C for 50 min and 70 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was then diluted 1:8 before analysis by Real-time PCR as described below. Real-time PCR Analysis of GAPDH, REDD1, and REDD2 mRNA—Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR was conducted using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7300 Real Time PCR system using a QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were as follows: GAPDH forward primer, 5′-GGGCTGCCTTCTCTTGTGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGAACTTGCCGTGGGTAGA-3′; REDD1 forward primer, 5′-TAGTGCCCACCTTTCAGTTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCAGGGACTGGCTGTAACC-3′; REDD2 forward primer, 5′-CCAGCCTCAAGGACTTCTTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCCTCAATGACTGTCGTTCC-3′. All PCR reactions were performed in 96-well optical plates (Applied Biosystems) containing each specific forward and reverse primer at 0.4 μm, 5 μl of diluted cDNA, and 12.5 μl of SYBR Green I in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Each run included a buffer blank and no-template control to test for contamination of assay reagents. Gene expression levels were calculated and normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test were used to compare differences among groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A previous study (38Shah O.J. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1185-E1190PubMed Google Scholar) showed that glucocorticoids repress mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle in rats and that leucine administration to dexamethasone-treated rats reverses the repression. The present study confirmed the results of the earlier study and showed that 4 h after dexamethasone administration, phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 was reduced in skeletal muscle (data not shown). To assess whether either dexamethasone or leucine administration alters the expression of REDD1 or REDD2, the amounts of the respective mRNAs in rat skeletal muscle RNA were measured by RT-PCR and expressed relative to the amount of GAPDH mRNA, an mRNA that did not change in response to either dexamethasone or leucine administration. As shown in Fig. 1A, 4 h after dexamethasone administration, the expression of REDD1 mRNA was increased more than 8-fold above the control value. In contrast, REDD2 mRNA expression was reduced in muscle from dexamethasone-treated rats compared with controls (Fig. 1B). Leucine, administered to either control or dexamethasone-treated rats had no significant effect on the expression of either form of mRNA. To confirm that the dexamethasone-induced changes in REDD1 mRNA abundance would result in altered REDD1 protein expression, the effect of the hormone on REDD1 expression was assessed by protein immunoblot analysis. It was found that REDD1 protein content was almost undetectable in muscle from control rats but was dramatically increased in muscle of rats treated with dexamethasone (Fig. 2A). Thus, the increase in REDD1 mRNA abundance is associated with a corresponding increase in protein expression. To further explore the regulation of REDD1 and REDD2 mRNA expression and mTOR signaling by dexamethasone, the effect of the drug in L6 myoblasts was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, mTOR signaling was repressed in L6 myoblasts 4 h after dexamethasone administration, as assessed by a shift of both S6K1 (Fig. 3A) and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3B) into less phosphorylated, i.e. more rapidly migrating, forms. As observed in skeletal muscle from dexamethasone-treated rats, dexamethasone enhanced the expression of REDD1 mRNA (Fig. 3C) and simultaneously repressed REDD2 mRNA expression in L6 myoblasts (Fig. 3D). Moreover, dexamethasone treatment resulted in a 5-fold increase in REDD1 protein content compared with controls (Fig. 2B). To assess whether or not the enhanced expression of REDD1 mRNA was necessary for repression of mTOR signaling, siRNAs directed against the rat REDD1 mRNA were used to reduce its expression in L6 myoblasts. As shown in Fig. 4A, administration of REDD1 siRNA caused a reduction in REDD1 mRNA expression to ∼50% of the value observed in cells that had been administered a control siRNA. Moreover, administration of REDD1 siRNA prior to dexamethasone dramatically attenuated the drug-induced expression of the mRNA. As shown in Fig. 4B, the control siRNA had no effect on the dexamethasone-induced decrease in S6K1 phosphorylation. However, in cells transfected with the REDD1 siRNA, dexamethasone had little or no effect on S6K1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the drug repressed mTOR signaling through enhanced expression of REDD1. Further support for this suggestion was provided by the observation that the dexamethasone-induced dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was also attenuated in cells transfected with REDD1 siRNA (Fig. 4C). An important mechanism through which mTOR signaling is regulated involves the Tuberin·Hamartin complex. As shown in Fig. 4D, dexamethasone enhanced the amount of Hamartin associated with Tuberin in L6 myoblasts transfected with control siRNA. However, the drug had no effect on assembly of the Tuberin·Hamartin complex in cells transfected with REDD1 siRNA, suggesting that REDD1 may function upstream of Tuberin·Hamartin in regulating mTOR signaling. To further assess a possible role for the Tuberin·Hamartin complex in REDD1-mediated repression of mTOR signaling, the effect of exogenous expression of Rheb on the dexamethasone-induced repression of mTOR signaling was examined. For these studies, Rat2 cells were used because Rheb was only poorly expressed in transfected L6 myoblasts (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5A, Rheb expression was increased by at least an order of magnitude in Rat2 cells transfected with the FLAG-Rheb plasmid compared with cells transfected with the control plasmid. As observed in L6 myoblasts, dexamethasone caused a decrease in phosphorylation of both S6K1 (Fig. 5B) and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 5C) as assessed by decreased migration during electrophoresis. In contrast, exogenous expression of Rheb enhanced both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in the absence of dexamethasone. Importantly, in cells overexpressing Rheb, the effect of dexamethasone on S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was severely attenuated. The results of the present study confirmed earlier reports that glucocorticoids repress mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle (15Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E76-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Shah O.J. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1185-E1190PubMed Google Scholar) and L6 myoblasts (16Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E74-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in both gastrocnemius muscle and L6 myoblasts, dexamethasone promotes dephosphorylation of the mTOR substrates S6K1 and 4E-BP1. The present study extended the findings from previous studies to show that REDD1, but not REDD2, mRNA expression is enhanced in both skeletal muscle and L6 myoblasts in response to dexamethasone administration. In a previous study (33Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), dexamethasone was shown to induce REDD1 expression in lymphocytes but not in the nonlymphoid cells that were examined. Although mTOR signaling was not examined in the earlier study, the time course for induction of REDD1 mRNA by dexamethasone in lymphoma cells (33Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) parallels that for the repression of mTOR signaling in L6 myoblasts (16Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E74-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both dexamethasone-induced expression of REDD1 mRNA in lymphocytes (33Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and repression of mTOR signaling in L6 myoblasts (18Shah O.J. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Romanelli A. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2525-2533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are blocked by RU486, a glucocorticoid agonist that competes with dexamethasone for binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. Overall, the available evidence indirectly suggests that dexamethasone might act to repress mTOR signaling through a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated increase in REDD1 expression. That suggestion is supported by the results of the present study showing that dexamethasone induces REDD1 expression not only in lymphoid cells, as reported previously (33Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but also in skeletal muscle in vivo as well as in L6 myoblasts in culture. A number of recent studies have suggested a possible link between induction of REDD1 expression and repression of signaling through mTOR. Studies in both Drosophila (20Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2879-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (39Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9769-9772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) show that exogenous overexpression of either REDD1 or REDD2 represses mTOR signaling, whereas decreased expression of either protein increases signaling through mTOR. Moreover, in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking REDD1, conditions that normally promote expression of the protein have little effect on the phosphorylation state of S6K1 or 4E-BP1 (25Sofer A. Lei K. Johannessen C.M. Ellisen L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5834-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). One mechanism through which mTOR is regulated involves its association with Rheb. Rheb binds to mTOR near the amino-terminal end of its catalytic domain (27Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). When it is associated with GTP, Rheb acts to enhance mTOR activity, but when it is associated with GDP, it is a repressor. The finding in the present study, that overexpression of Rheb in L6 myoblasts attenuates the down-regulation of mTOR signaling caused by dexamethasone, suggests that the drug may act to repress mTOR signaling by enhancing the proportion of Rheb present in the GDP-bound form. Such a suggestion is also supported by the observation that overexpression of Rheb in mouse embryo fibroblasts reverses the effect of exogenous expression of REDD1 on mTOR signaling (25Sofer A. Lei K. Johannessen C.M. Ellisen L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5834-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting the suggestion that dexamethasone may act to increase the amount of Rheb in the GDP-bound form is the novel observation that dexamethasone enhances the assembly of the Tuberin·Hamartin complex (Fig. 4). Moreover, REDD1 knockdown using siRNA prevented dexamethasone-induced assembly of the complex, suggesting that REDD1 acts to repress mTOR by signaling to Tuberin and Hamartin. Although Tuberin by itself exhibits GAP activity toward Rheb in in vitro assays, co-expression of both Tuberin and Hamartin is required for effective repression of mTOR signaling in cells in culture (40Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in Tuberin that interfere with its binding to Hamartin repress the growth inhibitory effects of the protein in COS1 cells (41Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). That REDD1 functions through the Tuberin·Hamartin complex to modulate mTOR function is further supported by recent studies showing that REDD1 signaling to mTOR requires Tuberin. For example, in cells in which Tuberin expression is reduced using siRNA, induction of REDD1 expression has little or no effect on S6K1 phosphorylation (19Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L. Manning B.D. Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Witters L.A. Ellisen L.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2893-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 42Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Bardeesy N. DePinho R.A. Guan K.-L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to wild type cells, exogenous expression of REDD1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking Tuberin has no effect on S6K1 phosphorylation (25Sofer A. Lei K. Johannessen C.M. Ellisen L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5834-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the effect of exogenous expression of REDD1 on assembly of the Tuberin·Hamartin complex has not been examined previously. Although the mechanism through which REDD1 might regulate Tuberin function is unknown, one possibility involves changes in Tuberin phosphorylation. In this regard, Tuberin is regulated through phosphorylation by a number of protein kinases. For example, phosphorylation of Tuberin on multiple residues by protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt) is associated with inhibition of its GAP activity toward Rheb, resulting in enhanced signaling through mTOR (reviewed in Ref. 43Shah O.J. Hunter T. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian cells, overexpression of REDD1 has no effect on PKB phosphorylation (39Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9769-9772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and in Drosophila REDD1 functions downstream of PKB (20Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2879-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) suggesting that REDD1 does not regulate Tuberin through a PKB-dependent process. Tuberin function is also regulated through phosphorylation by the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) (44Ma L. Chen Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 179-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), but the finding that dexamethasone does not activate ERK in L6 myoblasts (15Shah O.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E76-E82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that ERK is not downstream of REDD1. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also phosphorylates Tuberin, and in contrast to phosphorylation by PKB or ERK, phosphorylation by AMPK enhances Tuberin activity, resulting in repressed mTOR signaling (45Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.-L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar). However, although REDD1 does not require AMPK to repress mTOR signaling (19Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L. Manning B.D. Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Witters L.A. Ellisen L.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2893-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 25Sofer A. Lei K. Johannessen C.M. Ellisen L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5834-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), AMPK requires REDD1 to modulate mTOR activity (25Sofer A. Lei K. Johannessen C.M. Ellisen L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5834-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Overall, the available evidence suggests that REDD1 modulates Tuberin·Hamartin assembly through an as yet undiscovered mechanism. Of relevance to the mechanism through which REDD1 might modulate Tuberin function is the observation that oral administration of leucine to fasted rats has no effect on either basal or dexamethasone-induced REDD1 expression. In contrast, the magnitude of the leucine-induced increase in 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation is unaffected by dexamethasone (38Shah O.J. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1185-E1190PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that leucine acts downstream of REDD1 to activate mTOR. Amino acids have little (28Smith E.M. Finn S.G. Tee A.R. Browne G.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18717-18727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 46Roccio M. Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 25: 657-664Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or no effect (47Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) on the amount of GTP bound to Rheb. Moreover, in cells lacking Tuberin, amino acid deprivation represses mTOR signaling, and the readdition of amino acids to deprived cells restores phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 (28Smith E.M. Finn S.G. Tee A.R. Browne G.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18717-18727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 46Roccio M. Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Oncogene. 2005; 25: 657-664Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that amino acid regulation of mTOR can occur through a Tuberin-independent mechanism. Although the putative Tuberin-independent signaling pathway regulated by amino acids has not been delineated, a recent study suggests that amino acids promote the association of Rheb with mTOR and thereby enhance mTOR protein kinase activity (27Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Therefore, in part, amino acids may overcome the repressive effects of glucocorticoids on mTOR signaling by stimulating the binding of Rheb to mTOR. A second possibility is that amino acids might promote the activation of a guanine nucleotide exchange protein (GEF) for Rheb. Although a Rheb GEF has yet to be identified, activation of such a protein might overwhelm the repressive effect of REDD1-mediated Tuberin activation and thereby enhance mTOR signaling. Such an idea will need to be addressed in future studies. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates a pivotal role for REDD1 in down-regulating mTOR function in response to dexamethasone treatment. The results of the present study, in combination with previously published reports, support a model wherein dexamethasone binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, thereby enhancing REDD1 gene transcription. Through an as yet unidentified mechanism, REDD1 promotes the association of Hamartin with Tuberin (41Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) resulting in enhanced GAP activity toward Rheb. The resulting increase in Rheb complexed with GDP represses mTOR function, leading to decreased phosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 and subsequent alterations in mRNA translation and protein synthesis.

Treatment of LNCaP cells with WIN-55,212-2 (1-10 μm; 24 h) resulted in: (i) an arrest of the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle; (ii) an induction of p53 and p27/KIP1; (iii) down-regulation of cyclins D1, D2, E; (iii) decrease in the expression of cdk-2, -4, and -6; (iv) decrease in protein expression of pRb; (v) down-regulation of E2F (1-4); and (vi) decrease in the protein expression of DP1 and DP2. Similar effects were also observed when androgen-independent PC3 cells were treated with WIN-55,212-2 (5-30 μm). We further observed sustained up-regulation of ERK1/2 and inhibition of PI3k/Akt pathways in WIN-55,212-2-treated cells. Inhibition of ERK1/2 abrogated WIN-55,212-2-indued cell death suggesting that sustained activation of ERK1/2 leads to cell cycle dysregulation and arrest of cells in G0/G1 phase subsequently leading to an induction of apoptosis. Further, WIN-55,212-2 treatment of cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in such a way that favors apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis proceeded through down-regulation of caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases. Based on these data we suggest that cannabinoid receptor agonists should be considered as novel agents for the management of prostate cancer. We have recently shown that the expression levels of both cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are higher in human prostate cancer cells than in normal prostate epithelial cells, and treatment of LNCaP cells with WIN-55,212-2 (a mixed CB1/CB2 agonist) resulted in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis (Sarfaraz, S., Afaq, F., Adhami, V.

Based on these data we suggest that cannabinoid receptor agonists should be considered as novel agents for the management of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer (CaP) 2The abbreviations used are: CaP, prostate cancer; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma. ranks as the most common noncutaneous malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American males, with similar trends in many Western countries. According to an estimate of the American Cancer Society, a total of 234,460 men will be diagnosed with CaP in the United States in the year 2006 and 27,350 CaP-related deaths are predicted (1Jemal A. Siegel R.W. Ward E. Murray T. Xu J. Smigal C. Thun M.J. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2006; 56: 106-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5532) Google Scholar). The major cause of mortality from this disease is metastasis of hormone refractory cancer cells that fail to respond to hormone ablation therapy (2Denmeade S.R. Lin X.S. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1996; 28: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 3Tang D.G. Porter A.T. Prostate. 1997; 32: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Because surgery and current treatment options have proven to be inadequate in treating and controlling CaP, the search for novel targets and mechanism-based agents for prevention and treatment of this disease has become a priority. In recent years, cannabinoids the active components of Cannabis sativa linnaeus (marijuana) and their derivatives are drawing renewed attention because of their diverse pharmacological activities such as cell growth inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects, and tumor regression (4Galve-Roperh I.

Further interest in cannabinoid research came from the discovery of the cannabinoid system and the cloning of specific cannabinoid receptors (10Guzman M. Sanchez C. Galve-Roperh I. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 78: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Two cannabinoid receptors have been identified: the “central” CB1 and the “peripheral” CB2 receptor. In a recent study, we have shown that WIN 55,212-2 (Fig. 1) a mixed CB1/CB2 receptor agonist imparts cell growth inhibitory effects in LNCaP cells via an induction of apoptosis. An important observation of this study was that WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not result in apoptosis of the normal prostate epithelial cell at similar doses (11Sarfaraz S. Afaq F. Adhami V.M. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Here, we show that treatment of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN-55,212-2 resulted in an arrest of the cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and this arrest was associated with a sustained activation of ERK1/2, induction of p27/KIP1, and inhibition of cyclin D1. Blocking of both cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 by their specific antagonist resulted in inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and its specific siRNA abrogated these effects. Materials—R-(+)-WIN 55,212-2 (2,3 dihydro-5-methyl-3-([morpholinyl]methyl) pyrollo (1,2,3 de)-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-[1-napthaleny]methanone, C27H26N2O3.CH3SO3H was purchased from Sigma. CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 (SR1) and CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 (SR2) were procured from Dr. Herbert H. Seltzman (NIDA, National Institutes of Health, Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Research, through RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC). ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was purchased from Tocris Biosciences (Ellisville, MO). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were procured from Invitrogen. Antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) used were obtained from Cellgro Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). The mono- and polyclonal antibodies (p53, cdk2, -4, and -6, KIP1/p27, E2F-3, and DP-2) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The human reactive monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (cyclins D1, D2, E, pRb, E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-4, and DP-1) were obtained from Labvision (Fremont, CA). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for anti-PARP, Bcl-2 Bax were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-PARP (116 kDa) and anti-PI3K (p85) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and anti-PARP (p85) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 p42/44 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugate was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protein was estimated using the BCA protein assay kit obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Cell Culture—LNCaP and PC3 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic penicillin and streptomycin. PC3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained under standard cell culture conditions at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humid environment. Treatment of Cells—WIN-55,212-2, (dissolved in Me2SO) was used for the treatment of cells. The final concentration of Me2SO used was 0.1% (v/v) for each treatment. For dose-dependent studies, LNCaP cells were treated with WIN-55,212-2 at 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 μm final concentrations for 24 h in complete cell medium. PC3 cells were treated with WIN-55,212-2 at 5.0, 10, 20, 25, and 30 μm final concentration for 24 h in complete cell medium. Control cells were treated with vehicle alone. To establish the role of CB1 and CB2 receptor in WIN-55,212-2 induced ERK1/2 activation cells were pretreated with 3 μm SR141716 and SR144528 alone, and in the second set, cells were pretreated with both the antagonists (3 μm each) for 3 h followed by incubation with 7.5 μm WIN-55,212-2 for 24 h. To study the role of ERK1/2 in cannabinoid receptor induced cell growth inhibition, cells were pretreated with 30 μm ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 for 1 h followed by incubation with 7.5 μm WIN-55,212-2 for 24 h. Cell Viability—The cells were grown at density of 1 × 106 cells in 100-mm culture dishes and treated with WIN-55,212-2 (1-10 μm) for 24 h. The cells were trypsinized and collected in the microfuge tube. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (300 μl). Trypan blue (0.4% in PBS; 10 μl) was added to a smaller aliquot (10 μl) of cell suspension, and the number of cells (viable-unstained and nonviable-blue) were counted using a hemocytometer. Quantification of Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—The cells were grown at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 100-mm culture dishes and were treated with WIN-55,212-2 (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 μm doses) for 24 h. The cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and processed for labeling with fluorescein-tagged deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotide and propidium iodide by use of an Apo-direct apoptosis kit obtained from Phoenix Flow Systems (San Diego, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled cells were analyzed using a FACScan benchtop cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at the UWCCC Flow Cytometry Facility in the University of Wisconsin. Results were analyzed using Mod-Fit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) for cell cycle and WinMD1 version 2.8 software for quantification of apoptosis. Detection of Cleaved Caspase-3 by Confocal Microscopy— The cells were grown in two chambered cell culture slides (BD Biosciences), treated with WIN-55,212-2 (5.0, 7.5, 10.0 μm doses) for 24 h, washed with 1× PBS at room temperature, and were immediately fixed in cold 100% methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Cells were blocked with blocking buffer (5.5% normal goat serum in TBST, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 60 min, and were washed with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Cells were then incubated with primary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight using the vendor's protocol. After incubation, cells were washed twice for 5 min with TBST and once with TBS. Coverslips were mounted using the Prolong Antifade kit obtained from Molecular Probes, (Eugene, OR). Cells were visualized with a Bio-Rad MRC1000 scan head mounted transversely to an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope at the Keck Neural Imaging Laboratory in the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Silencing of ERK 44/42 by Small Interfering RNA—For suppressing ERK1/2 expressions, ERK1, ERK2, and control scrambled siRNA were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). LNCaP cells were transfected with siRNAs (ERK1, 150 nmol/liter and ERK2, 80 nmol/liter, scrambled siRNA 150 nmol/liter) using the nucleofection kit R specific for LNCaP transfection from Amaxa Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were resuspended in a solution from nucleofector kit R following the manufacturer's guidelines. 100 μl of nucleofector solution R was mixed with 2 × 106 cells and siRNA. They were then transferred to the cuvette provided with the kit and was nucleofected with an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus. Cells were transfected using the T-001 pulsing parameter and were transferred into 100-mm plates containing 37 °C prewarmed culture medium. After transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h, after which the medium was replaced with fresh medium, cells were treated with 7.5 μm WIN-55,212-2 for 24 h, and protein lysates were prepared. Using 2 μg of GFP we observed 70-80% transfection efficiency with this protocol. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—Following treatment of cells with WIN-55,212-2, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with cold PBS (10 mmol/liter, pH 7.45). The cells were then incubated in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 20 mmol/liter NaF, 100 mmol/liter Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.4), with freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) over ice for 20 min. The cells were scraped, and the lysate was collected in a microcentrifuge tube and passed through a 21.5-gauge needle to break up the cell aggregates. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (total cell lysate) collected, aliquoted, and was used on the day of preparation or immediately stored at -80 °C for use at a later time. For Western blotting, 25-50 μg protein was resolved over 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The nonspecific sites on blots were blocked by incubating in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk/1% Tween 20 in 20 mmol/liter TBS, pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with appropriate monoclonal primary antibody in blocking buffer for 90 min to overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate and detected by chemiluminescence and autoradiography using hyperfilm obtained from Amersham Biosciences (UK Ltd.). Densitometric measurements of the bands in Western blot analysis were performed using digitalized scientific software program UN-SCAN-IT (Silk Scientific Corporation, Orem, UT). Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test to assess statistical significance. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. WIN-55,212-2 Causes G1 Phase Cell Cycle Arrest—We have earlier shown that treatment of LNCaP cells with WIN-55,212-2 (1-10 μm) for 24 h significantly decreased the cell viability and led to induction of apoptosis (11Sarfaraz S. Afaq F. Adhami V.M. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the induction of apoptosis may be cell cycle-dependent (12Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar, 13Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14King K.L. Cidlowski J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 601-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 15Sandhu C. Slingerland J. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2000; 24: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vermeulen K. Berneman Z.N. Van Bockstaele D.R. Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the next series of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that WIN-55,212-2-caused apoptosis of LNCaP cells is mediated via cell cycle blockade. We performed DNA cell cycle analysis to assess the effect of WIN-55,212-2 treatment on the distribution of cells in the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 2, compared with vehicle treatment, WIN-55, 212-2 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle (59, 62, 69, 81, and 83% cells in G1 phase at 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 μm concentrations, respectively). This observation is important because the molecular analyses of human cancers have revealed that cell cycle regulators are frequently mutated in most common malignancies (17Kastan M.B. Canman C.E. Leonard C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18Molinari M. Cell Prolif. 2000; 33: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, in recent years, inhibition of the cell cycle has been appreciated as a target for the management of cancer (19McDonald E.R. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 871-886PubMed Google Scholar, 20Owa T. Yoshino H. Yoshimatsu K. Nagasu T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 1487-1503Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). WIN-55,212-2-induced Cell Cycle Arrest Is Mediated via an Induction of KIP1/p27 and Concomitant Inhibition in Cyclins D1, D2, E, and Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6—Because our studies demonstrated that WIN-55,212-2 treatment of cells resulted in a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we examined the effect of WIN-55,212-2 on cell cycle regulatory molecules operative in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Studies have shown a critical role of p27/KIP1 in apoptosis and cell cycle progression through G0-G1 phase (21Macri E. Loda M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 23Atallah D. Marsaud V. Radanyi C. Kornprobst M. Rouzier R. Elias D. Renoir J.M. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2004; 20: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We observed a significant induction of p27/KIP1 by WIN-55,212-2 at 5-10 μm doses. (Fig. 3A). Relative density data revealed 1.5-, 2.3-, and 2.6-fold increases in the protein expression of Kip/p27 at 5.0, 7.5, and 10 μm concentrations of WIN-55,212-2, respectively. Using immunoblot analysis, we also assessed the effect of WIN-55,212-2 treatment on the protein expression of the cyclins and cdks, which are known to be regulated by KIP1/p27. WIN-55,212-2 treatment of the cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin E (Fig. 3A) as well as cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6 (Fig. 3A). Densitometric analysis data of cyclins revealed a significant decrease in the expression of cyclin D1 (84%, 97%), cyclin D2 (60%, 86%), and cyclin E (40%, 50%) at 7.5 and 10.0 μm concentrations of WIN-55,212-2, respectively (Fig. 3B). Relative density data of cdks also revealed a significant decrease in the expression of cdk2 (43%, 65%), cdk4 (54%, 89%), and cdk6 (46%, 60%) at similar doses of WIN-55,212-2. In the next series of experiments we assessed the effect of WIN-55,212-2 on p27/KIP1, cyclin and cdk in androgen-insensitive cell PC3. Cells were treated with different doses of WIN-55,212-2 (5, 10, 20, 25, 30 μm), and we found an induction in p27/KIP1 and down-regulation in the protein expression of cyclin and cdk particularly at doses of 20-30 μm (Fig. 3B). WIN-55,212-2 Inhibits Protein Expression of pRB, E2F, and DP—Down-regulation of cdk4/6 has been shown to be associated with a decrease in the expression of retinoblastoma (pRb) tumor suppressor protein a key regulator of the G1 → S phase transition in the cell cycle (24Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25Deshpande A. Sicinski P. Hinds P.W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2909-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effect of WIN-55,212-2 on protein expression of pRb. Immunoblot data revealed that WIN-55,212-2 treatment of cells resulted in a significant decrease in the protein expression of pRb. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots showed 27, 82, and 89% inhibition at 5.0, 7.5, and 10 μm concentrations of WIN-55,212-2 (Fig. 4A). Because pRb controls cell cycle by binding to and inhibiting the E2F transcription factors, we determined the protein expression of E2F (1-4) transcription factors. As shown in Fig. 4A, WIN-55,212-2 treatment of cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in E2F transcription factors. Relative density data revealed an inhibition in E2F-1 (81 and 86%), E2F-2 (12 and 30%), E2F-3 (30 and 41%), and E2F-4 (10 and 38%) at a concentration of 7.5 and 10 μm WIN-55,212-2. Because the activity of E2F is known to be dependent on its heterodimeric association with members of DP family of proteins, we also evaluated the effect of WIN-55,212-2 treatment on both members of DP family viz. DP-1 and DP-2. Immunoblot and densitometric analysis data revealed a decrease in the protein expression of DP-1 (37 and 48%) and DP-2 (30 and 56%) at 7.5 and 10 μm concentration of WIN-55,212-2 (Fig. 4A). In the next series of experiments we assessed the effect of WIN-55,212-2 on pRB, E2F family of proteins (1-4) and its heterodimeric partners DP-1 and DP-2 in androgen-insensitive cell PC3. Cells were treated with different doses of WIN-55,212-2 (5, 10, 20, 25, 30 μm), and we found a decrease in the protein expression of pRB, E2F (1-4), DP-1, and DP-2 at 20-30 μm doses (Fig. 3B). WIN-55,212-2-induced Sustained Activation of ERK and Inhibition of PI3K/AKT Leads to Apoptosis through Cannabinoid Receptors—It has been reported that challenging gliomas with cannabinoids leads to the activation of ERK1/2 signaling and AKT inhibition (26Gomez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Sanchez C. Haro A. Guzman M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Galve-Roperh I. Sanchez C. Cortes M.L. Gomez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzman M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). This sustained ERK1/2 activation can mediate cell cycle arrest (8Guzman M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We observed a significant and sustained activation of ERK1/2 and significant inhibition of PI3K (p85) and AKT (Thr308) when LNCaP cell were treated with WIN-55,212-2 at a dose of 1-10 μm (Fig. 5A). To confirm that ERK1/2 activation is cannabinoid receptor-mediated, cells were pretreated with 3 μm SR141716 (CB1 antagonist) and SR144528 (CB2 antagonist) for 3 h followed by treatment with WIN-55,212-2. Data in Fig. 5B show that there was no activation of ERK1/2 when treated with the antagonists alone. WIN-55,212-2 (7.5 μm) treatment resulted in significant activation of ERK1/2. When antagonist were coadministered with WIN-55,212-2, there was a decrease in the protein expression of ERK1/2 and a significant increase in the protein expression of PARP (116) as compared with the treatment 7.5 μm WIN-55,212-2 alone (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that sustained ERK1/2 activation and subsequent apoptosis is mediated through cannabinoid receptors. WIN-55,212-2-induced Sustained Activation of ERK1/2 Leads to Cell Growth Inhibition with the Induction of Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest—To define the role of ERK1/2 in cannabinoid receptor-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, LNCaP cells were pretreated with ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (30 μm) for 1 h. This treatment alone resulted in no change in the morphology of the cells. However, 7.5 μm WIN-55,212-2 treatment resulted in distinct morphological changes in LNCaP cells, as cells became round and detached from the surface of the plate, whereas pretreatment of LNCaP cells with PD98059 (30 μm) prevented these morphological changes (Fig. 6A). WIN-55,212-2 treatment of LNCap cells results in G1 cell cycle arrest. To assess whether cell cycle arrest is mediated via activation of ERK1/2, we next performed DNA cell cycle analysis. As shown in Fig. 6B, blocking of ERK1/2 activation by its inhibitor PD98059 resulted in a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase of cell cycle (72%) when compared with WIN-55,212-2 treatment alone (81%). To assess whether cell cycle dysregulation leads to induction of apoptosis, we next quantified the extent of apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 6C, WIN-55,212-2 treatment of LNCaP cells at a dose of 7.5 μm resulted in 23% of apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was only 9% when WIN-55,212-2 (7.5 μm) was coadministered with PD98059 (30 μm). We next determined whether PD98059 reversed the activation of ERK1/2 by WIN-55,212-2 treatment alone, and we found that ERK1/2 protein expression was significantly decreased when WIN-55,212-2 was given in combination with PD98059 (Fig. 6D). We next determined the effect of PD98059 on p27/KIP1 (Fig. 6D), a cell cycle regulatory molecule operative in G1 phase of the cell cycle, and cyclin D1 because of its function in influencing cell proliferation. WIN-55,212-2 treatment increased the protein expression of p27/KIP1 whereas this increase in expression was down-regulated when WIN-55,212-2 was given in combination with PD98059. WIN-55,212-2 treatment significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin D1, and this effect was significantly reversed (>55%) when WIN-55,212-2 was coadministered with PD98059 (Fig. 6D). We also observed a decrease (62%) in the protein expression of BCl-2, a pro-apoptotic protein when the cells were treated with WIN-55,212-2 at 7.5 μm; this effect was significantly reversed to 50% when WIN-55,212-2 was coadministered with ERK1/2 inhibitor (Fig. 6D).FIGURE 6Effect of simultaneous treatment of WIN-55,212-2 and ERK1/2 inhibitor.

LNCaP cells transfected with 150 nm ERK1, 80 nm ERK2 or scrambled siRNA (150 nm) for 48 h and were then treated with 7.5 μm WIN-55,212-2 for 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against ERK1/2 (phospho-p44/42, Thr202/Tyr204), p27, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and β-actin. The bar diagram represents relative density of the bands normalized to β-actin.

We observed that WIN-55,212-2 did not induce ERK1/2 activation and p27 when ERK1/2 was silenced (Fig. 6E). Similarly, protein expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 which down-regulated by WIN-55,212-2 was found to be reversed when ERK1/2 was silenced. WIN-55,212-2 Induces Apoptosis via the Classical Apoptotic Pathway—The above data suggest that WIN-55,212-2 induces growth inhibition via cell cycle arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle followed by apoptosis. Because p53 is one of the major regulators of apoptosis, expression of this tumor suppressor sensitizes cells to apoptosis in response to stress. We observed a significant up-regulation in the protein expression of p53 when cells were treated with WIN-55,212-2 (Fig. 7A). p53-induced apoptosis results from overlapping downstream pathways that suppress mitogenic and survival signaling and promote proapoptotic signaling. In this context, p53 can up-regulate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax and possibly transcriptionally repress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Because Bax and Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in apoptosis"
https://openalex.org/W2101773993,"The C1 domain mediates the diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent translocation of conventional and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. In novel PKC isoforms (nPKCs), this domain binds membranes with sufficiently high affinity to recruit nPKCs to membranes in the absence of any other targeting mechanism. In conventional PKC (cPKC) isoforms, however, the affinity of the C1 domain for DAG is two orders of magnitude lower, necessitating the coordinated binding of the C1 domain and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated C2 domain for translocation and activation. Here we identify a single residue that tunes the affinity of the C1b domain for DAG- (but not phorbol ester-) containing membranes. This residue is invariant as Tyr in the C1b domain of cPKCs and invariant as Trp in all other PKC C1 domains. Binding studies using model membranes, as well as live cell imaging studies of yellow fluorescent protein-tagged C1 domains, reveal that Trp <i>versus</i> Tyr toggles the C1 domain between a species with sufficiently high affinity to respond to agonist-produced DAG to one that is unable to respond to physiological levels of DAG. In addition, we show that while Tyr at this switch position causes cytosolic localization of the C1 domain under unstimulated conditions, Trp targets these domains to the Golgi, likely due to basal levels of DAG at this region. Thus, Trp <i>versus</i> Tyr at this key position in the C1 domain controls both the membrane affinity and localization of PKC. The finding that a single residue controls the affinity of the C1 domain for DAG-containing membranes provides a molecular explanation for why 1) DAG alone is sufficient to activate nPKCs but not cPKCs and 2) nPKCs target to the Golgi."

https://openalex.org/W2039011843,Ventricular tachycardia is a common and lethal complication after myocardial infarction. Here we show that focal transfer of a gene encoding a dominant-negative version of the KCNH2 potassium channel (KCNH2-G628S) to the infarct scar border eliminated all ventricular arrhythmias in a porcine model. No proarrhythmia or other negative effects were discernable. Our results demonstrate the potential viability of gene therapy for ablation of ventricular arrhythmias.
https://openalex.org/W2055208759,"FtsZ, a homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, is involved in the process of cell division, particularly in septum formation in bacteria. The primary amino acid sequences of this protein are fairly conserved in prokaryotes. We observed that a eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr protein kinase, PknA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, when expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited cell elongation due to a defect in septum formation. We found that FtsZ either from Escherichia coli (eFtsZ) or from M. tuberculosis (mFtsZ) was phosphorylated on co-expression with PknA. Consistent with these observations, solid phase binding and in vitro kinase assays revealed the ability of PknA to interact with mFtsZ protein and also to phosphorylate it. We, therefore, ascertained mFtsZ as a substrate of PknA. Furthermore, the phosphorylated mFtsZ exhibited impairment in its GTP hydrolysis and polymerization abilities. Thus, our results highlighted the ability of PknA to phosphorylate as well as to regulate the functionality of FtsZ, the protein central to cell division throughout the bacterial lineage.

Thus, our results highlighted the ability of PknA to phosphorylate as well as to regulate the functionality of FtsZ, the protein central to cell division throughout the bacterial lineage. Bacterial cell division is a tightly regulated process. It comprises a DNA cycle and a division cycle. The DNA cycle involves DNA replication and chromosome segregation. During the division cycle, the cell identifies the midpoint and differentiates the site in preparation for septum formation as well as cytokinesis. The septum formation initiates with the development of a contractile Z-ring at mid-cell, which sets up a scaffold for the recruitment of additional proteins. These proteins congregate at the Z-ring in a highly orchestrated fashion, causing an orderly assembly of the septal ring. The septal ring during the progression of the event constricts, culminating in complete disappearance, and finally, the division septum forms that lead toward cell separation (1Rothfield L.I. Justice S.S. Cell. 1997; 88: 581-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The ring-like structure is primarily composed of FtsZ protein, which is the key molecule responsible for initiating the earliest event in the process of septation. In several bacterial species, the FtsZ-binding proteins involved in the process of cytokinesis have been identified (2Weiss D.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In fact, many, albeit not all, proteins involved in the division cycle are known, and their interactions have already been well characterized in several bacteria. In Escherichia coli, at least 15 different proteins have been localized at the division site in a sequential manner (3Vicente M. Rico A.I. Martinez-Arteaga R. Mingorance J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in Bacillus subtilis, the Z-ring has been shown to recruit at least 10 cell division proteins directly or indirectly (4Errington J. Daniel R.A. Scheffers D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of proteins involved in septum formation are well conserved among bacteria, indicating common division machinery. The bacterial FtsZ is known to be a homolog of eukaryotic tubulin (5Bi E.F. Lutkenhaus J. Nature. 1991; 354: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 6Erickson H.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 362-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Like tubulin, FtsZ is also a GTPase and has been reported to have the ability to polymerize into dynamic polymers in a GTP-regulated manner (7RayChaudhuri D. Park J.T. Nature. 1992; 359: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 8Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol.

In this context, we have focused on FtsZ from a slow growing pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the dreadful disease tuberculosis. The genome sequence of M. tuberculosis has revealed the presence of the FtsZ homolog, which has been purified, characterized, and recently crystallized (10White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. Seitz L.E. Moore G.D. Borhani D.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Leung A.K.W. White E.L. Ross L.J. Reynolds R.C. DeVito J.A. Borhani D.W. J. Mol.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1634-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, except for FtsW, identifiable analogs of putative FtsZ-interacting proteins are lacking (13Datta P. Dasgupta A. Bhakta S. Basu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24983-24987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Rajagopalan M. Maloney E. Dziadek J. Poplawska M. Lofton H. Chauhan A. Madiraju M.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 250: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is also not clear how the FtsZ activities are regulated in this pathogen. In earlier reports, we and others have indicated the involvement of PknA, a Ser/Thr protein kinase, in the process of cell division (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Kang C.M. Abbott D.W. Park S.T. Dascher C.C. Cantley L.C. Husson R.N. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1692-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the precise regulation of activities by this kinase has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we have concentrated on this aspect and identified FtsZ as an interacting partner of PknA. In vitro assays with PknA showed its ability to phosphorylate M. tuberculosis FtsZ (mFtsZ) 3The abbreviations used are: mFtsZ, M. tuberculosis FtsZ; eFtsZ, E. coli FtsZ; DAPI, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: mFtsZ, M. tuberculosis FtsZ; eFtsZ, E. coli FtsZ; DAPI, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. protein. In concordance with this observation, our results also indicated that mFtsZ was phosphorylated on co-expression with PknA in E. coli cells. Interestingly, we found that the phosphorylation of mFtsZ affected its GTPase activity as well as polymerization ability. Thus, our results, for the first time, established the association of PknA in regulating the functionality of FtsZ, the protein involved in the process of cytokinesis throughout the bacterial lineage. Materials—Restriction/modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. All other fine chemicals including 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, GTP, glutathione, biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, streptavidin-HRP (Sigma), and glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) were commercially available. Oligonucleotides used in this study were custom-synthesized (Biobasic Inc. or IDT). [γ-32P]ATP (3000-5000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Jonaki Laboratories, Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, Hyderabad, India. PCR Amplification, Construction of Recombinant Plasmids— Genomic DNA isolated from E. coli strain K12 (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manitis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). The ftsZ open reading frames were PCR-amplified using the Expand long template PCR system (mixture of Pwo and TaqDNA polymerases; Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Both of the amplified fragments were initially cloned in pUC19 vector (pUC-eFtsZ and pUC-mFtsZ), and nucleic acid sequences were determined using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). These constructs (pUC-eFtsZ/pUC-mFtsZ) were digested with SacI/HindIII, ligated to corresponding sites of pGEX-KG (pGEX-eFtsZ/pGEX-mFtsZ) and subsequently transformed in E. coli strain DH5α. Clones containing the genes of interest were confirmed by restriction analysis. The methods adopted for PCR amplification, site-directed mutagenesis, and subsequent cloning in expression vectors of other genes (pMAL-PknA, p19Kpro-PknA, pMAL-K42N, p19Kpro-K42N, and pMAL-PPP) used in this study either were described elsewhere or will be provided on request (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The pGEX-eFtsZ/pGEX-mFtsZ were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for monitoring overexpression and subsequent purification of proteins. Overnight cultures (∼15 h at 37°C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) were reinoculated and grown to an A600 of ∼0.6. Cells were then induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, harvested after 3 h, and suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were sonicated, and the supernatant fraction was collected after centrifugation (17,600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). This fraction was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with elution buffer (5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The procedure adopted for purification of other proteins used in this study was mentioned earlier (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Biotinylation and Solid Phase Protein-Protein Interaction Studies—Purified mFtsZ after dialysis against PBS was incubated (2 h at 25 °C with gentle mixing) with 10-fold molar excess of biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The mixture was again dialyzed (overnight with four changes of buffer) against PBS to remove traces of free biotin and used in interaction studies following estimation of protein (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). In protein-protein interaction studies, MBP-PknA (1 μg/well) was coated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates and kept for 3 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS containing 0.5% Tween, blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.5% Tween) was added to the wells of the plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. This was followed by washing and incubation (1 h at 37 °C) with different concentrations of biotinylated mFtsZ in PBS. The interaction of mFtsZ with PknA was finally assessed by the addition of streptavidin-HRP (1 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C) and detection of the enzyme activity in each well with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. Binding of biotinylated mFtsZ with immobilized PknA was assessed in the presence of different concentrations of non-biotinylated mFtsZ or PknA to determine the specificity of interaction. In each case, for controls instead of PknA, the equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin was adsorbed to the wells of microtiter plates. Kinase Assay—The auto-/transphosphorylation ability of PknA was determined in an in vitro kinase assay mentioned elsewhere (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of PknA (1 μg) with or without mFtsZ were mixed with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2), and the reaction was initiated by adding 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Following incubation at 25 °C for 20 min, 5× SDS sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Samples were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and resolved using 8-10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried in a gel drier (Bio-Rad) at 70 °C for 2 h, and finally analyzed on a phosphorimaging device (Bio. Rad). For monitoring the effect of PPP, the above reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min after the addition of purified MBP-PPP fusion protein. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. GTPase Assay—The GTPase activity of the protein (mFtsZ or its phosphorylated form) was assessed in a microtiter plate-based colorimetric assay by determining the ability of the enzyme to liberate inorganic phosphate (Pi) from GTP (21Sarin J. Aggarwal S. Chaba R. Varshney G.C. Chakraborti P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44590-44597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Henkel R. Vandeberg J. Walsh A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, mFtsZ or its phosphorylated form (5 μm) was incubated with increasing concentration of GTP (0-1 mm) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 15 min. The enzymatic reaction was terminated by the addition of an acidic solution (200 μl) of malachite green, ammonium molybdate, and polyvinyl alcohol. The liberated Pi formed phosphomolybdate-malachite complex, and this was detected at 650 nm. The values obtained were corrected by subtracting the blank readings obtained for non-enzymatic release of Pi. A standard curve with sodium phosphate monobasic was run concurrently with each experiment, and GTPase activity (mean ± S.D.) is expressed as nanomoles of Pi liberated/min/mg of protein. Western Blotting—Plasmids (p19Kpro and pGEX-KG) harboring different open reading frames (pknA, K42N, and ftsZs from E. coli/M. tuberculosis) were co-transformed in E. coli (strain DH5α for PknA/eFtsZ and BL21(DE3) for PknA/mFtsZ). After dual selection on ampicillin (75 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 μg/ml) plates, the clones obtained were cultured in LB broth in the presence of both of the antibiotics and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (37 °C/3 h). Cell extracts obtained were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blotting using different primary (anti-PknA, anti-GST-HRP conjugate, and anti-phosphothreonine) and secondary (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate) antibodies. Finally, blots were developed with ECL detection system following the manufacturer's (GE Healthcare) recommended protocol. Light Scattering—The mFtsZ polymerization was measured by light scattering in a fluorescence reader (Molecular Devices, model Gemini EM) with both the excitation and the emission wavelengths set at 600 nm (23Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mFtsZ or its phosphorylated form was added to a final concentration of 5 μm to the well of 96-well FLUOTRAC (Greiner) plate, which was then placed (30 °C for 10 min) into the chamber of fluorescence reader to establish a baseline. Following the addition of 1 mm GTP (reaction volume = 100 μl), data were collected for an additional 50 min. The net change in light scattering was determined by subtracting the base line from each reading and plotted as a function of time. Protein Sedimentation—Purified mFtsZ or its phosphorylated form (5 μm protein/reaction) was incubated with or without 1 mm GTP at 25 °C for 10 min (reaction volume = 100 μl) in polymerization buffer (50 mm sodium MES, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). This was followed by high speed centrifugation (Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge) as described elsewhere (9Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) to separate the supernatant and pellet fractions. Pellets were resuspended (volume = 100 μl), and samples (both supernatant and pellet fractions) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized following staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Fluorescence Microscopy—Overnight grown E. coli DH5α cells transformed with p19Kpro-PknA or p19Kpro were harvested by centrifugation. After washing with PBS, cells were suspended in 1 ml of 70% ethanol for fixation. The fixed cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and spread on a glass slide pretreated with poly-lysine. Cells were stained with DAPI solution (1 mg/ml in 50% glycerol) and examined in a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). PknA Expression in E. coli Exhibited Elongated Cells with Segregated Nucleoids—We previously reported that constitutive expression of the pknA open reading frame of M. tuberculosis in E. coli resulted in a remarkable elongation of cells (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There could be two possible arguments in respect to the filamentous morphology of these E. coli cells. Firstly, the morphological changes could be a consequence of defect in nuclei replication and segregation, which is the first step in cell division. Secondly, the elongated morphology might be the result of an imperfection in septum formation (cytokinesis), which is the later stage in the process of cell division. To investigate these aspects, we stained the cells with DAPI and visualized them under a confocal microscope. Interestingly, the E. coli cells harboring p19Kpro-PknA showed a beaded structure with no sign of constriction (Fig. 1A, right panel), indicating that the nucleoids were segregating from each other in the filamentous cells. However, cells transformed with p19Kpro vector (Fig. 1A, left panel) were either mono- or bi-nucleoidal. This led us to believe that the elongated cell morphology, as a result of expression of PknA in E. coli, was due to defect in septum formation. Therefore, we hypothesized that PknA might be interacting with proteins involved in the process. Available literature indicated that FtsZ is the key cell division protein involved in septum formation of bacteria (2Weiss D.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To have an insight on its association with PknA, we co-transformed both p19kpro-PknA and pGEX-eFtsZ in E. coli strain DH5α. Colonies grown in the presence of both ampicillin and hygromycin were screened. One such colony harboring both of the expression plasmids was selected, cultured in LB broth in the presence of both of the antibiotics, and induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Lysates from these cells exhibited co-expression of both PknA and eFtsZ in Western blotting using anti-phosphothreonine (Fig. 1B, upper panel), anti-GST (Fig. 1B, middle panel), and anti-PknA (Fig. 1B, lower panel) antibodies. It is worth mentioning here that both of the proteins co-expressed (although at different levels) despite using two incompatible plasmids carrying the same replicon, and this was consistent with earlier reports (24Yang W.

To visualize the phosphosignal generated by expressed proteins in E. coli, we utilized the anti-phosphothreonine antibody, which detects phosphothreonine residues in a protein or peptide largely independent of surrounding amino acids. As expected, the absence of any Ser/Thr protein kinases in E. coli, the antibody did not recognize any protein in the lysates prepared from the cells transformed with p19Kpro vector alone (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 1). On the other hand, phosphosignals corresponding to PknA but not for GST could be detected in the lysates prepared from cells transformed with p19Kpro-PknA and pGEX-KG (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 2). Interestingly, lysates prepared from cells co-expressing both PknA and eFtsZ showed phosphosignal corresponding to both of the proteins (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 3). Furthermore, co-expression of K42N, a kinase-dead mutant of PknA (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with eFtsZ, did not yield any phosphosignal (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 4). Expression of all the proteins was confirmed subsequently by using anti-GST or anti-PknA antibodies (Fig. 1B, middle and lower panels). It is noteworthy that in Western blotting using anti-GST antibody, besides recognizing only the GST fusion protein, samples co-expressing PknA and GST-eftsZ exhibited an additional band corresponding to the molecular weight of GST (Fig. 1B, middle panel, lane 3). This, we presume, could be cross-contamination of sample from the adjacent lane (Fig. 1B, middle panel, lanes 2 and 3) and did not seem to be unusual. Additionally, as evident in the Western blot with anti-PknA polyclonal antisera, the expression profiles of PknA and K42N mutant proteins were slightly different (see multiple bands for wild-type protein, whereas a single band was visible for the K42N mutant protein; Fig. 1B, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 4). This was noticed in spite of the use of same vector (p19Kpro) for expression of both of the proteins. Such an observation perhaps points toward the difference in the stability of the PknA and K42N mutant proteins. In fact, similar behavior of kinase-dead mutants of other Ser/Thr protein kinases has already been reported (25Beilina A. Brug M.V.D. Ahmad R. Kesavapany S. Miller D.W. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5703-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We also observed a ∼70-kDa band recognized by the anti-PknA antibody in all the samples. We interpret this band as a result of nonspecific recognition of some E. coli protein by the anti-PknA antibody. This is certainly not unusual since the antiserum we used in our experiment was not purified. However, such nonspecific recognition of host proteins did not affect the interpretation of our results. Thus, all these lines of evidence established that the PknA phosphorylated the eFtsZ in vivo. mftsZ Is a Substrate of PknA—Our findings with eFtsZ tempted us to envisage the relationship between mFtsZ and PknA. Besides this, analysis of nucleotide-derived amino acid sequences through the Clustal X 1.81 program (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35300) Google Scholar) revealed significant homology (∼78.6%) between eFtsZ and mFtsZ. Therefore, it is very likely that both of the proteins would behave similarly. To test this hypothesis, we expressed mFtsZ as a fusion protein with GST in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), purified by affinity chromatography (data not shown), and subsequently monitored its binding with purified MBP-PknA (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in vitro (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2A clearly indicates that binding of biotinylated mFtsZ and PknA exhibited a saturation kinetics (half-maximal binding = ∼1.2 μg/ml; dissociation constant = 41 ± 8 nm). On the other hand, no detectable binding of mFtsZ could be observed when bovine serum albumin replaced PknA. Both unlabeled PknA and unlabeled mFtsZ effectively inhibited the binding of biotinylated mFtsZ to PknA (Fig. 2B). The 50% inhibition of binding was achieved at ∼50 and ∼80 μg/ml PknA and mFtsZ, respectively. However, no significant inhibition of binding could be detected with MBP-β-galactosidase, further confirming the specificity of the in vitro interaction between PknA and mFtsZ. We have already reported the autophosphorylating activity of PknA as well as its transphosphorylating ability for known exogenous substrates (histone and myelin basic protein) in vitro (15Chaba R. Raje M. Chakraborti P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To examine whether mFtsZ could be a substrate of PknA, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. Although mFtsZ alone was unable to show any phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, left panel, lane 8), on incubating with MBP-PknA, it was phosphorylated (Fig. 2C, left panel, lane 3). A weak phosphosignal for mFtsZ (Fig. 2C, left panel, lane 5) was noticed when it was added in the reaction after heating (90 °C for 5 min). The transphosphorylation was PknA-specific since no γ-32P incorporation of mFtsZ could be detected when the reaction was carried out with the kinase-dead mutant K42N (Fig. 2C, left panel, lane 6). To rule out the possibility of the involvement of GST fusion tag in the transphosphorylation reaction, we incubated MBP-PknA + GST with [γ-32P]ATP. As expected, we did not see any phosphosignal for GST (Fig. 2C, right panel, lane 1). Furthermore, incubation of MBP + GST with [γ-32P]ATP did not yield any phosphosignal, confirming no contribution of fusion tags in auto-/transphosphorylation reactions (Fig. 2C, right panel, lane 2). It is interesting to mention here that the transphosphorylation of tubulin, the eukaryotic homolog of FtsZ, by cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk1, in regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis has recently been documented (27Fourest-Lieuvin A. Peris L. Gache V. Garcia-Saez I. Juillan-Binard C. Lantez V. Job D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Available reports with PPP (renamed as Pstp or Mstp), the only Ser/Thr protein phosphatase in M. tuberculosis, indicated its ability to dephosphorylate PknA as well as artificial substrates phosphorylated by this kinase (28Boitel B. Ortiz-Lombardia M. Duran R. Pompeo F. Cole S.T. Cervenansky C. Alzari P.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1493-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Chopra P. Singh B. Singh R. Vohra R. Koul A. Meena L.S. Koduri H. Ghildiyal M. Deol P. Das T.K. Tyagi A.K. Singh Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 11: 112-120Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, incubation with PPP dephosphorylated the PknA mediated transphosphorylation of mFtsZ (Fig. 2C, left panel, lane 4). However, it needs to be mentioned here that we do not have any evidence that PPP per se dephosphorylated mFtsZ. Based on the available report it seems very likely that PPP dephosphorylated PknA, which in turn prevented the transphosphorylation of mFtsZ (29Chopra P. Singh B. Singh R. Vohra R. Koul A. Meena L.S. Koduri H. Ghildiyal M. Deol P. Das T.K. Tyagi A.K. Singh Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 11: 112-120Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At this juncture, it was intriguing to know whether mFtsZ could be a substrate of PknA in vivo, and for this, we utilized an E. coli-based expression system to co-express both of the proteins. mFtsZ on co-expression with PknA yielded a phosphosignal in Western blotting with anti-phosphothreonine antibody (data not shown), and this result was analogous to that obtained with eFtsZ (Fig. 1B). We further purified mFtsZ by affinity chromatography utilizing glutathione affinity resin from the E. coli cells harboring both pGEX-mFtsZ and p19Kpro-PknA. As evidenced by the Western blotting using anti-phosphothreonine antibody, the purified protein was phosphorylated (Fig. 2D, upper panel). In contrast, the mFtsZ protein purified from E. coli cells transformed with only pGEX-mFtsZ did not show any phosphorylation (Fig. 2D, upper panel). As expected, mFtsZ and its phosphorylated form were recognized by anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2D, lower panel). Thus, our results unambiguously established the interaction between these two proteins and argued in favor of mFtsZ being one of the substrates of PknA. Phosphorylation of mFtsZ Affected Its Functionality—FtsZ protein is known to possess GTPase activity (7RayChaudhur"
https://openalex.org/W2037692396,"Phosphorylation-dependent activation of the transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 plays an important role in TGFβ-dependent signal transduction. Following phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, these molecules are translocated to the nucleus where they interact with coactivators and/or corepressors, including p300, CBP, and P/CAF, and regulate the expression of TGFβ target genes. In the current study, we demonstrate that both Smad2 and Smad3 are acetylated by the coactivators p300 and CBP in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Smad2 is also acetylated by P/CAF. The acetylation of Smad2 was significantly higher than that of Smad3. Lys19 in the MH1 domain was identified as the major acetylated residue in both the long and short isoform of Smad2. Mutation of Lys19 also reduced the p300-mediated acetylation of Smad3. By generating acetyl-Lys19-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that endogenous Smad2 is acetylated on this residue in response to TGFβ signaling. Acetylation of the short isoform of Smad2 improves its DNA binding activity in vitro and enhances its association with target promoters in vivo, thereby augmenting its transcriptional activity. Acetylation of Lys19 also enhanced the DNA binding activity of Smad3. Our data indicate that acetylation of Lys19 induces a conformational change in the MH1 domain of the short isoform of Smad2, thereby making its DNA binding domain accessible for interactions with DNA. Thus, coactivator-mediated acetylation of receptor-activated Smad molecules could represent a novel way to regulate TGFβ signaling.

Dysfunction of TGFβ signaling has been implicated in various human disorders ranging from vascular diseases to cancer progression (for a review, see Ref. 1Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). The effects of TGFβ are mediated through type I and type II receptors, which are transmembrane proteins possessing cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domains for signal propagation. TGFβ first binds to the type II receptor; the type I receptor is thereafter recruited to the receptor complex and is phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic domain by the type II receptor (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). The activated type I receptor then phosphorylates the receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads; Smad2 and Smad3) in their C-terminal SSXS motif (3Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). The activated Smads then interact with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus were they act as transcription factors together with co-activators and co-repressors (4Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). A large number of transcriptional coactivators, including CBP, p300, P/CAF, and GCN5, have intrinsic acetyltransferase activities that are important for their abilities to enhance transcription (5Bannister A.J.

Acetylation involves the transfer of the acetyl moiety from acetyl coenzyme-A to the amino group of a lysine residue of the acceptor protein. Acetylation is a dynamic process and the balance between the acetylation and deacetylation of histones has major effects on chromatin structure and transcription (for a review see Ref. 12Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Histones H3 and H4 are acetylated on specific lysine residues in their N-terminals, thereby relaxing the nucleosomal structure and allowing transcription. It has been demonstrated that non-histone proteins such as p53 (13Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P.

Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) also are acetylated and that this modification affects their interactions with DNA and other proteins. Protein acetylation can also affect protein stability, because it has been demonstrated that acetylation prevents ubiquitination of the same lysine residues (18Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H.

Bioessays. 2005; 27: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We have previously found that the stability of Smad7, an inhibitory Smad molecule, is regulated by reversible acetylation (22Simonsson M. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Gronroos E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of exon 3 in the Smad2 gene gives rise to two distinct protein isoforms (23Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The short isoform (Smad2(ΔE3)), unlike full-length Smad2 (Smad2(FL)), retains DNA-binding activity (24Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The two isoforms of Smad2 are coexpressed throughout mouse development, but Smad2(FL) is the dominant isoform in most cell lines (23Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that expression of Smad2(ΔE3), but not Smad2(FL), in Smad2-deficient mice results in viable and fertile animals (25Dunn N.R. Koonce C.H. Anderson D.C. Islam A. Bikoff E.K. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that Smad2(ΔE3), but not Smad2(FL), has the ability to activate all essential target genes downstream of TGFβ during development. In the current study, we demonstrate that both isoforms of Smad2, as well as Smad3, are acetylated on a specific lysine residue, Lys19, in their MH1 domains in response to TGFβ signaling. Acetylation of the short isoform of Smad2 (Smad2(ΔE3)) augments its DNA binding activity in vitro and enhances its association with target promoters in vivo. Acetylation of Lys19 also enhances the DNA binding of Smad3. Our data indicate that acetylation of Lys19 induces a conformational change in the MH1 domain of Smad2(ΔE3), thereby making its DNA binding domain accessible for interactions with DNA. Cell Culture—All tissue culture media and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen and Sigma. 293T, HepG2, HeLa, COS-1, and HaCaT cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Smad2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from Anita Roberts (NCI) (26Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P.

For overnight starvation, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), non-essential amino acids (1×), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. TGFβ, Reagents, and Antibodies—TGFβ was obtained from Peprotech EC. TSA was obtained from Sigma.

FLAG antibodies (M5) were from Sigma and anti-acetyl lysine antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology and Upstate Biotechnology. The monoclonal Smad2/3 antibody (cat. no. 610843) was from BD Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-acetyl-Lys19 Smad2 antisera was raised against an acetylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 15–24 in Smad2, and was affinity-purified as described (22Simonsson M. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Gronroos E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphorylated Smad2 antibody has been described elsewhere (27Persson U. Izumi H. Souchelnytskyi S. Itoh S. Grimsby S. Engstrom U. Heldin C.H. Funa K. ten Dijke P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies and protein-G Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmids and DNA Transfections—The expression vectors for FLAG- and FLAG-tagged Smad2(FL) and Smad3 in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were generously provided by P. ten Dijke (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). The short isoform of Smad2 (Smad2(ΔE3)) was generated from the corresponding Smad2(FL) construct by PCR. The expression vectors for p300, CBP and P/CAF have been described (28Itoh S. Ericsson J. Nishikawa J. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4291-4298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutants in Smad2(FL), Smad2(ΔE3), and Smad3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). The Smad-responsive ARE-Luc and 12xCAGA-Luc promoter-reporter constructs have been described (28Itoh S. Ericsson J. Nishikawa J. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4291-4298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using the MBS transfection kit (Stratagene). Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 1% aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding the appropriate antibodies plus protein G-Sepharose beads, followed by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with 0.5 m NaCl and once with water. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline with the addition of 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. After washing, the blots were visualized with Western Blotting Chemiluminescence Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were transiently transfected with promoter-reporter genes in the absence or presence of expression vectors for the indicated Smad protein, either wild-type or the indicated mutants. 24-h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and treated in the absence or presence of TGFβ (5 ng/ml). After 36 h, luciferase activities were determined in duplicate samples as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The pCH110 vector encoding the β-galactosidase reporter gene (Amersham Biosciences) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase values (relative light units, RLU) were calculated by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. The data represent the average ±S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicates. Electromobility Shift Assay—Total cell extracts were prepared from transiently transfected COS-1 cells using hypertonic lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% aprotinin). The transfected proteins were visualized by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by quantitation with a charge-coupled device camera (Fuji) and image analysis software (Aida Image Analyzer, version 3.10). Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with 1 μg of poly-(dIdC) and a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing four Smad-binding sites (4xCAGA) in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% aprotinin). The samples were incubated for 15 min on ice and run on 5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. For EMSAs with purified GST-Smad2(ΔE3) and in vitro translated Smad2(ΔE3)-MH1, the proteins were visualized by Western blotting, followed by quantitation with a charge-coupled device camera (Fuji) and image analysis software (Aida Image Analyzer, version 3.10). Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dIdC) and 32P-labeled 4xCAGA probe in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm spermidine). The reaction products were separated and analyzed as described above. Where indicated, GST-Smad2(ΔE3) was incubated in the presence of purified GST-P/CAF in the absence or presence of 1 mm acetyl coenzyme A in acetylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm sodium butyrate) for 2 h prior to the EMSA. DNAP Assays—Cell lysates from transiently transfected 293T cells were precleared with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) and subsequently used in DNA precipitation (DNAP) assays. The biotinylated double-stranded DNA was composed of a multimerized Smad-binding element (4xCAGA). DNA-bound proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose for 60 min at 4 °C, washed, and detected by Western blot analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (29Kurisaki K. Kurisaki A. Valcourt U. Terentiev A.A. Pardali K. Ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H.

For the analysis of transfected material, 1 × 106 COS-1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of FLAG-tagged Smad constructs, with or without constitutively active ALK5. After transfection, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, sonicated, and one-fourth of the material was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of the indicated antibody. The cross-link was reversed at 65 °C overnight, followed by proteinase K treatment. The DNA was extracted using phenol:chloroform. For analysis of endogenous Smad2, two 15-cm dishes of HeLa cells (10 × 106 cells) were used per immunoprecipitation. The PCR conditions for each target gene were optimized to remain in the linear range of amplification. The primers used to amplify the PAI-1 promoter have been described (29Kurisaki K. Kurisaki A. Valcourt U. Terentiev A.A. Pardali K. Ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Moustakas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4494-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The primers used for the p21 promoter were (forward primer) 5′-CAT TGT GAA GCT CAG TAC CAC AA-3′ and (reverse primer) 5′-TGC TTT CAG GCA TTT CAA ATA GAC-3′. The PCR primers used for 12xCAGA-Luc reporter gene were (forward primer) 5′-ACT GCA GGT GCC AGA AC ATT-3′ and (reverse primer) 5′-GTT CCA TCT TCC AGC GGA TA-3′. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels, and stained by ethidium bromide. Smad2(FL), Smad2(ΔE3), and Smad3 Are Acetylated—The histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 are able to interact with Smad2, -3, and -4, and they function as coactivators of TGFβ-induced transcription in a Smad4-dependent fashion (30Feng X.H.

Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4291-4298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kahata K. Hayashi M. Asaka M. Hellman U. Kitagawa H. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to determine if Smad2(FL) and Smad3 were acetylated in vivo. When Smad2(FL) or Smad3 were transiently expressed in 293T cells, both proteins were acetylated in response to coexpression of either p300 or CBP (Fig. 1A). The acetylation of Smad2(FL) was more pronounced than that of Smad3, indicating that Smad2(FL) is a better substrate for these acetyltransferases. Smad2(FL) and Smad3 are highly similar proteins, but whereas Smad3 can bind DNA directly, Smad2(FL) is dependent on coactivators to associate with DNA. This difference between Smad2(FL) and Smad3 is caused by an additional exon (exon 3) that is inserted in front of the DNA binding domain in Smad2(FL) (24Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A splice variant of Smad2, which lacks exon 3 (Smad2(ΔE3)) has been identified (23Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This isoform of Smad2 plays an important role during embryonal development (25Dunn N.R. Koonce C.H. Anderson D.C. Islam A. Bikoff E.K. Robertson E.J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine if Smad2(ΔE3) was acetylated and establish if the acetylation of the R-Smads was regulated by TGFβ signaling, Smad2(FL), Smad2(ΔE3), and Smad3 were transfected together with p300 in the absence or presence of constitutively active ALK5 receptor. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, expression of ALK5 enhanced the acetylation of all the Smads tested. In vitro acetylation assays using deletion mutants of GST-Smad2(FL) and immunoprecipitated p300, indicated that the major acetylation site in Smad2(FL) resided in the N-terminal MH1 domain (data not shown). To identify the lysine residues targeted by p300-mediated acetylation, all lysine residues in the MH1 domain of Smad2(FL) were mutated to arginine, either individually or in sets of two residues, and the mutant proteins were expressed in 293T cells in the absence or presence of p300. Mutation of Lys19 and Lys20 (K19R/K20R), but not mutation of other lysine residues, blocked the acetylation of Smad2(FL) (Fig. 1C). Lys19 and Lys20 are conserved between Smad2 and Smad3 and are located just in front of a specific insert in Smad2 (Fig. 2A). To identify the specific lysine residue acetylated by p300, Lys19, and Lys20 in Smad2(FL) were mutated individually and subjected to p300-mediated acetylation following expression in 293T cells. Mutation of Lys19 blocked the p300-mediated acetylation of Smad2(FL), whereas mutation of Lys20 had no effect (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Lys19 is the preferred site for p300-mediated acetylation of Smad2(FL). Mutation of Lys19 also blocked the p300-dependent acetylation of Smad2(ΔE3) (Fig. 2C, left panel). Mutation of Lys19 also reduced the acetylation of Smad2(FL) in HepG2, COS-1, and HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that Lys19 is the major acetylated residue in these cell lines. We were unable to detect any differences in the phosphorylation or interaction with p300 between wild-type Smad2(FL) or Smad2(ΔE3) and the corresponding K19R mutants (data not shown). The p300-dependent acetylation of Smad3 was attenuated when Lys19 was mutated, whereas mutation of Lys20 had no effect (Fig. 2C, right panel), suggesting that Lys19 is acetylated also in Smad3. Smad2(FL) and Smad2(ΔE3) were also acetylated by P/CAF in vivo and the acetylation of both proteins was lost following mutation of Lys19 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Lys19 in Smad2 is also targeted by P/CAF. We were unable to detect any acetylation of Smad3 by P/CAF under these conditions. Because Smad2(FL) and Smad2(ΔE3) were better substrates for p300, CBP, and P/CAF when compared with Smad3, we focused on Smad2 in our attempts to elucidate the functional role of acetylation of R-Smads. Lys19 in Smad2 Is Acetylated in Vivo—To determine if endogenous Smad2 was acetylated on Lys19, we generated an acetyl-Lys19-specific Smad2 antisera (AcK19). The affinity-purified antibody recognized wild-type Smad2(FL) following expression in 293T cells together with p300, whereas it failed to recognize the K19R mutant (Fig. 3A). The acetylation of Lys19 in endogenous Smad2 in HaCaT cells was enhanced following TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 3B). The acetylation was further enhanced when cells were treated with the deacetylase inhibitor TSA (compare lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 3B), suggesting that the acetylation of Lys19 is a dynamic process regulated by deacetylases. Smad2 was also acetylated on Lys19 in response to TGFβ stimulation in HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). The acetylation of endogenous Smad2 was inhibited by the acetyltransferase inhibitor anacardic acid (Fig. 3D), confirming that the acetylation of Lys19 in Smad2 is dependent on cellular acetyltransferases. The Lys19-specific antibody also recognized Smad3 in response to p300-mediated acetylation (Fig. S2), confirming that Lys19 is acetylated in Smad3. However, we were unable to detect any acetylation of endogenous Smad3 on Lys19, confirming our observation that the acetylation of Smad3 is low compared with Smad2. Following receptor-mediated phosphorylation, Smad2 functions as a transcription factor by interacting with the promoters of Smad target genes. We used the AcK19 antibody in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to determine if acetylated Smad2 was associated with the promoters of target genes in vivo. Smad2 acetylated on Lys19 was bound to the promoters of both the PAI-1 and p21 genes in HeLa cells and the occupancy increased in response to TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 3E). The recruitment of acetylated Smad2 to the PAI-1 promoter in response to TGFβ stimulation followed the same time course as the recruitment of total Smad2 (Fig. 3F). The increased association of acetylated Smad2 with the PAI-1 promoter in response to TGFβ stimulation coincided with an increased recruitment of p300 and P/CAF to the promoter (Fig. 3G). Acetylated Smad2 was also recruited to the endogenous PAI-1 and p21 promoters in HaCaT cells in response to TGFβ stimulation (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, our results demonstrate that endogenous Smad2 is acetylated on Lys19 in response to TGFβ signaling and that the acetylated molecules are associated with the promoters of target genes in vivo. Because the AcK19 antibody also recognizes acetylated Smad3, it is possible that Smad3 contributes to the positive signals observed in the ChIP assays in Fig. 3. However, HeLa cells express very low levels of Smad3 compared with Smad2 (Fig. 3C). In addition, the acetylation of Smad3 is low compared with Smad2, suggesting that acetylated Smad2 is the major contributor to the positive ChIP signals in our experiments. Further work is required to analyze the recruitment of acetylated Smad3 to target genes in vivo. Acetylation of Lys19 Enhances the Transcriptional Activity of Smad2(ΔE3)—Smad3 and the short form of Smad2 (Smad2(ΔE3)) function as transcription factors by directly binding to DNA. However, the long form of Smad2 is unable to bind DNA and is, therefore, dependent on interactions with other DNA binding factors to function as a transcription factor. To test if the acetylation of Lys19 affected the transcriptional activity of Smad2, HepG2 cells were transfected with Smad-responsive promoter-reporter genes and Smad2(FL) or Smad2(ΔE3), either wild-type or the corresponding K19R mutants, in the absence or presence of p300. We were unable to detect any difference in transcriptional activity between wild-type Smad2(FL) and the K19R mutant on the ARE-Luc promoter-reporter gene (data not shown), indicating that the acetylation of Lys19 in the full-length form of Smad2 does not affect its transcriptional activity under these conditions. However, the transcriptional activity of Smad2(ΔE3) on the 12xCAGA-Luc promoter-reporter gene was enhanced in response to p300 expression (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the transcriptional activity of the K19R mutant of Smad2(ΔE3) was insensitive to p300 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that p300-mediated acetylation of Lys19 enhances the transcriptional activity of the short isoform of Smad2. Similar results were obtained following coexpression of Smad2(ΔE3) and P/CAF (Fig. 4B). Our data indicate that the acetylation of Lys19 in Smad2(ΔE3) is important for its ability to transactivate promoter-reporter genes. To test if this was also true for endogenous target genes, Smad2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with Smad2(ΔE3), either wild-type or the K19R mutant, in the absence or presence of p300 and the expression of the p21 gene was analyzed by RT-PCR. The expression of the p21 gene was greatly enhanced in the presence of Smad2(ΔE3) and p300, whereas p300 failed to enhance the expression of the p21 gene in the presence of the K19R mutant (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our results suggest that the acetylation of Lys19 in Smad2(ΔE3) enhances its transcriptional activity. Acetylation of Lys19 Enhances"
https://openalex.org/W2040556195,"In Candida albicans UTR2 (CSF4), CRH11, and CRH12 are members of a gene family (the CRH family) that encode glycosylphosphatidylinositol-dependent cell wall proteins with putative transglycosidase activity. Deletion of genes of this family resulted in additive sensitivity to compounds interfering with normal cell wall formation (Congo red, calcofluor white, SDS, and high Ca2+ concentrations), suggesting that these genes contribute to cell wall organization. A triple mutant lacking UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 produced a defective cell wall, as inferred from increased sensitivity to cell wall-degrading enzymes, decreased ability of protoplasts to regenerate a new wall, constitutive activation of Mkc1p, the mitogen-activated protein kinase of the cell wall integrity pathway, and an increased chitin content of the cell wall. Importantly, this was accompanied by a decrease in alkali-insoluble 1,3-β-glucan but not total glucan content, suggesting that formation of the linkage between 1,3-β-glucan and chitin might be affected. In support of this idea, localization of a Utr2p-GFP fusion protein largely coincided with areas of chitin incorporation in C. albicans.As UTR2 and CRH11 expression is regulated by calcineurin, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase involved in tolerance to antifungal drugs, cell wall morphogenesis, and virulence, this points to a possible relationship between calcineurin and the CRH family. Deletion of UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 resulted in only a partial overlap with calcineurin-dependent phenotypes, suggesting that calcineurin has additional targets. Interestingly, cells deleted for UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 were, like a calcineurin mutant, avirulent in a mouse model of systemic infection but retained the capacity to colonize target organs (kidneys) as the wild type.

In conclusion, this work establishes the role of UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 in cell wall organization and integrity. The cell wall in yeast is an essential structure that maintains cell morphology and helps to stabilize internal osmotic conditions (1Klis F.M. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also involved in yeast adherence and filamentation, two major factors contributing to the virulence of Candida albicans (2Sundstrom P. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The cell wall shows a bilayered structure with external and internal parts having specific functions. The outer layer enriched in mannoproteins determines cell surface properties (2Sundstrom P. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 3Chauhan N. Li D. Singh P. Calderone R. Kruppa M. Calderone R.A. Candida and Candidiasis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 159-175Google Scholar). In contrast, the inner layer forms the cell wall skeleton with 1,3-β-glucan chains as major constituents (4De Groot P.W.J. De Boer A.D. Cunningham J. Dekker H.L. De Jong L. Hellingwerf K.J. De Koster C. Klis F.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These 1,3-β-glucan chains are linked by covalent bonds to 1,6-β-glucans and chitin to form a three-dimensional matrix that surrounds cells (5Lipke P.N. Ovalle R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies about cell wall assembly have indicated that glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 3The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CFW, calcofluor white; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; CFU, colony-forming unit; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CR, congo red; GH, glycoside hydrolase; CBM, carbohydrate-binding module. -anchored proteins may play an important role in cell wall synthesis and in modifying or cross-linking polymers (6Mouyna I. Fontaine T. Vai M. Monod M. Fonzi W.A. Diaquin M. Popolo L. Hartland R.P. Latge J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14882-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Some GPI proteins such as the members of the Gas family have a 1,3-β-transglucosidase activity that is responsible for in vitro 1,3-β-glucan chain elongation (6Mouyna I. Fontaine T. Vai M. Monod M.

Monteoliva L. Diez-Orejas R. Nombela C. Gil C. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3341-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, GPI proteins such as Hwp1p and members of the Als protein family are involved in C. albicans adhesion and virulence (8Hoyer L.L. Fundyga R. Hecht J.E. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Arnold J.

Immun. 2002; 70: 3281-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In C. albicans, 104 ORFs coding for putative GPI proteins have been described by a genome-wide approach (12De Groot P.W.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Klis F.M. Yeast. 2003; 20: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Of these, UTR2/CSF4 has been shown to be one of the genes that is most strongly regulated by calcineurin (13Karababa M. Valentino E. Pardini G. Coste A.T. Bille J. Sanglard D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 1429-1451Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar), a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase playing a crucial role in the response of yeast to stress conditions. Calcineurin acts on the transcription factor Crz1p (for calcineurin-regulated zinc finger) (13Karababa M. Valentino E. Pardini G. Coste A.T. Bille J. Sanglard D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 1429-1451Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A recent study reported the existence of a cluster of 60 genes dependent on calcineurin and Crz1p activation. These genes are involved in cell wall organization, cellular organization, cellular transport and homeostasis, cell metabolism, and protein fate (13Karababa M. Valentino E. Pardini G. Coste A.T. Bille J. Sanglard D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 1429-1451Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Loss of calcineurin in C. albicans results in phenotypes comparable with those observed in strains with altered cell wall composition. This is consistent with the involvement of calcineurin in the regulation of genes, like UTR2, that are important for cell wall biogenesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CRH family also consists of three GPI proteins, named CRH1, UTR2/CRH2, and CRR1, that are involved in cell wall construction (14Rodriguez-Pena J.M. Cid V.J. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Deletion of CRH1 and CRH2 results in additive sensitivity to compounds (Congo red and calcofluor white) that interfere with cell wall assembly. Moreover, the double deletion mutant showed a 2-fold increase in the amount of alkali-soluble cell wall glucan in comparison to wild type, indicating that less glucan is bound to chitin (14Rodriguez-Pena J.M. Cid V.J. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Studies with GFP fusion proteins indicated that Crh1p and Crh2p are located at the cell surface, particularly in chitin-rich areas, and that their temporal and spatial localization is specifically controlled during the cell cycle (14Rodriguez-Pena J.M. Cid V.J. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Rodriguez-Pena J.M. Rodriguez C. Alvarez A. Nombela C. Arroyo J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2549-2558PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, both proteins are shown to be covalently bound to the cell wall network (16Yin Q.Y. De Groot P.W.J. Dekker H.L. De Jong L. Klis F.M. De Koster C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20894-20901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recently, two Crh homologues of Yarrowia lipolytica were found to be important for cell wall construction and were shown to have endo-1,3-β-glucosidase activity in vitro (17Hwang J.S. Seo D.H. Kim J.Y. Yeast. 2006; 23: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the CRH family in C. albicans. In an earlier study, Utr2p/Csf4p was selected as a potential cell surface factor using a bio-informatics approach (18Alberti-Segui C. Morales A.J. Xing H. Kessler M.M. Willins D.A. Weinstock K.G. Cottarel G. Fechtel K. Rogers B. Yeast. 2004; 21: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Deletion of UTR2 in C. albicans resulted in altered colony morphogenesis, attenuated cell adhesion, and reduced virulence. However, neither the role in cell wall assembly nor the functionality of other members of the CRH gene family in C. albicans was investigated (18Alberti-Segui C. Morales A.J. Xing H. Kessler M.M. Willins D.A. Weinstock K.G. Cottarel G. Fechtel K. Rogers B. Yeast. 2004; 21: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, we have addressed the role of the putative transglycosidases encoded by UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 in cell wall biology and pathogenesis of C. albicans. First, we show that strains lacking UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 exhibit phenotypes typical for cell wall defects. Second, alterations in cell wall polysaccharide composition in mutants lacking UTR2 suggest that Utr2p is involved in formation of the linkage between 1,3-β-glucan and chitin. Third, we show that the CRH family is critical for virulence in an animal model of systemic infection. Furthermore, comparative phenotypic analysis of the CRH family mutants with a calcineurin mutant indicates a partial overlap and thus suggests the existence of other important calcineurin-regulated targets.

Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 109-135Google Scholar). DH5α was grown in LB (Luria-Bertani broth; Difco) or LB plates, supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) when required. Transformation Procedures—C. albicans strains were transformed by a one-step transformation method of yeast in stationary phase as reported previously (20Coste A.T. Karababa M. Ischer F. Bille J. Sanglard D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Disruption of UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 in C. albicans—Two different regions of UTR2 (orf19.1671 available on line) were amplified from C. albicans genomic DNA with the following pairs of primers (supplemental Table I): UTR2-1-XbaI/UTR2-1-XhoI and UTR2-2-XbaI/UTR2-2-XhoI in a PCR, and cloned into compatible restriction sites of pBluescriptKS+ to yield pGP01 and pGP03 (supplemental Table II), respectively. Deletions in the cloned UTR2 regions were created by PCR using outward directed primer pairs UTR2-1-PstI/UTR2-1-BglII and UTR2-2-PstI/UTR2-2-BglII (supplemental Table I) with pGP01 and pGP03 as templates. The products of these PCRs were digested with PstI and BglII and ligated to a PstI-BglII 3.7-kb fragment from pMB7 containing the hisG-URA3-hisG“Ura-blaster” cassette to yield pGP02 and pGP04 (supplemental Table II), respectively. The construction of two different UTR2 cassettes was aimed to enhance the recovery of targeted sequential genome deletions, because one cassette (pGP04) is internal to the first one (pGP02). Finally, disruption cassettes were linearized by digestion with ApaI and SacI and used for sequential disruption of both UTR2 alleles with intermediate marker regeneration as described by Fonzi and Irwin (21Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The UTR2 revertant strain was obtained by reintroduction of UTR2 into the utr2Δ C. albicans mutant. A PCR was performed with the primers UTR2-5′-BamHI/UTR2-1-XhoI to yield a fragment containing the entire UTR2 ORF, including 3′- and 5′-flanking regions. The resulting fragment was cloned into pDS178 (22de Micheli M. Bille J. Schueller C. Sanglard D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1197-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to obtain pGP05. This plasmid was linearized with SalI, which cuts within LEU2 to favor integration at the LEU2 genomic locus, and was transformed into C. albicans. CRH11 (orf19.2706) and CRH12 (orf19.3966) disruption cassettes were obtained using the same strategy as outlined above. PCRs were performed with the pairs of primers listed in supplemental Table I. Plasmids used for CRH11 and CRH12 disruptions are listed in supplemental Table II. Southern and Northern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted from C. albicans and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (supplemental Fig. 1). Northern blotting was performed as reported by Sanglard et al. (23Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Ischer F. Pagani J.L. Monod M. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2378-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The TEF3 probe was used as internal standard and originated from a 0.7-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment from pDC1 described in Sanglard et al. (23Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Ischer F. Pagani J.L. Monod M. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2378-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Phenotypic Analyses—C. albicans strains to be tested for their susceptibility to cell wall-perturbing agents and drugs were grown overnight in liquid YEPD medium. Cells were diluted to 1.5 × 107 cells per ml with serial 10-fold dilutions. Of each dilution 5 μl was spotted onto YEPD plates or plates containing 100 μg/ml congo red (CR; Sigma), 40 μg/ml calcofluor white (CFW; Sigma), 0.06% SDS (Fluka), or 500 mm CaCl2 (Fluka). Plates were incubated for 48 h at 34 °C. Protoplast Formation, Cell Wall Regeneration, and Cell Wall Degradation Assays—Cells grown overnight in YEPD were washed twice in TE, pH 8.0. Aliquots containing 1.5 × 107 cells were resuspended in PRO buffer (25 mm EDTA, 1 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 50 μg/ml 100T Zymolyase (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C until cell wall lysis occurred. Protoplast formation was checked by microscopic observation. To regenerate cell walls, protoplasts were suspended in a soft-top agar (YEPD broth containing 0.7% agar and 1.2 m sorbitol, auto-claved and cooled to 45 °C). This suspension was poured evenly across the top of YEPD agar plates and allowed to solidify. To determine the number of intact cells present in the samples, the same amount of protoplasts was plated onto YEPD agar without top agar. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Numbers of cells grown in YEPD with or without top agar (nt and nnt, respectively), and the starting inoculum (ni) were determined as colony-forming units (CFU) by counting colonies of serial dilutions on YEPD agar. Cell wall regeneration was expressed as a percentage (Pcw) and determined by the following equation: Pcw = (nn - nnt)/(ni - nnt). Cell wall degradation was expressed as the percentage of intact cells after lysis caused by Zymolyase activity and was monitored by taking aliquots at 10-min intervals and measuring the optical density at 540 nm. Cell Wall Isolation and Analysis of Cell Wall Composition—C. albicans strains were grown overnight in liquid YPD at 30 °C to an A600 of about 2. The detailed procedure for cell wall isolation is described by De Groot et al. (4De Groot P.W.J. De Boer A.D. Cunningham J. Dekker H.L. De Jong L. Hellingwerf K.J. De Koster C. Klis F.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To determine alkali-resistant 1,6-β- and 1,3-β-glucans, cell walls (about 4 mg dry weight) were extracted by incubation (three times) in 1 ml of 3% (w/v) NaOH at 75 °C for 1 h (24Magnelli P. Cipollo J.F. Abeijon C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Extracted walls were washed three times with 1 ml of H2O and freeze-dried. To release alkali-resistant 1,6-β-glucan, alkali-extracted walls were incubated with recombinant endo-1,6-β-glucanase (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA) as described (25Kapteyn J.C. Hoyer L.L. Hecht J.E. Muller W.H. Andel A. Verkleij A.J. Makarow M. Van Den Ende H. Klis F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The supernatant after centrifugation represents the alkali-resistant 1,6-β-glucan fraction. The remaining cell wall pellet was washed two times with 1 ml of H2O and freeze-dried. Alkali-resistant 1,3-β-glucan was solubilized by incubating with the recombinant endo-1,3-β-glucanase Quantazyme (Qbiogene Morgan Irvine, CA) as described (25Kapteyn J.C. Hoyer L.L. Hecht J.E. Muller W.H. Andel A. Verkleij A.J. Makarow M. Van Den Ende H. Klis F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Supernatants containing either 1,6-β-glucan or 1,3-β-glucan were analyzed with the phenol-sulfuric acid assay using glucose as a reference (26Dubois M. Gilles K. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Nature. 1951; 168: 167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). For total cell wall glucan and mannan determination, cell wall carbohydrates were hydrolyzed to monomers using the sulfuric acid hydrolysis method (27Dallies N. Francois J. Paquet V. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). About 4 mg of freeze-dried walls were incubated in 100 μl of 72% (v/v) H2SO4 for 3 h at room temperature. The samples were then diluted with 575 μl of distilled H2O to obtain a 2 m H2SO4 solution and incubated for 4 h at 100 °C. Amounts of mannose and glucose in the samples were determined by HPLC (GE Healthcare) on a REZEX organic acid analysis column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at 40 °C with 7.2 mm H2SO4 as eluent, using an RI1530 refractive index detector (Jasco, Great Dunmow, UK). The chromatograms were analyzed using AZUR chromatography software and compared with chromatograms of known amounts of mannose, glucose, and glucosamine. Chitin was determined following the protocol described by Kapteyn et al. (28Kapteyn J.C. Van Den Ende H. Klis F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Protein Structure Analysis—Functional domains of Utr2p, Crh11p, and Crh12p, glycoside hydrolase (GH) domains and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), were identified using the SMART tool analysis software and the CAZy Carbohydrate-Active enZymes data base. Most likely, GPI addition of amino acid (ω)-sites (Ser440, Asn430, and Gly478) were predicted using big-PI Fungal Predictor software. The three-dimensional structure of the putative transglycosidase domain of Utr2p was obtained by homology modeling. The GH16 domain boundaries of Utr2p were predicted by alignment of multiprotein families using the Pfam protein families data base. The secondary structure of the Utr2p GH16 domain was predicted and aligned on template structures of a fold library using threading to identify a Protein Data Bank template for homology modeling. At the level of secondary structure, Utr2p favorably aligns with Bacillus lichenoformis 1,3-1,4-β-d-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (Protein Data Bank code 1GBG). This template also belongs to the CAZy GH16 family and cleaves 1,4-β-glycosidic bonds that are adjacent to 1,3-β-glycosidic bonds in mixed-linked glucans. Multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering was used to align the Utr2p GH16 target and 1GBG template sequence for homology modeling. Optimization of this alignment was carried out manually. Detection of Mkc1p by Immunoblotting—C. albicans cell extracts for immunoblotting were prepared from cells grown to mid-log phase as described by Navarro-Garcia et al. (29Navarro-Garcia F. Eisman B. Fiuza S.M. Nombela C. Pla J. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 2737-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeasts incubated for 2 h in the presence or absence of CR (20 μg/ml) were resuspended in lysis buffer and broken using glass beads in a Mini-Bead Beater-8 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) applying three 30-s rounds with intermediate ice cooling (1 min). Equal amount of proteins (150 μg), verified by the Bradford assay (30Bradford D.S. Cooper K.M. Oegema Jr., T.R. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1983; 65: 1220-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Ponceau S staining, were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Dually phosphorylated Mkc1p was detected using 1,000-fold diluted anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) anti-serum (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Western blots were developed using an ECL kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of GFP Fusion Proteins—To create a fusion protein of Utr2p with the GFP, a fragment of the UTR2 ORF (from +1to +1263), lacking the ω-site and C-terminal GPI signal sequence, was amplified with the primer pair UTR2-5′-GFP-BamHI/GFP-3′-UTR2. GFP was amplified from yEGFP (31Cormack B.P. Bertram G. Egerton M. Gow N.A. Falkow S. Brown A.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) with primers UTR2-5′-GFP and GFP-3′-ClaI. These two fragments share a 30-bp overlap and were used as templates in a second PCR amplification step with external primers UTR2-5′-BamHI and GFP-ClaI. The resulting UTR2-GFP fragment was cloned into pBluescriptSK+ digested with BamHI and ClaI to yield pGP50. To obtain a functional Utr2p-GFP protein, a UTR2 fragment from +1263 to +2861 containing the ω-site and C-terminal sequence was amplified using primers UTR2-5′-ClaI/UTR2-1-XhoI and cloned into a compatible site of pGP50 to yield pGP51. The final UTR2-GFP fusion construct was amplified from pGP51 with the primer pair UTR2-5′-GFP-SalI/UTR2-3′-GFP-NheI and cloned into CIpACT-C-ZZ under the control of the ACT1 promoter to yield pGP52. This plasmid was digested with StuI and transformed into the utr2Δ strain (GPY04) to yield GPY101. The UTR2-GFP construct could yield a functional protein as it complemented the phenotypes (hypersusceptibility to cell wall damaging agents) of the utr2Δ strain (data not shown). Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence and contrast interference microscopy were performed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Zeiss) equipped for epifluorescence microscopy with a 100-watt mercury high pressure bulb and Zeiss filter set 15. A Kappa DX30 digital camera with high resolution was used to record images, which were processed further using the computer program Adobe Photoshop 6.0. For chitin staining, cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml CFW, and cells were examined directly for fluorescence after washing off excess CFW. Mouse Infection Assays—Animal experiments were performed as described previously (13Karababa M. Valentino E. Pardini G. Coste A.T. Bille J. Sanglard D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 1429-1451Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, C. albicans isolates grown overnight at 30 °C in YEPD were diluted to 106 cells/ml into 50 ml of YEPD and incubated for another 24 h at 30 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and cell concentrations were adjusted to 2 × 106 CFU/ml in PBS. To confirm the accuracy of the infection dose, samples of inoculum suspensions were plated onto YEPD agar. Mice were infected intravenously with each strain at a dose of 5 × 105 CFU in 250 μl of PBS via the lateral tail vein. For reintroduction of UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 into the utr2Δ/crh11Δ/crh12Δ mutant strain GPY103, pMK83 containing the CaSAT1 marker was used (32Reuss O. Vik A. Kolter R. Morschhauser J. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 341: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). UTR2, CRH11, and CRH12 were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs listed in supplemental Table I and cloned into compatible restriction sites of pMK83 to yield pGP55 (containing UTR2), pGP56 (containing CRH11), and pGP57 (containing CRH12). These plasmids were linearized by HpaI (pGP55 and pGP56) and MluI (pGP57) in order to facilitate integration in"

https://openalex.org/W2080395830,"The differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes is orchestrated by the expression of the “master adipogenic regulators,” CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and C/EBP α. In addition, activation of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is necessary and sufficient to promote adipogenic conversion and prevent apoptosis of mature adipocytes. In this report we used small interfering RNAto deplete CREB and the closely related factor ATF1 to explore the ability of the master adipogenic regulators to promote adipogenesis in the absence of CREB and probe the function of CREB in late stages of adipogenesis. Loss of CREB/ATF1 blocked adipogenic conversion of 3T3-L1 cells in culture or 3T3-F442A cells implanted into athymic mice. Loss of CREB/ATF1 prevented the expression of PPARγ, C/EBP α, and adiponectin and inhibited the loss of Pref-1. Loss of CREB/ATF1 inhibited adipogenic conversion even in cells ectopically expressing C/EBP α, C/EBP β, or PPARγ2 individually. CREB/ATF1 depletion did not attenuate lipid accumulation in cells expressing both PPARγ2 and C/EBP α, but adiponectin expression was severely diminished. Conversely ectopic expression of constitutively active CREB overcame the blockade of adipogenesis due to depletion of C/EBP β but not due to loss of PPARγ2 or C/EBP α. Depletion of CREB/ATF1 did not suppress the expression of C/EBP β as we had previously observed using dominant negative forms of CREB. Finally results are presented showing that CREB promotes PPARγ2 gene transcription. The results indicate that CREB and ATF1 play a central role in adipogenesis because expression of individual master adipogenic regulators is unable to compensate for their loss. The data also indicate that CREB not only functions during the initiation of adipogenic conversion but also at later stages.

Normal adipose tissue development and increases in adipose tissue mass associated with weight gain and obesity require the formation of mature adipocytes from preadipocytes or stromal progenitor cells (1Ailhaud G.

The agents that govern adipogenic conversion in vivo are less well understood, but there is convincing evidence that free fatty acids, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, and glucocorticoids play important roles in the development of adipose tissue and the formation of new adipocytes. Exposure to differentiation-inducing agents initiates a well characterized cascade of gene expression events that lead to the mature adipocyte phenotype. The differentiation cascade begins with the expression of C/EBP β within hours of treatment with inducing agents (11Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 85-855Google Scholar). This factor then promotes the expression of PPARγ and C/EBP α (12Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13Wu Z. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these factors are necessary to promote the terminal or mature adipocyte phenotype including insulin-sensitive glucose uptake (14El Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, all of these “master adipogenic regulators” are expressed after the initiation of the differentiation program. This suggests that pre-existing regulatory factor(s) are required to initiate adipogenic conversion. In previous studies we demonstrated that the transcription factor CREB was expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes before treatment with differentiation-inducing agents, in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and throughout the adipogenic cascade (15Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 917-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activity were activated by both cAMP mimetics via protein kinase A and by insulin through the ERK signaling pathway. Subsequently we demonstrated that ectopic expression of constitutively active forms of CREB was sufficient to drive adipogenic conversion of 3T3-L1 cells, whereas dominant negative forms of CREB inhibited this process (16Reusch J.E.-B. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The central role of CREB in adipogenesis is exemplified by the ability of constitutively active forms of CREB to overcome inhibition of adipogenic conversion due to blockade of Ras/ERK signaling (17Klemm D.J. Leitner J.W. Watson P. Nesterova A. Reusch J.E.B. Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28430-28435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, diminished CREB activity in mature adipocytes induces apoptosis, in part, through decreased Akt expression (18Reusch J.E.B. Klemm D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1426-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). More recently, in collaboration with Lane and co-workers (19Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we have reported evidence that CREB promotes expression of C/EBP β, which in turn may drive the remaining steps in adipogenesis. These studies highlight the importance of CREB in the development and survival of adipocytes. However, the relative importance of CREB versus the master adipogenic regulators C/EBP β, C/EBP α, and PPARγ and the role of CREB in later stages of adipogenesis are unknown. In this report we used siRNA to knock down CREB and the closely related factor ATF1 to explore the ability of the master adipogenic regulators to promote adipogenesis in the absence of CREB and probe the function of CREB in late stages of adipocyte differentiation. We found that loss of CREB/ATF1 effectively blocked adipogenic conversion of 3T3-L1 cells in culture or 3T3-F442A cells implanted into athymic mice. Depletion of other CRE-binding proteins, ATF2, c-Jun, or CREM, had no affect on adipogenesis. Depletion of CREB/ATF1 prevented the expression of PPARγ, C/EBP α, and adiponectin in cells treated with differentiation-inducing agents and inhibited the loss of Pref-1. Conversely ectopic expression of constitutively active CREB overcame the blockade of adipogenesis due to depletion of C/EBP β but not due to loss of PPARγ2 or C/EBP α. Unexpectedly depletion of CREB/ATF1 did not suppress the expression of C/EBP β as we had previously observed using dominant negative forms of CREB. Individual depletion of CREM, c-Jun, or ATF2 also did not diminish hormone-induced C/EBP β expression, but combined knockdown of these factors together with CREB/ATF1 resulted in loss of C/EBP β expression. Interestingly loss of CREB/ATF1 inhibited adipogenic conversion even in cells ectopically expressing C/EBP α, C/EBP β, or PPARγ2. Finally results are presented showing that CREB, at least in part, promotes PPARγ2 gene transcription. The results indicate that CREB and ATF1 play a central role in adipogenesis because expression of individual master adipogenic regulators is unable to compensate for their loss. The data also indicate that CREB not only functions during the initiation of adipogenic conversion but at later stages as well.

After 2 days, the 3T3-L1 cells were transferred to high glucose DMEM plus 10% FCS, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 1 μg/ml insulin and refed every 2 days. Differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes was confirmed by Oil Red O staining of lipid vesicles. Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 10% glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete mini protease inhibitor tablets, Roche Applied Science). After correcting for protein concentrations, cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli SDS loading buffer, and equal amounts of lysate protein were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The blots were blocked with phosphatebuffered saline containing 5% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then treated with antibodies that recognize the target proteins indicated in each figure overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and subsequently treated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After the blots were washed, specific immune complexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrates. siRNA and Plasmid Transfection and Luciferase Assays—For siRNA transfection, 3T3-L1 cells were plated at 30-50% confluency on 6-well plates in complete medium. Twenty-four hours later the cells were transferred to Opti-MEM for transfection. Double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides or the control luciferase-specific siRNA was complexed with Oligofectamine reagent and applied to the cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations at a final concentration of 200 nm. Where more than one siRNA oligonucleotide is specified in Table 1, equimolar amounts of the individual oligonucleotides were combined before use. After 3 h, an equal volume of DMEM containing 30% FCS was added to the wells. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before subsequent manipulations. For plasmid transfections, plates of 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were grown to 70-80% confluency and transfected with the indicated plasmids with Lipofectamine PLUS reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells transiently transfected with the C/EBP β gene promoterluciferase or PPARγ2 gene promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were used within 48 h of transfection. Cells stably transfected with C/EBP β and LacZ expression vectors were selected in blasticidin (10 μg/ml), whereas cells transfected with the PPARγ2 expression plasmid were selected in hygromycin (100 μg/ml). Cells stably expressing C/EBP α were selected in G418 (1 mg/ml). Large, rapidly growing, well separated colonies were isolated 10-12 days after selection was begun with the antibiotics. Isolated clones were passaged in low glucose DMEM containing 10% FCS and 1 mm l-glutamine with half the concentration of selection antibiotic used during selection. Luciferase assays were conducted on lysates from cells transfected with plasmids containing the C/EBP β gene promoter or the PPARγ2 gene promoter (-611 to +32) linked to the firefly luciferase gene. Cells were co-transfected with the plasmid pRL-TK as an internal control. Cell lysates and luciferase reactions were performed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system on a Turner Designs 20/20n luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Microscopy—Microscopy was performed on a Nikon TE2000-U inverted epifluorescence microscope. Phase-contrast, bright field images were captured to a personal computer with a Spot Insight color camera (Diagnostic Imaging, Sterling Heights, MI). Images were analyzed and processed with Meta-Morph 6.1 Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Apoptosis Assays—TUNEL staining was performed using ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kits according to the manufacturer's directions. Stable Expression of Control and CREB siRNAs—Stable expression of siRNAs specific for luciferase or CREB was achieved by ligating the double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides specified in Table 1 into pSilencer 4.1 vectors. The luciferase oligonucleotide was inserted into pSilencer 4.1-CMVneo. A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to CREB siRNA oligo B was inserted into pSilencer 4.1-CMVneo, and another corresponding to CREB siRNA oligo C was inserted into pSilencer 4.1-CMVpuro. The plasmids were transfected into 3T3-F442A cells as described above. Cells for stable depletion of CREB were transfected sequentially with both CREB siRNA expression plasmids and selected in both G418 (1 mg/ml) and puromycin (2 μg/ml). Cells transfected with the luciferase siRNA expression plasmid were selected in G418 alone. Large, rapidly growing colonies were isolated and pooled for implantation into athymic mice as described below. In Vivo Adipogenesis in Matrigel—3T3-F442A preadipocytes were stably transfected with plasmids for the constitutive expression of siRNA for luciferase (control) or CREB as described above. Cells were selected in appropriate antibiotic until large, rapidly growing colonies were present. Colonies were mixed and grown to 50-70% confluence on 10-cm plates. The cells were then infected with an adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) at a multiplicity of infection of 100. The next day, cells were trypsinized and recovered by centrifugation. The pellets (∼2 × 106 cells) were gently resuspended in 200 μl of low growth factor Matrigel at 4 °C. Female athymic mice were lightly anesthetized with Halothane, and the Matrigel/cell suspensions were injected subcutaneously into the abdomen anterior of the thigh. Fresh food, water, and clean cages with fresh bedding were provided every other day for a period of 2 or 4 weeks. Light was maintained on a 12-h cycle, and humidity was 40-45% with a temperature of 25-27 °C. The animals were monitored daily, and weight was checked once a week. The mice were then anesthetized with Halothane and euthanized by exsanguinations. The solid Matrigel plugs and adjacent skin and subcutaneous muscle were removed. The plugs were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then sliced in half with a razor blade. The halves were oriented in paraffin blocks with the cut surfaces up for sectioning. Five-micrometer sections were deparaffinized in HemoD and rehydrated in graded ethanol series. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Alternately deparaffinized sections were mounted with Permount for visualization of GFP. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation for CREB Promoter Binding—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for CREB binding to the PPARγ2 gene promoter were performed on 3T3-L1 cells treated with MDI for 48 h using kits from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA) according to their directions. The procedure was modified as described previously (19Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays were used to assess binding of CREB, ATF2, c-Jun, and CREM to the distal C/EBP β gene promoter CRE site. A double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the promoter from -117 to -96 with respect to the transcription start was used in the reactions, which were performed as described previously (19Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Depletion of CREB/ATF1 Blocks 3T3-L1 Cell Adipogenesis in Culture—We previously reported that ectopic expression of constitutively active forms of CREB alone is sufficient to drive adipogenesis. Alternately ectopic expression of dominant negative forms of CREB blocked adipogenic conversion of 3T3-L1 cells treated with differentiation-inducing agents. To further explore the impact of CREB on adipocyte differentiation, we used specific siRNA as a means of depleting CREB in 3T3-L1 cells. We found that CREB-specific siRNA reduced CREB levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to almost undetectable levels within 72 h of transfection (Fig. 1A). Although CREB levels began to increase 6 days after siRNA transfection, they never achieved levels measured in untreated cells or cells treated with control siRNA. CREB-specific siRNA also reduced levels of the related transcription factor ATF1 to undetectable levels over the same time course. CREB-specific siRNA did not affect the expression of other CRE-binding factors including ATF2, CREM (Fig. 1A), or c-Jun (data not shown). Cells transfected with control or CREB-specific siRNA were then treated with the differentiation-inducing mixture, MDI, to evaluate the loss of CREB and ATF1 on adipogenesis. PPARγ2 and C/EBP α expression were detected in control siRNAtreated cells beginning on day 3 after MDI exposure (Fig. 1A). PPARγ2 levels continued to increase over the 9-day differentiation period, whereas levels of C/EBP α peaked at day 6 and then declined slightly at day 9. The expression of these factors was delayed and the levels were much lower in CREB siRNA-treated cells. Levels of Pref-1, an inhibitor of adipogenesis, declined rapidly in cells transfected with control siRNA and treated with MDI. Pref-1 levels were elevated in CREB siRNA-treated cells before MDI exposure and remained elevated for at least 72 h after addition of these agents. Thereafter Pref-1 levels declined but were still detectable 6 days after MDI exposure. Unexpectedly loss of CREB/ATF1 had little impact on C/EBP β liver enriched activator protein or liver enriched inhibitory protein expression. The ability of CREB siRNA to inhibit adipogenic conversion was also apparent in Oil Red O-stained cell preparations. Although control siRNA-treated cells accumulated substantial levels of triglyceride, only minute lipid droplets were present in a small percentage of cells transfected with CREB siRNA (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that CREB and/or ATF1 is required for MDI-induced adipogenesis in culture. The expression of other CRE-binding proteins like ATF2 and c-Jun or their activation by extracellular signals is increased during the early stages of adipogenesis (21Lee M.Y. Kong H.J. Cheong J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Likewise CREM, another CREB family member, is expressed in preadipocytes (19Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To determine whether these factors were required for adipogenic conversion, they were individually depleted via siRNA. Depletion of ATF2, c-Jun, and CREM was verified by Western blot assay (Fig. 2A). We found that loss of these factors had no significant effect on the conversion of preadipocytes to mature, lipid-filled adipocytes (Fig. 2B). Depletion of CREB/ATF1 Blocks 3T3-F442A Cell Adipogenesis in Vivo—Although the role of CREB in adipocyte differentiation and survival has been examined in cultured cells, its role in in vivo adipogenesis has not been explored. To begin to address this issue, we generated stably transfected 3T3-F442A preadipocytes constitutively expressing either control or CREB-specific siRNAs. These cells were implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice in low growth factor Matrigel plugs for a period of 2 or 4 weeks. During this time the plugs become vascularized such that proadipogenic factors produced by the recipient mice promote adipogenic conversion of the implanted cells. Twenty-four hours before their implantation, the cells were infected with an adenovirus from which GFP was constitutively expressed to follow their fate. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells expressing control siRNA formed substantial numbers of unilocular and multilocular adipocytes within the Matrigel plug 2 weeks after implantation. The number of adipocytes and the size of the lipid droplets increased slightly at the 4-week time point. That these adipocytes arose from the implanted cells is evident by their GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3B). However, cells expressing CREB siRNA failed to form adipocytes at either time point (Fig. 3A). No significant differences in cell survival were detected by TUNEL staining of the plug sections (data not shown). These results indicate that the role of CREB in adipogenesis extends to the in vivo formation of adipocytes. Depletion of CREB/ATF1 Blocks Adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 Cells Expressing C/EBP α, C/EBP β, or PPARγ—Ectopic overexpression of C/EBP α or β or PPARγ alone is sufficient to promote adipogenic conversion and increase or accelerate adipogenesis in cells treated with MDI (8Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The goal of subsequent experiments was to determine whether loss of CREB/ATF1 could block the proadipogenic activities of these master regulators. We generated stably transfected 3T3-L1 cells constitutively expressing C/EBP β, C/EBP α, or PPARγ2. These cells were then transfected with control or CREB-specific siRNA and then left untreated or treated with MDI. Adipogenic conversion of these cells was measured by the appearance of Oil Red-staining lipid droplets and by the appearance of adipocyte markers. As shown previously, CREB siRNA blocked MDI-induced lipid accumulation and prevented the modest lipid accumulation detected in control siRNA-transfected cells in the absence of MDI (Fig. 4A). In cells expressing C/EBP α or β or PPARγ and transfected with control siRNA, a small percentage of cells exhibited substantial lipid accumulation even in the absence of MDI. With MDI, these cells showed normal or slightly higher than normal levels of lipid content. Cells expressing both PPARγ2 and C/EBP α and treated with control siRNA exhibited substantial lipid accumulation regardless of MDI exposure. However, lipid droplets were greatly diminished in CREB/ATF1-depleted cells expressing C/EBP β or PPARγ2 with or without MDI. Loss of CREB/ATF1 also reduced uninduced or MDI-induced lip"

https://openalex.org/W2093650749,"The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for the invasion and metastasis of many epithelial tumors including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In the present study, a scattering and fibroblastic morphology with reduced intercellular contacts was found in the SW480 colon cancer cells overexpressing the gene encoding thymosin β4 (Tβ4), which was accompanied by a loss of E-cadherin as well as a cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin, two most prominent markers of EMT. Whereas E-cadherin downregulation was likely to be accounted by a ZEB1-mediated transcriptional repression, the accumulation of β-catenin was a result of glycogen synthase kinase-3β inactivation mediated by integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and/or its downstream effector, Akt. Intriguingly, ILK upregulation in Tβ4-overexpressing SW480 cells seemed to be attributed mainly to a stabilization of this kinase by complexing with particularly interesting new Cys-His protein (PINCH) more efficiently. In the meantime, a strong correlation between the expression levels of Tβ4, ILK and E-cadherin in CRC patients was also revealed by immunohistochemical analysis. Taken together, these data suggest a novel role of Tβ4 in promoting CRC progression by inducing an EMT in tumor cells via upregulating ILK and consequentially its signal transduction."

The (dihydro)furan-substituted 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one forms the characteristic core structure, and the annulation type distinguishes the linear furanocoumarins or psoralens from the angular furanocoumarins (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that plants accumulate either psoralens only, e. g. Ammi majus (11Elgamal M.H.A. Shalaby N.M.M. Duddeck H. Hiegemann M.

Plantes Médicinales et Phytothérapie. 1986; 4: 313-322Google Scholar), or both types of compounds, whereas the exclusive production of angular furanocoumarins has never been reported (1Murray R.D.H. Méndez J. Brown S.A. The Natural Coumarins: Occurrence, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Wiley, New York1982Google Scholar). Furanocoumarins often accumulate in the surface wax of tissues and can easily be collected in washes with organic solvents (17Zobel A.M. Brown S.A. J. Chem. Ecol. 1990; 16: 1623-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Zobel A.M. Brown S.A. J. Chem. Ecol. 1991; 17: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Such surface coating was considered to protect the plants from fungal invasion or herbivore attack (19Städler E. Roessingh P. Symp. Biol. Hung. 1990; 39: 71-85Google Scholar), because potent antimycotic activity has been documented for furanocoumarins in vitro (20Afek U. Carmeli S. Aharoni N. Phytochemistry. 1995; 39: 1347-1350Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the few insects utilizing furanocoumarin-producing plants as an ecological niche, i.e. the black swallowtail butterfly, depend on a particular detoxifying machinery (21Li X. Baudry J. Berenbaum M.R. Schuler M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2939-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The toxicity to insects is conceivably a consequence of both DNA modification and monooxygenase inhibition. Furanocoumarins intercalate in double-stranded DNA, and psoralens are known to cross-link pyrimidine bases under irradiation by [2 + 2]cycloaddition via their 3,4- and 2′,3′-double bonds, whereas angular furanocoumarins form only monoadducts for steric reasons (22Kanne D. Straub K. Rapoport H. Hearst J.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although the angular compounds are not as potent antifeedants as the psoralens (23Gruenert D.C. Ashwood-Smith M. Mitchell R.H. Cleaver J.E. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5394-5398PubMed Google Scholar), the combination of angular and linear furanocoumarins shows synergistic effects (24Berenbaum M.R. Nitao J.K. Zangerl A.R. J. Chem. Ecol. 1991; 17: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Berenbaum M.R. Zangerl A.R. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1996; 30: 1-24Google Scholar) presumably because the angular compounds inhibit monooxygenases required for the detoxification of psoralens (26Ma R. Cohen M.B. Berenbaum M.R. Schuler M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Wen Z. Pan L. Berenbaum M.R. Schuler M.A. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This fact and the relatively limited distribution of angular furanocoumarins suggested that the supplementary production of angular furanocoumarins has evolved as a sophisticated means of plants to counter the detoxification mechanisms of herbivores (28Berenbaum M.R. Feeny P. Science. 1981; 212: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Berenbaum M.R. Zangerl A.R. Oecologia. 1993; 95: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Berenbaum M.R. Zangerl A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13743-13748Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that this capability has developed as a modification of the pathway to linear furanocoumarins at a late stage in the evolution. The flow of carbon in furanocoumarin biosynthesis is known since decades from precursor feeding studies (1Murray R.D.H. Méndez J. Brown S.A. The Natural Coumarins: Occurrence, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Wiley, New York1982Google Scholar) and proceeds from 4-coumaric acid via umbelliferone, which is prenylated in either the 6- or 8-position to give demethylsuberosin and osthenol, respectively (Fig. 1). Whereas the subcellular compartment and the precise mode of cyclization of 4-coumaric acid to umbelliferone have remained elusive (31Matern U. Lüer P. Kreusch D. Sankawa U. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 1. Elsevier, Amsterdam1999: 623-637Crossref Google Scholar), the 6-prenyltransferase was assigned to plastids in Ruta graveolens (32Dhillon D.S. Brown S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 177: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is compatible with the mevalonate-independent prenylation of umbelliferone observed in Apium graveolens (33Stanjek V. Piel J. Boland W. Phytochemistry. 1999; 50: 1141-1145Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An equivalent location is likely for the 8-prenyltransferase activity, although this has not been as firmly documented. All subsequent steps converting demethylsuberosin to psoralen or osthenol to angelicin are supposedly catalyzed by highly analogous enzymes (34Stanjek V. Boland W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1998; 81: 1596-1607Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but only the linear series has been studied in detail. Enzyme studies conducted mostly with elicited A. majus or P. crispum cells (35Hamerski D. Matern U. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Hamerski D. Matern U.

Biochem. 1986; 161: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) identified marmesin and psoralen synthases as well as psoralen 5-monooxygenase as separate cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome P450; SRS, substrate recognition site; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; nt, nucleotide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UTR, untranslated region; PBD, Protein Data Bank. 3The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome P450; SRS, substrate recognition site; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; nt, nucleotide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UTR, untranslated region; PBD, Protein Data Bank. entities for the consecutive conversion of demethylsuberosin to bergaptol, which then is methylated to bergapten (39Hehmann M. Lukacin R. Ekiert H. Matern U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These studies became possible, because furanocoumarins are completely lacking from the cell suspensions propagated in the dark but accumulate rapidly in the cells and culture fluid upon treatment with fungal elicitor. Nevertheless, the specific CYP activities of crude microsomes were rather low, on average, and varied greatly with the plant type and growth stage of cells. Significant conversion rates were accomplished with microsomes from A. majus cells propagated in suspension no longer than 5 months and treated for 5-10 h with elicitor. Moreover, the CYP activities of isolated microsomes turned out rather labile even on storage at -70 °C, which ruled out any purification. Overall, the time course of furanocoumarin accumulation and the induction of CYP activities suggested a window of about 2-6 h of elicitation for maximal abundance of the committed transcripts. Marmesin synthase, psoralen synthase, and psoralen 5-monooxygenase catalyze very different reactions with psoralen synthase (Fig. 1) catching most the attention. Although oxidative carbon-chain cleavage reactions are common in nature, such as in homoterpene (40Boland W. Gäbler A. Gilbert M. Feng Z. Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 14725-14736Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or steroid biosynthesis (41Lieberman S. Lin Y.Y. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the true mechanism has remained under debate (41Lieberman S. Lin Y.Y. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The psoralen synthase activity of A. majus microsomes was examined with position and stereospecifically deuterated marmesin substrates (42Stanjek V. Miksch M. Lüer P. Matern U. Boland W. Angew. Chemie-Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 400-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and revealed the unique release of acetone as byproduct. The reaction probably initiates at C-3′ (Fig. 1), and it is noteworthy that psoralen synthase, in contrast to chemical model reactions (43Stanjek V. Studien zur Biosynthese der Furanocumarine. Universität Bonn, 1998Google Scholar), abstracts the hydrogen syn-configurated to the shielding isopropyloxy group (Fig. 1). This is a consequence of the radical mode of the reaction requiring that all partners be confined to a cage (43Stanjek V. Studien zur Biosynthese der Furanocumarine. Universität Bonn, 1998Google Scholar). The same kind of mechanism appears to operate in the pathway to angular furanocoumarin in Heracleum mantegazzianum, where the conversion of (+)-columbianetin to angelicin (Fig. 1) proceeds by syn-elimination (34Stanjek V. Boland W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1998; 81: 1596-1607Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These data further supported the assumption that the angular pathway has evolved from psoralen biosynthesis, although the release of acetone has not been confirmed for Heracleum, and final proof must await the alignment of enzyme sequences. In contrast to the basic course of biosynthesis, the molecular genetics of furanocoumarin formation has remained largely unresolved due, in part at least, to the lability of the consecutively operating P450s. As an initial step, we describe here the cloning and functional expression of the psoralen synthase from A. majus, the first furanocoumarin-committed monooxygenase gene. The recombinant enzyme revealed narrow specificity for (+)-marmesin, whereas (+)-columbianetin, which is considered as the analogous precursor of the angular furanocoumarin angelicin acted as a competitive inhibitor only. Nevertheless, supplemental insight from molecular modeling and docking approaches seemed to support the idea that psoralen synthase may have evolved also angelicin synthase activity through a limited number of point mutations fitting the active site to the metabolism of (+)-columbianetin. Chemicals—Umbelliferone, psoralen, xanthotoxin, (+)-pulegone, and cinnamic acids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and xanthotoxol, menthofuran or HPLC-grade 4-coumaric acid were from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) and Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), respectively. Angelicin, bergapten, and bergaptol were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay, France). Isoproturon and chlortoluron were from CIL (Paris, France). Demethylsuberosin was synthesized as described previously (36Hamerski D. Matern U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and (+)-marmesin, 5-hydroxymarmesin, and (+)-3,4,2′,3′-D4-columbianetin were kindly provided by G. Innocenti (Faculty of Pharmacy, Padova, Italy) and W. Boland (Max-Planck Institut für Chemische Ökologie, Jena, Germany). Hybond-N+ filters and Rediprime™ II Random Prime Labeling kit were from Amersham Biosciences and [α-32P]dCTP was bought from MP Biomedicals. TaqDNA polymerase, MMLV-reverse transcriptase, restriction endonucleases XhoI, PvuII, BamHI, and PaeI or AccSure DNA polymerase were purchased from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and Bioline (Luckenwalde, Germany), respectively. Cell Cultures and Separation of Coumarins—Cell suspensions of A. majus L. (40-ml B5 cultures in 250-ml flasks) were propagated continuously in the dark at 21-24 °C, and 7-day-old cultures were treated with crude Phytophthora sojae cell wall elicitor (5 mg/40 ml, sterilized in 1 ml of water) as described earlier (35Hamerski D. Matern U. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Hamerski D. Matern U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Control cultures received sterile distilled water only. The cells were harvested by vacuum filtration at various time intervals up to 32 h, washed twice with sterile distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C until use. The culture fluid and wash were combined, and coumarins were separated by HPLC in a solvent system described elsewhere (44Hagemeier J. Batz O. Schmidt J. Wray V. Hahlbrock K. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 629-635Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) employing a nucleosil C-18 column (5 μm, 4 × 12.5 cm) and a step gradient from 1.5% ortho-phosphoric acid (A) and 80% aqueous acetonitrile (B) starting at 90% A in B, decreasing to 50% A in B over 20 min, and followed by 100% B for an additional 10 min. The elution at 1.0 ml/min was monitored by ultraviolet absorbance (350 nm), and psoralen (Rt 20.0 min) was completely separated under these conditions from bergaptol (18.4 min), xanthotoxol (15.6 min), marmesin (16.0 min), demethylsuberosin (26.8 min), umbelliferone (12.0 min), and 4-coumaric acid (11.7 min). cDNA Cloning—Total RNA was isolated from elicitor-induced (1-6 h) and control cells as published elsewhere (45Giuliano G. Bartley G.E. Scolnik P.A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and cDNA was synthesized with the anchor primer (AP) CCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC(dT)17. First strand cDNA was amplified with Taq polymerase, and cytochrome P450-related ESTs were then generated in separate reactions using AP and one of the four primers derived from the conserved PERF motif (EEFXPER; Fig. 2C) (46Schopfer C.R. Ebel J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each incubation was subsequently diluted 1:1000 and amplified in a second round of nested PCR using eight decamer primers inferred from the PFG motif (Fig. 2C) in combination with AP (47Fischer T.C. Klattig J.T. Gierl A. Theor. Appl. Genet. 2001; 103: 1014-1021Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were cloned, the full-length clones were generated by RNA ligase-mediated RACE (48Hübner S. Hehmann M. Schreiner S. Martens S. Lukacin R. Matern U. Phytochemistry. 2003; 64: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the products were ligated into pCR® 4-TOPO Vector (Invitrogen) for multiplication in Top10F host (Invitrogen). The cDNA for final sequencing (primer-walking) was amplified by proofreading PCR (0.5 mm primer, 2.0 mm MgSO4, 56 °C annealing temperature) with AccSure DNA polymerase-activated (94 °C for 10 min) prior to 35 cycles of 0.5 min of denaturation, 1.0 min of annealing, and 2.0 min of extension. Purification of the cDNAs before RACE and sequencing was carried out with High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Sequence analysis was achieved with advanced WU-Blast2 (EMBL) and alignments with ClustalW (EMBL-EBI). The induction of specific transcript abundance was monitored by semiquantitative PCR (Fig. 2B) using end-to-end primers (forward 5′-GCAGAGTGCAGAGCAATAGAAATGAAGATGC and reverse 5′-GAGCTGGGAATGAGTATTGACATGG). Genomic DNA was isolated by a standard procedure (49Dellaporta S.J. Wood J. Hick J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6248) Google Scholar) from adult A. majus plants freshly harvested from the Botanical Gardens, the CYP71AJ1 gene was amplified by PCR employing the end-to-end primers, and the gene was ligated into the pCR®4-TOPO Vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Northern and Southern Blotting—Samples of total RNA isolated from the induced cells at various time points of elicitation (up to 32 h) were densitometrically quantified after 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and aliquots (4 μg per time point) were dissolved in (30.0 μl) 0.5 m MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 50% formamide containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. Following the denaturation at 68 °C for 15 min, the samples were transferred onto Hybond-N+ filters in a Minifold I device (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany). The filters were dried for 2 h at 80°C and then prehybridized at 68 °C for 3 h with 0.025% salmon sperm DNA in 5× SSC, 2× Denhardt's solution containing 0.1% SDS. Full-length CYP71AJ1 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime™ II Random Prime Labeling kit, purified through a Sephadex G50 column and employed as a probe in Northern blotting. The RNA was hybridized at 68 °C for 16 h, the filter washed subsequently twice at 68 °C with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and twice with 1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS before exposure to an imaging plate. The radioactivity was spotted by a Bioimager FLA 2000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). For Southern blotting, the genomic DNA was isolated from A. majus leaf tissue (49Dellaporta S.J. Wood J. Hick J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6248) Google Scholar), resuspended in sterile distilled water and stored at 4 °C until use. Digestion (20 μg of DNA per incubation) was accomplished overnight with endonucleases XhoI, PvuII, BamHI, or PaeI, and the restriction fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis at 70 V for 4 h on 0.8% agarose containing 0.4 μg/100 ml ethidium bromide. The DNA was depurinated in 0.25 n HCl for about 20 min, denatured with 0.5 n NaOH containing 1.5 m NaCl for 40 min and neutralized twice for 30 min with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 in the presence of 1.5 m NaCl. The DNA was transferred for 20 h onto a Hybond-N+ filter in 20× SSC. The membrane was dried, washed (2× SSC), prehybridized (5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's containing 0.2% SDS), and the cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described above. The hybridized filter was washed at 68 °C successively twice with 2× SSC, twice with 1× SSC, and twice with 0.1× SSC, all in the presence of 0.1% SDS, and exposed to an imaging plate for Bioimager FLA 2000 analysis. Expression Constructs—The ORF of CYP71AJ1 was amplified by PCR and introducing KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites proximal upstream to the start ATG and downstream to the stop codon (TGA) employing end-to-end primers (forward 5′-CGGTACCATGAAGATGCTGGAACAGAAT and reverse GGAATTCTCAAACATGTGGTCTGGCAACCACCAAGAGAGG). The incubation was heated to 95 °C for 5.0 min prior to 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C followed by 45 s of annealing at 50 °C and a 2.0-min extension at 72 °C. The reaction was finished by an additional 10.0-min extension at 72 °C. The product was purified through agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with KpnI and EcoRI, and the fragment of 1490 bp was ligated into yeast expression vector pYEDP60 (50Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronne A. Urban B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the expression plasmid was verified by restriction and sequence analyses prior to the transformation of yeast cells. Substitution of the N-terminal membrane anchor region (37 amino acids) in CYP71AJ1 by the corresponding region of CYP73A1 (33 amino acids) generated the mutant CYP71AJ1mut. A primer was designed corresponding to the amino acid sequence Arg27-Leu33 of Cyp73A1 fused to residues Pro38-Pro45 of Cyp71AJ1 (reverse primer 5′-GGGATATTGTGGTGGAGAAGGTGGGAGCTTGAATTTTTTACCGCGG) and employed for PCR with the CYP73A1 cDNA template in combination with another primer (forward 5′-GGATCCATGGACCTCCTCCTCATAGA) creating a BamHI restriction site upstream of the ATG. This first amplification generated a product of 123 nt composed of the upstream 99 nt of CYP73A1 followed downstream by 24 nt of CYP71AJ1. This product was agarose-purified and used in a second PCR as a sense primer together with the reverse primer 5-CGAATTCAAAGCAACTGCAAGTGAAA and CYP71AJ1 cDNA as template. In both cases, the PCR mixture was preheated for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 45 s annealing at 60 °C during the first cycle and decreasing by 1 °C for each cycle, and a 2.0-min extension at 72 °C. Additional 20 cycles were performed with the annealing temperature maintained at 50 °C, and the PCR was terminated with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The end product CYP71AJ1mut, corresponding to a nearly full-size CYP71AJ1 sequence but harboring a replacement of the upstream 111 nt by the upstream 99 nt of CYP73A1, was flanked in 5′ and 3′ by BamHI and EcoRI sites, respectively, which were used for ligation into the pYeDP60 yeast expression vector. The identity of the resulting plasmid was verified by restriction and sequence analyses. Yeast Expression and Enzyme Assays—Yeast strain WAT11, engineered to overexpress the P450 reductase isoform ATR1 from Arabidopsis thaliana upon galactose induction (50Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronne A. Urban B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed with the various pYeDP60 expression constructs as described elsewhere (51Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Propagation of yeast cells and preparation of microsomes were conducted as described previously (50Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronne A. Urban B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single colonies from SGI plates were transferred into SGI liquid medium (10 ml) and grown at 28 °C for 24 h. An aliquot of the culture (5 ml) was transferred subsequently into YPGE growth medium (200.0 ml), and growth was continued for an additional 24 h at 28 °C. Expression of P450 was then induced by the addition of galactose (20.0 g/liter growth medium). The induction was conducted for 18 h at 20 °C, before the cells were harvested, and the microsomal fraction collected by precipitation in the presence of 0.05 m MgCl2 (52Diesperger H. Sandermann Jr., H. FEBS Lett. 1978; 85: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protein amounts were determined according to Bradford (53Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar), and the microsomal P450 contents were determined as described by Omura and Sato (54Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CYP71AJ1 Substrate Specificity—Each compound listed in Table 1 was tested as a potential substrate for CYP71AJ1. Briefly, microsomes isolated from yeast CYP71AJ1mut transformants were incubated in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (150.0 μl total), containing 200 μm of potential substrate, in the presence of 1.0 mm NADPH or without NADPH (control). The assay mixture was equilibrated for 2.0 min at 27 °C prior to starting the reaction by the addition of microsomes. After 1 h at 27 °C the reaction was terminated by adding 75.0 μl of acetonitrile/conc. HCl (99:1), and product formation as well as substrate consumption was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Purospher 5 μm, 4 × 125-mm endcapped column (Merck). The column was equilibrated in water/acetic acid/acetonitrile (98: 1:1) at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min, and the elution was performed under diode array detection (220-400 nm) using a convex gradient of acetonitrile/methanol (1:1) from 0 to 60% for 25.0 min, followed by 100% acetonitrile/methanol (1:1) for an additional 10 min. Bioconversion of (+)-marmesin to psoralen was directly assessed in yeast cultures. Yeast cells transformed with CYP71AJ1, CYP71AJ1mut, or the empty vector were grown in YPGE medium and induced for P450 expression by the addition of galactose. (+)-Marmesin was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 24 °C. The composition of the culture fluid was analyzed subsequently by HPLC at 300 nm, using the separation method described above.TABLE 1Compounds included in psoralen synthase substrate assaysClassificationCompoun"
https://openalex.org/W1966380833,"Abnormal amplification of centrosomes is the major cause of mitotic defects and chromosome instability in cancer cells. Centrosomes duplicate once in each cell cycle, and abrogation of the regulatory mechanism underlying centrosome duplication leads to centrosome amplification. p53 tumor suppressor protein is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication: loss of p53 as well as expression of certain p53 mutants result in deregulated centrosome duplication and centrosome amplification. p53 at least in part depends on its transactivation function to control centrosome duplication, primarily via upregulation of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, which prevents untimely activation of CDK2/cyclin E, a key initiator of centrosome duplication. However, numerous studies have shown the presence of p53 at centrosomes, yet the role of the centrosomally localized p53 in the regulation of centrosome duplication had been enigmatic. Here, we comparatively examined wild-type p53 and p53 mutants that are transactivation(+)/centrosome-binding(−), transactivation(−)/centrosome-binding(+) and transactivation(−)/centrosome-binding(−) for their abilities to control centrosome duplication. We found that the transactivation(+)/centrosome-binding(−) and transactivation(−)/centrosome-binding(+) mutants suppress centrosome duplication only partially compared with wild-type p53. Moreover, the transactivation(−)/centrosome-binding(−) mutant almost completely lost the ability to suppress centrosome duplication. These observations provide direct evidence for the centrosomally localized p53 to participate in the regulation of centrosome duplication in a manner independent of its transactivation function in addition to its transactivation-dependent regulation of centrosome duplication."

Here, we demonstrate, using a variety of gain- and loss-of-function approaches, a role of FXR in the process of cell motility, which involves the small heterodimeric partner (SHP)-dependent up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9. We use this observation to reveal a transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving the SP/KLF transcription factors, SP2 and KLF6. Small interference RNA-based silencing studies in combination with promoter, gel shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that SP2 and KLF6 bind to the matrix metalloproteinase-9 promoter and together function to maintain this gene in a silenced state. However, upon activation of FXR, SHP interacts with SP2 and KLF6, disrupting the SP2/KLF6 repressor complex. Thus, together, these studies identify a mechanism for antagonizing Sp/KLF protein repression function via SHP, with this process regulating endothelial cell motility.

An alternate mechanism of regulation occurs through FXR-dependent up-regulation of the atypical nuclear receptor, small heterodimeric partner (SHP). Although SHP lacks a DNA binding domain, it regulates transcription by several putative mechanisms that are not fully understood (13Boulias K. Katrakili N. Bamberg K. Underhill P. Greenfield A.

Interestingly, these proteins may function as transcriptional activators or repressors, although the mechanisms by which specificity of effect is achieved are not well defined. Because bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are the natural ligands for FXR (21Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B.

However, more recent work has expanded the scope of this nuclear receptor system into a diversity of cell types and functions, including vascular wall cells (26Bishop-Bailey D. Walsh D.T. Warner T.D.

Res. 2006; 98: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting potentially important and heretofore unrecognized actions that may be achieved by the FXR pathway. In this study, we delineate a signaling pathway by which FXR promotes endothelial cell motility through transcriptional activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). This pathway requires SHP inhibition of an SP2/KLF6 repressor complex. Thus, whereas SP2 and KLF6 repress MMP-9 promoter activity under basal conditions, activation of FXR results in a process by which SHP displaces SP2/KLF6 from the MMP-9 promoter, thereby up-regulating MMP-9 expression and function. Together, these studies identify SHP as a key disruptor of SP2/KLF6-mediated gene silencing to allow transcriptional activation by FXR. The functional importance of this pathway is supported by its biological role in FXR-induced endothelial cell motility. Cell Culture—Blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) are a blood-derived endothelial cell commonly utilized for investigations of vascular cell motility and remodeling (29Lin Y. Weisdorf D.J. Solovey A. Hebbel R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). BOECs (P4–P6) were prepared from human blood using primary cell isolation conditions that have been previously described (29Lin Y. Weisdorf D.J. Solovey A. Hebbel R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in EBM-2 medium supplemented with EGM-2, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin. Cells were incubated with CDCA, 6-ECDCA, or equivalent volume of vehicle (Me2SO) at concentrations and durations that were based on prior work (27Fiorucci S. Antonelli E. Rizzo G. Renga B.

HepG2 cells were also used in some experiments in which the molecular intervention was not feasible in BOECs. Retroviral Overexpression—FXR and SHP plasmid constructs (from Benjamin Shneider and David Mangelsdorf) and lacZ were subcloned into the retroviral vector pMMP using standard molecular approaches to generate pMMP-rFXR, pMMP-rSHP, and pMMP-rLacZ (30Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced for confirmation. In brief, to generate retrovirus, 5 × 106 293T/17 cells in 100-mm dishes were co-transfected with three plasmids, 1.5 μg of pMD.MLV gag.pol, 0.5 μg of pMD.G, and 2 μg of relevant retroviral vector using Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cell culture medium containing retrovirus was collected 48 h after transfection. For cell transduction, 2 ml of viral stock and 8 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were mixed and added in a 100-mm dish of 0.5 × 106 BOECs with 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Transduction efficiency using this approach was uniformly >90%. Cells were used for experiments after 18–24 h. Microarray Analysis—Cells were incubated with vehicle or CDCA (100 μm) for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen), and 3 μg was used for the probe preparation using the GEArray AmpoLabeling-LPR kit and biotin-16,2′-deoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate. GEArray Q Series Human Endothelial Cell Biology Gene Array (HS-036) membrane was used for hybridization with the synthesized probe and detected by using the Chemiluminescent detection kit (Super Array Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Changes in expression were assessed by the software provided by the manufacturer. siRNA Gene Silencing—siRNA targeting human FXR, SHP, MMP-9, SP2, KLF6, and a scrambled control were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Cells were transfected with siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as we described previously (16Cao S. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Jin D. Puri V. Cook T.A. Lerman L.O. Zhu X.Y. Urrutia R. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1901-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Conditions and concentrations required for specificity of knockdown with high transfection efficiency were individually established for each of the siRNA (see supplemental materials). Semiquantitative and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells as described above. 1.0 μg of total RNA was used for the cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primer of SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and appropriate forward and reverse primers of FXR and GAPDH for the semiquantitative PCR. Thermal cycling conditions were: 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s and a final extension by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min in a Hybaid PCR express instrument. For TaqMan-based quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) 25 ng of each cDNA was added to the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix along with 900 nm of each primer and 200 nm of probe according to the manufacturer's instruction (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (7Sirvent A.

Real-time fluorescence monitoring was performed with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR System instrument. Amplification of human GAPDH and eukaryotic 18 S rRNA (Applied Biosystems) was used in the same reaction of all samples as an internal control. FXR, SHP, MMP-9, SP2, and KLF6 mRNA was normalized to GAPDH mRNA and shown as the -fold change. Gelatin Zymography—Conditioned media samples from cells incubated with vehicle, CDCA, or 6-ECDCA for 48 h were mixed with electrophoresis loading buffer and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE co-polymerized with gelatin type B (2 mg/ml). After washing with 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubation in zymogram developing buffer, the gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie, and then destained. Gelatinolytic activities were detected as transparent bands (31Huhtala P. Tuuttila A. Chow L.T. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16485-16490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-9 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Total human MMP-9 levels were measured from cultured BOEC supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Biosystems, Minneapolis, MN) based on the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Motility—Chemotaxis was measured by using a modified Boyden chamber assay (8-μm pore size, Neuro Probes, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as we described previously (32Lee J.S. Kang Decker N. Chatterjee S. Yao J. Friedman S. Shah V. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 1861-1870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bottom wells of the chamber were filled with 26 μl of serum-free media containing 10 ng/ml VEGF, and covered with a polycarbonated filter. 2 × 104 serum-starved cells were added into the upper chamber of each well. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with CDCA or vehicle to stimulate FXR-dependent gene transcription. Migrated cells at the lower surface of filters were fixed and stained using Hema3 stain (Biochemical Sciences, Inc., Swedesboro, NJ). Cellular migration was determined by counting the number of stained cells on membranes in five randomly selected, non-overlapping high power fields. Data are presented as percent change in VEGF-induced chemotaxis. Luciferase Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutated Sp1 human MMP-9-promoter-luciferase reporter constructs (33Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar) (Dr. H. Sato, Japan) and 0.01 μg of Renilla luciferase reporter vector to control for transfection efficiency (pRL-TK) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 10 h later, culture medium was changed, and cells were cultured for an additional day then stimulated with vehicle or 50 μm CDCA for 6 h. Luciferase assays were conducted using a dual luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (16Cao S. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Jin D. Puri V. Cook T.A. Lerman L.O. Zhu X.Y. Urrutia R.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—5.0 μg of nuclear extract from vehicle or CDCA (50 μm)-stimulated cells was incubated in a binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.0 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)) for 10 min at room temperature. The 32P-labeled probe encoding the Sp1 binding site of MMP-9 promoter 5′-ATTCCTTCCGCCCCCAGATG-3′ was added for 20 min. In some experiments, an excess of cold probe, at the indicated dilutions, was added concomitant with the addition of radiolabeled probe. The mixture was electrophoresed at 12.5 V/cm on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate-EDTA). Gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed (16Cao S. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Jin D.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were transfected with either control pcDNA or pSP2 or pKLF6 and then incubated with vehicle or CDCA (50 μm). Cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, then harvested in SDS lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) and sheared to fragment DNA. Samples were then immunoprecipitated using agarose-conjugated antibodies to SP2 or KLF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa, Cruz, CA), control (IgG) antibody, or agarose beads alone. After removal of the cross-links, immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction (500 μl) and ethanol precipitation. DNA was used for PCR with sense primer 5′-ATT CAG CCT GCG GAA GAC AGG G-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGA TGG AAG ACT CCC TGA GAC TTC-3′ encoding the Sp1 binding site of MMP-9 promoter and detected by visualizing PCR products on an agarose gel as we previously described (16Cao S. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Jin D. Puri V. Cook T.A. Lerman L.O. Zhu X.Y. Urrutia R. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1901-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells overexpressing rSHP-His were lysed in a buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5/150 mm NaCl/3 mm MgCl2/1 mm EDTA/0.5% Nonidet P-40/10% glycerol). Lysates were precleared with control IgG and Protein A-Sepharose beads, and then incubated overnight with Anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with Protein A-Sepharose beads and washing, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membranes, and immunoblotted with SP2 or KLF6 antibody. To study the endogenous interaction of SHP with SP2/KLF6, nuclear extract of cells treated with either vehicle or CDCA (50 μm) were immunoprecipitated with SP2 or KLF6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoblotted with SHP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above. Proteins were also probed separately with human FXR, SP2, KLF6, and Histone H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MMP-9 (BD Biosciences), and β-actin (Sigma). Statistical Analysis—The data in the bar graphs represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments, each performed with duplicate samples. Blots, autoradiographs, and micrographs represent typical experiments reproduced at least three times with similar results. Statistical analyses were performed using a Student's t test, with a two-tailed value of p < 0.05 considered significant. FXR Regulates Cell Motility via the Up-regulation of MMP-9—Our work initiated from the observation that FXR is expressed in BOECs and regulates cell motility via the up-regulation of MMP-9, a key cellular protease important in cell motility (Fig. 1, A–E, and supplemental Fig. S1A). Initially, the FXR-mediated up-regulation of MMP-9 was identified using a pathway-specific array approach (Fig. 1A). These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR, which showed that the FXR ligand, CDCA, induced a concentration-dependent up-regulation of MMP-9 mRNA levels, with a 6-fold increase observed in response to 10 μm CDCA (Fig. 1B). In addition to these observations at the mRNA level, we also found that FXR activation resulted in a 2-fold increase in MMP-9 enzymatic activity and 3-fold increase in MMP-9 protein levels as measured by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1C) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively (Fig. 1D). Moreover, similar results were obtained with the synthetic FXR agonist, 6-ECDCA (Fig. 1, B–D). Lastly, cells were incubated with the natural FXR ligand, CDCA, under the same conditions used above to stimulate FXR-dependent gene transcription, and then chemotaxis was examined in response to the chemotactic agent, VEGF. Interestingly, cells incubated with CDCA evidenced enhanced migration compared with those incubated with vehicle (Fig. 1E). To more firmly establish the MMP-9 protease in cell migration, we silenced MMP-9 using a specific siRNA. MMP-9 protein levels were markedly reduced in the presence of MMP-9 siRNA as observed by Western blot (supplemental Fig. S1B). Also, MMP-9 mRNA levels were significantly reduced by 80% in the presence of MMP-9 siRNA, whereas GAPDH expression remained unchanged as observed by qRT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Interestingly, under these conditions migration was not observed in cells transfected with MMP-9 siRNA indicating that this molecule is required to trigger FXR-dependent cell motility. In addition to the pharmacological experiments shown above, a series of molecular gain- and loss-of-function approaches were also used to confirm that CDCA activation of MMP-9 gene transcription was indeed mediated directly by FXR. First, cells were transfected with FXR siRNA or scrambled siRNA. A concentration-dependent decrease in FXR mRNA levels was observed in response to FXR siRNA in cells with 30 nm FXR siRNA effectively knocking down 85% of FXR mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). CDCA increased MMP-9 mRNA levels in cells transfected with scrambled siRNA but not in cells transfected with FXR siRNA as assessed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, retroviral FXR (rFXR) overexpression rescued the MMP-9-silencing effect of FXR siRNA both basally as well as in response to CDCA (Fig. 2A). In control experiments, rFXR robustly increased both FXR mRNA and protein levels by severalfold (supplemental Fig. S2D). Lastly, siRNA transfection of BOECs also suppressed BOEC migration indicating that the effects of CDCA on cell motility were also occurring through an FXR-dependent mechanism (Fig. 2B). Therefore, these studies demonstrate that FXR regulates cell motility through an MMP-9-dependent mechanism. FXR Activation of MMP-9 Gene Transcription Requires SHP—To search for biochemical mechanisms used by FXR to regulate gene transcription, we used HepG2 cells, a commonly used cell for transcription mechanism studies relating to FXR (4Denson L.A.

First, we co-transfected HepG2 cells with a human wild-type MMP-9 promoter and either FXR siRNA or scrambled siRNA and then incubated cells with vehicle or 50 μm CDCA. CDCA significantly increased relative luciferase activity in HepG2 cells co-transfected with scrambled siRNA, as compared with FXR siRNA (Fig. 2C). Next, we overexpressed FXR or retrovirus encoding lacZ in HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type MMP-9 promoter and then incubated cells with vehicle or CDCA. Interestingly, the relative luciferase activity was significantly increased by >2.5-fold in HepG2 cells overexpressing FXR as compared with lacZ control, both in the presence and absence of CDCA (Fig. 2D). One prototypical pathway by which FXR regulates target genes is through heterodimerization with nuclear receptors such as retinoic acid receptor and binding to consensus IR-1 repeats located within target promoters (11Zavacki A.M.

Hrywna Y. Thompson J.R. de Pedro N. Blevins R.A. Pelaez F. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28765-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Another indirect pathway occurs through transcriptional activation of the atypical non-DNA binding nuclear receptor SHP (13Boulias K. Katrakili N. Bamberg K. Underhill P. Greenfield A. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2624-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To differentiate between the roles of these two pathways, we performed computer-assisted analysis of the published nucleotide sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site of the human MMP-9 gene, which failed to identify an IR-1 repeat (data not shown). Consequently, we focused our attention on SHP as a mediator of FXR activation of MMP-9 gene transcription. For this purpose, first, we measured mRNA and protein levels of SHP in response to increasing concentrations of CDCA. A concentration-dependent increase in SHP mRNA levels was observed in cells incubated with CDCA as analyzed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A). A concurrent concentration-dependent increase in SHP protein levels were also observed as analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3B). In addition, CDCA induced up-regulation of SHP mRNA levels was not observed in cells transfected with FXR siRNA, confirming SHP as an FXR target gene (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, an increase in SHP mRNA levels (2.26-fold) was also observed in response to MMP-9 siRNA (supplemental Fig. S3A). However, a time kinetic analysis using qRT-PCR revealed that the CDCA-induced increase in SHP mRNA levels preceded the increase in MMP-9 mRNA levels (Fig. 3D). To determine if SHP is required for CDCA activation of MMP-9 gene transcription, we next examined if gene silencing of SHP could block CDCA-induced MMP-9 up-regulation. Indeed, MMP-9 mRNA levels did not increase in response to CDCA in BOECs transfected with SHP siRNA (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, retroviral SHP (rSHP) overexpression rescued the MMP-9-silencing effect of FXR siRNA both basally as well as in the presence of CDCA (Fig. 4A). In control experiments, a concentration-dependent decrease in SHP mRNA level was observed in cells transfected with SHP siRNA with 30 nm SHP siRNA reducing SHP mRNA levels by 70% and blocking CDCA induced up-regulation of SHP mRNA (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Next, overexpression of SHP mRNA levels was pursued using a retroviral system (rSHP), which increased SHP mRNA levels in transduced cells by >4-fold (supplemental Fig. S3D). Overexpression potentiated both basal and CDCA-induced up-regulation of MMP-9 mRNA levels by 2-fold (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, these results were corroborated using the MMP-9 promoter in HepG2 cells. siRNA-based silencing of SHP abolished the CDCA-induced increase in MMP-9 promoter activity (Fig. 4C). Additionally, transduction experiments using rSHP significantly increased the relative MMP-9 luciferase activity by >2-fold both basally and in response to CDCA (Fig. 4D). These studies establish that FXR activates MMP-9 gene transcription through SHP and led us to further identify the components of this pathway. SHP-mediated Antagonism of SP2 and KLF6 Repression Is Required for the Up-regulation of MMP-9 by FXR—The MMP-9 promoter contains an Sp1 binding site and indeed prior studies have demonstrated that Sp1 is important for regulating MMP-9 gene transcription (33Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expanding family of Sp/KLF proteins regulates target genes through DNA binding to Sp1 motifs. Furthermore, intersection of FXR signaling with Sp/KLF protein gene regulation is unexplored. To examine this further, we transfected HepG2 cells with wild-type reporter luciferase construct or one with a point mutation in the Sp1 site. The Sp1 mutant construct evidenced a severalfold increase in MMP-9 promoter activity, suggesting that repressor protein binding to the Sp1 motif of the MMP-9 promoter may regulate MMP-9 gene transcription (Fig. 5A). Because Sp1-like proteins may function as repressors, we comprehensively examined the"

These proteins represent attractive targets for developing novel antimicrobial agents and modulators of immune responses with therapeutic applicability. In this report, we present the results of functional and structural studies of 26 single-site mutants of human β-defensin 1 (hBD1). All mutants were assayed for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (ATCC strain 25922) and for chemotactic activity with CCR6-transfected HEK293 cells. To analyze the structural implications of mutagenesis and to verify the correctness of the disulfide connectivity, we used x-ray crystallography to conduct complete structural studies for 10 mutants in which the topology of disulfides was the same as in the native hBD1. Mutations did not induce significant changes of the tertiary structure, suggesting that the observed alterations of biological properties of the mutants were solely associated with changes in the respective side chains. We found that cationic residues located near the C terminus (Arg29, Lys31, Lys33, and Lys36) of hBD1 define most of the anti-E. coli in vitro activity of this protein. In turn, nearly all mutations altering the CCR6-mediated chemotaxis are located at one area of the protein, defined by the N-terminal α-helical region (Asp1... Ser8) and a few topologically adjacent residues (Lys22, Arg29, and Lys33). These experimental results allow for the first time drafting of the CCR6-epitope for a defensin molecule.

The defensin family is composed of small (3–5 kDa), cationic, and cysteine-rich proteins. In human defensins, the connectivity of three disulfide bridges forms the basis for assigning them into one of two classes, the α- and β-defensins (5Selsted M.E. Harwig S.S. J. Biol.

In β-defensins, the topology of the three disulfide bridges is 1–5, 2–4, and 3–6, meaning that the first cysteine in the sequence is covalently linked to the fifth, and so on.

A naturally occurring 36-amino acid hBD1 peptide shows anti-bacterial activity at micromolar concentrations against some Gram-negative bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as yeast Candida albicans. When tested in vitro, hBD1 is relatively less potent against the Gram-positive Streptococcus aureus (9Goldman M.J. Anderson G.M. Stolzenberg E.D. Kari U.P. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M.

The chemotactic activities of both defensins involve a specific seven transmembrane Gi-protein-coupled receptor, the chemokine receptor CCR6 (17Yang D. Chertov O. Bykovskaia S.N. Chen Q. Buffo M.J.

A functional overlap between β-defensins and MIP-3α suggests that their biological activities may be determined by similar structural features (29Hoover D.M. Boulegue C. Yang D. Oppenheim J.J.

Despite the lack of both amino acid sequence and structural similarity between β-defensins and MIP-3α, several laboratories suggested the molecular motifs that might be responsible for the common functions of these proteins (29Hoover D.M.

These motifs include a large, positively charged patch on the surface of the molecule and a cluster of residues inβ-defensins that is topologically similar to the “Asp5-Cys6-Cys7-Leu8” fragment in MIP-3α. At the moment, however, these observations are purely hypothetical. Besides having a relatively incomplete structure-function analysis of the antimicrobial properties of defensins, there is no experimentally derived base for similar analysis of their chemotactic properties. To better understand the role of specific structural features in the chemotactic properties of β-defensins, we conducted extensive functional and structural studies of 26 single-site mutants of hBD1. All proteins were also subjected to anti-E. coli assays. Preparation, Expression, and Purification of the hBD1 Mutants—The plasmids encoding the genes of the native hBD1 and all mutants were generated according to the protocol described elsewhere (32Pazgier M. Lubkowski J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 49: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The complete protocol for expression and purification of all proteins is also included in the supplemental materials. The molecular weights of folded and oxidized defensins were determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. In the case of each protein, this analysis confirmed formation of three disulfide bonds. Subsequently, concentrations of defensins in appropriate buffers were determined by UV absorption spectrophotometry at 280 nm. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature with equal volumes of protein solution in water (usually at 20 mg/ml) and appropriate reservoir solution. The conditions promoting crystallization were determined by screening with the commercially available crystallization Sparse Matrix Screens. The final crystallization conditions are shown in the supplemental materials. The x-ray diffraction data for most of the mutants were collected using a conventional radiation source. The intensities of reflections were recorded using a MAR Research 345 image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator, operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. In the case of mutants L13A and K31E, diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation (beamline 22BM of the SER-CAT station at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The experimental intensities were recorded using the MAR CCD300 detector (MAR Research). In all cases, data reduction and scaling were performed with the program suite HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z.

Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) against E. coli cells (strand ATCC 25922). Cultures of E. coli were grown at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth to mid-log phase (A600 of 0.4–0.5) and then diluted to 106 colony-forming units/ml in sterile potassium phosphate buffer (KPi, 10 mm, pH 7.4), supplemented with 1% (v/v) of tryptic soy broth. Bacteria were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in the presence of different concentrations (between 0 (control) and 100 μg/ml) of hBD1 mutants. The E. coli cells were then diluted serially in the same buffer and spread onto LB agar plates (three for each concentration). After incubation for 24 h at 30 °C, the colonies were counted. The anti-E. coli activity was calculated as a ratio of the number of colonies counted in the presence of defensin mutant to the number of colonies in the control plate. In each case, results were averaged over three independent experiments, and values of standard errors were determined. The final results are expressed as LD50,LD90, and LD99, representing the concentrations of defensins causing death of 50, 90, and 99% of E. coli cells, respectively. Chemotactic Activity Assay—A chemotaxis assay was performed, using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber technique as described previously (39Falk W. Leonard E.J. Infect. Immun. 1980; 29: 953-959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCR6-transfected human embryonic kidney cells (CCR6/HEK293) were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) and applied at a density 5 × 105/ml. The same medium was used for dilution of the solutions of the mutants (at the concentrations 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 ng/ml). During the assays, the CCR6/HEK293 cells were migrating through 10-μm filter membrane (Neuroprobe), pretreated (2 h, 37 °C) with collagen soak solution (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml rat collagen type I). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h in humidified air with 5% CO2, the filters were removed and the trapped CCR6/HEK293 cells were fixed to the membrane and stained using the HemaQuick kit (Richard Allen Scientific). The stained cells were then counted using the inverted microscope, under immersion oil. Each experiment was repeated at least five times, and the final results correspond to the averaged values with the appropriate standard errors. The results are represented by Cmax, indicating the concentration of peptide inducing maximum cell migration, and CImax (the maximum chemotaxis index) defined as the -fold increase in the number of cell migration measured in the presence of test peptide over spontaneous cell migration in the presence of medium control. Selection of Point Mutations and Preparation of Defensin Peptides—The residues subjected to mutagenesis were selected based on the earlier studies of the structural and physicochemical properties of human β-defensins (29Hoover D.M.

Altogether, 17 residues representing 47% of the amino acid sequence of mature hBD1 were selected for substitution with Ala and, in the case of several residues, also with other (usually charged) amino acids (Fig. 1). Additional criteria used during selection of residues subjected to mutagenesis were the surface accessibility and a predicted lack of the structural role. Based on the second condition, all Gly (with exception of Gly10), Cys, and Pro residues were excluded from mutagenesis. Also, neither of the two Ala residues was subjected to substitutions. The 17 mutated residues represent 60% of the solvent-accessible surface in hBD1(wt). An additional 12% of this surface is formed by the residues with well defined structural roles (Cys, Gly, and Pro) or alanines. The wild-type hBD1 and the 26 mutants were expressed as recombinant insoluble fusion proteins in E. coli. A straightforward protocol for isolation of peptides from the inclusion bodies and cleavage of the fusion leader allowed generation of multimilligram quantities of folded proteins that were purified to homogeneity. Combination of the analytical reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography confirmed the purity, identity, and the correct fold of the proteins under study. Structural Analysis—All hBD1 mutants included in this study were subjected to the crystallization trials to establish the extent of structural changes induced by mutations and to confirm the correctness of disulfide connectivity. For over half of the proteins, crystals formed readily during the routine screening procedure. However, crystals suitable for detailed crystallographic studies could be obtained for only 10 mutants (identified in Fig. 1). For each of the 10 mutants, the complete high quality x-ray data extended to at least 1.85 Å. These proteins crystallized under a variety of conditions, and, with few exceptions, their molecules were packed differently in the crystals (Table 1). In all cases, 35 of 36 residues in each molecule could be unambiguously modeled in the 2Fo - Fc electron density peaks, always including the site of mutation. Basic characteristics of the refined structures are shown in Table 1, whereas representative electron density maps and additional structural analyses are included in the supplemental materials. The structural results for the 10 mutants of hBD1 provided clear answers to the two primary questions. None of the mutations induced significant changes of the tertiary structure. As shown in Fig. 2, the Cα traces of all crystallographically independent monomers representing the 10 mutants of hBD1 can be structurally well aligned with the six independent models of hBD1(wt), with the root mean square deviations between 0.18 and 0.66 Å. This level of topological similarity is comparable to root mean square deviations, 0.16–0.70 Å, calculated for the 45 possible alignments of 10 independent monomers of hBD1(wt) (see the supplemental materials). The main structural variability is observed for the loop connecting the strands β1 and β2 (the fragments Tyr14–Ala16 and Pro18–Thr21), which is inherently flexible in the hBD1 molecule. The largest difference in the conformation of this loop is found for the mutants L13A and K31E, where the shift of the Cα atom of Ile19 compared with the wild-type defensin is close to 2.8 Å. Smaller structural differences are also observed for some long surface-exposed side chains (i.e. Lys, Arg, and Glu). An analysis of B-factors (supplemental materials) shows that mutations did not significantly affect the dynamic properties of the proteins. The crystallographic studies confirmed for all mutants the connectivity of six cysteine residues characteristic for β-defensins, proving the effectiveness of the applied folding protocol. The stereochemistry of three disulfide bridges in the mutated proteins is also identical to that determined earlier for hBD1 (35Hoover D.M. Chertov O. Lubkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39021-39026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 44Bauer F. Schweimer K. Kluver E. Conejo-Garcia J.R. Forssmann W.G. Rosch P. Adermann K. Sticht H.

Cumulatively, the structural results indicate that the differences in the biological in vitro activities of the hBD1 mutants result solely from the changes in the specific mutation sites, characterized either by the alterations to the geometry of molecular surface or to its physicochemical properties (such as electric charge, hydrophobicity, etc.). The secondary result, obtained during these studies, is an observation that, despite the variability of crystal environments, none of these proteins exhibited well defined higher order arrangements (oligomerization, formation of the quaternary structure). This observation extends the earlier notions (35Hoover D.M. Chertov O. Lubkowski J. J. Biol.

Antibacterial Properties—The antibacterial activities of the mutants and hBD1(wt) were tested against E. coli ATCC 25922 cells in a low ionic strength medium. Utilization of the uniform protocol allows for several significant observations. As a measure of anti-E. coli activity, we have chosen three different values of protein concentration, resulting in death of 50%, 90%, and 99% of bacteria. All experiments were performed at least three times. In parallel to the assay for each mutant, a similar experiment with the hBD1(wt) was conducted, allowing for the overall standardization of the results. The results of the experiments are shown in Table 2 and in the supplemental materials. Because the highest co"

Although the mode of action of lithium remains elusive, a putative primary target is thought to be inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) activity. Two IMPase genes have been identified in mammals, the well characterized myo-inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) and myo-inositol monophosphatase 2 (IMPA2). Several lines of genetic evidence have implicated IMPA2 in the pathogenesis of not only bipolar disorder but also schizophrenia and febrile seizures. However, little is known about the protein, although it is predicted to have lithium-inhibitable IMPase activity based on its homology to IMPA1. Here we present the first biochemical study comparing the enzyme activity of IMPA2 to that of IMPA1. We demonstrate that in vivo, IMPA2 forms homodimers but no heterodimers with IMPA1. Recombinant IMPA2 exhibits IMPase activity, although maximal activity requires higher concentrations of magnesium and a higher pH. IMPA2 shows significantly lower activity toward myo-inositol monophosphate than IMPA1. We therefore screened for additional substrates that could be more efficiently dephosphorylated by IMPA2, but failed to find any. Importantly, when using myo-inositol monophosphate as a substrate, the IMPase activity of IMPA2 was inhibited at high lithium and restricted magnesium concentrations. This kinetics distinguishes it from IMPA1. We also observed a characteristic pattern of differential expression between IMPA1 and IMPA2 in a selection of tissues including the brain, small intestine, and kidney. These data suggest that IMPA2 has a separate function in vivo from that of IMPA1.

Inositol monophosphatase (IMPase 2The abbreviations used are: IMPase, inositol monophosphatase; PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). ; EC 3.1.3.25) is an enzyme that dephosphorylates myo-inositol monophosphate to generate free myo-inositol. This enzymatic pathway is important in cellular functions because myo-inositol is a pre-cursor of the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI). PI and its phosphorylated derivatives (phosphatidylinositol phosphate; PIP) play crucial roles in intracellular signal transduction via the production of second messengers, myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate triggers release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and undergoes a multi-step dephosphorylation by multiple enzymes including IMPase to generate free myo-inositol. Cells can generate myo-inositol by another biochemical pathway in which glucose 6-phosphate is isomerized by myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase to produce myo-inositol 1-phosphate (1Harwood A.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and then dephosphorylated by IMPase leading to free myo-inositol. The dephosphorylation of myo-inositol monophosphate by IMPase is a critical and rate-limiting step for the regeneration of PI. From a clinical point of view, IMPase has attracted much interest (1Harwood A.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Atack J.R. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Bipolar disorder (also known as manic depressive illness) is characterized by chronically recurring episodes of fluctuating moods between mania and depression. Lithium has been used for half a century as a first-line drug in this disorder. Importantly, lithium inhibits IMPase under therapeutic concentrations (∼1 mm). Besides IMPase, several other enzymes (inositol polyphosphate phosphatase, bisphosphate nucleotidase, fructose 1,6-bisphophatase, phosphoglucomutase, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β) have been proposed as possible targets of lithium (4Quiroz J.A. Gould T.D. Manji H.K. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Gould T.D. Manji H.K.

However, it is unclear as to which molecule is central to the efficacy of lithium. Berridge et al. (7Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 8Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar) proposed the “inositol depletion hypothesis” in the therapy of bipolar disorder. It suggests that the beneficial effect of lithium in the treatment of this disease is at least partly mediated by the inhibition of IMPase. Lithium is thought to suppress myo-inositol production by inhibiting IMPase and/or inositol polyphosphatase, in turn, attenuating the production of the PI-related second messengers, myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and diacylglycerol. Interestingly, Williams et al. (9Williams R.S. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) observed that lithium and two other mood stabilizers, carbamazepine and valproic acid, blocked the collapse of sensory neuron growth cones and expanded the growth cone area. These effects were reversed by supplementation of inositol in the medium. These data support the idea that inositol depletion may underlie the action of mood stabilizers. To date IMPA1 is the only gene known to encode IMPase activity (10Diehl R.E. Whiting P. Potter J. Gee N. Ragan C.I. Linemeyer D. Schoepfer R. Bennett C. Dixon R.A. J. Biol.

The protein is, however, well characterized biochemically. First, IMPA1 exhibits magnesium-dependent IMPase activity, which is inhibited by therapeutic doses of lithium. Second, the protein forms homodimers and is abundantly expressed in the brain. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed the three-dimensional structure of the IMPA1 homodimer (16Bone R. Springer J.P. Atack J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10031-10035Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, no information was available on the biochemical or structural properties of IMPA2. It was not known whether the gene was translated in vivo or the gene product displayed IMPase activity as predicted by its structural homology with IMPA1. This study aimed to characterize the function of IMPA2 by examining its biochemical and expressional profiles as a first step to investigating the cellular role of this gene in the pathogenesis of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Cells and Antibodies—NB-1 and IMR-32 cell lines were purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Tokyo, Japan). The HeLa Tet-Off cell line was from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). MIA-PaCa2 and Panc-1 cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Anti-IMPA2 rabbit antisera were raised against two IMPA2 peptides (IMPA2-N, ALAGGI-IRKALTEEKC and IMPA2-C, CALQTINYGRDDEK) that were coupled to keyhole lympet hemocyanin. Anti-IMPA1 serum was raised against the IMPA1 peptide, EAIKNEMNVM-LKSSVDLC. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using Isogen reagent (Wako Pure Chemicals). Northern blot analysis was performed following standard procedures, using 32P-labeled fragments corresponding to the full open reading frame of human IMPA1 or IMPA2 as a probe. IMPA1 and IMPA2 fragments were amplified by PCR using the primer sets (5′-GGATTATGCAGTAACTCTAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGATTATGCAGTAACTCTAGCAAG-3′ for IMPA1; and 5′-ATGAAGCCGAGCGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-CATCGCCATCTCCCGGGTGCTG-3′ for IMPA2). The fragments were radiolabeled using the Rediprime II DNA labeling system (GE Healthcare) and [α-32P]dCTP (GE Healthcare). In situ Hybridization—Mouse cDNAs for IMPA1 and IMPA2 were amplified by PCR using Marathon-ready mouse brain cDNA (Clontech) and primer sets (5′-GTTGAGCATCGATCGCGGTGCGCT-3′ and 5′-TCCATCTAATTTTGAATATGTCATCTGT-3′ for IMPA1; and 5′-AAGGCGAGGGCACTGTGCGGAGCCTCCG-3′ and 5′-CAAGATCTGGGTTTGGCTCTGATGA-3′ for IMPA2), then cloned into pBS-KS(+). Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were generated using a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) with T7 or T3 polymerase. In situ hybridization of mouse tissues at postnatal days 7 and 21 was performed as described (17Sadakata T. Mizoguchi A. Sato Y. Katoh-Semba R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Tissues from adult mice were also examined using the same probes. Mammalian Expression Vectors—Human IMPA1 and IMPA2 cDNAs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors SR-HA and SR-V5 (18Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 19Ohnishi T. Yamashita A. Kashima I. Schell T. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Hachiya T. Hentze M.W. Anderson P. Ohno S. Mol.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a standard procedure to generate expression vectors for HA-IMPA1 D93N and HA-IMPA2 D104N. Immunofluorescent Staining and Cell Fractionation Study—Immunofluorescent staining of overexpressed IMPA proteins was performed as follows: HeLa Tet-Off cells, grown on a glass coverslips, were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with the stated plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection with either SR-HA-IMPA1 or SR-HA-IMPA2 constructs, cells were fixed with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 15 min. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% phosphate buffered saline Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h, the slips were incubated with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with secondary antibody (Alexa588-labeled anti-rat IgG, Invitrogen) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride staining for 1 h at room temperature were followed by washes in PBS-T. Fractionation of HeLa Tet-Off cells was performed using the FractionPREP Cell Fractionation system (Biovision, Mountain View, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. We used the following antibodies as localization markers: anti-Hsp70 (Sigma) and anti-Akt1 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) as cytoplasmic markers; anti-pan-cadherin (Sigma) and anti-cytochrome P450 reductase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as membrane markers; anti-histone H1 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) as a nuclear marker; and anti-vimentin (Sigma) as a cytoskeletal marker. Knockdown of Inositol Monophosphatase Proteins by Small Interfering RNA—Transfection of siRNA duplexes (Stealth siRNA from Invitrogen) into HeLa Tet-Off cells was performed using HiPerFect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 12 h before transfection, cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate at a density of 4 × 104/well in normal growth medium and then placed at 37 °C in a5%CO2 atmosphere. Just before transfection, wells were emptied, and 500 μl of fresh medium was added. The siRNAs were diluted in 100 μl of normal growth medium without serum and mixed with 1 μl of HiPerFect reagent. After 15-min incubation at room temperature, the complexes were added dropwise to each well. The final siRNA concentration was kept at 5 nm. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in 100 μl of 1.5 × SDS sample buffer and boiled at 100 °C for 4 min. After sonication to reduce viscosity, the samples were stored at -20 °C until use. To test the effects of siRNA treatment on cell growth, cells were detached from 6-well dishes by trypsinization at days 1, 2, and 3 post-transfection and counted using a Burker-Turk hemocytometer. Gel Filtration and Immunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells grown on five 10-cm dishes were transfected with SR-V5-IMPA2 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Two days after transfection, cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. Crude cell extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, then frozen at -80 °C until analysis. A portion of the supernatant was analyzed by gel filtration column chromatography (Superdex 200 HR 10/30, GE Healthcare) equipped with the AKTA system (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min using lysis buffer. Each fraction was Western blotted using the anti-V5 antibody (Promega, Madison, WI). Molecular weight markers (GE Healthcare) were separately run. Recombinant Proteins—Preparation of HA-tagged recombinant protein from cDNA-transfected HEK293T cells was performed as described (18Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 19Ohnishi T. Yamashita A. Kashima I. Schell T. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Hachiya T. Hentze M.W. Anderson P. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1187-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). After the addition of 25% glycerol, purified protein was frozen at - 80 °C until use. Each preparation was checked for quality by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis and silver staining. Phosphatase Assays—Standard assays were performed at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0) 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm substrate, and 70 ng of purified protein in a 20 μl of assay volume. At specified time points, 40 μl of distilled water and 100 μl of Biomol Green reagent (BIOMOL Research Lab., Plymouth Meeting, PA) were added to 10 μl of the reaction. The amount of free phosphate was calculated by calorimetric determination at 620 nm in a micro-titer plate format. Substrates—The regioisomers of scyllo-inositol phosphates and myo-inositol phosphates were synthesized according to published procedures (20Chung S.K. Kwon Y.U. Chang Y.T. Sohn K.H. Shin J.H.

Commercially available compounds including inositol polyphosphates and other sugar phosphates were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA), Wako Pure Chemicals, Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland), Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), Calbiochem, AG Scientific (San Diego, CA), and/or Sigma. Expression of IMPA2—First, we compared the precise spatial expression patterns of IMPA1 and IMPA2 in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization (Fig. 1). IMPA1 mRNA showed moderate to high levels of expressions in wide areas of the brain. In contrast, IMPA2 generally displayed lower levels of expression except for the mid-hind brain regions and cells of the visual cortex, where high expression was maintained. In P7 mouse brains, IMPA1 mRNA was expressed at high levels in the hippocampus and cerebellar granule cells and Purkinje cells and at moderate levels in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus, superior and inferior colliculus, pontine nuclei, pituitary gland, and medulla oblongata (Fig. 1A). In the same stage animals, IMPA2 mRNA was expressed at relatively high levels in cerebellar Purkinje cells, pons, pituitary gland, and medulla oblongata and at moderate levels in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and inferior colliculus (Fig. 1C). In P21 mouse brains, IMPA1 mRNA was localized at high levels in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum and at moderate levels in the caudate-putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, superior and inferior colliculus, mesencephalic tegmentum, pontine nuclei, and medulla oblongata (Fig. 1B), whereas IMPA2 expression was detected at high levels in the visual cortex (layers II, III, and V), mesencephalic tegmentum, pons, and medulla oblongata (Fig. 1D). In P21 olfactory bulb, both IMPA1 and IMPA2 mRNAs were expressed in cells of the glomerular layer, mitral cell layer, and granular layer (Fig. 1, E and F). In P21 hippocampus, IMPA1 was widely expressed in the CA1-3 regions and dentate gyrus (Fig. 1G) at high levels, whereas IMPA2 was expressed at low levels in cells of similar hippocampal regions (Fig. 1H) and the hilus (Fig. 1O). In P21 cerebral cortex (motor area), the predominant expression of IMPA1 was observed in cells of the layers II-III and V (Fig. 1I), whereas IMPA2 mRNA was seen in layer V pyramidal cells (Fig. 1J). In P21 cerebellum, IMPA1 mRNA was detected predominantly in Purkinje cells and moderately in granule cells and deep cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 1, K and M), whereas IMPA2 mRNA was localized predominantly in the deep cerebellar nuclei and at low levels in Purkinje cells and cell type(s) of the granular layer (Fig. 1, L, N, and P). These results demonstrated that transcription of IMPA1 and IMPA2 was differentially regulated in region and cell-type specific manner within the central nervous system. Next, we compared the expression of IMPA2 mRNA with that of IMPA1 in several human cell lines (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our previous data showing the high expression of IMPA2 mRNA in the pancreas (15Yoshikawa T. Turner G. Esterling L.E. Sanders A.R. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. Mol. Psychiatry. 1997; 2: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), IMPA2 was expressed as a doublet in two cell lines derived from pancreatic cancers (MIA-PaCa1 and Panc1) in addition to HeLa Tet-Off cells. No expression was detected in two neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR-32 and NB-1). This cell line-specific expression is interesting because the promoter sequence of IMPA2 has a high G/C content and no canonical TATA box, indicative of a housekeeping gene (23Yoshikawa T. Padigaru M. Karkera J.D. Sharma M. Berrettini W.H. Esterling L.E. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). IMPA1 mRNA was detected as a single band in all cell lines examined. To determine whether IMPA2 transcripts were translated into protein, we attempted to detect IMPA2 protein using HeLa Tet-Off cells expressing IMPA2 mRNA. We raised two IMPA2 polyclonal antibodies against N- and C-terminal regions (IMPA2-N and IMPA2-C, Fig. 2B). Both antibodies consistently detected a doublet (31 and 32.5 kDa) in HeLa Tet-Off cell lysates (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the intensity of the doublet was significantly reduced in cells treated with siRNAs targeting three different sites on the IMPA2 transcript (Fig. 2C, lanes 5, 6, and 7), indicating that both proteins in the doublet were immunologically IMPA2. This was the first demonstration that the IMPA2 gene was translated into protein in vivo. Using our antibodies, we examined the expression of IMPA1 and IMPA2 proteins in mouse tissues. Both proteins were expressed in a range of tissues at different intensities (Fig. 2D). This is the first identification of the IMPA2 protein in four regions of the brain, small intestine, heart, kidney, spleen, and other tissues. The major IMPase protein in heart may be IMPA2 because we were unable to detect IMPA1 expression in that organ. The IMPA1 protein was most abundantly expressed in the testis, whereas IMPA2 showed only weak expression. An in situ hybridization study using adult mice also showed characteristic expression patterns of two IMPase genes (supplemental Fig. 1). Kidney and small intestine expressed both IMPA1 and IMPA2 proteins with a characteristic difference in their mRNA expression patterns: in the small intestine, IMPA1 mRNA was strongly expressed in epithelial cells of villi and intestinal glands (Fig. 2E, upper panels). In contrast, IMPA2 mRNA was almost exclusively expressed in epithelial cells of intestinal glands (Fig. 2E, lower panels). In the kidney, strong IMPA2 signal was observed in the cells surrounding the lumen in the duct-like structures, whereas IMPA1 expression was ubiquitous. The IMPA2 positive duct-like structures (Fig. 2F, bottom, arrowheads) are likely to be epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubules as deduced from their packed nuclear morphology. This anatomical site-specific expression of IMPA1 and IMPA2 strongly suggests distinct biological roles in these tissues. We also examined whole brain, spleen, pancreas, and liver for the expression of IMPA1 and IMPA2 transcripts from adult mice (supplemental Fig. 1). Consistent with Western blot data, we observed the expression of two transcripts in the brain and spleen (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). Purification of IMPase from several tissues including brain suggests that it is a predominantly cytosolic protein (24Takimoto K. Okada M. Matsuda Y. Nakagawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Meek J.L. Rice T.J. Anton E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Attwood P.V. Ducep J.B. Chanal M.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HA-tagged IMPA2 (Fig. 2B) expressed in HeLa Tet-Off cells showed a dispersed pattern in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2G). This pattern was similar to that of IMPA1. Perinuclear staining (Fig. 2G, arrowheads) was observed with both HA-IMPA1 and -IMPA2 constructs. These nuclear-associated stainings are possibly artifacts generated by the overexpression system. This speculation is supported by a biochemical fractionation study of HeLa Tet-Off cells (Fig. 2H), indicating the absence of IMPA2 protein in the nuclear fraction. The majority of IMPA2 protein was detected in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. Because the two cytoplasmic markers used in this study, Hsp70 and Akt1, were detected as contaminants in the membrane fraction, most likely because of incomplete disruption of cells in the fractionation step; we cannot say with certainty that the IMPA2 protein exists in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. IMPA2 Forms Homodimers but No Heterodimers with IMPA1—Biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies on IMPA1 show that the protein forms homodimers (16Bone R. Springer J.P. Atack J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10031-10035Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Attwood P.V. Ducep J.B. Chanal M.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because IMPA2 displayed strong amino acid homology (54%) with IMPA1 (Fig. 2B), we predicted that IMPA2 would also form homodimers and/or heterodimers with IMPA1. To test this theory, we first performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. HA- or V5-tagged IMPA1 and IMPA2 (Fig. 2B) were transiently expressed as various combinations in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, V5-IMPA1 co-immunoprecipitated with HA-IMPA1, implying homodimerization of the protein. Similarly, we detected HA-IMPA2·V5-IMPA2 complexes in this assay, suggesting homodimerization of IMPA2. We did not detect V5-IMPA1·HA-IMPA2 or HA-IMPA1·V5-IMPA2 complexes, excluding the formation of heterodimers. Next, we performed gel filtration column chromatography on protein extracts from HEK293T cells that transiently expressed V5-IMPA2. Subsequent Western blot analysis revealed that V5-IMPA2 eluted at around 70 kDa as a single peak without a shoulder (Fig. 3B). Because the calculated molecular mass of V5-IMPA2 is ∼33 kDa, all pools of IMPA2 are likely to exist as homodimers in vivo. Moreover, ultracentrifugation sedimentation and x-ray crystallographic analyses of IMPA2 supported the proposed formation of homodimers (41Arai R. Ito K. Ohnishi T. Ohba H. Akasaka R. Bessho Y. Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Yoshikawa T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Intrinsic IMPase Activity of IMPA2—Given that IMPA2 exhibits high primary structural similarity to IMPA1, we expected IMPA2 to have intrinsic IMPase activity. To examine this possibility, we prepared near homogeneously purified HA-IMPA2 and HA-IMPA1 proteins from cDNA-transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 4A). Silver staining detected a minor band of faster mobility below the major band in HA-IMPA2 preparations (Fig. 4A, asterisk). This minor band was found to be IMPA2 by mass spectrometry (data not shown) and Western blot analysis using an anti-IMPA2 antibody (IMPA2-C, Fig. 2B). The"

We previously showed that F1L interacts with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak and inhibits activation of Bak following an apoptotic stimulus (Wasilenko, S. T., Banadyga, L., Bond, D., and Barry, M. (2005) J. Virol. 79, 14031-14043). In addition to Bak, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax is also capable of initiating cytochrome c release suggesting that vaccinia virus infection could also inhibit Bax activity. Here we show that F1L inhibits the activity of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax by inhibiting oligomerization and N-terminal activation of Bax. F1L expression also inhibited the subcellular redistribution of Bax to the mitochondria and the insertion of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane. The ability of F1L to inhibit Bax activation does not require Bak, because F1L expression inhibited cytochrome c release and Bax activation in Bak-deficient cells. No interaction between Bax and F1L was detected during infection, suggesting that F1L functions upstream of Bax activation. Notably, F1L was capable of interacting with the BH3-only protein BimL as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, and F1L expression inhibited apoptosis induced by BimL. These studies suggest that, in addition to interacting with the pro-apoptotic protein Bak, F1L also functions to indirectly inhibit the activation of Bax, likely by interfering with the pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins such as BimL.

Apoptosis is a tightly controlled process that plays a critical role in development, tissue homeostasis, and the recognition and removal of virus-infected cells (1Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar). A family of intracellular cysteine proteinases, known as caspases, largely mediates apoptosis and is activated via either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is primarily initiated via death receptor activation, whereas the intrinsic pathway is initiated from within the cell and specifically requires the involvement of the mitochondria (1Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar, 2Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). Mitochondria act as a pivotal regulator within cells, serving to both amplify and initiate apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis leads to the loss of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential and permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane culminating in the release of a number of pro-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome c, SMAC/DIABLO, and Omi/Htr2A, which serve to promote apoptotic death (2Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Green D.R. Kroemer G.

Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family includes anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and a large group of pro-apoptotic family members. The pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family are further subdivided into the multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins, which include Bak and Bax, and the BH3-only proteins, which trigger the activation of Bak and Bax. Cells deficient in both Bax and Bak are completely resistant to cytochrome c release, demonstrating the collective importance of these two pro-apoptotic proteins (5Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.

Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Following an apoptotic stimulus, Bak undergoes a conformational change revealing an N-terminal epitope that ultimately results in the formation of high molecular weight oligomers of Bak (9Griffiths G.J.

In contrast, Bax is normally found in the cytoplasm or loosely associated with intracellular membranes, and apoptotic stimuli induce a conformational change in Bax that permits insertion of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane (12Hsu Y.T.

Similar to Bak, this conformational change in Bax reveals an N-terminal epitope, and Bax inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane as high molecular weight oligomers, facilitating the release of cytochrome c (16Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Current theories suggest that Bax and Bak induce apoptosis and cytochrome c release by either facilitating the formation of a pore in the outer mitochondrial membrane or by modulating pre-existing pores (17Degli Esposti M. Dive C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar).The BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim, Bad, Bik, Noxa, Puma, Bmf, and Hrk) are essential death sensors that respond to pro-apoptotic signals and ultimately activate Bak and Bax (19Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 20Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Following an apoptotic stimulus, BH3-only proteins are activated through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms and exert their pro-apoptotic effects by either directly activating Bak and Bax, or by binding and inhibiting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (19Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 20Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins have therefore been referred to as either “direct activators” of Bax and Bak or as “death sensitizers” (21Moreau C. Cartron P.F. Hunt A. Meflah K. Green D.R. Evan G. Vallette F.M.

Although a number of viruses encode obvious Bcl-2 homologues, a subset of viral anti-apoptotic proteins that function at the mitochondria, but lack obvious homology to Bcl-2, have recently been identified (27Polster B.M.

Banadyga L. Bond D. Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14031-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Wasilenko S.T. Stewart T.L. Meyers A.F. Barry M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

F1L possesses a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane anchor that is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial localization (38Stewart T.L. Wasilenko S.T. Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1084-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite lacking obvious homology to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, we have shown that F1L constitutively interacts with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak and inhibits the activation of Bak following an apoptotic stimulus (36Wasilenko S.T. Banadyga L. Bond D. Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14031-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we report that, in addition to inhibiting Bak, F1L is also able to inhibit Bax activation. F1L expression prevented activation, oligomerization, and insertion of Bax in the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, no interaction between F1L and Bax was detected, suggesting that F1L exerts its anti-apoptotic function upstream of Bax activation. Significantly, F1L efficiently inhibited apoptosis induced by the long form of the BH3-only protein Bim (BimL) and interacted with BimL. These results suggest that F1L can indirectly inhibit Bax activation via the interaction with BH3-only proteins, which are essential for transducing pro-apoptotic signals through Bak and Bax.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Viruses—HeLa, HEK293T, and Bak-/-, Bim-/-, Bak-/-/Bax-/- baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells (kindly provided by E.

Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1084-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell for the indicated times. To induce apoptosis, cells were either subjected to 200 mJ/cm2 of UV-C, 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Roche Diagnostics) and 5 μg/ml cycloheximide, or 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich).Transfections—pEGFP-F1L, pEGFP-F1L-(206-226), and pEGFP-Bcl-2 were generated as previously described (37Wasilenko S.T.

Bim localization was detected using anti-Bim (Calbiochem) at 1:500. Primary antibodies were detected using anti-rabbit Alexa546 or anti-mouse Alexa546 (Molecular Probes) at a 1:300 dilution and analyzed using laser scanning microscopy. Data were quantified by counting 200 cells per experiment. The means ± S.D. from three replicate experiments are shown.Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by staining cells with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Molecular Probes) (42Metivier D. Dallaporta B. Zamzami N. Larochette N. Susin S.A. Marzo I. Kroemer G. Immunol. Lett. 1998; 61: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with 0.2 μm TMRE, and fluorescence was detected with a BD Biosciences FACScan through the FL-2 channel. Loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential in EGFP-positive cells was measured as a decrease in TMRE fluorescence by two-color flow cytometry as described (38Stewart T.L. Wasilenko S.T. Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1084-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Data were acquired on 20,000 cells per sample and analyzed with CellQuest software. Loss of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential was calculated as (number of EGPF+TMRE- cells/total number of EGFP+ cells) × 100, and data are represented as the mean ± S.D. from three replicate experiments.Gel-filtration Chromatography—Gel-filtration chromatography was performed as described previously (36Wasilenko S.T. Banadyga L. Bond D. Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14031-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (1 × 107) were either mock infected or infected with either VV(Cop)EGFP or VV(Cop)ΔF1L at an m.o.i. of 10 for 8 h, subjected to UV light, and allowed to recover for 5 h. Cells were lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer containing 2% CHAPS, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and disrupted by passage through a 22-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g, and supernatants were loaded at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min on a Superose6 HR (10/30) column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 1% CHAPS, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The column was calibrated using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa). Fractions of 150 μl were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Bax(N20) (BD Biosciences).Mitochondrial Isolation—Mitochondria were isolated as described (36Wasilenko S.T. Banadyga L. Bond D. Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14031-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (1 × 107) or Bak-/- MEFs (1 × 107) were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 with either VV(Cop)EGFP or VV(Cop)ΔF1L for 8 h. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA and incubated on ice for 30 min (43Zong W.X. Li C. Hatzivassiliou G. Lindsten T. Yu Q.C. Yuan J. Thompson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cells were passed through a 22-gauge needle, and crude membranes and nuclei were pelleted at 750 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer and again passed through a 22-gauge needle. Membranes and nuclei were pelleted at 750 × g, and the supernatant containing the mitochondria was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to isolate mitochondria. To remove loosely associated proteins, mitochondrial pellets were washed with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 12) for 20 min on ice, and spun at 100,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. Mitochondria were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 2% CHAPS, and protein concentrations were determined using a standard BCA test (Pierce). To induce cytochrome c release in purified mitochondria, increasing amounts of recombinant tBid (R&D Biosystems) were added to 50 μg of mitochondria and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. Mitochondria were harvested by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. For anti-Bax(6A7) immunoprecipitations, 100 μg of purified mitochondria was incubated with 300 ng of recombinant tBid for 40 min at 30 °C. Mitochondria were pelleted and resuspended in 2% CHAPS lysis buffer, and activated Bax was immunoprecipitated with anti-Bax(6A7).Detection of Apoptosis in Baby Mouse Kidney Cells—Wild-type and Bim-/- BMK cells were infected with VV(Cop) or VVΔF1L in the absence and presence of 100 μm z-VAD-fmk. Apoptosis was determined by counting the number of adherent cells. The percentage of adherent cells (% cell survival) was normalized to the number of adherent cells following infection with VV(Cop) (±S.D.). Standard deviations were calculated from three independent experiments. To detect poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, floating and adherent cells were harvested, lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 8 m urea, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PARP (1:1000, BD Pharmingen). PARP cleavage products were quantified using ImageQuant™TL (GE Healthcare).Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—To immunoprecipitate activated Bax, cells were lysed in 2% CHAPS lysis buffer (2% CHAPS, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, Complete mini proteasome inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)) for 1 h at 4 °C, and soluble protein fractions were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Bax(6A7) (BD Pharmingen) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were isolated with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. FLAG immunoprecipitations were carried out in either 2% CHAPS or 1% Triton X-100 using anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma-Aldrich). Endogenous Bim immunoprecipitations were carried out in 2% CHAPS lysis buffer using anti-Bim (Calbiochem). Immune complexes were isolated with protein A beads (GE Healthcare) and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. EGFP immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described using goat-anti-EGFP (L. Berthiaume, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada) (36Wasilenko S.T. Banadyga L. Bond D. Barry M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14031-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and complexes were purified with protein G beads (GE Healthcare). Protein samples were separated by either 8% or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to either nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). Antibodies used were as follows: anti-Bax N20 (BD Biosciences), anti-Bak NT (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anticytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, BD Biosciences), anti-manganese superoxide dismutase (clone 110, Stressgen Bioreagents), anti-Bim (Calbiochem), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-EGFP (Covance). Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence as per the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare).RESULTSVaccinia Virus Infection Induces Bax Activation—We have previously shown that vaccinia virus encodes an anti-apoptotic protein, F1L, which localizes to the mitochondria and inhibits cytochrome c release (36Wasilenko S.T.

Induction of apoptosis at the mitochondria is achieved through the activation of Bax and Bak, two pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (5Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T.

Previous studies have demonstrated that F1L interacts with Bak and inhibits Bak activation following an apoptotic trigger (36Wasilenko S.T. Banadyga L. Bond D. Barry M. J.

Because either Bak or Bax is capable of initiating cytochrome c release, we hypothesized that vaccinia virus would also encode a mechanism to inhibit Bax activity (5Wei M."
https://openalex.org/W2149610494,"The kinetic mechanism of Na+ binding to thrombin was resolved by stopped-flow measurements of intrinsic fluorescence. Na+ binds to thrombin in a two-step mechanism with a rapid phase occurring within the dead time of the spectrometer (<0.5 ms) followed by a single-exponential slow phase whose kobs decreases hyperbolically with increasing [Na+]. The rapid phase is due to Na+ binding to the enzyme E to generate the E:Na+ form. The slow phase is due to the interconversion between E* and E, where E* is a form that cannot bind Na+. Temperature studies in the range from 5 to 35 °C show significant enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity changes associated with both Na+ binding and the E to E* transition. As a result, under conditions of physiologic temperature and salt concentrations, the E* form is negligibly populated (<1%) and thrombin is almost equally partitioned between the E (40%) and E:Na+ (60%) forms. Single-site Phe mutations of all nine Trp residues of thrombin enabled assignment of the fluorescence changes induced by Na+ binding mainly to Trp-141 and Trp-215, and to a lesser extent to Trp-148, Trp-207, and Trp-237. However, the fast phase of fluorescence increase is influenced to different extents by all Trp residues. The distribution of these residues over the entire thrombin surface demonstrates that Na+ binding induces long-range effects on the structure of the enzyme as a whole, contrary to the conclusions drawn from recent structural studies. These findings elucidate the mechanism of Na+ binding to thrombin and are relevant to other clotting factors and enzymes allosterically activated by monovalent cations. The kinetic mechanism of Na+ binding to thrombin was resolved by stopped-flow measurements of intrinsic fluorescence. Na+ binds to thrombin in a two-step mechanism with a rapid phase occurring within the dead time of the spectrometer (<0.5 ms) followed by a single-exponential slow phase whose kobs decreases hyperbolically with increasing [Na+]. The rapid phase is due to Na+ binding to the enzyme E to generate the E:Na+ form. The slow phase is due to the interconversion between E* and E, where E* is a form that cannot bind Na+. Temperature studies in the range from 5 to 35 °C show significant enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity changes associated with both Na+ binding and the E to E* transition. As a result, under conditions of physiologic temperature and salt concentrations, the E* form is negligibly populated (<1%) and thrombin is almost equally partitioned between the E (40%) and E:Na+ (60%) forms. Single-site Phe mutations of all nine Trp residues of thrombin enabled assignment of the fluorescence changes induced by Na+ binding mainly to Trp-141 and Trp-215, and to a lesser extent to Trp-148, Trp-207, and Trp-237. However, the fast phase of fluorescence increase is influenced to different extents by all Trp residues. The distribution of these residues over the entire thrombin surface demonstrates that Na+ binding induces long-range effects on the structure of the enzyme as a whole, contrary to the conclusions drawn from recent structural studies. These findings elucidate the mechanism of Na+ binding to thrombin and are relevant to other clotting factors and enzymes allosterically activated by monovalent cations. Numerous enzymes with widely different functions, structures, and mechanisms require a monovalent cation (M+) for optimal catalytic activity (1Suelter C.H. Science. 1970; 168: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 2Evans H.J. Sorger G.J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1966; 17: 47-76Crossref Google Scholar, 3Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In practically all cases reported to date, M+ activation is mediated by Na+ or K+ with high selectivity (3Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Page M.J. Di Cera E. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1049-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Remarkable progress has been made during the past decade in the structural characterization of such enzymes. Structural studies have uncovered two basic mechanisms of activation, one in which M+ functions as a cofactor by bridging atoms of the protein and substrate in the active site and another in which M+ binds away from substrate and influences recognition and catalysis through an allosteric mechanism. A simple classification of M+-activated enzymes has been proposed recently by merging information from kinetic and structural studies (3Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1305-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The classification groups enzymes based on their M+ specificity (Na+ or K+) and the mechanism of activation, cofactor-like (Type I) or allosteric (Type II). Among Na+-activated Type II enzymes, thrombin has been studied in considerable detail both functionally and structurally (5Bode W. Blood Cells Mol.

At steady state, Na+ promotes diffusion into the active site and acylation of substrate by thrombin (35Wells C.M. Di Cera E.

However, the kinetics of M+ binding to M+-activated enzymes in general remain for the most part unexplored due to the difficulty of resolving rate constants for reactions that likely occur on a very fast time scale (4Page M.J. Di Cera E. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1049-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the case of thrombin, earlier studies have suggested that Na+ binds in a two-step mechanism with a fast phase occurring within the dead time of the spectrometer (2 ms), followed by a slow phase in the 30-ms time scale at 5 °C (41Lai M.T. Di Cera E. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30275-30282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we revisit these earlier observations and address the kinetic mechanism of Na+ binding to thrombin in more detail. We identify the Trp residues responsible for the spectral changes and the precise mechanism that gives rise to the two-step components of Na+ binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of human thrombin was carried out in a HPC4-modified pNUT expression vector (15Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 42Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of thrombin mutants was carried out in baby hamster kidney cells. Mutants were activated with the prothrombinase complex between 40 and 60 min at 37 °C. Enzymes used in the activation were from Enzyme Research (South Bend, IN). Mutants were purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography using Resource Q and S columns with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 m choline chloride (ChCl), 5 mm MES, pH 6, at room temperature. Active site concentrations were determined by titration with hirudin (43Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All nine Trp residues of thrombin were mutated to Phe by single-site substitutions. The conservative replacement did not change the kinetic properties of the constructs, which retained activity toward substrates and Na+ activation comparable with wild-type (data not shown). Murine thrombin was prepared as reported elsewhere (44Bush L.A. Nelson R.W. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7183-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow fluorescence measurements of Na+ binding to thrombin were carried out with an Applied Photophysics SX20 spectrometer, using an excitation of 280 nm and a cutoff filter at 305 nm. Samples of thrombin at a final concentration of 50 nm were mixed 1:1 with 60-μl solutions of the same buffer (5 mm Tris, 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG), 2The abbreviations used are: PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. pH 8.0, at 15 °C) containing variable amounts of NaCl (up to 400 mm) kept at constant ionic strength of 400 mm with ChCl. The baseline was measured with 400 mm ChCl in the mixing syringe. Each trace was determined in quadruplicate. Na+ binding studies were carried out for wild-type thrombin in the temperature range 5-35 °C. The pH was precisely adjusted at room temperature to obtain the value of 8.0 at the desired temperature. Tris buffer has a pKa of 8.06 at 25 °C and a temperature coefficient of ΔpKa/ΔT of -0.027 (45Stoll V.S. Blanchard J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These properties ensured buffering over the entire temperature range examined. The fluorescence increase observed upon Na+ binding has an initial rapid phase that cannot be resolved within the dead time (<0.5 ms) of the spectrometer, followed by a single exponential slow phase with a kobs that decreases as [Na+] increases (see “Results”). The total change in fluorescence calculated from the sum of the amplitudes of the fast and slow phases coincides with the value of F determined by equilibrium measurements of intrinsic fluorescence. The value of F as a function of [Na+] was fit according to Equation 1 (39Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13785-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) F=F0+F1Kapp[Na+]1+Kapp[Na+](Eq. 1) where F0 and F1 are the values of F in the absence and under saturating [Na+] and Kapp is the apparent equilibrium association constant for Na+ binding (see below). The value of F0 corresponds to the base-line reading. The simplest kinetic scheme accounting for the two-step mechanism of Na+ binding detected by stopped-flow measurements is given by Scheme 1. E*⇆k1k-1E⇔KAE:Na+SCHEME 1 The free enzyme exists in equilibrium between two forms, E* and E, that interconvert with kinetic rate constants k1 and k-1. Of these forms, only E can interact with Na+ with an equilibrium association constant KA to generate the E:Na+ form. The fast phase detected by rapid kinetics is due to the binding of Na+ to E to generate E:Na+. Analysis of the fast phase was carried out according to Equation 2, which is analogous to Equation 1, F=F0+FiKA[Na+]1+KA[Na+](Eq. 2) where Fi is the value of F under saturating [Na+] (Fi < F1) and KA is the intrinsic equilibrium association constant for Na+ binding. The slow phase is due to the interconversion between E* and E with an observed rate constant as shown in Equation 3. kobs=k1+k-111+KA[Na+](Eq. 3) The value of kobs is expected to decrease with increasing [Na+] from k1 + k-1 ([Na+] = 0) to k1 ([Na+] = ∞). Analysis of kobs yields k1, k-1, and a value of KA that is independent from that derived from analysis of the amplitude of the fast phase according to Equation 2. In the event of a mutation that abrogates the fast phase, the effect of Na+ binding can still be detected from measurements of kobs (see “Results”). The alternative two-step mechanism as shown in Scheme 2 E⇔KAE:Na+⇆k1k-1E*:Na+SCHEME 2 where a slow isomerization follows the rapid binding of Na+ leads to an observed rate constant as shown in Equation 4. kobs=k-1+k1KA[Na+]1+KA[Na+](Eq. 4) In this case, the value of kobs is expected to increase with increasing [Na+] from k-1 ([Na+] = 0) to k1 + k-1 ([Na+] = ∞). Hence, the dependence of kobs on [Na+] is of diagnostic value and rules out Scheme 2 in favor of Scheme 1 (see “Results”). There is a relationship between the apparent equilibrium association constant Kapp derived from Equation 1 and the intrinsic equilibrium association constant KA derived from Equation 2 or 3. The value of Kapp can also be derived from equilibrium titrations of intrinsic fluorescence (35Wells C.M. Di Cera E.

The value of KA, on the other hand, can only be derived from rapid kinetic studies. Because of the presence of E, E*, and E:Na+ in Scheme 1, at equilibrium one has (49Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 121: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) Equation 5. Kapp=KA1+k-1k1=KA1+r(Eq. 5) The parameter r = [E*]/[E] measures the population of E* relative to E. Under conditions where r << 1 and the free form is essentially all E, the value of Kapp coincides with KA. However, under conditions where r is significant, a sizable fraction of free thrombin exists in the E* form and the value of Kapp underestimates the true Na+ binding affinity KA. Hence, it is very important to know how r changes under conditions of interest to correctly interpret Na+ binding in terms of the process that converts E to E:Na+. The temperature dependence of Kapp, KA, and r yields the thermodynamic parameters associated with the underlying processes according to Equation 6 (39Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A.

The change occurs in two steps, clearly revealed by stopped-flow measurements (Fig. 1A). A fast phase, whose amplitude increases with [Na+], occurs within the dead time of the spectrometer (<0.5 ms) and is followed by a single-exponential slow phase whose kobs decreases with increasing [Na+]. Control experiments run with murine thrombin, an enzyme devoid of Na+ activation (44Bush L.A. Nelson R.W. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7183-7188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), show no change in fluorescence even at 200 mm Na+ (Fig. 1B). The dependence of kobs on [Na+] is hyperbolic (Fig. 2) and is consistent with the mechanism depicted in Scheme 1 and Equation 3. That supports the conclusion that, in the absence of Na+, thrombin exists in equilibrium between two conformations, E* and E, and that only E can be converted to the E:Na+ form. The binding of Na+ to E gives rise to the fast phase. The slow phase detected by stopped-flow measurements is the result of the interconversion between E* and E that takes place on a time scale of milliseconds.FIGURE 2Values of kobs for the slow phase of fluorescence increase due to Na+ binding to thrombin (see Fig. 1) as a function of [Na+] in the temperature range 5-35 °C.

Analysis of such curves in the temperature range 5-35 °C enables determination of Kapp from Equation 1 (Table 1). A van't Hoff plot of the Kapp values is shown in Fig. 4 and reveals a curvature conducive to the presence of a heat capacity change of -500 cal/mol/K, consistent with previous results (38Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Prasad S. Wright K.J. Roy D.B. Bush L.A. Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analysis of the amplitude of the fast phase as a function of [Na+] (Fig. 3B) according to Equation 2 enables the determination of KA (Table 1). These values of KA are practically identical to those derived independently from analysis of kobs as a function of [Na+] according to Equation 3 (Fig. 2), which also enables resolution of k1 and k-1 (Table 1). The van't Hoff plot of the KA values is curved, as for Kapp, due to a heat capacity change of -500 cal/mol/K (Fig. 4). This proves that the heat capacity change reported previously for the values of Kapp (38Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Prasad S.

Chem. 2001; 90: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reflects an intrinsic property of Na+ binding to thrombin and is not the result of the pre-existing equilibrium between E and E*. In fact, from the definition of Kapp in Equation 5, it can be seen that the E-E* equilibrium gives rise to an apparent heat capacity change when the value of r changes with temperature, even if no heat capacity change is associated with KA and/or r. The direct determination of KA from rapid kinetic data resolves the transition from E to E:Na+ in Scheme 1 and decouples this process from the linked equilibrium between E and E*. The temperature dependence of KA then offers direct validation of the heat capacity change associated with Na+ binding as a basic thermodynamic property of thrombin (38Guinto E.R. Di Cera E.

C5a and its degradation product C5a-des-Arg74 also bind to the C5a receptor-like 2 (C5L2). C3a and C3a-des-Arg77, also called acylation-stimulating protein, augment triglyceride synthesis and glucose uptake in adipocytes and skin fibroblasts. Based on data obtained using transfected HEK293 and RBL cells, C5L2 is additionally proposed as a functional receptor for C3a and C3a-des-Arg77. Here we use 125I-ligand binding assays and flow cytometry with fluorescently labeled ligands to demonstrate that neither C3a nor C3a-des-Arg77 binds to C5L2. C5L2 expression and its regulation are investigated on various cell lines by a novel C5L2-restricted binding assay and quantitative real time PCR. Dibutyryl cAMP and interferon-γ induce up-regulation of this receptor on myeloblastic cell lines (U937 and HL-60), whereas tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has no effect. In contrast, epithelial HeLa cells are found to constitutively express C5L2 but not the C5a receptor. In HeLa cells, interferon-γ and TNF-α drastically reduce C5L2 expression. No C5a-dependent Ca2+ signaling is observed even in these cells endogenously expressing C5L2. Taken together, C5L2 is not a receptor for C3a or C3a-des-Arg77. Thus, this receptor is unlikely to be directly involved in lipid metabolism. Instead, the identification of stimuli modifying C5L2 expression indicates that C5L2 is a highly regulated scavenger receptor for C5a and C5a-des-Arg74. During complement activation the pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are generated, which interact with the C3a receptor and C5a receptor (CD88), respectively.

Instead, the identification of stimuli modifying C5L2 expression indicates that C5L2 is a highly regulated scavenger receptor for C5a and C5a-des-Arg74. Activation of the complement system leads to the release of the anaphylatoxic peptides C5a 3The abbreviations used are: C5a, complement split product of C3, anaphylatoxin; ASP, acylation-stimulating protein; C3a, complement split product of C3, anaphylatoxin; C3a-des-Arg77 (ASP), des-arginated form of C3a; C3aR, C3a receptor; C5aR, C5a receptor; C5L2, C5a receptor-like 2; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; IL, interleukin. and C3a. These anaphylatoxins play an important role during inflammation, e.g. by acting as chemoattractants for neutrophils and other immune cells and by increasing vascular permeability. The C5a receptor (C5aR, CD88) and the C3a receptor (C3aR) are members of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. They are broadly expressed in different tissues throughout the body. C5a and C3a are rapidly inactivated by serum carboxypeptidase N-catalyzed cleavage of their terminal Arg residue. Although C5a-des-Arg74 retains ∼10% of its biological activity and still weakly binds to C5aR, C3a-des-Arg77 loses its affinity for C3aR (1Ember J.A. Jagels M. Hugli T. Volanakis J. Frank M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 241-284Google Scholar). Besides being a remnant of complement action in response to foreign material, C3a-des-Arg77 is also proposed to play an important role in glucose uptake and fat storage in adipose tissue and is therefore also called acylation-stimulating protein (ASP) (2Cianflone K. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In human skin fibroblasts, C3a-des-Arg77 mediates protein kinase C activation that triggers diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity (3Baldo A. Sniderman A.D. St. Luce S. Zhang X.J. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, C3a-des-Arg77 promotes translocation of glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, leading to a higher rate of glucose influx into the cells (4Tao Y. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. Colby-Germinario S.P. Germinario R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, adipose tissue serves as producer of complement factor C3, factor B and D (5White R.T. Damm D. Hancock N. Rosen B.S. Lowell B.B. Usher P. Flier J.S. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9210-9213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Choy L.N. Rosen B.S. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12736-12741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro experiments demonstrated enhanced levels of C3a-des-Arg77 in the supernatant of adipocytes stimulated with insulin or chylomicrons (7Maslowska M. Scantlebury T. Germinario R. Cianflone K. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of C3a-des-Arg77 formation in adipose tissue is not known. C5L2 is the third member of the anaphylatoxin receptor family sharing 58% identity to C5aR and 55% identity to C3aR in the transmembrane domains (8Lee D.K. George S.R. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Liu Y. Brown M. Lynch K.R. O'Dowd B.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Northern blot data suggest that C5L2 is coexpressed with C5aR on various cells and tissues, such as neutrophils/macrophages, mast cells, immature dendritic cells, as well as in the brain, lung, heart, kidney, liver, ovary, or testis (8Lee D.K.

However, other data concerning C5L2 expression on neutrophils are conflicting (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Otto M. Hawlisch H. Monk P.N. Muller M. Klos A. Karp C.L. Kohl J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 142-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). C5L2 binds C5a with nearly the same affinity as the C5aR and C5a-des-Arg74 with a 20-fold higher affinity compared with C5aR (13Cain S.A. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7165-7169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). C5L2 couples only weakly to G-proteins because of the lack of key sequence motifs for interaction of heptahelical receptors with the corresponding G-proteins. For example, the DRY (DRF in CD88) motif is DLC in C5L2, and the mutation of this sequence to DRC can partially restore signaling ability (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with wild-type C5L2, no increase in cytosolic calcium levels or activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway could be observed, and C5L2-transfected RBL cells failed to degranulate upon stimulation with C5a, C3a, or C5a-des-Arg74 (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Cain S.A. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7165-7169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). C5L2–/– mice show increased influx of neutrophils into the lung and higher levels of TNF-α and IL-6 when compared with wild-type mice in a model of pulmonary immune complex injury (14Gerard N.P. Lu B. Liu P. Craig S. Fujiwara Y. Okinaga S. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39677-39680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that C5L2 serves as a nonsignaling decoy receptor for C5a with a negative modulatory influence on C5aR-mediated inflammation. However, C5L2 is also thought to be the specific receptor for C3a-des-Arg77 (ASP) and C3a, mediating their effects on lipid metabolism and glucose uptake in adipocytes and skin fibroblasts (15Kalant D. Maclaren R. Cui W. Samanta R. Monk P.N. Laporte S.A. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Kalant D. Cain S.A.

C5L2 might therefore play an important role in obesity and related diseases. However, ligand specificity of C5L2 remains a controversial issue. On the one hand, C5L2 was reported to bind solely C5a and C5a-des-Arg74 and no other anaphylatoxic peptide (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). On the other hand, binding of C3a, C3a-des-Arg77 (ASP), and even C4a has been reported (16Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11123-11129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Anaphylatoxin-induced internalization of C5L2 is disputed as well; β-arrestin-mediated internalization in transfected HEK293 cells was observed not only after binding of C5a but also of C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 (15Kalant D. Maclaren R. Cui W. Samanta R. Monk P.N. Laporte S.A. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conversely, other authors did not find C5L2 internalized after ligand binding (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Cain S.A. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7165-7169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Regulation of C5L2 as decoy receptor could help to fine-tune the C5a-mediated inflammatory response. C5L2 is known to be regulated during sepsis in mice, rats, and humans. It is up-regulated in lung, liver, and heart but not in kidneys of mice in a cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis (17Gao H. Neff T.A. Guo R.F. Speyer C.L. Sarma J.V. Tomlins S. Man Y.

However, results differ among different publications (12Huber-Lang M. Sarma J.V. Rittirsch D. Schreiber H. Weiss M. Flierl M. Younkin E. Schneider M. Suger-Wiedeck H. Gebhard F. McClintock S.D.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1003-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for C5L2 up- or down-regulation in neutrophils from cecal ligation and puncture rats. In human patients C5L2 is transiently down-regulated in neutrophils during sepsis (12Huber-Lang M. Sarma J.V. Rittirsch D. Schreiber H. Weiss M. Flierl M. Younkin E. Schneider M. Suger-Wiedeck H. Gebhard F. McClintock S.D. Neff T. Zetoune F. Bruckner U. Guo R.F. Monk P.N. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Apart from sepsis, nothing is known about the regulation of C5L2, and no regulating factors have been described so far. Therefore, in this study we wanted to clarify whether C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 (ASP) bind specifically to C5L2 or not, and whether this ligand/receptor system can be directly involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. An additional objective was to identify C5L2-expressing cells and stimuli that regulate C5L2 expression in naturally expressing cell types. Recombinant human IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and IL-6 was from Tebu-Bio (Offenbach, Germany). All other materials were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum; human myeloblastic HL-60 and U937 cells in RPMI 1640 were cultured with 10% fetal calf serum; human epithelial (cervix carcinoma) HeLa cells (kindly provided by R. Heilbronn, Berlin, Germany) were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal calf serum. The rat basophilic leukocyte cell line RBL-2H3 (CRL 1593; ATCC, Manassas, VA; a gift from Dr. M. Oppermann, Göttingen, Germany) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum; RBL cells stably transduced with C3aR or C5L2 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 800 μg/ml G-418. All media, fetal calf serum, and additives and G-418 were purchased from PAA (Pasching, Austria). Subcloning of C5L2 and C3aR and Stable Transduction of RBL and HEK Cells—RBL cells and HEK cells were stably transduced with human C3a receptor and C5L2 using a retroviral gene transfer system (RetroX®, Clontech). Human C3a receptor was subcloned into pQCXIN® (Clontech) from genomic DNA using the sense primer 5′-AAAAAGCGGCCGCgccaccatggcgtctttctctgc-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AAAAAGGATCCtcacacagttgtactatttc-3′. The added NotI and BamHI are shown in italics, and the Kozak sequence is underlined. Human C5L2 was subcloned from genomic DNA using the sense primer 5′-AAAAAGGATCCgccaccatggggaacgattctgtc-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AAAAAGAATTCctacacctccatctccg-3′. The added BamHI and EcoRI are shown in italics, and the Kozak sequence is underlined. The constructs were subcloned using NotI and BamHI restriction sites for C3aR or BamHI and EcoRI sites for C5L2. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. RBL cells were transduced according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech) and selected with 800 μg/ml G-418. Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK cells were transiently transfected with pEE6-HCMV.neo-C5L2 (13Cain S.A. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7165-7169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Preparation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from cell culture using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of total RNA was used for transcription with SuperScript II RNaseH– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). C5L2 Real Time PCR—TaqMan real time PCR was performed using a C5L2-specific TaqMan gene expression assay (hC5L2_s3) in combination with the TaqMan universal PCR master mix and the 7000 sequence detection system for analysis (all from Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). For normalization, the housekeeping gene 18S-rRNA (gene expression assay Hs99999901_s1) was used. Standard curves were generated using serially diluted cDNA. Competitive 125I-Labeled Ligand Binding Assays—Binding assays were carried out in HAG-CM (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25% BSA, 0.5 mm glucose) in a total volume of 50 μl per well of a microtiter plate (Greiner, Essen, Germany). Tracer concentrations of 125I-labeled anaphylatoxins (0.12 nm for 125I-C3a and 125I-C3a-des-Arg77 or 0.1 nm for 125I-C5a, respectively) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of nonlabeled anaphylatoxins (Calbiochem) and 3 × 105 stably transfected RBL cells or 1.5 × 105 transiently transfected HEK293 cells per well or (because of extremely high receptor expression) 6.25 × 103 of stably transfected HEK293 cells per well, respectively. 40 μl of the mixture was filtered using Multiscreen-HTS™ filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and washed twice with 100 μl of HAG-CM. The filter plates were dried, and 50 μl of MicroScint O (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per well were added. Bound radioactivity was determined using a TopCount NXT (Canberra-Packard, Dreieich, Germany). For 125I-C3a- and 125I-C3a-des-Arg77-binding assays, the filter plates were pretreated with 2% protamine sulfate overnight at 4 °C and extensively washed with HAG-CM before use. For selective detection of C5L2, the cells were preincubated with the C5aR inhibitor AcF[OPdChaWR] for 10 min at room temperature prior to adding the cells to the mixture of labeled and nonlabeled ligand leading to a final concentration of 1 μm of the antagonist in the reaction mixture. 125I-C3a and 125I-C5a were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 125I-C3a-des-Arg77 was generated by treatment of 125I-C3a with 0.6 units of carboxypeptidase B (Calbiochem) per pmol for 20 min at 37 °C in 130 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2 followed by heat inactivation of the enzyme at 70 °C for 10 min. Specificity of the carboxypeptidase was proved by inhibition of the des-argination reaction of nonlabeled C3a with Plummers inhibitor (dl-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanic acid; Calbiochem). Heating C3a or 125I-C3a to 70 °C for 10 min did not affect activity of the ligands as tested by binding assays. At least three independent binding studies were performed for each cell line and receptor. The number of binding sites per cell and the affinity were determined by iterative curve fitting using Ligand (Kell) software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Transiently transfected HEK293 cells showed high expression levels of the C5L2 receptor in the range of 3.3–5 × 105 C5L2 receptors per cell and a Kd of 0.1–0.3 nm. C3aR expression was in the range of 2.5–5 × 105 receptors per cell with a Kd of 0.7–1.0 nm. On transduced HEK293 cells (HEK-C5L2, HEK-C5aR, and HEK-C3aR), 1.2–2.8 × 106 C5L2, C5aR, or C3aR per cell was found with a Kd of 1–2 nm for C5L2, 2–6 nm for C5aR, and 3–6 nm for C3aR. Fluorescence Labeling of Anaphylatoxins and Flow Cytometry—C3a, C3a-des-Arg77, and C5a were fluorescently labeled using MFP488 N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) in 160 mm NaHCO3 for 1 h at 20 °C. Excess of free MFP488 N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester was eliminated using Centri-Spin 10 columns (EMP Biotech, Berlin, Germany). Mass spectrometry indicated 1–4 labels per molecule of anaphylatoxin. For binding assays 5 × 105 cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a final volume of 25 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25% BSA, 0.5 mm glucose) with 50 nm of fluorescently labeled anaphylatoxin. Specificity of binding was determined using 20-fold excess of unlabeled anaphylatoxin. Cells were then washed twice in 150 μl of ice-cold buffer and centrifuged at 500 × g. Cells were then fixed using Cellfix (BD Biosciences), and flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fura2 Assay for Determination of Free Cytosolic Ca2+—Cells were loaded with 10 μm Fura2-AM (Calbiochem) in the presence of 0.2% Pluronic F-127 at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in HBSS (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.5% BSA) for 30 min at 37 °C and then diluted 1:10 with HBSS and again incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with HBSS and resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Measurements of [Ca2+]i were carried out in the luminescence spectrometer LS 50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C in a total volume of 500 μl. Therefore, the Fura2-AM-loaded cells were diluted 1:10 in HBSS and 25 μl of stimuli were added after recording of the base line. For C5L2-restricted measurements, the cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with AcF[OPdChaWR] at a final concentration of 10 μm. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). C5L2 Is Neither a High nor a Low Affinity Receptor for C3a or C3a-des-Arg77—C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 (ASP) are known to stimulate triglyceride synthesis and glucose uptake in adipocytes and skin fibroblasts. C5L2 is proposed to be the functional receptor for these mediators. This claim has been primarily based on binding studies performed with transfected RBL cells (16Kalant D. Cain S.A. Maslowska M. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Monk P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11123-11129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Functional responses, phosphorylation, and internalization were observed in transfected HEK293 cells after stimulation with C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 (15Kalant D. Maclaren R. Cui W. Samanta R. Monk P.N. Laporte S.A. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the binding of C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 (ASP) to C5L2 is still a controversial matter. To clarify this discrepancy, competitive 125I-ligand binding assays as well as flow cytometry using fluorescently labeled ligands were performed. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected expressing either C5L2, C5aR, or C3aR. In accordance with Okinaga et al. (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), no specific binding of 125I-C3a or 125I-C3a-des-Arg77 to C5L2 could be observed in C5L2-transfected HEK cells. Specific binding of C5a demonstrated that high expression levels of this anaphylatoxin receptor had been achieved (Fig. 1, left panel). 125I-C3a-des-Arg77 was generated by carboxypeptidase B treatment of 125I-labeled C3a. The integrity of the 125I-C3a was demonstrated by its specific binding to C3aR-transfected cells (Fig. 1, upper right panel). The complete des-argination by carboxypeptidase B treatment was confirmed in the same binding study, as C3a-des-Arg77 generated did not bind to the C3aR (Fig. 1, upper right panel). No binding of 125I-labeled C3a, C3a-des-Arg77, or C5a occurred in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1, lower right panel). Additionally, RBL cells expressing C5L2, C5aR, or C3aR were generated using a retroviral gene transfer and expression system. The transduced RBL cells showed exactly the same binding pattern of 125I-C3a and 125I-C3a-des-Arg77 (data not shown) as described for transiently transfected HEK293 cells, indicating that the lack of binding of these ligands to C5L2 was independent of the cell line used. Taken together, these data exclude high affinity binding of C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 to C5L2 in HEK293 cells or RBL cells. However, a low affinity interaction with these ligands could not be excluded using competitive binding assays because the 125I-labeled ligands must be applied in tracer amounts (∼0.1 nm) for this type of assay. To investigate whether C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 bind to C5L2 with low or intermediate affinity, flow cytometry using 50 nm of fluorescently labeled C3a, C3a-des-Arg77, and C5a was performed (Fig. 2). For this purpose, HEK293 cells highly expressing C5L2, C5aR, or C3aR were generated (HEK-C5L2, HEK-C5aR, and HEK-C3aR) using the above-mentioned retroviral gene transfer and expression system. Exposure of transduced HEK-C5L2 to MFP488-labeled C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 did not lead to any shift of fluorescence intensity compared with the buffer control (Fig. 2a) or to mock-transduced cells (Fig. 2d). Expression of C5L2 and the functionality of labeled C5a were demonstrated by the shift of MFP488 intensity in the corresponding experiment compared with the buffer control (Fig. 2b). Addition of the MFP488-labeled C5a with a 20-fold excess of nonlabeled C5a drastically decreased fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2b, arrow), indicating that receptor-specific binding was being measured. Functionality of MFP488-labeled C3a was proven in a similar experiment on HEK-C3aR (Fig. 2c). No binding of the labeled ligands occurred to mock-transduced HEK cells (Fig. 2d). Mass spectrometry was applied to verify the integrity of native C3a-des-Arg77 as well as of the MFP488-labeled C3a-des-Arg77, the ligands being used in the competitive binding studies and flow cytometric experiments. As expected, the mass of MFP488-labeled and nonlabeled C3a-des-Arg77 differed from the corresponding form of C3a only by the mass of the enzymatically removed amino acid arginine. Notably, no degradation products of C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 were detectable (data not shown). Taken together, flow cytometric analysis with fluorescently labeled ligands confirmed the results of the competitive 125I-ligand binding assays and additionally excluded a low affinity interaction of C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 with C5L2. Nonreceptor Binding of C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 as a Possible Reason for Controversial Results among Previous Reports—Our preliminary binding assays with 125I-labeled C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 suggested an explanation for previous reports of binding to C5L2. There was a remarkably high level of binding of these ligands to the filter membranes/plastics used in binding assays even after pretreatment of the filter membranes with 0.25% BSA solution. This binding was highly suggestive of a specific receptor-ligand interaction and was not shown by 125I-C5a (Fig. 1). In contrast, 125I-labeled C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 bound at very high levels in binding assays even in the absence of any cells. More important, this binding to filter membranes could be competed with nonlabeled C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 with an IC50 of ∼25 nm (Fig. 3). To overcome this critical and potentially misleading technical problem, we pretreated the filters in all our 125I-C3a and 125I-C3a-des-Arg77 binding assays with the cationic agent protamine sulfate (Figs. 1 and 3). 4It should be noted that other ligand binding assay protocols for the characterization of the C3a receptor applying sucrose gradient centrifugation instead of filter membranes are not prone to this phenomenon (19Burg M. Martin U. Bock D. Rheinheimer C. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Klos A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5574-5581PubMed Google Scholar, 20Martin U. Bock D. Arseniev L. Tornetta M.A. Ames R.S. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Ganser A. Klos A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Hence, this unusual and apparently specific binding to filter membranes/plastics might be one explanation for the controversial findings in previous studies. However, it should be noted that binding of C3a-des-Arg77 to filter membranes instead of cells might explain only divergent results of ligand binding assays. Kalant et al. (15Kalant D. Maclaren R. Cui W. Samanta R. Monk P.N. Laporte S.A. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that addition of C3a-des-Arg77 to C5L2-transfected HEK293 cells increased glucose uptake and triglyceride production. In adipocytes, triglyceride synthesis correlated with surface expression of C5L2 in knockdown experiments using small interfering RNA. Moreover, β-arrestin recruitment and internalization could be visualized in these cells after stimulation with C3a, C3a-des-Arg77, C5a, and C5a-des-Arg74. However, these functional data do not prove at all a direct interaction of C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 with C5L2. Consequently, it is feasible that C5L2 might be indirectly involved in mediating functions of these complement fragments. Additionally, one has to address the question of the conditions in which C3a-des-Arg77/ASP has been shown to influence lipid metabolism. The functional assays (15Kalant D. Maclaren R. Cui W. Samanta R. Monk P.N. Laporte S.A. Cianflone K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) were performed using relatively high concentrations of C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 in the range of 1 μm and above. This would only be achieved by a cleavage of ∼20% of serum C3. It is unlikely that such a degree of complement activation would occur in peripheral blood under physiological conditions. However, it is feasible to assume that lipid metabolism is influenced by C3a-des-Arg77 in pathophysiological situations with a high degree of complement activation, i.e. in diseases like sepsis. Additionally, such high concentrations of this stimulus might also be found locally in the adipose tissue, e.g. if bacteria are present. On the other hand, several enzymes such as secreted procathepsin-L (21Frade R. Rodrigues-Lima F. Huang S. Xie K. Guillaume N. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2733-2736PubMed Google Scholar), thrombin (22Huber-Lang M. Sarma J.V. Zetoune F.S. Rittirsch D. Neff T.A. McGuire S.R. Lambris J.D. Warner R.L. Flierl M.A. Hoesel L.M.

Similar inflammation-independent mechanisms might lead to a local increase of C3a-des-Arg77 in adipose tissue. Design of a Novel C5L2-restricted Competitive 125I-C5a Binding Assay—To easily detect and quantify C5L2 expression on target cells, a modified competitive 125I-C5a binding assay was designed that restricted specific C5a binding to C5L2. To discriminate C5L2 from C5aR, the binding assay was carried out in the presence of the C5aR-specific cyclic antagonist AcF[OPdChaWR]. 1 μm of the antagonist was sufficient to completely prevent binding of 125I-C5a to transiently C5aR-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4, left panel), but even 10 μm of the antagonist had no effect on C5a binding to C5L2-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4, right panel). To prove the specificity of the antagonist, a structurally related cyclic peptide in which alanine replaces tryptophan (AcF[OPdChaAR]) was applied in the same concentrations and caused no inhibition of 125I-C5a binding to the C5aR (data not shown). This binding assay was used to determine C5L2 expression on various cell lines. Detection of C5L2 and Its Regulation on Myeloid and Epithelial Cell Lines—C5L2 is apparently broadly expressed, but no cell lines have been shown to express this receptor at high levels, and only few data are available on its regulation. Applying the C5L2-restricted 125I-C5a binding assay, various cell lines were screened for the expression of this receptor before and after treatment with different stimuli. Both C3aR and C5aR are known to be up-regulated in myeloblastic cell lines after induction with Bt2cAMP or IFN-γ, respectively (19Burg M. Martin U. Bock D. Rheinheimer C. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Klos A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5574-5581PubMed Google Scholar, 26Burg M. Martin U. Rheinheimer C. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Bottger E.C. Klos A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4419-4426PubMed Google Scholar). Here we wanted to analyze whether C5L2 is also regulated in these cells. Native U937 and HL-60 cells expressed undetectable levels of C5L2 or C5aR, but both receptors were up-regulated after 3 days of treatment with Bt2cAMP, as determined by competitive 125I-C5a binding in the absence of any C5aR inhibitor (not depicted) and C5L2-restricted competitive 125I-C5a binding in the presence of the antagonist (HL-60 cells, Kd = 0.5–0.8 nm, 2–2.8 × 104 C5L2 receptors per cell, n = 3; U937 cells, Kd = 0.6–0.8 nm, 0.4–1.4 × 104 C5L2 receptors per cell, n = 3) (Fig. 5, left panels). However, C5aR is more strongly expressed than C5L2 (∼5-fold in U937 and ∼9-fold in HL-60 cells; data not shown) (19Burg M. Martin U. Bock D. Rheinheimer C. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Klos A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5574-5581PubMed Google Scholar). In U937 but not in HL-60 cells, a slight increase in C5L2-specific 125I-C5a binding could be observed after IFN-γ treatment. TaqMan real time PCR revealed that C5L2 transcription was induced by more than 100-fold by Bt2cAMP (1 mm for 3 days) in HL-60 cells. IFN-γ (1,000 units/ml for 3 days) had only a slight effect, and TNF-α (20 ng/ml for 3 days) had no effect on C5L2 transcription in these cells (Fig. 5, right upper panel). Induction of U937 cells with Bt2cAMP also led to a drastic increase in C5L2 mRNA (∼40-fold). In contrast, IFN-γ and TNF-α caused only a small or no elevation in C5L2 mRNA (∼10-fold) in this cell line (Fig. 5, right lower panel). Epithelial HeLa cells showed specific binding of 125I-C5a indicating constitutive expression of C5aR and/or C5L2. No difference in binding was observed in the presence or absence of 1 μm AcF[OPdChaWR], indicating that only C5L2 but not C5aR is expressed on these cells (Kd = 0.2–0.3 nm, 9–11 × 103 C5L2 per cell, n = 3) (Fig. 6). C5L2 expression levels in HeLa cells decreased drastically during a 3-day period of treatment with either 1,000 units/ml IFN-γ or 20 ng/ml TNF-α as assessed by C5L2-restricted 125I-C5a binding (Fig. 6, lower panel). In contrast, Bt2cAMP, IL-1β, and IL-6 did not alter C5L2 expression in these cells (data not shown). TaqMan real time PCR confirmed a higher receptor mRNA level in native HeLa cells compared with various other cell lines. The amount of C5L2 mRNA (normalized in relation to 18 S rRNA) was >20-fold higher than that of MRC5 lung fibroblasts, A549 lung carcinoma cells, LoVo colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, or SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells and nonstimulated HL-60 or U937 cells (data not shown). The fact that C5L2 is expressed in the absence of C5aR indicates that the mode of regulation of these two anaphylatoxin receptors differs at least partially. It is tempting to speculate that the observed expression of C5L2 in epithelial HeLa cells might indicate a role of this receptor in epithelial cells. However, in preliminary experiments on human keratinocytes from healthy donors, no C5L2-restricted C5a binding could be observed (data not shown). Further studies of cells with different epithelial origin, including mucosa, are needed to address this hypothesis. Cells Endogenously Expressing C5L2 Do Not Respond through This Receptor in the Fura2 Assay—Much effort has been spent on the investigation of potential intracellular signaling through C5L2. In C5L2-transfected cells, Okinaga et al. (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9406-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) could neither observe any calcium flux nor an activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway after addition of C5a. Additionally, after binding of C5a, C5L2 shows only a basal level of phosphorylation, and its internalization is disputed. In this study we wanted to investigate whether this anaphylatoxin receptor couples to intracellular calcium signaling in cells endogenously expressing C5L2. Therefore, Fura2-AM assays were performed using Bt2cAMP-differentiated HL-60 and U937 cells because they express C5L2 and show calcium signaling after stimulation with C5a or C3a. To discriminate effects of C5aR, which is also up-regulated (and even much stronger), cells were preincubated for 10 min with 10 μm AcF[OPdChaWR] prior to the addition of C5a. Differentiated myeloblastic HL-60 and U937 cells did not show increased intracellular calcium concentrations after C5L2 restricted C5a binding (2 nm) (Fig. 7). Additionally, Fura2-AM assays were carried out using epithelial HeLa cells. After stimulation with up to 100 nm C5a, no increase in cytosolic calcium could be observed in the absence or presence of the C5a receptor inhibitor (data not shown). Taken together, our observations support the hypothesis that C5L2 is a scavenger receptor for C5a and C5a-des-Arg74, which does not couple to G-proteins, even in cells endogenously expressing C5L2. C5L2 does not bind C3a or C3a-des-Arg77/ASP, as demonstrated in the same cell lines (HEK and RBL) that were used previously to demonstrate binding or functional responses (15Kalant D. Maclaren R.

These results confirm observations of Okinaga et al. (10Okinaga S. Slattery D. Humbles A. Zsengeller Z. Morteau O. Kinrade M.B. Brodbeck R.M. Krause J.E. Choe H.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39677-39680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which indicate strongly that C5L2 is a decoy receptor for C5a and C5a-des-Arg74 but not a receptor for C3a. Previous reports on the specific binding of C3a and C3a-des-Arg77 to C5L2-expressing cells might have been misled by the apparently specific binding of these ligands to plastic surfaces and/or filter membranes. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that C3a-des-Arg77 can affect lipid metabolism if applied in a relatively high concentration and that C5L2 might influence this process indirectly. Additional studies will define the role of C5L2 in this context. Further investigation is also needed to clarify whether high amounts of C3a or C3a-des-Arg77 can be found in adipose tissue and to elucidate putative new mechanisms that locally produce these complement split products independent of inflammation. We thank the head of the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical School Hanover, Prof. Suerbaum, for his support."
https://openalex.org/W1984298794,"CEACAM1 (also known as CD66a) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates homophilic intercellular interactions that influence cellular growth, immune cell activation, and tissue morphogenesis. Various studies have suggested a link between CEACAM1 and cellular apoptosis, including a recent demonstration that ERK1/2 signaling is triggered downstream of CEACAM1. In this study, we reveal that CEACAM1-long binding confers survival signals to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CEACAM-specific antibodies effectively protected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from apoptosis, with this effect being particularly dramatic for primary monocytes that undergo spontaneous apoptosis during in vitro culture. This protective effect was reiterated when using soluble CEACAM1, which binds to cell-surface CEACAM1 via homophilic interactions. Monocyte survival correlated with a CEACAM1-dependent up-regulation of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis Bcl-2 and the abrogation of caspase-3 activation. CEACAM1 binding triggered a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of the protein kinase Akt without influencing the activity of extracellular signal-related kinase ERK, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-specific inhibitor LY294002 effectively blocked the protective effect of CEACAM1. Together, this work indicates that CEACAM1 confers a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and Akt-dependent survival signal that inhibits mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis of monocytes. By controlling both ERK/MEK and PI3K/Akt pathways, CEACAM1 functions as a key regulator of contact-dependent control of cell survival, differentiation, and growth.

The carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM1; also known as CD66a and the biliary glycoprotein) is a highly abundant and broadly expressed glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It consists of a single Ig variable domain-like amino terminus, from one to three Ig constant domain-like regions, and a single membrane-spanning segment followed by either a short (CEACAM1-S) or long (CEACAM1-L) cytoplasmic domain. The amino-terminal domain facilitates homophilic (CEACAM1-CEACAM1) intercellular binding that influences a broad spectrum of cellular processes related to cellular activation and/or cell cycle progression (reviewed in Ref. 1Hammarstrom S.

Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 35: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).CEACAM1 is expressed on a myriad of cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. In immune cells, CEACAM1 influences cellular responses to various stimuli. For example, CEACAM1 binding amplifies proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion in response to B cell receptor ligation without increasing their differentiation into plasma cells or immunoglobulin class switching (6Greicius G. Severinson E. Beauchemin N. Obrink B. Singer B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In T lymphocytes, cellular activation leads to increased CEACAM1 expression at the cell surface, both through the rapid mobilization of intracellular receptor stores and de novo protein synthesis (7Kammerer R. Hahn S. Singer B.B. Luo J.S. von Kleist S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3664-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Nakajima A. Iijima H. Neurath M.F. Nagaishi T. Nieuwenhuis E.E.

Immun. 2002; 3: 229-236Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although CEACAM1-specific antibodies may stimulate T cells under certain conditions (7Kammerer R. Hahn S. Singer B.B. Luo J.S. von Kleist S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3664-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), CEACAM1 binding generally inhibits T cell responses. For example, in vitro studies have revealed that CEACAM1-specific antibodies reduce proliferation, expression of activation markers, and cytotoxic function in response to various stimuli (9Boulton I.C. Gray-Owen S.D. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 229-236Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Morales V.M. Christ A. Watt S.M. Kim H.S. Johnson K.W. Utku N. Texieira A.M. Mizoguchi A. Mizoguchi E. Russell G.J.

Remarkably, CEACAM1 binding by the N. gonorrhoeae Opa proteins also inhibits T cell activation, providing this pathogen with an effective strategy by which to avoid the development of specific immunity (9Boulton I.C. Gray-Owen S.D. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 229-236Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Recent evidence suggests that the effect of CEACAM1 on immune cell function depends upon the isoform expressed. Differential splicing of CEACAM1 transcript generates either a long (73 amino acids) cytoplasmic domain-containing CEACAM1-L, which contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) 3The abbreviations used are: ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; Ab, antibody; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; FSC, forward scatter; SSC, side scatter; CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen. 3The abbreviations used are: ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; Ab, antibody; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; FSC, forward scatter; SSC, side scatter; CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen. that inhibit cellular growth and activation (12Kunath T.

Turbide C. Houde C. Kunath T. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of CEACAM1-L in lymphocytes involves SHP-1 phosphatase recruitment to the phosphorylated ITIM (9Boulton I.C. Gray-Owen S.D. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 229-236Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Chen D. Iijima H. Nagaishi T. Nakajima A. Russell S. Raychowdhury R. Morales V. Rudd C.E. Utku N. Blumberg R.S. J.

The cellular response to binding thus depends upon the relative level of splice variants expressed. In fact, the demonstration that the ratio of CEACAM1-L versus CEACAM1-S isoforms expressed changes from 1:1 to 3:1 upon B cell activation (6Greicius G. Severinson E. Beauchemin N. Obrink B. Singer B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggests an increasing potency of the inhibitory signals of the receptor upon B cell activation.CEACAM1 has been demonstrated to influence apoptosis by epithelial cells. During normal mammary alveolar morphogenesis in extracellular matrix-containing Matrigel, CEACAM1-blocking antibodies inhibit the apoptotic death of cells within the forming acini, thereby preventing normal lumen formation (16Huang J. Hardy J.D. Sun Y. Shively J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isoform of CEACAM1 expressed can dramatically affect this process, as CEACAM1-S is required for normal acinar formation, whereas CEACAM1-L blocks it (16Huang J. Hardy J.D. Sun Y. Shively J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4193-4205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kirshner J. Chen C.J. Liu P. Huang J. Shively J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interesting in this regard, the CEACAM1-L cytoplasmic domain is cleaved by pro-apoptotic caspase-3 to liberate a truncated derivative that lacks the tyrosine-containing ITIMs and resembles CEACAM1-S (18Houde C. Roy S. Leung N. Nicholson D.W. Beauchemin N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16929-16935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This makes it tempting to speculate that, in contrast to CEACAM1-S, signals emanating from the CEACAM1-L cytoplasmic domain oppose the apoptotic process. Indeed, Singer et al. (19Singer B.B. Klaile E. Scheffrahn I. Muller M.M. Kammerer R. Reutter W. Obrink B. Lucka L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1949-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that CEACAM1 binding affects survival of rat neutrophils by triggering ERK kinase-dependent signals.Here, we establish that CEACAM1 binding confers potent protection of primary human monocytes from apoptosis via a process that involves a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- and Akt-dependent induction of Bcl-2 expression that prevents the activation of caspase-3. Together with previous work, this reveals a central role for CEACAM1 in sensing intercellular contact to regulate survival, cell cycle progression, and cellular differentiation through the distinct but interacting ERK/MEK and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) D14HD11 (IgG1, cross-specific for human CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6) and 9A6 (specific for human CEACAM6) were kind gifts of Dr. F. Grunert (University of Freiburg, Germany). Col-1 (cross-specific for human CEACAM3 and CEACAM5) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The murine MOPC-21 IgG1 mAb, used as an isotype control throughout this study, was purchased from Sigma. Unless otherwise indicated, anti-human mAbs or polyclonal Abs conjugated with fluorochrome were purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-Akt antibody, anti-phospho-Akt antibody, Akt and phosphorylated Akt control cell extracts, anti-MEK1/2 antibody, anti-phospho-MEK1/2 antibody, MEK1/2, and phosphorylated MEK1/2 control cell extracts were from Cell Signaling Technology (Pickering, Ontario, Canada). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitor LY294002 and mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase-specific inhibitor PD98059 were from Sigma and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) before use. Soluble CEA (CEACAM5) isolated from a liver metastasis of human colon carcinoma was purchased from Fitzgerald Industries International (Concord, MA). Recombinant CEACAM1-Fc protein, consisting of the extracellular domains of CEACAM1 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1, was purified from transiently transfected COS-7 cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (20Markel G. Wolf D. Hanna J. Gazit R. Goldman-Wohl D. Lavy Y. Yagel S. Mandelboim O. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Fas ligand is a recombinant protein containing an extracellular domain of human Fas ligand (amino acids 103–281) fused at the amino terminus to a linker peptide (26 amino acids) and a FLAG tag (Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA).Cell Preparations—Heparinized human blood was obtained from healthy blood donors, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) and then frozen at –152 °C until use. CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells were separated from PBMCs by single cell sorting in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Monocytes were separated from the PBMCs using multistep Percoll (Sigma) gradient centrifugation and then purified by depletion of contaminating B cells, T cells, NK cells, and granulocytes using antibody-conjugated magnetic beads in the monocyte negative isolation kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The resulting cell preparations contained more than 95% monocytes and virtually no residual T and B lymphocytes, as assessed by CD14, CD4, CD8, and CD19 staining and flow cytometric analysis. C1R B cell lines were the kind gifts of Dr. K. S. MacDonald (University of Toronto). Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cell lines were established from the PBMCs of healthy blood donors (21Ostrowski M.A. Justement S.J. Ehler L. Mizell S.B. Lui S. Mican J. Walker B.D. Thomas E.K. Seder R. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6133-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Procedures involving isolation and handling of primary blood cells have been approved by the University of Toronto Ethics Review Unit.Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) after staining by standard methods, and all data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., San Carlos, CA). Forward and sideward scatter characteristics were used to localize monocyte and lymphocyte populations, with confirmation that gates contained these cell types by staining with CD14+ (expressed by monocytes) and CD3+ (a T cell marker), respectively. For intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus kit (Pharmingen). Intracellular staining was performed using FITC- and PE-conjugated antibodies specific for active human caspase-3 or Bcl-2, respectively. Control staining with an irrelevant isotype-matched Ab was performed during every FACS analysis. To analyze the surface expression of CEACAM1 on PBMCs, the cell suspension was first stained with mAb D14HD11 or a nonspecific isotype control as primary Ab, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG1APC, and then stained with anti-human CD3PerCP, CD4PE, CD8FITC, CD14FITC, or CD19FITC as indicated. HeLa cell lines transfected with either a human CEACAM1 cDNA-encoding plasmid or the empty pRC/cytomegalovirus expression vector were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.Cell Survival Analysis and Inhibitor Treatment—Duplicate or triplicate wells containing 0.1 × 106 PBMCs or isolated monocytes were cultured for 48 h in flat-bottomed 96-well plates in complete RPMI 1640 medium (containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, and antibiotics) with or without mAb D14HD11 or an isotype-matched control mAb at the indicated concentrations. Where indicated for antibody immobilization, 10 μg/ml mAb or isotype-matched control antibody in plain RPMI 1640 medium was adsorbed to the wells of a flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plate by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h and then washed three times with plain RPMI 1640 immediately before use. Apoptotic cell death and cellular apoptosis were determined by staining with annexin-VFITC and PI from the annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Apoptosis was also monitored by measuring active intracellular caspase-3. When PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the mitogen-activated protein/ERK inhibitor PD98059 was used, cells were preincubated with these inhibitors or the same dilutions of the dimethyl sulfoxide solvent for 30 min prior to the addition of mAb D14HD11 or isotype control.Western Blot Analysis—Monocytes (5–10 × 106 cells) were incubated with medium alone, 1 μg/ml mAb D14HD11, 1 μg/ml isotype-matched control mAb, or 10 μg/ml LPS and then harvested at the indicated time points. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to their resuspension in 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Pickering, Ontario, Canada) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C on an orbital shaker and then centrifuged to pellet the cellular debris. The protein-containing supernatant was stored at –80 °C until use. Equal amounts (15 μl per lane) of the protein-containing supernatants were mixed with 5 μl of 4× NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), boiled for 5 min, subjected to NuPAGE Novex high performance gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen), and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.6)) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibody specific for phosphorylated Akt versus total Akt, or phosphorylated ERK versus total ERK. These were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and visualized using the ECL detection system (Pierce).RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the indicated cells or cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA yield was quantified photometrically, and 1.5 μg of total RNA in a final volume of 20 μl was reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To amplify CEACAM1, we employed a previously described triple primer RT-PCR in which one common sense primer was used together with two antisense primers that selectively recognize the CEACAM1 splice variants encoding either a long (73 amino acids) or short (10 amino acids) cytoplasmic domain. The oligonucleotide primer that specifically hybridizes to the 3′ regions of each human CEACAM1 splice variant, 5′-GTTGTTTCTGTCCC-3′, was used for initial cDNA synthesis. A common sense primer FP49 (5′-GCAACAGGACCACAGTCAAGACGA-3′) that recognizes both CEACAM1 long and short slice variants equally was used along with the antisense primers BP60 (5′-GTGGTTGGAGACTGAGGGTTTG-3′) and BP59 (5′-TGGAGTGGTCCTGAGCTGCCG-3′), which are specific for the two differentially spliced isoforms. Amplification of transcript encoding the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) with primer mix 5′ primer TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGGG and 3′ primer CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA used as a control (22Adam R.M. Borer J.G. Williams J. Eastham J.A. Loughlin K.R. Freeman M.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen) was used for GAPDH cDNA synthesis. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 μl of first strand cDNA solution, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 3 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences), 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 0.6 μm concentrations of each of PCR primers. The reactions were initiated by heating the samples to 95 °C for 60 s, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The relative amounts of the PCR products were analyzed by scanning the gels and determining the intensities in the ethidium bromide-stained bands using Scan analyses software (Biosoft, Milltown, NJ).Statistical Evaluation—For comparisons between groups, analysis of variance with Fisher's post hoc testing was performed. Statistical significant was defined by p ≤ 0.05.RESULTSCD66 Epitope-specific Antibodies Inhibit Spontaneous Apoptosis of PBMCs and Purified Monocytes—Human PBMCs and monocytes cultured in vitro undergo spontaneous apoptosis without requiring additional external stimuli (23Mangan D.F. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3408-3412PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mangan D.F. Welch G.R. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1541-1546PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kiener P.A. Moran-Davis P. Rankin B.M. Wahl A.F. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4917-4925PubMed Google Scholar). This process can be accelerated and enhanced by the removal of serum. However, even in the presence of 20% serum, the majority of monocytes will undergo apoptosis over several days (25Kiener P.A. Moran-Davis P. Rankin B.M. Wahl A.F. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4917-4925PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the surviving monocytes differentiate to become macrophages. Consistent with previous observations (23Mangan D.F. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3408-3412PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mangan D.F. Welch G.R. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1541-1546PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kiener P.A. Moran-Davis P. Rankin B.M. Wahl A.F. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4917-4925PubMed Google Scholar), we observe that significant death of PBMCs occurs following 48 h of culture in vitro. Apoptotic and necrotic cells are apparent by flow cytometry as a population exhibiting reduced forward light scatter (FSC) as a result of gross changes in cell size and refractive index, and increased side scatter (SSC) as a result of chromatin condensation (Fig. 1A, indicated as population within gate A for FSC versus SSC plot for sample cultured in medium alone). The apoptotic nature of these cells is supported by their staining with annexin V, which binds to phosphatidylserine in depolarized membranes, and the expression of active caspase 3 (see below). In clear contrast, relatively few cells were present within this apoptotic gate (A) when PBMCs were cultured in the presence of the mAb D14HD11, which defines the CD66 epitope-expressing subset of the CEACAM family of receptors (26Beauchemin N. Draber P. Dveksler G. Gold P. Gray-Owen S. Grunert F. Hammarstrom S. Holmes K.V. Karlsson A. Kuroki M. Lin S.-H. Lucka L. Najjar S.M. Neumaier M. Obrink B. Shively J.E. Skubitz K.M. Stanners C.P. Thomas P. Thompson J.A. Virji M. von Kleist S. Wagener C. Watt S. Zimmermann W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This change was not attributable to the simple addition of antibody, as PBMCs cultured in the presence of the isotype control mAb MOPC-21 were indistinguishable from those grown in medium alone (Fig. 1A, compare FSC versus SSC plots). It was also not attributable to the engagement of Fc receptors by bound immunoglobulin, as the immobilization of the CEACAM-specific and control antibodies also displayed these different effects (see below). When comparing the relative proportion of monocyte and lymphocyte populations on FSC versus SSC plots, the absence of cells within the apoptotic gate A during culture with CD66-specific antibodies, most correlated with an increase in the proportion of cells falling within the monocyte gate, with a smaller change in the numbers of lymphocytes. The CD66-specific antibodies thus appeared to protect PBMC populations, particularly monocytes, from death.To confirm that the changes apparently reflected reduced apoptosis in cultured PBMCs, the cells were stained with annexin VFITC (Fig. 1, A and B) and propidium iodide (data not shown). This analysis indicated that CD66-specific antibodies increased the proportion of cultured PBMCs that were viable at 48 h to 91.6 ± 3.6% (n = 5) from the 69.3 ± 2.6% (n = 5) evident when PBMCs were cultured with an isotype control antibody or medium alone (Fig. 1B). The cell death was largely attributable to apoptosis, as the proportion of cells that were annexin V+ PI– was reduced from 26.8 ± 3.9% (medium alone; n = 5) or 25.2 ± 4.3% (isotype control; n = 5) to a mean of 7.3 ± 2.6% (anti-CD66; n = 5). When lymphocyte and monocyte populations were considered separately, an almost complete absence of annexin V-positive (PI–) monocytes was evident when PBMCs were cultured with CD66-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A, compare SSC versus annexin V plots of cells within gate M). Although reduced annexin V staining was also apparent within the lymphocyte population (Fig. 1A, compare SSC versus annexin V plots of cells within gate L), the relatively low level of death in all lymphocyte populations makes it difficult to determine the significance of these differences. The effect of CD66-specific antibodies was dose-dependent over a range of 0.01–1 μg/ml, with no greater influence evident when applied at concentrations above this range (Fig. 1C).The protection of monocytes present in mixed PBMC populations may either be attributable to the CD66-specific antibodies binding monocytes directly, or the antibodies could bind to other cells that can promote survival of monocytes in vitro. To assess these possibilities, we purified monocytes from other PBMCs by negative selection with magnetic beads, and then cultured these in the presence or absence of immunoglobulin. The survival of isolated monocytes cultured with CD66-specific versus control antibodies or medium alone (Fig. 1D) was indistinguishable from that observed for monocytes cultured with other PBMCs (Fig. 1A, SSC versus annexin V plot of cells within gate M). Given the reproducibility of results obtained whether the antibodies were added to PBMC cultures or purified monocytes, we interpret them to indicate that the CD66-specific antibodies function by binding to monocytes directly.CEACAM Expression by ex Vivo Human PBMCs—The CD66 epitope-specific mAb D14HD11 recognizes a subset of the human CEACAM family of receptors, which are differentially expressed by various human leukocytes (7Kammerer R.

J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous reports, we detected D14HD11 binding to ex vivo CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells by surface staining (Fig. 2A). Ex vivo CD14+ monocytes also expressed the CD66 epitope, albeit this was lower than that detected on the lymphocytes. Flow cytometric analysis revealed no apparent change in CEACAM1 expression during 48 h of in vitro culture of the monocytes (data not shown).FIGURE 2Expression of CEACAM1 in T cells, B cells, and monocytes.

Solid lines show the fluorescence intensity obtained with anti-human CEACAM1 mAb (D14HD11), and dashed lines indicate background fluorescence obtained with isotype-matched control mAb.

https://openalex.org/W2045252266,"Clinically apparent hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) usually results from a loss of function mutation in the vitamin D receptor (VDR). We recently described a human with the classical HVDRR phenotype but normal VDR function. Hormone resistance resulted from constitutive overexpression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) that competed with a normally functioning VDR-retinoid X receptor (RXR) dimer for binding to the vitamin D response element (VDRE). Here we describe the purification, molecular cloning, and expression of this vitamin D resistance-causing, competitive response element-binding protein (REBiP) hnRNP C1/C2. When overexpressed in vitamin D-responsive cells, cDNAs for both hnRNPC1 and hnRNPC2 inhibited VDR-VDRE-directed transactivation (28 and 43%, respectively; both p < 0.005). By contrast, transient expression of an hnRNP C1/C2 small interfering RNA increased VDR transactivation by 39% (p < 0.005). Chromatin immunoprecipitation of nucleoproteins bound to the transcriptionally active 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-driven CYP24 promoter revealed the presence of REBiP in vitamin D-responsive human cells and indicated that the normal pattern of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-initiated cyclical movement of the VDR on and off the VDRE is legislated by competitive, reciprocal occupancy of the VDRE by hnRNP C1/C2. The temporal and reciprocal pattern of VDR and hnRNPC1/C2 interaction with the VDRE was lost in HVDRR cells overexpressing the hnRNP C1/C2 REBiP. These observations provide further evidence for the functional importance of REBiP as a component of the multiprotein complex involved in the regulation of vitamin D-mediated transcription. In particular, chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggest that, in addition to its RNA-processing functions, hnRNP C1/C2 may be a key determinant of the temporal patterns of VDRE occupancy.

The temporal and reciprocal pattern of VDR and hnRNPC1/C2 interaction with the VDRE was lost in HVDRR cells overexpressing the hnRNP C1/C2 REBiP. These observations provide further evidence for the functional importance of REBiP as a component of the multiprotein complex involved in the regulation of vitamin D-mediated transcription. In particular, chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggest that, in addition to its RNA-processing functions, hnRNP C1/C2 may be a key determinant of the temporal patterns of VDRE occupancy. The effects in vivo of vitamin D are largely mediated by a specific vitamin D receptor (VDR). 2The abbreviations used are: VDR, vitamin D receptor; HVDRR, hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; REBiP, response element-binding protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; FCS, fetal calf serum; ROS, rat osteosarcoma; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: VDR, vitamin D receptor; HVDRR, hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; REBiP, response element-binding protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; FCS, fetal calf serum; ROS, rat osteosarcoma; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. The VDR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that recognizes and binds to Cisacting vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in the promoter regions of target genes to induce or repress transcription. In addition to VDR, there are many other factors that act to “fine tune” hormone responsiveness. First among these is the circulating vitamin D-binding protein that delivers active vitamin D metabolites to target tissues (1White P. Cooke N. Trends Endocrinol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21760-21769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second are the various “acceptor” proteins, such as megalin and cubulin (3Zhai X.Y. Nielsen R. Birn H. Drumm K.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2224-2236PubMed Google Scholar), which are anchored in the plasma membrane of target cells and promote internalization of steroid hormones. Third are the so-called “co-integrator” chaperone proteins that direct the intracellular trafficking of vitamin D metabolites for metabolism, catabolism, and transactivation via the VDR (7Adams J.S.

Fifth are receptor-associated co-activators and co-repressors that influence recruitment of other elements of the transcriptional machinery to the promoter (11Herdick M. Carlberg C. J. Mol.

And sixth are the “co-modulator” Cis-acting proteins of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family that compete with the VDR-RXR for binding to the vitamin D response element (VDRE), thus altering hormone receptor-directed transactivation (13Arbelle J.E.

Acting in their capacity as double-stranded DNA-binding proteins, we have shown previously that individual hnRNPs may function as dominant-negative modulators of steroid hormone-mediated transcription by competing with the VDR-RXR (14Chen H.

Investig. 1997; 99: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for VDRE and estrogen response element, respectively. Here we describe the isolation, purification, and cloning of the cDNA for the naturally occurring human retinoid X and vitamin D response element-binding protein (REBiP), which was shown to be hnRNP C1/C2. In further studies, we have demonstrated the ability of the REBiP to exert a dominant-negative effect on 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)-induced transcription via the naturally occurring VDRE in the vitamin D-24-hydroxylase (CYP24) gene promoter. Finally, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we have revealed the temporal pre-existence of the REBiP on the VDRE in vivo in cells in advance of VDRE occupation by the liganded VDR, suggesting a possible role for the REBiP promoting cis site-specific chromatin remodeling in the region of the human genome harboring VDREs. Reagents and Cell Culture—Crystalline 1,25(OH)2D3 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was solubilized in 100% ethanol for addition to reaction mixtures. An Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphoblast cell line and primary dermal fibroblast cultures from a VDR-RXR-normal patient with classical symptoms of hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) were used as a source for REBiP (15Chen H. Hewison M. Hu B. Adams J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cultures of cells from an unrelated female of the same age with normal skeletal development were used as control cells for comparison. Immortalized B-cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Omega, Tarzana, CA). VDR-VDRE-reporter assays were performed in the VDRE + ROS (rat osteosarcoma) 17/2.8 cells, a cell line stably transfected with luciferase under the control of the VDRE in the CYP24 promoter (a kind gift from Hector DeLuca, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) as previously described (24Arbour N.C. Ross T.K. Zierold C. Prahl J.M. Deluca H.F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). VDRE + ROS cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 6 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10% FCS. Vitamin D-responsive human kidney HKC-8 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FCS. Purification and Molecular Cloning of REBiP—A DNA affinity resin was prepared as described by Kadonga and Tijan (25Kadonga J.T. Tijan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Gel-purified oligonucleotides (30-mers) containing nucleotides of the complementary sequence to consensus RXRE (5′-GATCAGCTTCAGGTCAGAGGTCAGAGAGCT-3) with 4-bp cohesive ends were annealed with their complementary sequence, subjected to 5′-phosphorylation, and then concatamerized in reactions using DNA ligase. The concatamerized DNA was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. Affinity-purified response element-binding proteins present in the nuclear extracts of HVDRR cells were sequentially eluted from the support in increasing concentrations of KCl as described previously (21Chen H. Hu B. Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31352-31357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Selected fractions were then submitted to automated Edman degradation and amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 477A or Hewlett Packard G1005 protein sequencer (Harvard Microchemistry Facility, Cambridge, MA) as previously described (15Chen H. Hewison M. Hu B. Adams J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Following the identification of hnRNP C1/C2 as the REBiP from amino acid sequencing, a cDNA expression construct, including the coding region of the hnRNP C1/C2 gene, was cloned. Approximately 200 ng of HVDRR total RNA, isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), was used as a template. Successful amplification of the coding region cDNA sequence was achieved with 30 cycles of reverse transcription-PCR using the primers to hnRNP C1/C2 (5′-ACGATGGCCAGCAACGTTACCAAC-3′ and 5′-TCCTCCATTGGCGCTGTCTCT-3′). The resulting PCR product was ligated into the PCR 3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and the cDNA sequence verified. Antibodies and Immunoblotting Assays—Cell extracts from the HVDRR patient and the control subject were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses, using a panel of antibodies including anti-human hnRNP C1/C2, anti-human hnRNPC-like, anti-human hnRNPA, anti-human Ku protein, and anti-human actin antibody (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were performed as described previously (14Chen H.

Endocrinology. 2001; 146: 4266-4273Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Assays—Cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 12-well plates. For transient expression analyses, each well received 0.8 μg of REBiP cDNA expression plasmid or vector-alone plasmid. For siRNA experiments, each well received 10 μm siRNP C1/C2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Promoter-reporter assays carried out using VDRE + ROS cells utilized the endogenous luciferase construct, whereas similar assays using HKC-8 cells required transfection of 0.8 μg of the VDRE-luciferase plasmid. All transfections were carried out in 0.004% Lipofectamine-2000 in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) followed by an overnight incubation. The next day, the medium was replaced by Opti-MEM containing 0.1% ethanol or 10 nm 1,25(OH)2D3. After an additional 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were lysed and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities measured (Promega, Madison, WI). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and ChIP Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (15Chen H. Hewison M. Hu B. Adams J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using REBiP-enriched nuclear extract from DNA affinity chromatography as a source of response element-binding proteins. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (26Zhang C. Dowd D.R. Staal A. Gu C. Lian J.B. Wijnen J. Stein G.S. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35325-35336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, HVDRR and control lymphocytes were cultured for 4 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped, heat-inactivated FCS and treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for the indicated times. Following hormone treatment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. After quenching of the cross-linking with 1.25 m glycine, cells were harvested, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Nuclei were collected and resuspended in 500 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (all from Sigma). The resulting chromatin samples were sonicated to yield sheared DNA fragments of sizes between 300 and 1000 bp. For each immunoprecipitation, sheared chromatin was diluted with immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl). The chromatin was collected and incubated at 4 °C overnight with 5 μg of anti-VDR-9A7 (Affinity Bioreagents Inc. Golden, CO) and anti-hnRNP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. The immune complexes were precipitated with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (source) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then subjected to serial 1-ml washes of the following: immunoprecipitation dilution buffer TSE-500 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl); LiCl/detergent buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1; 500 mm LiCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; and 1% deoxycholic acid in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The antibody-protein-DNA immunocomplexes were then eluted with 1% SDS in 50 mm NaHCO3. Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight with the addition of 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm. All of the samples were then digested at 45 °C for 1 h with 20 μgof proteinase K. DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed by PCR using amplifying primer sequences spanning the enhancer VDRE in the proximal CYP24 promoter, –334 to –22 bp relative to the start site of transcription. Amplifying primer pairs spanning a more distal section of the CYP24 promoter not harboring a VDRE, bp –1749 to –1424, were used as a negative control in ChIP assays. Purification and Molecular Cloning of the REBiP—Previous work from this laboratory (14Chen H. Hu B. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35557-35564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) identified two species of an anti-hnRNP-reactive protein from vitamin D-resistant New World primate nuclear extracts that bound specifically to a consensus human VDRE (VDRE-D3, AGGTCAGACAGGTCA) direct repeat motif in both double- and single-stranded format. Subsequently, we screened human HVDRR cell extracts for their ability to bind to the same response elements in vitro and determined that, although both cis elements could specifically bind HVDRR extract, the most avid interaction appeared to be with the RXRE in double-stranded DNA format (15Chen H. Hewison M. Hu B. Adams J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Given these preliminary results, we used concatamers of the double-stranded RXRE as an affinity agent to purify the human REBiP. The affinity support bound a nuclear protein with a tryptic fragment bearing 100% sequence identity with the human hnRNPC1 and C2 proteins (Fig. 1A), the alternatively spliced, translated products of the hnRNPC1/C2 gene. Using tryptic peptide sequencing, a full-length REBiP cDNA was cloned that bore 99.5% nucleotide sequence identity and 99.3–99.7% deduced amino acid sequence identity with the human hnRNPC1 and C2 proteins. Western blot analyses using an anti-human hnRNP C1/C2 antibody confirmed that cells from the HVDRR patient overexpressed a pair of anti-hnRNP C1/C2-reactive proteins of 39–40 kDa, compatible with the hnRNPC1 and the slightly larger hnRNPC2 (Fig. 1B). This contrasted with extracts from an age- and sex-matched normal, vitamin D-sensitive donor that expressed principally hnRNPC2. Data in Fig. 1C showed that the endogenous hnRNPC1/C2 gene product was not confined to the nucleus, as the REBiP was also readily detectable in the post-nuclear supernatant of both HVDRR and control B-lymphocytes. REBiP Specifically Interacts with the VDRE and Blocks VDRE-directed Transactivation—Confirmation of the ability of the affinity-purified REBiP or hnRNPC to bind to a VDRE and affect VDRE-directed transactivation was then sought. As was the case with crude extracts from HVDRR cells (15Chen H. Hewison M. Hu B. Adams J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), affinity-purified REBiP was specifically bound to the VDRE in double-stranded format (Fig. 2B) and competed with 100× unlabeled oligonucleotide for occupation of a VDRE bearing a direct repeat of the AGGTCA (VDRE-D3) or RXRE (Fig. 2A). These data suggested that the affinity-purified hnRNPC could bind specifically to a direct repeat of AGGTCA separated by either one or three base pairs and might function in a dominant-negative mode to block VDRE-directed transactivation. Promoter-reporter analyses confirmed that transient overexpression of the unspliced hnRNPC1/C2 cDNA in wild-type, vitamin D-sensitive cells blocked VDR-VDRE-directed reporter activity in the absence or presence of added 1,25(OH)2D3 (57 and 44% decrease, respectively, compared with vector-only control; both p < 0.005) (Fig. 3A). Somewhat unexpectedly, co-expression of the siRNA for hnRNPC1/C2 increased transcription both in the absence and presence of stimulatory 1,25(OH)2D3 (39 and 135% increase, respectively, compared with vector only control; both p < 0.005). These data suggested that an endogenous, functional, human hnRNPC1/C2 siRNA-reactive mRNA for a REBiP is normally expressed in this rat cell line; the inset Western blot (Fig. 3B) confirms this to be the case. Data in Fig. 3C shows that overexpression of hnRNPC1 and hnRNPC2 cDNAs alone or together suppressed VDR-VDRE-directed reporter activity in the absence or presence of added 1,25(OH)2D3. This inhibitory effect on transcription appeared to be modulated by a combination of the two splice variants, with hnRNPC2 being slightly more potent than hnRNPC1 and the inhibitory effect of the two cDNAs being additive in the absence of 1,25(OH)2D3.FIGURE 3Altered expression of hnRNP C1 and C2 modulates VDRE-directed transactivation. A, VDRE + ROS 17/28 cells with constitutive expression of a CYP24 luciferase promoter-reporter construct were transiently transfected with either an hnRNP C1/C2 expression construct or siRNA to hnRNP C1/C2 in the absence or presence of 10 nm of 1,25(OH)2D3.

In initial experiments, both vitamin D-resistant HVDRR and vitamin D-responsive control cells were treated with or without a VDR-saturating concentration of 10 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 for 15 min prior to isolation of cross-linked protein-chromatin complexes. The protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-hnRNP C1/C2 and anti-VDR antibody and quantification of cross-linked DNA performed by reverse transcription-PCR using two sets of primer pairs, one set corresponding to a transcriptionally active enhancer VDRE (–334 to –22 bp of the CYP24 gene promoter) and a control, non-VDRE-containing region (–1749 to –1424 bp of the CYP24 gene promoter) (Fig. 4, top panels). Prior to and following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, neither the VDR nor the hnRNP C1/C2 REBiP were bound by the non-VDRE upstream region of the CYP24 promoter (–1794 to –1424 bp) in either control or HVDRR cells (Fig. 4A). By contrast, in vitamin D-responsive human B lymphoblasts, the proximal VDRE-containing promoter region of the CYP24 promoter (–334 to –22 bp) (Fig. 4B) was occupied mostly by anti-human hnRNP C1/C2-reactive protein and just minimally by the VDR in the basal state before 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. After exposure to a VDR-saturating concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3, the VDR was recruited to the VDRE with a coincident decrease in hnRNP C1/C2 interaction with the promoter. This suggested that there was competition between the two VDRE-binding proteins for the cis sequence. The rabbit IgG control did not detect any other proteins interacting with this region of the promoter, indicating that binding of both the hnRNP C1/C2 and VDR was specific. Surprisingly, in REBiP-overexpressing HVDRR cells, both the VDR and the hnRNPC1/C2 REBiP were present on the promoter in the absence of added hormone, and this pattern of relative occupancy of the VDRE by the two proteins changed little upon acute administration of 1,25(OH)2D3. Bearing in mind that this experiment afforded only a single 15-min “snapshot” of hormone-induced changes in VDR and hnRNP C1/C2, these data suggest that the two proteins remained as co-occupants of the VDRE and/or that one of the two was anchored to the VDRE with the other being bound to the other but not necessarily still binding to DNA. Analysis of Temporal Changes in Association of VDR and hnRNPC1/C2 with the VDRE by ChIP—To further clarify the dynamics of VDRE occupancy, we analyzed temporal changes in the interaction of the hnRNP C1/C2 REBiP with the –334 to –22 bp fragment of the CYP24 gene promoter (Fig. 5). It is now well recognized that occupancy of the VDRE by the VDR-RXR is cyclical in nature, eventually resulting in the relative stable association of the heterodimer with the promoter and sustained transcriptional effects (26Zhang C. Dowd D.R. Staal A. Gu C. Lian J.B. Wijnen J. Stein G.S. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35325-35336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the molecular nature of the “on-off” behavior of the VDR-RXR at the VDRE remains a matter of conjecture. We postulated that these receptor-response element cycling events may be due to the competitive presence of the REBiP at the VDRE. As such, we examined the temporal sequence of proteins occupying the VDRE in control vitamin D-responsive and vitamin D-resistant HVDRR cells over a period of 165 min (Fig. 5). As was the case with the ChIP assay data presented in Fig. 4, before the addition of hormone, the VDR was relatively excluded from the VDRE in control vitamin D-responsive cells compared with vitamin D-resistant HVDRR cells in which both the VDR- and anti-hnRNP C1/C2-reactive REBiP were present on the VDRE. Following the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the control cells, the VDR was recruited to the VDRE and the REBiP content diminished. Further, as previously reported by others (26Zhang C. Dowd D.R.

The main receptor for cAMP in mammals is the ubiquitous regulatory (R) subunit of protein kinase A. Despite the recognized significant potential for pharmacological applications of CBDs, currently only one group of competitive inhibitor antagonists is known: the (Rp)-cAMPS family of phosphorothioate cAMP analogs, in which the equatorial exocyclic oxygen of cAMP is replaced by sulfur. It is also known that the diastereoisomer (Sp)-cAMPS with opposite phosphorous chirality is a cAMP agonist, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogs is currently not fully understood. Previous crystallographic and unfolding investigations point to the enhanced CBD dynamics as a key determinant of antagonism. Here, we investigate the (Rp)- and (Sp)-cAMPS-bound states of R(CBD-A) using a comparative NMR approach that reveals a clear chemical shift and dynamic NMR signature, differentiating the (Sp)-cAMPS agonist from the (Rp)-cAMPS antagonist. Based on these data, we have proposed a model for the (Rp/Sp)-cAMPS antagonism and agonism in terms of steric and electronic effects on two main allosteric relay sites, Ile163 and Asp170, respectively, affecting the stability of a ternary inhibitory complex formed by the effector ligand, the regulatory and the catalytic subunits of protein kinase A. The proposed model not only rationalizes the existing data on the phosphorothioate analogs, but it will also facilitate the design of novel cAMP antagonists and agonists.

Biol. 2003; 19: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All CBDs share a conserved architecture with a contiguous β-subdomain nested within a noncontiguous α-subdomain (18Su Y.

Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The β-subdomain consists of an eight-stranded β-barrel, where the cAMP phosphate-binding cassette (PBC) is located. Upon cAMP binding, its signal is propagated through the α/β-subdomain interface, causing a rearrangement of the orientation of the three α-helices in the α-subdomain. It is this α-subdomain rearrangement that ultimately controls the activity of the functional unit coupled to cAMP (20Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Given the significant physiological relevance of CBDs, the potential of this domain as a pharmacological target has been the subject of extensive investigations (21Arnsten A.F.T. Ramos B.P.

For instance, for PKA, which is the major receptor of cAMP in vertebrates, over the past ∼40 years, hundreds of compounds were tested as competitive inhibitors of cAMP for therapeutic purposes. However, only one group of cAMP surrogates, the phosphorothioate (Rp)-cAMPS analogs (Fig. 1b), was found to have an antagonist function (24Van Haaster P.M. Van Driel R. Jastorff B. Baraniak J. Stec W.C. De Wit J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 259: 10020-10024Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 25Dostmann W.R.G. Taylor S.S. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Doskeland S.O. Ogreid D. J. Biol.

In (Rp)-cAMPS, the equatorial exocyclic oxygen of cAMP is replaced by a sulfur atom, thus introducing chirality at the phosphorous position. Switching to the opposite chirality by placing the sulfur atom in the axial exocyclic position leads to the related diastereomeric cAMP analog: (Sp)-cAMPS (Fig. 1a). Unlike (Rp)-cAMPS, (Sp)-cAMPS behaves as a cAMP agonist, revealing the stringent stereo-specific requirements of antagonism. However, it is currently not fully understood in molecular terms why the (Rp)- and (Sp)-cAMPS analogs function as a cAMP antagonist and agonist, respectively. The crystal structures of the regulatory subunit of PKA (R) bound to both phosphorothioate analogs have been solved at 2.3 Å resolution and are overall very similar to each other (i.e. Cα root mean square deviation of 0.34 Å) and to the cAMP-bound state (i.e. Cα root mean square deviation of 0.5 Å) as well (27Wu J. Jones M.J. Xuong N-H. Eyck L.F.T. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6620-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite the overall similarity of these three structures, subtle local conformational differences were found for the conserved arginines in the PBC (i.e. Arg209 for CBD-A and Arg333 for CBD-B). For example, the intermolecular distances indicate that the phosph(othio)ate-Arg209 guanidinium interaction is significantly tighter for (Rp)-cAMPS as compared with (Sp)-cAMPS and cAMP, although the affinity of the (Rp)-surrogate for this CBD is lower than that of the (Sp)-analog and of cAMP (27Wu J. Jones M.J. Xuong N-H. Eyck L.F.T. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6620-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystallographic investigation revealed that the (Rp)-cAMPS bound state is probably more dynamic than the (Sp)-cAMPS- and cAMP-bound forms, based on its higher B-factors (27Wu J. Jones M.J. Xuong N-H. Eyck L.F.T. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6620-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the Gibbs free energy of urea unfolding of (Rp)-cAMPS-bound R is similar to that of cAMP-free R, whereas the thermodynamics of unfolding for (Sp)-cAMPS compares well with that of the more thermodynamically stable cAMP-bound R (28Dostmann W.R.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we further investigate by NMR the effects of (Rp)- and (Sp)-cAMPS binding. For this purpose, we focus on the 119-244 RIα fragment, which maps to CBD-A of the R-subunit of PKA and represents its minimal central controlling unit (29Das R. Abu-Abed M. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 8406-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using a comparative NMR strategy based on Nz exchange spectroscopy to assign different bound states, it was possible to unveil how the internal signaling pathways of CBD-A are differentially perturbed by (Rp)-cAMPS as compared with (Sp)-cAMPS and cAMP. In addition, 15N relaxation measurements (i.e. T1,2, HN NOE, and relaxation-compensated constant time CPMG NMR dispersion) combined with hydrodynamic simulations provide further insight on the sites and time scales of the enhanced dynamics caused by (Rp)-cAMPS. The interpretation of these results in the context of the allosteric networks of CBD-A and of the stereo-electronic effects caused by the oxygen-to-sulfur isolobal substitution has led to the proposition of a molecular model for the antagonism and agonism of the (Rp)- and (Sp)-cAMPS analogs, respectively. NMR Sample Preparation of RIα-(119-244) Bound to Different Ligands—Samples of uniformly 15N-labeled cAMP-bound RIα-(119-244) in MES buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3) were prepared as previously discussed (29Das R. Abu-Abed M. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 8406-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Hamuro Y. Anand G. Kim J.S. Juliano C. Stranz D.D. Taylor S.S. Woods V.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 304: 1185-1196Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The RIα-(119-244) samples with substoichiometric amounts of cAMP used for the Nz exchange experiments were obtained through a protocol of unfolding, partial dialyzing out of cAMP and refolding. Specifically, after adding 8 m urea to cAMP-bound RIα-(119-244), the sample was dialyzed for 18 h in the presence of 0.5 liters of MES buffer with 6 m urea and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After changing the dialysis buffer three times at regular intervals, the protein was then partially refolded by stepwise dilution of the dialysis solution to 0.5 m urea through the addition of MES buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Essentially complete removal of urea was obtained by a final dialysis against the MES buffer, which resulted in a sample with NMR-detectable amounts of both cAMP-bound and free states of RIα-(119-244) at a total concentration of ∼0.1 mm. The addition of 50 μm (Sp)-cAMPS phosphorothioate cAMP analog (Sigma) to this sample resulted in another NMR sample with NMR-observable amounts of both cAMP-bound and (Sp)-cAMPS-bound RIα-(119-244). This sample was used to assign the (Sp)-cAMPS-bound RIα-(119-244) through Nz exchange spectroscopy. The sample with both cAMP-bound and (Rp)-cAMPS-bound (Sigma) RIα-(119-244) was prepared similarly. Samples containing only RIα-(119-244) bound to the (Sp)-cAMPS or (Rp)-cAMPS analogs were prepared by extensively rather than partially dialyzing the protein under denaturing conditions and then refolding. Specifically, we added urea to 6 ml of 0.15 mm RIα-(119-244) to a final urea concentration of 8 m. After keeping the resulting solution at room temperature for 30 min, it was dialyzed against 8 m urea buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 16 h with three buffer changes. The protein solution was then dialyzed extensively with 6 m urea for 24 h to completely remove cAMP. After refolding the protein as indicated above, 1 mm excess (Sp)-cAMPS analog was added. The (Rp)-cAMPS-bound RIα-(119-244) sample was prepared likewise. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR data were acquired using a Bruker AV 700-MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe set at a temperature of 306 K. The calibration of the probe temperature was obtained using a thermocouple as well as an ethylene glycol sample. Unless otherwise specified, all spectral widths, number of digitization points, carrier frequencies, 15N GARP decoupling strength, and gradient shapes were set as previously discussed (29Das R.

The backbone resonances of cAMP-bound RIα-(119-244) were assigned through standard triple resonance experiments as previously indicated (29Das R. Abu-Abed M. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem.

Nz Exchange—The assignment of the backbone amides of RIα-(119-244) bound to (Sp)-cAMPS was obtained from that of cAMP-bound RIα-(119-244) through Nz exchange spectra (36Farrow N.A. Zhang O.

Similarly, the backbone amides of RIα (119-244) bound to (Rp)-cAMPS were assigned through Nz exchange spectra of a sample with NMR observable amounts of both cAMP-bound and (Rp)-cAMPS-bound RIα-(119-244). In both cases, the Nz mixing period was 230 ms, and the relaxation delay between subsequent scans was 2 s. After acquisition of 128 scans per t1 transient, the Nz exchange spectra were processed using linear prediction. The ( ((ΔδHN1)2+(ΔδNH15/6.5)2)) equation (39Mulder F.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was used to compute the compounded 1H,15N chemical shift variations between the different states of RIα-(119-244) (i.e. X-bound versus free and X-bound versus cAMP-bound, where X = (Sp)- or (Rp)-cAMPS). Relaxation Dispersion NMR—A relaxation-compensated constant time (RC-CT) CPMG pulse sequence (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 204-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) was used to measure the 15N relaxation dispersions for backbone amides in the cAMP-, the (Rp)-cAMPS-, and the (Sp)-cAMPS-bound states of RIα-(119-244). The total CPMG length (TCP) was 93.3 ms with either 8 or 88 180° 15N pulses corresponding to CMPG field strengths (ψCPMG) of 43 and 472 Hz, respectively (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A.

Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Fifteen interleaved replicate data sets were acquired and co-added for each CMPG field strength with 128 dummy scans and 16 scans per serial file separated by an interscan delay of 2.2 s. In addition, considering that at 700 MHz and at the CPMG radio frequency strength employed (3.1 kHz), 15N pulses are affected by significant offset effects, all CT-RC-CPMG experiments were acquired with three different 15N carrier frequencies (110, 119, and 127 ppm) to span the 15N spectral width using three narrow bands. The NMR relaxation dispersion ΔR2eff was calculated as follows: ΔR2eff=R2eff(43Hz)-R2eff(472Hz). Since R2eff(νCPMG)=(-1/TCP)ln(IνCPMG/Io) (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D.

Abu-Abed M. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 8406-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For cross-peaks affected by overlap and/or relaxing too quickly to be detected in the RC-CT-CPMG spectra (i.e. Val134, His138, and Leu139 in all three bound states), the ΔR2eff computation was not possible. Other 15N NMR Relaxation Measurements—The 15N spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation rates R1 and R2 as well as the {1H}15N steady state NOEs were measured for the cAMP-, the (Rp)-cAMPS-, and the (Sp)-cAMPS-bound states of RIα-(119-244) using pulse sequences with water flip back pulses and sensitivity enhancement (34Farrow N.A.

Reson. 2004; 171: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were measured with a ψCPMG of 472 Hz (40Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11341-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 41Mulder F.A.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and CPMG relaxation delays of 8.48, 16.96, 25.4, 33.92, 42.4, 50.88, 59.36, 76.32, and 93.28 ms. The steady state {1H}15N NOE values were measured from the ratio of peak intensities determined with and without proton saturation. For the NOE experiment, a 12-s recycle delay was used, including a 5-s proton saturation period (43Mulder F.A. Bouakaz L. Lundell A. Venkataramana M. Liljas A. Akke M. Sanyal S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5930-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Renner C. Schleicher M. Moroder L. Holak T.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas for the R1 and R2 pulse sequences, the recycle delay was 1.5 s. 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence two-dimensional NMR spectra were collected before and after each relaxation experiment to check the stability of the protein sample. The whole series of R1 and R2 relaxation rate measurements with different relaxation periods was collected in triplicate to average potential long term instabilities (39Mulder F.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and for the NOE experiments 10 sets of data were collected both with and without proton saturation. All replicate spectra were co-added before processing with NMRPipe (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 439Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The relaxation rates and their errors were computed through relaxation fitting simulations with Sparky 3.111 (50Ding Z. Lee G. Liang X. Gallazzi F. Arunima A. Van Doren S.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10119-10134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using 1000 iterations with a Gaussian distributed random noise added. The uncertainty in the steady state NOE was measured based on the S.D. value of the distribution of the differences in fit heights between duplicate spectra (34Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). All errors were treated as previously explained (51Kroenke C.D. Rance M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10119-10125Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Selected cross-peaks could not be used in the relaxation analysis due to line broadening and/or overlap. For the (Rp)-cAMPS-bound form, some of these cross-peaks correspond to residues in the αXN-/A-helix loop. Reduced Spectral Density Mapping—The 15N relaxation data were mapped into reduced spectral densities, assuming that their high frequency values are constant: J(ωN + ωH) = J(ωH) = J(ωN - ωH), as previously described (52Atkinson R.A. Kieffer B. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2004; 44: 141-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 53Houben K. Wasielewski E. Dominguez C. Kellenberger E. Atkinson R.A.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Under this assumption, the J(ωN + ωH) and J(ωN) values are derived only from the measured 15NR1 and {1H}15N NOEs, whereas the J(0) values are computed using the measured 15NR2 rates as well (55Lefèvre J.F. Dayie K.T. Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The calculated value of J(0) includes also chemical exchange contributions. Errors in the reduced spectral densities were assessed through propagation of the uncertainties in the experimentally determined 15N relaxation rates and NOEs. For reference purposes, the Lorentzian spectral density of an isotropically diffusing rigid molecule was computed as follows: J(ω) = (2/5)τc/(1 + (ωτc)2). Hydrodynamic Simulations—The contributions of the overall tumbling and the effect of diffusional anisotropy on the relaxation rates and the reduced spectral densities were modeled through bead method-based hydrodynamic simulations using the HYDRONMR program (56Bernado P. de la Torre J.G. Pons M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 57Garcìa de la Torre J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the coordinates for the 119-244 fragment of the 1RGS Protein Data Bank structure of RIα were employed with hydrogen atoms added through the program Molmol (58Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar) and with an atomic element radius of 3.3 Å, which represents the optimal average value that has been previously found to best fit several hydrodynamic properties (i.e. translational diffusion, sedimentation coefficients, rotational diffusion, and intrinsic viscosity) for a set of model proteins (57Garcìa de la Torre J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An error of ±0.2 Å was considered for the atomic element radius to account for hydration layer variability. A temperature of 306 K was used for the HYDRONMR simulation, and the viscosity of water in centipoises at this temperature was computed as follows (57Garcìa de la Torre J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar): η = 1.7753-0.0565t + 1.0751 × 10-3 t2 - 9.2222 × 10-6 t3, where t is the temperature in Celsius. The 15N relaxation rates at a static field of 16.44 T computed by HYDRONMR for the rigid RIα-(119-244) assume an N-H distance of 1.02 Å and a chemical shift anisotropy of -160 ppm (56Bernado P. de la Torre J.G. Pons M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 57Garcìa de la Torre J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Dpar/Dper ratio was computed as 2Dz/(Dx + Dy), where Dx and Dy are the pair of eigenvalues of the rotational diffusion matrix that are closest to each other, with Dx > Dy (56Bernado P. de la Torre J.G. Pons M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 57Garcìa de la Torre J"
https://openalex.org/W1978401953,"The four mammalian bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1)-like proteinases act to proteolytically convert procollagens to the major fibrous components of the extracellular matrix. They also activate lysyl oxidase, an enzyme necessary to the covalent cross-linking that gives collagen fibrils much of their tensile strength. Thus, these four proteinases are attractive targets for interventions designed to limit the excess formation of fibrous collagenous matrix that characterizes fibrosis. Although it has previously been reported that the serum protein α2-macroglobulin is unable to inhibit the astacin-like proteinases meprin α and meprin β, we herein demonstrate α2-macroglobulin to be a potent inhibitor of the similar BMP1-like proteinases. BMP1 is shown to cleave the α2-macroglobulin “bait” region, at a single specific site, which resembles the sites at which BMP1-like proteinases cleave the C-propeptides of procollagens I–III. α2-Macroglobulin is an irreversible inhibitor that is shown to bind bone morphogenetic protein 1 in a covalent complex. It is also demonstrated that genetically modified α2-macroglobulin, in which the native bait region is replaced by sequences flanking the probiglycan BMP1 cleavage site, is enhanced ∼24-fold in its ability to inhibit BMP1, and is capable of inhibiting the biosynthetic processing of procollagen I by cells. These findings suggest possible therapeutic interventions involving ectopic expression of modified versions of α2-macroglobulin in the treatment of fibrotic conditions.

Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) 3The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; ECM, extracellular matrix; EGF, epidermal growth factor; pCP, procollagen C-proteinase; C-propeptide, COOH-terminal propeptide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is the prototype of a subgroup of structurally similar, secreted metalloproteinases, each member of which has an astacin-like protease domain, complement-uegf-BMP1 protein-protein interaction domains, and epidermal growth factor motifs (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Greenspan D.S. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mammalian members of this subgroup proteolytically convert a variety of precursor molecules into mature, functional proteins involved in formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Greenspan D.S. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Members of this class of proteinases also activate a subset of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily of proteins in a broad range of species, through cleavage of extracellular protein antagonists (2Greenspan D.S. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the four mammalian BMP1-like proteinases are likely to be key regulators and orchestrators of ECM formation and signaling by certain transforming growth factor-β-like molecules, in morphogenetic events and homeostasis. Surprisingly, studies regarding regulation of the expression and activities of these key proteinases have been limited. Nevertheless, one such study showed that, whereas transcription of the BMP1 gene and secretion of BMP1 are both up-regulated ∼8-fold by treatment of cells with transforming growth factor-β1, induction of detectable procollagen C-proteinase activity is only ∼2-fold, suggesting the existence of an endogenous inhibitor(s) (3Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In fact, a number of studies have detected unexpectedly low levels of procollagen C-proteinase (pCP) activity in tissues and cell cultures, also leading to suggestions of endogenous inhibitors (4Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) is a member of the α-macroglobulin family of proteins found in the circulation and egg whites of a broad range of species (5Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human α2M is found at relatively high levels (2–4 mg/ml) in plasma and is produced by hepatocytes, but is also produced by a number of other cell types that include lung fibroblasts, macrophages, astrocytes, and tumor cells (6Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 7Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Human α2M is a tetramer of four identical 185-kDa subunits, each of which has an exposed 39-amino acid “bait region” that contains cleavage sites for a variety of proteinases (6Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cleavage within the bait region results in exposure of a highly reactive α2M thioester that can covalently bind the cleaving proteinase (6Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cleavage within the bait region also results in a conformational change that entraps the proteinase within the interior of the α2M molecule, thus inhibiting further proteinase activity by steric hindrance (6Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The conformational change also gives rise to what can be considered an “activated” form of α2M, with exposed sites for binding of α2Mto its cognate cell surface receptor, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, and for binding to a number of cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β, platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-1β, basic fibroblast growth factor, and nerve growth factor (6Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Binding to lipoprotein receptor-related protein results in rapid clearance of α2M-proteinase complexes from the extracellular space and catabolism, although activated α2M appears able to bind cytokines in a reversible manner that allows it to serve as a carrier and targeting protein involved in modulating the biological responses of various cell types (6Borth W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). BMP1-like proteinases have astacin-like protease domains (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Greenspan D.S. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that α2M does not inhibit vertebrate proteinases with astacin-like protease domains (7Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 9Kruse M.N. Becker C. Lottaz D. Köhler D. Yiallouros I. Krell H.W. Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), such as α meprin and β meprin (9Kruse M.N. Becker C. Lottaz D. Köhler D. Yiallouros I. Krell H.W. Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), although bovine α2M has been shown to have inhibitory activity toward the crayfish digestive protease astacin (10Stöcker W. Breit S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Zwilling R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1991; 98: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we identify a potential site for cleavage of α2M by BMP1-like proteinases. We demonstrate cleavage at this site by BMP1 and the potent inhibition of BMP1 proteolytic activities via the formation of covalent complexes with cleaved α2M. A genetically altered version of α2M, in which the bait region has been replaced by the BMP1 cleavage site of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan precursor probiglycan is shown to have a greatly enhanced ability to inhibit BMP1, and is able to inhibit procollagen I processing by cells. Implications of the data are discussed. Cleavage of α2M by BMP1—200 nm FLAG-tagged recombinant BMP1, prepared, and purified as previously described (11Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 200 nm human α2M (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. Subsequently, reaction proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on a 7.5% gel and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western blot analysis, 320 nm BMP1 was incubated with 200 nm α2M at 37 °C overnight, and samples were loaded on 7.5% gels and separated by SDS-PAGE, under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Subsequently, membranes were incubated with a 1:25000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate as the secondary antibody. Inhibition of BMP1 pCP Activity by α2M—For the dose dependence study, α2M was preincubated with BMP1 for 2 h at 37 °C. The study of time-dependent cleavage of α2M by BMP1 indicates that cleavage of α2M by BMP1 is complete after a 2-h preincubation, under the conditions used. Thus, the rate of procollagen processing is proportional to the amount of active BMP1 remaining uncomplexed to α2M. Relative processing of procollagen was plotted against α2M concentrations and nonlinear regression was performed to obtain IC50 values. Time-dependent Inhibition of BMP1 Cleavage of Probiglcyan by α2M—15 ng of BMP1 (9.4 nm) was preincubated with/without 5 times the amount of α2M (47.0 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2, 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, 450 ng of probiglycan, prepared as previously described (12Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N. Troedel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was added to a final volume of 20 μl and incubated overnight. Cleavage reactions were quenched by adding 4 μl of chondroitinase ABC (a mixture of 10 μl of 0.01 units/μl protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikaguku Corp.), 40 μl of 6× chondroitinase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 240 mm NaAc, 0.25 mm EDTA), and 10 μl of 500 mm EDTA), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and Western blot analysis was performed, using anti-probiglycan antibody LF51 (13Fisher L.W. Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (the kind gift of Dr. Larry W. Fisher) at a 1:5000 dilution, and a 1:25000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate, as the secondary antibody. Inactivation of α2M by Methylamine—1 mg/ml α2M was incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, in the presence or absence of 20 mm methylamine for 20 h, followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. Both methylamine-treated and control α2M samples were tested for the ability to be cleaved by BMP1, and ability to inhibit BMP1 cleavage of probiglycan. Production of Recombinant α2M—Human α2M sequences were PCR amplified from human placenta cDNA in three fragments. Primers used were: fragment 1 (amino acids 24–416), 5′-GCTAGCAGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGTCAGTCTCTGGAAAACCGCAGTAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGTAAGAGAGGTACCCATAAC-3′ (reverse); fragment 2 (amino acids 416–1052), 5′-GTTATGGGTACCTCTCTTACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGTAGGCTCGAGCTTGGGC-3′ (reverse); and fragment 3 (amino acids 1052–1474), 5′-GCCCAAGCTCGAGCCTACAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAAGCATTTCCAAGATCTTTGCTG-3′ (reverse). PCR products were assembled into the full-length α2M sequence in pBlueScript II KS+ (Stratagene), and cloned downstream of (and adjoined via an NheI site to) BM40/SPARC signal peptide sequences, between the HindIII and NotI sites of the tetracycline-inducible expression vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). The resulting construct expresses full-length α2M, except that the native signal peptide is replaced by the BM40 signal peptide, for optimization of secretion. In addition, upon cleavage of the signal peptide, a FLAG epitope remains at the NH2 terminus of α2M sequences. To generate mutant α2M, an MfeI site was introduced into the 5′-end of α2M bait region sequences, without changing the encoded protein, via two-step PCR. Primers used were: primer 1, 5′-GATATGTACAGCTTCCTAGAGGA-3′; primer 2, 5′-GTTGCAATTGTGGACACATTTTGGGTTTACGA-3′; primer 3, 5′-TCCACAATTGCAACAGTATGAAATGCATGGACCT-3′; and primer 4, 5′-CTTTCGTACGGTCTCCGTGTGA-3′. PCR amplicons of primers 1 and 2, and 3 and 4 were then used as templates, for PCR amplification using primers 1 and 4. The resulting amplicon was cloned between BsrGI and BsiWI sites in the α2M sequence. Biglycan sequences were PCR amplified with primers 5′-GAGAGAATTCTGGGACTTCACCCTGGACGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAAGGTACCATGGCGCTGTAGGTGGGTGT-3′ (reverse). The amplicon was then digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and cloned between MfeI and BsiWI sites in the modified α2M sequences. In the resulting mutant α2M (b-α2M) the sequences flanking the human probiglycan BMP1 cleavage site substitute for the bait region (see Fig. 1). 293 T-Rex cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 5 μg/ml blasticidin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells at 80% confluence were transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmid/35-mm culture dish using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were selected in the same type of medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml Zeocin. Production of secreted α2M, upon induction with 1 μg/ml tetracycline, was detected via Western blot. Confluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated 15 min in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. Cells were then washed once with PBS, followed by addition of serum-free DMEM containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline, to induce protein expression, and 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Conditioned medium was harvested every 24 h, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm p-aminobenzonic acid. Conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove debris and supernatants were stored at –70 °C. FLAG-tagged α2M and b-α2M were affinity-purified from conditioned medium using an anti-FLAG M2 column (Sigma), following the manufacturer's instructions. Cross-linking—6.9 nm recombinant α2Morb-α2M was incubated 5 min with 80 mm glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in PBS at room temperature. Cross-linking was terminated by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.2 m. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% acrylamide gradient gels and subjected to immunoblotting. Determination of Ki Values and Second-order Rate Constants for BMP1-α2M Interactions—Confluent 293 T-Rex cells producing recombinant BMP1 were washed twice with PBS, and incubated 15 min in serum-free, Cys/Met-free DMEM at 37 °C. Cells were then washed once with PBS, followed by addition of serum-free DMEM containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline, to induce protein expression, 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 60 μCi/ml Pro-Mix 35S-cell labeling mixture (Amersham Biosciences). Conditioned medium was harvested every 24 h, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm p-aminobenzonic acid. Metabolically 35S-radiolabeled BMP1 was affinity purified from conditioned medium using an anti-FLAG M2 column (Sigma), following the manufacturer's instructions. 40 nm 35S-labeled BMP1 was incubated with 20, 40, 80, 160, and 240 nm plasma α2M, or recombinant wild type α2M or with 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 nm b-α2Mat37°Cin 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. Reactions were stopped at 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min (plasma α2M and recombinant wild type α2M), or at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 min (b-α2M) by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling 5 min at 95 °C. Protein samples were separated on 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels, which were then treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont) and exposed to film. Percentages of BMP1 incorporated into high molecular weight complexes were determined by densitometry and kinetic parameters were determined essentially via the method of Enghild et al. (14Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Brew K. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of Procollagen Processing by Cells—2 × 105 MC-3T3-E1 cells were plated in a 24-well plate, allowed to attach overnight, and then treated with 50 μg/ml ascorbate in DMEM, 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and incubated 15 min in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. Cells were then washed once with PBS, followed by addition of serum-free DMEM containing 50 μg/ml ascorbate, 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 nm α2M or b-α2M, or an equivalent volume of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Conditioned media were harvested after 24 h as described above. Cell layers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and scraped into hot SDS-sample buffer. Medium and cell layer samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-collagen α1(I) C-telopeptide polyclonal antibody LF67 (13Fisher L.W. Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from Larry Fisher), as described. BMP1 Cleaves α2M—Perusal of the amino acid sequence of the α2M bait region found a site comprising residues Ser687, Asp688, and surrounding residues that resembled the majority of known BMP1 cleavage sites (Fig. 1). The resemblance resided primarily in the placement of Phe684 and Tyr686 3 and 4 residues, respectively, NH2-terminal to Asp688, because residues with aromatic side chains are frequently found in positions P2–P5, and an Asp is almost always found in the P1′ position of previously identified substrates of BMP-like proteinases (2Greenspan D.S. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Moreover, the majority of previously characterized cleavage sites of BMP1-like proteinases have residues with small side chains in the P1 positions (Ref. 2Greenspan D.S. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), such that the placement of α2M Ser687 in relationship to Asp688, Phe684, and Tyr686 is also reminiscent of a BMP1 cleavage site. To test whether α2M can be cleaved by BMP1-like proteinases, the two proteins were co-incubated and α2M examined for processing. Although α2M incubated alone at 37 °C overnight was stable (Fig. 2A), 185-kDa α2M co-incubated at 37 °C overnight with BMP1 was cleaved to produce two bands of ∼100 and ∼85 kDa. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the 85-kDa band yielded the sequence SVSGKPQYMV, corresponding to the NH2 terminus of secreted α2M. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the 100-kDa band yielded the sequence DVMGRGHR, thus demonstrating cleavage of α2M by BMP1 at the predicted site between Ser687 and Asp688 in the bait region. Cleaved α2M Forms a Complex with BMP1—Because a common feature in the inhibition of proteinases by α2M is formation of a covalent complex between α2M and the proteinase, we next sought to determine the capability of α2M to covalently bind BMP1. BMP1 is normally detected on SDS-PAGE gels as a ∼90-kDa monomer (3Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), but it can also be detected as a ∼270-kDa form on a reduced gel, subsequent to incubation with α2M (Fig. 2B). Under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2C), BMP1 can be detected as even higher molecular weight forms. The 85-kDa NH2-terminal and 100-kDa COOH-terminal fragments of cleaved α2M can remain covalently bound, via disulfide linkage, and this form can be linked to other 85- and 185-kDa forms via disulfide bonds (8Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the high molecular weight forms observed under non-reducing conditions likely represent BMP1 covalently bound, via reaction with the thioester, to 185-, 270-, and 375-kDa disulfide-bonded oligomers, although the exact identity of each band on the non-reducing gel remains somewhat speculative. The above interpretations are consistent with Western blots probed with anti-α2M antibodies, which show α2M to co-localize to the same high molecular weight forms as BMP1 under both reducing (Fig. 2D) and non-reducing (Fig. 2E) conditions. The observation here of covalent binding of BMP1 to the 100-kDa α2M cleavage product is consistent with the mechanism whereby α2M has been found to covalently bind other proteinases that it inhibits (8Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). α2M Inhibits the pCP Activity of BMP1—Because the first identified and best characterized activity of BMP1 is as a pCP (15Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), we next sought to determine whether this activity is inhibited in the presence of α2M. Control experiments demonstrated that BMP1 achieves maximum cleavage of plasma α2M by 2 h (Fig. 3A). Thus, to gauge the effect of α2M-BMP1 interaction on BMP1 pCP activity, a constant amount of BMP1 (9.4 nm) was preincubated 2 h with increasing concentrations of α2M (0, 4.7, 9.4, 18.7, 37.5, 56.2, 75.0, or 93.7 nm), prior to incubation overnight with 3H-radiolabeled type I procollagen. Reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and cleavage of procollagen was measured by densitometric analysis of autofluorogams. As can be seen (Fig. 3B), prior incubation with α2M led to potent inhibition of BMP1 pCP activity, with a calculated IC50 of 4.8 nm. α2M Inhibits the Cleavage of Probiglycan by BMP1—To determine whether α2M can inhibit BMP1 cleavage of substrates other than procollagens, we tested the ability of α2Mto inhibit BMP1 cleavage of probiglycan. As can be seen (Fig. 4), BMP1 was able to completely convert probiglycan to biglycan after 30 min under assay conditions, whereas preincubation with a 5-fold molar excess of α2M for 2 h prior to incubation with probiglycan resulted in inhibition of a majority of probiglycan processing. Thus, α2M appears to be a general inhibitor of BMP1 activity against various substrates. Mechanism of α2M Inhibition of BMP1—Binding and inhibition of proteinases by α2M is thought to follow cleavage of the bait region. The latter results in activation of a highly reactive α2M thioester bond, which can form an amide bond between lysyl amino groups of the proteinase and the glutamyl residue of the thioester (8Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, cleavage of the bait region triggers a conformational change in α2M, such that it “collapses” around the proteinase, thus trapping it and inhibiting its ability to interact with large protein substrates via steric hindrance (8Feinman R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 245-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Treatment of α2M with methylamine, which reacts with the thioester, also causes conformational changes in α2M, and removes its ability to bind and inhibit proteinases by the mechanism described above. To determine whether binding and inhibition of BMP1 by α2M is likely to be via the mechanism described above, α2M was treated with methylamine prior to incubation with BMP1. BMP1 was unable to cleave methylamine-treated α2M (Fig. 5A), α2M pretreated with methylamine did not form complexes with BMP1 (Fig. 5B), and α2M pretreated with methylamine was unable to inhibit BMP1 processing of probiglycan to biglycan (Fig. 5C). Inability of BMP1 to cleave methylamine-treated α2M was probably the consequence of the conformational change induced in α2M by methylamine interaction with the α2M thioester. Subsequent to this conformational change, the bait region is presumably not available for cleavage. Together, results thus bolster the conclusion that binding of BMP1 by α2M can involve formation of an amide bond between BMP1 lysyl amino groups and the glutamyl residue of the α2M thioester, and that inhibition involves α2M conformational changes consequent to cleavage of the bait region. Modified α2M Has Enhanced Ability to Inhibit BMP1—We have previously noted wide differences in the efficiency with which different substrates are cleaved by BMP1. 4Y. Zhang, G. Ge, and D. S. Greenspan, unpublished data. One of the substrates processed most efficiently by BMP1 is probiglycan (12Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N. Troedel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether we could enhance the ability of α2M to inhibit BMP1 by replacing the native bait region with sequences surrounding the probiglycan scissile bone (see Fig. 1). It was found that the mutant recombinant α2M (b-α2M) forms complexes with and is cleaved by BMP1 more readily than plasma α2M or recombinant wild type α2M, prepared under the same conditions as b-α2M (Fig. 6A). When the pCP inhibitory activities of varying concentrations of recombinant wild type α2M and b-α2M were measured (Fig. 6, B and C) (see “Experimental Procedures”), they led to calculated IC50 values of 133 and 1.88 nm, respectively. The IC50 value of 133 nm for recombinant wild type α2M suggests considerably less effectiveness in BMP1 inhibition than the 4.82 value obtained for plasma α2M (Fig. 3B), whereas the b-α2M IC50 value of 1.88 is consistent with increased inhibitory effectiveness. In fact, because 9.4 nm BMP1 would be expected to be 50% inhibited by 4.7 nm α2M under assay conditions, if one molecule of BMP1 is inhibited by one molecule of α2M, the IC50 value of 1.88 nm suggests that molecules of b-α2M are capable of inhibiting more than one molecule of BMP1, with an approximate stoichiometry of 2 molecules of BMP1 inhibited by one molecule of b-α2M. This in turn suggests that b-α2M is cleaved very rapidly by BMP1, because only in such cases are molecules of α2M known to inhibit proteases at a greater than 1:1 ratio (5Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Swenson R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4452-4456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although cross-linking experiments demonstrated both recombinant wild type α2M and b-α2M to form tetramers (Fig. 6D), some small difference in folding and/or post-translational modification may render the activity of the recombinant wild type protein less stable over the course of the overnight pCP assay than that of the corresponding protein from plasma. Importantly, however, b-α2M is shown to have markedly improved efficiency in inhibiting BMP1 compared with wild type α2M prepared under identical conditions, or compared with plasma α2M. The improved efficiency of interaction of b-α2M with BMP1, compared with wild type α2M, is further illustrated by comparing the rapidity with which b-α2M is cleaved by BMP1 compared with cleavage of wild type recombinant or plasma α2M (Fig. 3A). To obtain a quantitative comparison of the rates of interaction of BMP1 with the various wild type and mutant forms of α2M, we employed the methodology of Enghild et al. (14Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

The homeobox gene GAX inhibits angiogenesis and induces p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in vascular ECs. To elucidate the mechanism through which GAX activates p21WAF1/CIP1 expression, we constructed GAX cDNAs with deletions of the N-terminal domain, the homeodomain, or the C-terminal domain and then assessed these constructs for their ability to activate p21WAF1/CIP1. There was an absolute requirement for the homeodomain, whereas deleting the C-terminal domain decreased but did not abolish transactivation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter by GAX. Deleting the N-terminal domain did abolish transactivation. Next, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and found, ∼15 kb upstream of the p21WAF1/CIP1 ATG codon, an ATTA-containing GAX-binding site (designated A6) with a sequence similar to that of other homeodomain-binding sites. GAX was able to bind to A6 in a homeodomain-dependent manner and thereby activate the expression of a reporter gene coupled to this sequence, and this activation was abolished by mutating specific residues in this sequence. On the basis of the sequence of A6, we were then able to locate other ATTA-containing sequences that also bound GAX and activated transcription in reporter constructs. Finally, we found that the ability of these GAX deletions to induce G0/G1 arrest correlates with their ability to transactivate the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter. We conclude that GAX activates p21WAF1/CIP1 through multiple upstream AT-rich sequences. Given the multiple biological activities of GAX in regulating EC function, identification of a putative GAX-binding site will allow the study of how GAX activates or represses other downstream targets to inhibit angiogenesis.

Angiogenesis is critical to the growth, invasion, and metastasis of human tumors because the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients is limited to <1 mm in aqueous solution (1Boehm T. Folkman J. Browder T. O'Reilly M.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Key to the process of angiogenesis is the vascular endothelial cell (EC) 2The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays. (2Folkman J. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). In health, ECs respond to a balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors secreted by various cell types to maintain blood vessel homeostasis (3Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar, 4Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Tumors hijack this process by secreting pro-angiogenic factors to supply themselves with oxygen and nutrients, a transition known as the “angiogenic switch” (3Hanahan D. Folkman J.

Because targeting angiogenesis has developed into a promising avenue of research and treatment for malignancies (5Folkman J. Cancer Biol.

Although the extracellular signals and downstream signaling pathways activated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors have been topics of intense study (6Cross M.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Pharmacol.

Finally, GAX expression also inhibits angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models (20Gorski D.H. Leal A.D. J. Surg.

In addition to the inhibition of NF-κB signaling, a potentially important mechanism through which GAX could inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis is the inhibition of cell cycle progression by activating the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (20Gorski D.H. Leal A.D. J. Surg. Res. 2003; 111: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Smith R.C. Branellec D. Gorski D.H. Guo K. Perlman H. Dedieu J.F. Pastore C. Mahfoudi A. Denefle P. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In vascular ECs, GAX also inhibits proliferation and transactivates p21WAF1/CIP1 (20Gorski D.H. Leal A.D. J. Surg. Res. 2003; 111: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the sequences in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter and the likely mechanisms through which GAX accomplishes cell cycle arrest in vascular ECs have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we dissected the GAX protein and identified its homeodomain and polyhistidine (CAX or opa) repeat as important for DNA binding and transactivation, respectively. We also identified at least two upstream sequences to which GAX binds and thereby activates p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. These findings suggest that a major component of the mechanism by which GAX inhibits angiogenesis is its ability to induce cell cycle arrest in ECs by directly activating p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and thus inhibiting the early, proliferative stage of angiogenesis. GAX may thus represent a potentially promising target for the anti-angiogenic therapy of human tumors. Cells and Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and EGM-2 medium were obtained from Cambrex Corp. (Walkersville, MD). HUVECs were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Reporter Constructs—GAX deletions were constructed by PCR. First, a full-length human GAX (amino acids 1-303; referred to as hugax) cDNA clone (32Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Patel C.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3722-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33LePage D.F. Altomare D.A. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1994; 24: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was isolated from HUVEC total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR with the appropriate primers. Next, the N-terminal fragment of GAX (hugaxNT, amino acids 1-187), hugaxΔCT (amino acids 1-245), and an N-terminal deletion fragment of GAX (hugaxΔNT, amino acids 188-303) were generated by PCR with the appropriate primers. Constructs in which either the GAX homeodomain (amino acids 188-245; hugaxΔHD) or the GAX CAX (opa) repeat (hugaxΔCAX) was deleted were produced by overlap PCR. All cDNA deletion constructs contained EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites and were initially cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), after which they were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with a FLAG tag at the N-terminal end of the peptides. Mammalian retroviruses were similarly constructed as derivatives of LZRSpBMN-Z, in which the lacZ gene had been excised to make LZRSΔ (50Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). All PCR-amplified cDNA constructs were sequenced completely, and protein expression was verified by Western blotting. The construction of the GAX expression vector pCGN-GAX and the replication-deficient adenoviral vectors expressing the rat and human homologs of GAX, all conjugated to the α-hemagglutinin epitope, has been described (37Smith R.C. Branellec D. Gorski D.H. Guo K. Perlman H. Dedieu J.F. Pastore C. Mahfoudi A. Denefle P. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The control replication-deficient adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein was a kind gift of Dr. Daniel Medina (The Cancer Institute of New Jersey). The p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter-luciferase plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Kenneth Walsh (Boston University). It contains 2.4 kb of p21WAF1/CIP1 upstream sequence beginning at nucleotide 11 in the cDNA and is the same construct used (20Gorski D.H. Leal A.D. J. Surg.

Finally, the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) gene-silencing vectors targeted at GAX (Ad.shMeox-2/GAX) and green fluorescent protein (Ad.shGFP, control) were a kind gift of Dr. Berislav Zlokovic (52Wu Z.

Gene Expression and Promoter Assays—Transfections were carried out using TransIT® Jurkat transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) according to a modification of the manufacturer's instructions. In general, a 1 μl/1 μg ratio of transfection reagent to plasmid was used, after which cells were incubated 16-24 h and then harvested for experiments. Protein Expression—Whole cell extracts from treated HUVECs were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 before being incubated with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody (mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal, mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal, mouse anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 monoclonal, and mouse anti-p53 monoclonal; Sigma) in blocking solution or rabbit anti-GAX polyclonal antibody (40Skopicki H.A. Lyons G.E. Schatteman G. Smith R.C. Andres V. Schirm S. Isner J. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Blots were washed with blocking solution and incubated with either goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Pierce) and then washed again with blocking solution. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry, with each band being normalized to α-tubulin. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays utilizing HUVECs expressing GAX and its truncated forms were carried out as follows. HUVECs were infected with LZRSΔ vector, LZRSΔ-FLAG-hugax, or LZRSΔ-hugax for 2 days and then incubated overnight in fresh EGM-2 medium. Next, formaldehyde (37%) was added directly to the tissue culture medium to a final concentration of 1% with gentle shaking for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link the protein-DNA complexes, after which a final concentration of 0.125 m glycine was added, and the cells were further incubated for 5 min to stop the cross-linking reaction. For the remaining steps of protein isolation, all buffers used to isolate the proteins contained phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS, harvested by gentle scraping, and pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C, after which the pellets were washed once with 1× PBS. The cell pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of cell lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min to release the nuclei. Following that, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysis buffer (300 μl) was added to the pelleted nuclei, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min to lyse the nuclei and to release the chromatin. Chromatin samples were sonicated on ice to an average length of 600 bp and then pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and precleared by adding 30 μl of blocked protein A beads (Sigma) to 1 ml of supernatant with gentle shaking for 30 min at 4 °C. After preclearing, the supernatant was recovered after pelleting the beads by centrifugation. Target protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated by adding 30 μl of blocked anti-FLAG antibody beads (Sigma) to each sample, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. To the immunoprecipitated input control was added 10 μl of blocked protein G beads. The antibody-protein-DNA complex samples were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed twice with 1× dialysis buffer and four times with immunoprecipitation wash buffer at room temperature. Immunoprecipitated antibody-protein-DNA complexes were eluted with 250 μl of freshly prepared immunoprecipitation elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). To reverse cross-linking, 5 m NaCl was added to each combined eluate to a final concentration of 0.3 m, followed by heating at 65 °C for 5 h. Finally, DNA was eluted into 50 μl of H2O using a DNA gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). To detect the enrichment of chromatin sequences in the immunoprecipitate due to GAX binding to the chromatin upstream of p21WAF1/CIP1, we chose ChIP primers to amplify ∼200-bp fragments at 1-2-kb intervals beginning near the p21WAF1/CIP1 start codon and continuing 15 kb upstream (Table 1). Purified DNA from each ChIP assay (0.5-1 μl) was subjected to PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 60 °C for 30 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 45 s (extension). PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. After initial identification of a putative GAX DNA-binding site, we verified that this binding depended upon the homeodomain by performing ChIP on HUVECs transduced with the GAX deletion constructs. Finally, repeat ChIP experiments were carried out to detect the binding of endogenous GAX to the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter using previously generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the GAX protein (40Skopicki H.A.

Cotransfection assays of reporter plasmid DNA and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-hugax and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-hugaxΔHD were performed as described above to determine which domains of the GAX protein are important for regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 transcription. Four DNA fragments (A-D) were extended from ChIP probes A-D (each ∼1.5 kb) and inserted into pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid-inserted fragment p21WAF1/CIP1. Promoter activities were measured using constructs with the relevant regulatory sequences placed upstream of luciferase using a plasmid containing luciferase from Renilla reniformis under the control of the SV40 promoter (pRL-SV) as a normalization control for transfection efficiency. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and firefly luciferase activity from the p21WAF1/CIP1-luciferase promoter construct was normalized to constitutive Renilla luciferase activity. For each experiment, HUVECS at ∼80% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with different amounts of plasmid as described for individual experiments. HUVECs were then incubated with transfection reagents for 3 h and refreshed overnight with fresh endothelial cell basal medium and supplements (Cambrex Corp.). Empty pcDNA3.1-FLAG vector was used to equalize the total plasmid DNA transfected for each well. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—After each ChIP assay, the resuspended chromatin immunoprecipitate and flow-through were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR utilizing TaqMan probes (53Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar) to determine whether the immunoprecipitate was enriched in the p21WAF1/CIP1 upstream chromatin sequences of interest. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using a Cepheid SmartCycler thermocycler, with the associated SmartCycler Version 2.0 software used to analyze the data and to determine the threshold count (Ct) for each reaction. The fluorophore used was SYBR Green, and the sequences of the primers and probes were the same as those used in the initial ChIP reaction described above. Real-time PCR cycles started with an initial 1.5-min denaturation step at 95 °C, followed by 30-40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 56 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Each sample was run in triplicate, and Ct was determined for the target gene. To normalize the signal for each ChIP target and to identify which targets were enriched in the chromatin by GAX expression, immunoprecipitate and flow-through target gene levels were normalized to β-actin sequence levels using the ΔΔCt method (54Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25860) Google Scholar) as described previously (55Gorski D.H. Leal A.D. Goydos J.S. J. Am. Coll.

More interestingly, this protein is unusual in that exposure or assay in the presence of oxygen and high levels of CO2 resulted in substantial loss (85-90%) of activity compared with assays performed under strictly anaerobic conditions. Kinetic studies indicated that A. fulgidus RbcL2 possesses an unusually high affinity for oxygen (Ki = 5 μm); O2 is a competitive inhibitor with respect to CO2, yet the high affinity for O2 presumably accounts for the inability of high levels of CO2 to prevent inhibition. Comparative bioinformatic analyses of available archaeal Rubisco sequences were conducted to provide clues as to why the RbcL2 protein might possess such a high affinity for oxygen. These analyses suggested the potential importance of several unique residues, as did additional analyses within the context of available form I-III Rubisco structures. One residue unique to archaeal proteins (Met-295) was of particular interest because of its proximity to known active-site residues. Recombinant M295D A. fulgidus Rubisco was less sensitive to oxygen compared with the wild-type enzyme. This residue, along with other potential changes in conserved residues of form III Rubiscos, may provide an understanding as to how Rubisco may have evolved to function in the presence of air.

Several eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms are able to obtain all needed carbon by directly assimilating and reducing CO2. The major mechanism by which CO2 is assimilated in nature is via the Calvin-Benson-Basham (CBB) 2The abbreviations used are: CBB, Calvin-Benson-Basham; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate; 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; 2-PG, 2-phosphoglycolate; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. reductive pentose phosphate pathway. There are two unique enzymatic reactions in this pathway that allow CO2 to serve as the sole carbon source for growth. The first of these is catalyzed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that catalyzes the actual CO2 fixation reaction. The other unique enzyme is phosphoribulokinase, which catalyzes the synthesis of the substrate or CO2 acceptor compound for Rubisco, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). The mechanism of Rubisco catalysis is well defined (1Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rubisco initially catalyzes formation of an enediolate intermediate between the second and third carbons of RuBP; this allows for a nucleophilic attack by the gaseous substrate CO2, resulting in the formation of a six-carbon intermediate that is subsequently lysed into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). Alternatively, molecular oxygen may also serve as a gaseous substrate through a similar nucleophilic attack at the same enediol-enzyme complex, forming instead a five-carbon peroxide intermediate that is also subsequently cleaved to form two different products, one molecule of 3-PGA and one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG). The 3-PGA product formed by Rubisco is further utilized in the CBB pathway to regenerate RuBP to supply other carbon intermediates for growth. Unfortunately, the 2-PG product formed as a consequence of O2 fixation to the enediolate intermediate is further oxidatively metabolized, leading to the eventual loss of carbon from the organism, making the oxygenase function of Rubisco inimical to maximizing net CO2 fixation. The relative rates of the competing carboxylase and oxygenase reactions (vc/vo) catalyzed by Rubisco, performed at particular CO2 and O2 concentrations, provide a means to quantify the enzyme's inherent ability to distinguish between the two substrates such that vc/vo =Ω[CO2]/[O2], where Ω is the specificity factor. In addition, Ω = VcKo/VoKc, where (Vmax/Km) reflect the cataytic efficiencies for the carboxylase (Vo/Kc) and oxygenase (Vo/Ko) reactions, respectively. Rubisco is arguably the most abundant protein on earth (2Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 241-244Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (451) Google Scholar). This protein plays an important role in the photosynthetic tissue of higher forms of eukaryotic life such as terrestrial plants, but may also be found in lower phototrophic eukaryotes such as green, red, and brown algae and in prokaryotic cyanobacteria and phototrophic eubacteria. Moreover, large numbers of chemoautotrophic prokaryotes, which grow in the absence of light and use dark chemical reactions to provide the energy to support growth, depend on Rubisco and the CBB CO2 fixation pathway (2Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Rubisco molecules from these sources have been previously categorized into two groups (forms I and II) based on their sequence homology and structural similarities (2Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The form I Rubisco structure is a complex holoenzyme composed of eight large (L; catalytic) subunits and eight small (S) subunits in an (L2)4(S2)4 configuration. The form I enzymes are found in virtually all eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms and also in all cyanobacteria and most eubacteria that use the CBB pathway to assimilate CO2. The form II Rubiscos have a more simple structure, composed solely of large subunits in an (L2)n configuration, which share ∼25-30% amino acid identity with form I large subunits. Form II proteins are found in various purple photosynthetic bacteria, chemoautotrophs, and eukaryotic marine dinoflagellates (2Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The important kinetic constants of diverse forms of Rubisco, particularly Ω and Kc, differ considerably even among closely related and structurally similar proteins (4Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Horken K.M. Tabita F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); however, there is little molecular understanding as to the basis for this variation. Although all Rubisco proteins conserve key residues for known mechanistically important functions (1Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar), it is apparent that different non-conserved residues and regions of the protein must influence the specificity of the substrates carbon dioxide and oxygen. The focus of engineering a more efficient Rubisco would involve changing the specificity factor of the enzyme by either increasing the carboxylase or decreasing the oxygenase activity or somehow altering the relative affinity for either CO2 or O2 (6Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Clearly, before such molecular engineering feats should be considered, it will be most important to understand the factors that mitigate and influence the different kinetic properties of the enzyme. Recently completed fully sequenced genomes from Archaea have indicated the presence of Rubisco genes in several organisms, although there is no evidence that the CBB reductive pentose phosphate pathway provides a major means by which these organisms assimilate CO2 (7Deppenmeier U.

Rather, Rubisco and a novel pathway to synthesize RuBP appear to be used for a type of pyrimidine salvage pathway in methanogenic Archaea (13Finn M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6360-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has determined that the archaeal Rubisco genes from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, and Methanosarcina acetivorans encode bona fide Rubiscos, capable of catalyzing substantial activity, both in the native organisms as well as within Escherichia coli (11Watson G.M.F. Yu J. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Finn M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, the archaeal genes can be expressed in a phototrophic eubacterial host in which the native Rubisco genes have been inactivated such that the archaeal genes may complement the organism to allow CO2-dependent growth (12Finn M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence homologies, archaeal Rubiscos represent a special class of enzyme, termed form III (2Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14Watson G.M.F. Tabita F.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 13-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to distinguish these enzymes from previously characterized form I and II Rubiscos. Even with these considerable differences in primary sequence, the form III enzymes retain many features characteristic of all forms of Rubisco, mainly the ability to carry out carboxylation as a consequence of conservation of the key residues implicated in catalysis (11Watson G.M.F. Yu J. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as discussed above. The A. fulgidus rbcL2 gene encodes a protein (RbcL2) of 441 amino acids with a monomer molecular mass of 48.5 kDa. This form III Rubisco exists as a homodimer, as do the enzymes from M. jannaschii and M. acetivorans (11Watson G.M.F. Yu J. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Finn M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this respect, the quaternary structure of the three form III archaeal enzymes resembles the bacterial form II Rubisco from Rhodospirillum rubrum (15Tabita F.R. McFadden B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3459-3464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, A. fulgidus RbcL2 exhibits unique properties not found in other forms of Rubisco such as optimal activity at temperatures exceeding 80 °C. In addition, this protein is highly sensitive yet reversibly inhibited upon exposure to air levels of oxygen, necessitating that the enzyme be prepared under strictly anaerobic conditions to obtain optimal activity. This enzyme is derived from a very strict anaerobe, and like other Rubiscos, there are no motifs that suggest oxygen involvement in stability. In this study, we have focused on this unusual reversible inhibition by low concentrations of oxygen and examined the possible involvement with a unique residue (Met-295) that appears to be located at an influential site within the structure of the protein. The unique oxygen sensitivity of the form III archaeal Rubiscos may provide clues as to how the active site of this enzyme has evolved to become more stable in the presence of oxygen in more evolutionarily advanced form I and II Rubisco proteins. Plasmids, Bacterial Strains, and Growth Conditions—All cloning steps were performed in E. coli JM109 (16Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) prior to transformation into E. coli BL21 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for overexpression of the rbcL2 gene. E. coli cultures were grown in LB medium containing 1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% (w/v) NaCl. A. fulgidus rbcL2 (AF_1638, NCBI accession number NC_000917) was cloned directly from genomic DNA. Primers designed with an NdeI restriction site (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCGGAGTTTGAGATTTACAGA-3′) at the N terminus and a BamHI restriction site (5′-GCGGATCCTTAGATTGGCGTAACCCTG-3′) at the C terminus were used to amplify the rbcL2 gene from A. fulgidus genomic DNA with Pfu polymerase. The gene was ligated into PCR-Script® (Stratagene) and sequenced for PCR-incorporated mutations. The gene was subcloned into pET11a using the NdeI and BamHI sites in that vector. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (17Papworth C. Bauer J.C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Crossref Google Scholar). The Met-295 ATG sequence within the A. fulgidus rbcL2 gene was replaced with GCG, TTC, and GAC to obtain alanine, phenylalanine, and aspartate, respectively, at this position. Automated sequencing was performed to confirm the sequences of mutant genes using a Model 3730 DNA analyzer system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the Ohio State University Plant-Microbe Genomics Facility. The mutant genes were inserted into fresh pET11a plasmid after digestion with NdeI and BamHI. Overexpression of the rbcL2 Gene and Purification of Recombinant RbcL2 Protein—E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with a pET11a vector containing the A. fulgidus rbcL2 gene, and overnight tube cultures were used to inoculate 2.8-liter broad-bottom flasks containing 2 liters of medium. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C and shaken at 120 rpm to minimize aeration until the culture reached A600 = 0.4. The temperature of the cultures was then raised to 42 °C for 30 min to heat-shock the cultures, resulting in an increase in the amount of soluble recombinant protein (12Finn M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cultures were allowed to cool to room temperature before inducing with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to shake at 120 rpm for 16 h at room temperature. Cells were harvested and washed with anaerobic wash buffer (100 mm Bicine-NaOH (pH 8.3), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) and placed in an anaerobic chamber. Cells were centrifuged again in anaerobic screw cap centrifuge tubes with rubber seals. Cell pellets were recovered in the chamber and stored at -70 °C before further protein purification. All subsequent preparation and manipulation of the cell material were performed in an anaerobic chamber. Prior to column chromatography, cells were resuspended in wash buffer supplemented with 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 μg/ml DNase I and then disrupted using a pressurized French pressure cell (at 110,000 kilopascals) flowing directly into a sealed anaerobic serum vial sparged with argon gas. The lysed cells were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in screw cap centrifuge tubes with rubber seals. The supernatant was decanted into a serum vial, placed in an 80 °C water bath for 20 min, and plunged into an ice bath for 1 h. The heat-stable extract was transferred to a fresh screw cap centrifuge tube with a rubber seal and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was syringe-filtered using 0.22-μm filters before loading onto columns. Column chromatography was performed under anaerobic conditions using a BioLogic HR workstation (Bio-Rad). Heat-stable extract was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose strong anion-exchange column equilibrated with wash buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaHCO3 and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A). Samples were eluted in a 0-2 m NaCl gradient in Buffer A; recombinant A. fulgidus RbcL2 eluted at ∼0.4 m NaCl. Fractions were monitored for activity using a modified protocol of the standard Rubisco assay under anaerobic conditions (18Tabita F.R. Caruso P. Whitman W. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fractions with high activity were pooled, concentrated with a Millipore concentrator (molecular weight cutoff of 30,000), and loaded onto a 110-ml Superose 12 gel filtration column. Fractions with high activity were again pooled and further purified based on hydrophobic interaction using a phenyl-Sepharose column. Samples were eluted with buffers of decreasing salt content starting with 2 m (NH4)2SO4. Recombinant A. fulgidus RbcL2 was found to elute at ∼0.4 m (NH4)2SO4. Purified protein was stored in 20% glycerol at -70 °C in anaerobically sealed serum vials. Radiometric Rubisco Assays—A. fulgidus RbcL2 was assayed for activity under a strictly anaerobic atmosphere unless noted otherwise. The previously described assay was used and modified to optimize carboxylase activity (18Tabita F.R. Caruso P. Whitman W. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Buffers and substrates were bubbled with argon gas in sealed glass serum vials prior to use. In an anaerobic chamber, enzyme was prepared in glass serum vials in wash buffer supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl. Vials were sealed in the chamber and then placed in a Reacti-Therm III™ heating/stirring module (Pierce) set at 83 °C after the addition of 50 mm NaHCO3 in Bicine-NaOH buffer containing 2 μCi of NaH14CO3. Reactions were initiated by the addition of anaerobic RuBP and stopped by the addition of aerobic propionic acid. Vials were unsealed and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 65 °C. Samples were resuspended in 200 μl of 1 n HCl and counted in 3 ml of scintillation mixture using a Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). The Bradford method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) was used to determine protein concentrations with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Kinetic Measurements—Purified enzymes were used for all kinetic measurements of kcat, KCO2, KO2KRuBP (Km for RuBP), and Ω unless noted otherwise. The KCO2 was determined under strictly anaerobic conditions using sealed vials as described previously (20Smith S. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with few modifications. Dilutions of NaH14CO3 were prepared in 100 mm Bicine-NaOH buffer with 10 mm MgCl2. The pH of the buffer was usually ∼8.3, and the exact pH was recorded for each assay. Assays were performed at 83 °C, initiated by the addition of anaerobic RuBP, and terminated after 30 s by the addition of aerobic propionic acid. Vials were unsealed and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 65 °C. Products were resuspended in 1 n HCl and counted in scintillation mixture. Results were plotted using SigmaPlot 2002 (Version 8.0), deriving the KCO2 and KO2 by fitting values to a hyperbolic curve and double-reciprocal plot. The concentration of CO2 was derived using the pH and the Henderson-Hasselbach relationship. The solubility of CO2 at 83 °C was calculated from published values (21Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 13th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1985Google Scholar) to obtain an equation that was extrapolated to 83 °C. Various concentrations of oxygen were introduced into the vials by removing a certain percent of the anaerobic headspace and replacing it with the same amount of oxygen from a sealed serum vial sparged with pure oxygen. The solubility of oxygen was determined using available solubility charts (Unisense A/S, Aarhus, Denmark). The salinity of the buffer used for each assay was calculated. The amount of soluble oxygen (micromolar) based on the salinity and temperature under the assay conditions was provided by the charts and used in determining the amount of oxygen present in each vial. The KRuBP was measured as described for the KCO2, determined under strictly anaerobic conditions in sealed serum vials at 83 °C. Various concentrations of RuBP were prepared and sparged with argon gas. Assays were initiated by the addition of RuBP to the assay vials containing activated enzyme; the reaction was stopped after 30 s by the addition of aerobic propionic acid. Samples were dried overnight, resuspended, and counted in scintillation mixture. Results were plotted using SigmaPlot 2002 (Version 8.0). Specificity was measured under conditions of saturating O2 with 100 mm NaHCO3 in 100 mm Bicine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.3) and 10 mm MgCl2. The concentration of CO2 was calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbach relationship as described above for the KCO2. The solubility of oxygen was determined using available solubility charts as described above. The solubility of CO2 at 83 °C was calculated from published values (21Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 13th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1985Google Scholar) to obtain an equation that was extrapolated to 83 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [1-3H]RuBP and incubated at 83 °C for 2 h. Reaction products were separated with a Mono Q resin using a Dionex DX500 chromatography system and detected with an in-line scintillation counter (β-RAM, IN/US Systems, Inc., Tampa, FL) as described (22Harpel M.R. Lee E.H. Hartman F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Modeling of A. fulgidus RbcL2 was performed using Deep-View Swiss-PdbViewer Version 3.7 (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar). The template used to model the dimer form of the enzyme was the Thermococcus kodakaraensis strain KOD1 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1GEH) (24Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindvalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27925) Google Scholar); this is the closest related Rubisco large subunit and is 72% identical at the amino acid level to A. fulgidus RbcL2. General Properties of A. fulgidus RbcL2—It is clear that Rubisco from the Archaea A. fulgidus (RbcL2) may be considered a member of a rather discrete class of proteins that are easily distinguished from the well described form I and II Rubiscos (2Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 6Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Watson G.M.F. Tabita F.R. FEMS Microbiol.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the form III A. fulgidus enzyme possesses characteristic Rubisco motifs found in both form I and II Rubisco large subunits (1Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 25Gutteridge S. Gatenby A.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, the A. fulgidus RbcL2 enzyme is a homodimeric protein (12Finn M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with each monomer composed of 441 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48.5 kDa. RbcL2 shows 41% amino acid identity to the large subunit of the Synechococcus ssp. strain PCC 6301 Rubisco, a representative form I enzyme, and shows 33% amino acid identity to the R. rubrum enzyme, a typical form II Rubisco. The form I Synechococcus PCC 6301 and form II R. rubrum large subunits exhibit 33% identity to each other. Moreover, among other well studied form III Rubiscos, A. fulgidus RbcL2 shows close sequence (72%) identity to T. kodakaraensis strain KOD1 RbcL, but only 44% identity to M. jannaschii RbcL. The crystal structures of the form I Synechococcus PCC 6301 (Protein Data Bank code 1RBL), form II R. rubrum (code 5RUB), and form III T. kodakaraensis (code 1GEH) Rubiscos have been solved (27Lundqvist T. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12604-12611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol.

Despite overall low sequence homology between representative enzymes from different groups, there is conservation of almost all critical active-site residues that are within 3.3 Å of the bound substrate analog 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate within the active site of the Synechococcus PCC 6301 enzyme (28Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the lone exception being position 170 (Fig. 1). It is also clear that what might be termed the Rubisco motif (GXDFXKXDE) is conserved in all Rubiscos, with only the phenylalanine residue within this region replaced with leucine or tyrosine in the form III enzymes from M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus/T. kodakaraensis, respectively. It is the lysine residue within this motif that becomes carbamylated during “activation” of the enzyme, with the negatively charged aspartate and glutamate residues functioning to bind divalent cations to stabilize the carbamylated lysine (1Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). At this time, it is not known whether Phe-170 or residues substituted in this position are required for catalysis (1Cleland W.W. Andrews T.J. Gutteridge S. Hartman F.C. Lorimer G.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Andersson I. Knight S. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. Branden C.-I. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 229-234Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although the deduced sequence of A. fulgidus RbcL2 is more homologous to form I large subunits, no small subunit has been detected in the genome of this organism, and residues previously shown to make contact with small subunits of the form I large subunits (11Watson G.M.F. Yu J. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are poorly conserved within the large subunit polypeptide of A. fulgidus RbcL2. Some of these small subunit contact residues are, however, conserved in the form II R. rubrum enzyme, which also does not have small subunits (31Tabita F.R. McFadden B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3459-3466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A. fulgidus rbcL2 gene was overexpressed i"

Specifically, 2-[(5-fluoresceinyl)aminocarbonyl]ethyl methanethiosulfonate was conjugated to a free cysteine on loop C and to five substituted cysteines at strategic locations in the subunit sequence, and the backbone flexibility around each site of conjugation was measured with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy. The sites examined were in loop C (Cys-188 using a C187S mutant), in the β9 strand (T177C), in the β10 strand (D194C), in the β8-β9 loop (N158C and Y164C), and in the β7 strand (K139C). Conjugated fluorophores at these locations show distinctive anisotropy decay patterns indicating different degrees of segmental fluctuations near the agonist binding pocket. Ligand occupation and decay of anisotropy were assessed for one agonist (epibatidine) and two antagonists (α-bungarotoxin and d-tubocurarine). The Y164C and Cys-188 conjugates were also investigated with additional agonists (nicotine and carbamylcholine), partial agonists (lobeline and 4-hydroxy,2-methoxy-benzylidene anabaseine), and an antagonist (methyllycaconitine). With the exception of the T177C conjugate, both agonists and antagonists perturbed the backbone flexibility of each site; however, agonist-selective changes were only observed at Y164C in loop F where the agonists and partial agonists increased the range and/or rate of the fast anisotropy decay processes.

Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Before the availability of an atomic-resolution model of the nAChR, the agonist/antagonist binding site was localized to subunit interfaces and mapped with reference to the primary subunit sequences by mutagenesis and chemical modification. Seven segments that appeared to form the agonist/antagonist binding pocket were identified and arbitrarily denoted alphabetically as segments A-C (in the so-called “principal” subunit face that include the distinctive vicinal cysteines in loop C) D-F (in the neighboring and so-called “complementary” subunit) (2Changeux J.P.

Great insight into the structure of the nAChR has come from analyses of x-ray crystallographic structures of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V.

AChBPs are soluble homopentameric proteins that are found in several salt and fresh water mollusks and share close structural identity with the extracellular domain of the Torpedo nAChR. AChBP appears to be both a structural and functional surrogate for the extracellular domain of the nAChR. In fact, acetylcholine activates a channel of a chimera formed from a modified AChBP and the ion-channel domain of the 5-HT3 receptor (10Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that the molecular basis for ligand gating of ion channels is conserved across the entire pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. The most recent electron micrograph reconstruction of the receptor in Torpedo electroplax membranes has yielded a 4-Å-resolution model of the Torpedo nAChR, and by superimposing the AChBP structure on to the receptor a detailed template of the entire receptor has been developed (11Unwin N.

A fundamental question in receptor structure-function relationships now focuses on the molecular basis for agonist activation of these channels since the residues that form the extracellular binding site lie some distance from the ion gate in the transmembrane domain. The most studied allosteric gating theory posits a series of intraprincipal subunit rigid-body movements that starts with a twisting, inward movement of the β9-β10 hairpin (loop C) toward acetylcholine as it binds in a crevice formed by the β9-β10 hairpin and a portion of the β7-β8 loop (loop B) in the principal subunit and elements of the β5 and β6 strands in the complementary subunit (8Hansen S.B.

This movement is then thought to effect a displacement of the β1-β2 loop next to the transmembrane helix (M2) lining the ion channel in the same subunit as the β9-β10 hairpin, that in turn leads to channel opening. We reasoned that this intrasubunit mechanistic linkage or one involving the adjacent subunit would require agonist-specific changes in the α-carbonyl backbone mobility along an activation pathway that extends to the transmembrane ion gate. To examine the potential role of regions near the acetylcholine binding site in initiating conformational changes that may result in an activation signal, we measured the influence of nicotinic ligands on α-carbon backbone flexibility using AChBP as a receptor surrogate and a combination of site-directed labeling and fluorescence spectroscopy. Specifically, fluorescein was selectively conjugated to five substituted cysteines and a free cysteine in separate mutants of the Lymnaea stagnalis AChBP, and the backbone flexibility around each site of conjugation was assessed by monitoring the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of the reporter group. Of the six sites examined, one was in the β9-β10 hairpin at the tip of loop C (Cys-188 using a C187S mutant), one in the β9 strand (T177C), one was in the β10 strand (D194C), two were in the loop connecting the β8 and β9 strands (N158C and Y164C, loop F), and one was in the β7 strand (K139C). In the absence of ligand regional variation in α-carbon backbone mobility was observed, with loop C being the most ordered. Ligand-induced changes in loop C mobility did not correlate with agonist-antagonist behavior; however, the loop F site Y164C was found to undergo agonist-specific changes in mobility. Ligands and Labeling Reagents—(+)Epibatidine, α-bungarotoxin, nicotine, lobeline, and carbamylcholine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. d-Tubocurarine chloride was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Methyllycaconitine citrate (MLA) was from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). 4-Hydroxy,2-methoxybenzylidene anabaseine (4-OH,2MeOBA) was obtained from Dr. William Kem at the University of Florida. 2-[(5-Fluoresceinyl)aminocarbonyl]ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-Fl) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Ontario, Canada). α-125I-Labeled bungarotoxin (specific activity, 130 Ci/mmol) and (+/-)-[3H]epibatidine (specific activity, 65 Ci/mmol) were products of PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tetramethylrhodamine-α-bungarotoxin (TMR-Bgt) was purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Expression, Mutagenesis, and Purification of AChBP—Wild-type AChBP from L. stagnalis was expressed from a cDNA synthesized from oligonucleotides selected for mammalian codon usage, as previously described (14Hansen S.B.

Briefly, the cDNAs were inserted into a pFLAG-CMV-3 expression vector (Sigma) containing a preprotrypsin leader peptide followed by an NH2-terminal 1× FLAG epitope. A COOH-terminal His6 tag was attached to the protein for radioligand binding assays. Stable cell lines of single cysteine mutants of AChBP were generated as previously described (16Hibbs R.E. Talley T.T. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28483-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). AChBPs, typically in amounts between 4 and 6 mg, were purified from tissue culture medium by adsorption onto an α-FLAG antibody column and elution with FLAG peptide as previously described (16Hibbs R.E. Talley T.T. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28483-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purity and assembly of subunits as a pentamer were assessed by SDSPAGE and fast protein liquid chromatography. We attempted to engineer single cysteines at sites in loop C other than those presented in this study, but our attempts (T184C, Y185C, S186C, P189C, E190C, Y192C, E193C) resulted in non or weak binding, presumably misfolded protein. Radioligand Binding Assays—A scintillation proximity assay (Amersham Biosciences) was adapted for use in a soluble radioligand binding assay as previously described (16Hibbs R.E. Talley T.T. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28483-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, AChBP (0.5 nm binding sites) was incubated with increasing concentrations of either 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin or (+/-)-[3H]epibatidine in a solution of 0.1 mg/ml anti-His scintillation proximity assay beads. In competition assays, 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin was held constant at 20 nm, and the competing ligand was added in variable concentrations. Radioactivity was measured on a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Conversions from EC50 to KD were made with the Prism 4 software package from GraphPad Software, Inc (San Diego, CA) using a sigmoidal dose-response plot with a variable slope fitting. All radioligand binding data are averages of at least three replicate experiments. MTS-Fl Labeling—For each mutant, MTS-Fl and AChBP were dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, to final binding site concentrations of 100 and 20 μm, respectively. After 60 min at room temperature and shielded from light, the reaction mixtures were eluted through G-25 Sephadex columns (20 × 1 cm; Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to remove unconjugated MTS-Fl. Specific labeling was assessed by comparison of fluorophore emission at equilibrium from the labeled mutant with that of a sample of WT AChBP that was labeled in parallel with the mutant after standardization to protein concentration by UV absorbance. Steady-state emission spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jobin Yvon/Spex FluoroMax II spectrofluorometer (Instrument S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ) with the excitation and emission bandwidths set at 2 nm. In all cases nonspecific labeling was ≤5%. Stoichiometry of labeling for each preparation was estimated from a comparison of fluorophore concentration (absorbance at 496 nm for MTS-Fl, extinction coefficient 85,000 m-1 cm-1) and protein concentration (by absorbance at 280 nm, extinction coefficient 268,000 m-1 cm-1). Stoichiometries of labeling for each mutant were as follows: K139C, 19%; N158C, 10%; Y164C, 32%; T177C, 19%; C187S, 22%; D194C, 37%. Stopped-flow Kinetic Measurements—Stopped-flow experiments on ligand association and dissociation kinetics were conducted using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV (Leatherhead, UK) stopped-flow spectrofluorometer. The Fl-Cys-188 AChBP mutant was excited at 490 nm, and a 515-nm cut-on filter was used to select the fluorescence signal. The second-order association rate constants for binding of α-bungarotoxin and epibatidine were determined from the slope of plots of the observed rate of fluorescence change versus ligand concentration. The first-order rate constant of α-bungarotoxin dissociation was determined by mixing the preformed AChBP:α-bungarotoxin complex with concentrations of epibatidine in large excess over its KD and measuring the rate of resulting change in fluorescence. Because binding of epibatidine resulted in a smaller fluorescence enhancement than α-bungarotoxin, a decrease in fluorescein emission was observed. The first-order rate constant of epibatidine dissociation was measured by mixing the preformed AChBP-epibatidine complex with concentrations of gallamine (which alone gave no fluorescence enhancement) in large excess over its KD and observing the time course of the decrease in fluorescein emission. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined as a ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants. Similar experiments were performed with Fl-D194C to monitor epibatidine binding and Fl-Y164C to monitor α-bungarotoxin binding. In the case of Fl-D194C the competing ligand used to determine the dissociation rate was α-bungarotoxin, and for Fl-Y164C the competing ligand was epibatidine. Estimation of Ligand Dissociation Constants by Fluorescein to Tetramethylrhodamine Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—In cases where ligand binding yielded little change in fluorescein fluorescence, we employed TMR conjugated to α-bungarotoxin to measure ligand occupation. Proximity of the Fl-TMR pair yields donor (Fl) quenching and acceptor (TMR) fluorescence sensitization. Excitation and emission spectra of this fluorescent pair shows excellent donor-acceptor overlap free from interference from the native protein fluorescence (17Johnson D.A. Voet J.G. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5717-5725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The titrations provide a direct estimate of the dissociation constant for the substituted toxin. Association of competing ligands were estimated by back titration and concomitant reversal of FRET. Time-resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy—Emission anisotropy was determined as previously described (18Hibbs R.E. Johnson D.A. Shi J. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16602-16611Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, emission anisotropy decay was analyzed with the impulse reconvolution method implemented in the DAS6™ software package from HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd. (Glasgow, UK) described elsewhere (19Birch D.J.S. Imhof R.E. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy: Techniques. 1. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-95Google Scholar). Briefly and simply, this approach splits the analysis into two steps, analysis of the total emission decay, S(t), followed by analysis of the vertical/perpendicular difference emission decay, D(t). S(t), free of anisotropy effects, is given by the expression S(t)=I∥(t)+G·I⊥(t)(Eq. 1) and was analyzed as a biexponential function. D(t), which includes both fluorescence and anisotropy parameters, is given by the expression D(t)=I∥(t)+G·I⊥(t).(Eq. 2) D(t) is deconvolved with the results from the S(t) analysis as a constraint, yielding r(t)=β1exp(-t/ϕ1)+β2exp(-t/ϕ2).(Eq. 3) D(t) is deconvolved with the results from the S(t) analysis as a constraint, yielding Here, β1 and β2 are the amplitudes of the anisotropy at time 0 for the fast and slow anisotropy decay processes, respectively. φ1 and φ2 are the fast and slow rotational correlation times of the anisotropy decay, respectively. We define the fractional magnitude of the observable anisotropy decay associated with the “fast” diffusional processes as fxb, which is equal to β1/(β1 + β2), and the ratio fxb/φ1, which is a complex function of the rate and range of fast diffusional processes that are usually associated with segmental motion around each site of fluorophore conjugation (20Shi J. Tai K. McCammon J.A. Taylor P. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30905-30911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A nonassociative model was assumed, where the emission relaxation times are common to all the rotational correlation times. Goodness of fit was evaluated from the values of the reduced χ2r and by visual inspection of the weighted residual plots. Production and Characterization of Cysteine Mutants—Six single-residue substitution mutants of the AChBP from Lymnaea were engineered; five cysteine substitution mutants (K139C, N158C, Y164C, T177C, and D194C) and a serine substitution mutant (C187S) (Fig. 1A). The C187S mutant prevented the normal disulfide bond formation between Cys-187 and Cys-188 and, in turn, allowed for selective labeling of Cys-188. Radioligand binding assays were used with a pair of reference ligands for each AChBP mutant to verify that mutagenesis had not affected the overall fold or structure of the binding site (Table 1). Direct saturation binding measurements were made with α-125I-labeled bungarotoxin, and in separate experiments the KD for epibatidine (Fig. 2) was determined by competition against the radiolabeled α-neurotoxin. All the mutants retained a high affinity for both ligands assayed. The largest deviations from wild-type affinity observed for the substituted cysteines was the D194C mutant, which lost ∼25-fold in binding affinity for α-bungarotoxin, and the C187S mutant, which lost ∼200-fold in binding affinity for epibatidine. Even in these most-extreme cases, the cysteine-substituted AChBP mutants bind the reference ligands with dissociation constants in the low to mid nanomolar range. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction determinants are maintained but with lower interaction energy for the D194C and C187S substitution mutants. Losses in binding affinity at other mutation positions were judged to be small and non-significant when compared with the unmodified enzyme.TABLE 1KD values for AChBP mutants with reference ligandsAChBP mutantKD α-BungarotoxinKD EpibatidinenmnmWT1.80.16K139C160.22N158C1.60.16Y164C2.20.36T177C1.80.19C187S2020D194C461.7 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Structures of the fluorescent probe MTS-Fl and the nicotinic ligands used in anisotropy decay analyses. The pharmacologic activities of the majority of ligands used in these experiments have been well studied (38Daly J.W. Cell. Mol.

Epibatidine, nicotine, and carbamylcholine are classical full agonists at muscle and neuronal nAChRs, whereas d-tubocurarine, α-bungarotoxin, and MLA are competitive antagonists. Lobeline is reported as a mixed agonist/antagonist of nAChRs; in AChBP it induces conformations, mimicking other agonists (8Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). 4-OH,2MeOBA is the primary active metabolite of 2,4-dimethoxy-benzylidene-anabaseine (also known as GTS-21) and shows partial agonism selective for α7 receptors (39Meyer E.M.

We observed, however, that binding of both α-bungarotoxin and epibatidine to the Fl-labeled mutant resulted in a substantial enhancement of steady-state fluorescence. Accordingly, using stopped-flow measurements of ligand association and dissociation rates, we were able to determine the KD from the ratio of kinetic constants for both α-bungarotoxin and epibatidine at the covalently modified binding site. Although both α-bungarotoxin and epibatidine lost approximately 2 orders of magnitude in binding affinity to the Fl-Cys-188 protein, they still bound to AChBP with appreciable affinities (KD = 1.6 and 0.05 μm, respectively), strongly suggesting substantial retention of the configuration of the binding site (Table 2).TABLE 2KD values for representative AChBP-fluorescein conjugatesAChBP MutantKD EpibatidineKD α-BungarotoxinKD TMR-BgtnmnmnmWTaKD of ligands for WT AChBP was determined by radioligand binding assay as described in Table 1.0.161.817Fl-Y164CNDbND, not determined.14cKD of ligands for the labeled binding sites was estimated from direct measurements of association and dissociation rates of ligand binding by stopped-flow methods exciting the conjugated fluorescein at 490 nm and selecting the fluorescein emission signal with a 515-nm cut-off filter.

Open table in a new tab For the cysteine substitutions and conjugations that exhibited little or no change in fluorescence anisotropy upon ligand binding, it was necessary to demonstrate that the ligands studied are in fact bound to the Fl-labeled binding site at the concentrations used in the anisotropy experiments. To this end steady-state emission spectra for Fl-T177C were measured at room temperature as described for the determination of nonspecific labeling (See “Experimental Procedures”). Saturation binding of a TMR conjugate of α-bungarotoxin was monitored upon excitation of fluorescein at 485 nm by observing the quenching of fluorescein fluorescence emission at 515 nm; incremental increases in the concentration of the TMR-Bgt resulted in incremental decreases in Fl-T177C fluorescein emission due to FRET from fluorescein to TMR (Fig. 3, A and B). Because the minimum concentration of binding sites required for a fully quantifiable signal was ∼100 nm, the dissociation constant determined in this manner for the fluorescein-labeled T177C mutant could only be estimated to be ≤45 nm (Table 2).

(cluster of differentiation 1) family consists of five transmembrane glycoproteins encoded by linked genes (1Brigl M. Brenner M.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 817-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). They are divided into two groups based on amino acid sequence homology; group 1 includes CD1a, -b, and -c, and group 2 consists of CD1d, the only isoform present in mice and rats. The fifth member of the family, CD1e, has an amino acid sequence intermediate between the two groups. CD1 heavy chains are structurally similar to MHC class I molecules and possess a short C-terminal cytosolic tail, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an extracellular region that interacts non-covalently with β2-microglobulin (β2m). The role of CD1 molecules is to bind lipid antigens and present them to T cells, and the α1 and α2 domains of the extracellular region fold in a similar manner to the analogous domains in MHC class I molecules to generate the lipid binding site. CD1 heavy chain folding and association with β2m occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After exiting the ER, the assembled CD1 molecules pass through the secretory pathway and reach the plasma membrane. From there, with the exception of CD1a, they enter the endocytic system by adaptor protein (AP)-dependent internalization using tyrosine-based endocytic motifs (YXXΦ, X = any amino acid and Φ= bulky hydrophobic amino acid). Similar to MHC class II molecules, antigen loading occurs mainly in the endocytic system (1Brigl M. Brenner M.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 817-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The affinity of CD1 molecules for lipid antigens is explained by the architecture of their antigen binding sites, which are more hydrophobic and deeper than those of MHC class I molecules. They accommodate the alkyl chains of the lipids, leaving the more polar regions exposed for recognition by T cell receptors (2Gumperz J.E.

The majority of these NKT cells are called invariant NKT cells because they express fixed rearranged T cell receptor α chains (Vα14-Jα18 in mice and Vα24-Jα18 in humans) that are associated with different Vβ chains. After activation, they rapidly secrete Th1 and Th2 cytokines, suggestive of an immunoregulatory function (5Kronenberg M. Annu. Rev.

CD1d molecules have four occupied N-glycosylation sites (five in the case of mouse CD1d) and six Cys residues, four of which are involved in the formation of intrachain disulfide bridges. Correct folding of the heavy chain depends on glucose trimming (21Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and involves the chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) and the oxidoreductase ERp57. After release from the CNX/CRT cycle, the heavy chain binds non-covalently to β2m before trafficking to the plasma membrane (21Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to gaining access to the endocytic pathway by AP2- and AP3-dependent endocytosis, CD1d molecules can also be directed there by association with the invariant chain, normally responsible for the endocytic localization of MHC class II molecules, or by interaction with MHC class II invariant chain complexes (22Jayawardena-Wolf J. Benlagha K. Chiu Y.H. Mehr R. Bendelac A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 897-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Kang S.J. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1650-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CD1d undergoes multiple rounds of recycling between the endocytic system and the plasma membrane. The four N-linked glycans of human CD1d are localized in the α1 and α2 domains, effectively surrounding the antigen binding site, and in this study, we have focused on the role of these glycans in the assembly and stability of CD1d molecules. We show that in mature human CD1d molecules, one of the glycans (at position Asn-42) exists mainly in a form that is sensitive to the enzyme endoglycosidase H (Endo H), likely the unprocessed high mannose form, and that its deletion affects the stability of the heavy chain-β2m heterodimer. We propose a role for this glycan in mediating interactions between the heavy chain and β2m. Antibodies and Reagents—The monoclonal mouse antibodies (mAbs) to human CD1d, CD1d51, and D5 have been previously described (24Spada F.M. Borriello F. Sugita M. Watts G.F. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3468-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Exley M. Garcia J. Wilson S.B. Spada F. Gerdes D. Tahir S.M. Patton K.T. Blumberg R.S. Porcelli S. Chott A. Balk S.P. Immunology. 2000; 100: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit anti-human β2m antibody was from Dako Cytomation. The rat anti-human Grp94 mAb was from Stressgen. The reagents used for sandwich ELISA (anti-human interferon-γ (IFN-γ) mAb, biotinylated anti-human IFN-γ mAb (clone 4S.B3), and avidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate) were from Pharmingen. The glycosidases Endo H and PNGase F were from New England Biolabs. α-GalCer and galactosyl-(α1-2)-galactosyl ceramide (GalGalCer) were synthesized as described (26van den Elzen P. Garg S. Leon L. Brigl M. Leadbetter E.A. Gumperz J.E. Dascher C.C. Cheng T.Y. Sacks F.M. Illarionov P.A. Besra G.S. Kent S.C. Moody D.B. Brenner M.B. Nature. 2005; 437: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). NKT Cell Clone—The human Vα24/Vβ11 CD4+ NKT clone 6F5 was isolated by staining peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a normal human subject with mAbs specific for CD4 (OKT4; hybridoma obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the invariant T cell receptor α-chain expressed by CD1d-restricted NKT cells (6B11, Pharmingen). Cells staining positive for both mAbs were sorted as individual cells directly into wells of sterile 96-well plates using a MoFlo high speed fluorescence activated cell sorter with autoclone module (Dako-Cytomation). CD4+ NKT cell clones, including clone 6F5, were expanded using irradiated (50 grays) allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cell as feeders with PHA and recombinant interleukin-2 as described previously (27Exley M. Garcia J. Balk S.P. Porcelli S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Generation of N-Glycosylation Mutants of Human CD1d—Mutant constructs were generated using a human CD1d cDNA expression plasmid, pSRα-neo.CD1d. CD1d cDNAs containing single N-glycosylation site mutations were generated by the PCR method using primers that mutated each of the codons encoding Asn to generate Ala substitutions. CD1d mutants containing two glycosylation site mutations were generated using single mutants as templates for second round PCR-based mutagenesis and so forth for mutants at three and eventually all four glycosylation sites. Generation of Stable Transfectant C1R Cells—C1R cells were transfected with the vector pSRα-neo containing the gene of interest by electroporation at 230 mV/960 microfarads and selected for neomycin resistance at 1.8 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The cells were assayed for CD1d surface expression by flow cytometry. Cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and G418 at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Flow Cytometry—C1R cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant CD1d molecules were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD1d mAb (clone CD1d42) recognizing heavy chain associated with β2m or PE-rat antimouse IgG1 (A85-1) as an isotype control (Pharmingen). NKT Cell Stimulation Assay—C1R cells transfected with wild-type and mutant CD1d constructs were pulsed for 6 h with α-GalCer or GalGalCer (100 ng/ml in Me2SO) or Me2SO as control. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed in 0.05% glutaraldehyde. Cells were washed twice in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and once in NKT cell medium before use. Triplicate samples of 75,000 cells were co-cultured with 25,000 6F5 NKT cells in 96 U-bottom well plates for 22 h. The medium was supplemented with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 ng/ml) (Sigma) and interleukin-2 (1 nm) (Preprotech). Secreted human IFN-γ was detected by sandwich ELISA. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (21Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reimmunoprecipitation was performed by heating the washed immunoprecipitates in 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min at 100 °C before diluting 10-fold in 1% Triton X-100 in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.4 (TBS), 1.5 mm iodoacetamide. The supernatants were then used for reimmunoprecipitation with D5 antibody. The samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) before autoradiography. When Endo H digestion was performed, the samples were incubated overnight with 50 units of Endo H according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of CD1d from C1R.CD1d Cells—5 × 109 C1R.CD1d cells were lysed in 2% C12E9 in TBS. The lysate was loaded onto a CD1d51 immunoaffinity column in tandem with a precolumn coupled with mouse IgG to remove nonspecific contaminating proteins (21Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After washing with 0.1% C12E9/TBS, the proteins were eluted in acidic conditions (0.1% C12E9, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 3.5). The fractions were neutralized with 1 m Tris, and the proteins precipitated with ethanol. The proteins were then solubilized in 0.2% SDS. Western Blotting—The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Blots were incubated with D5 mAb (1:5000) or rat anti-human Grp94 mAb (1:10,000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) antibodies or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rat IgG (1:5000) for quantitative analysis. The proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) in the first case or imaged using a Fluorimager with ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences) in the second. For quantitative immunoblots, the protein content of the postnuclear supernatants was quantitated by the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA protein assay, Pierce). 3-fold serial dilutions were prepared, and the samples were resolved by reducing 12% SDS-PAGE. Peptide Analysis—After overnight digestion of the purified CD1d-β2m complexes with 100 units of Endo H, heavy chains were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the bands were excised from the gel. The gel samples were washed in 50% acetonitrile, 10-50 mm NH4HCO3, dried, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 0.1 μg of trypsin/15 mm3 gel in 10 mm NH4HCO3. The peptides were extracted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile, dried, and resuspended in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% acetonitrile. Fractionation of the samples was performed on a Hewlett Packard 1090 HPLC system equipped with an Isco Model 2150 peak separator anda1mm × 25 cm Vydac C-18 (5-μm particle size, 300-μm pore size) reverse phase column equilibrated with 98% buffer A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid) and 2% buffer B (0.052% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile). Peptides were eluted at 50 μl/min (gradient program: 0-60 min (2-37% buffer B), 60-90 min (37-75% buffer B), and 90-105 min (75-98% buffer B) and detected by their absorbance at 210 nm. Fractions were collected, and the peaks of interest were subjected to Edman sequencing using an ABI Precise 494 cLC instrument with an on-line HPLC for detection of the phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. Molecular Modeling of Glycosylated CD1d—The model of glycosylated CD1d was generated starting from the crystal structure of human CD1d complexed with the α-GalCer, Protein Data Bank code 1zt4 (3Koch M. Stronge V.S. Shepherd D. Gadola S.D. Mathew B. Ritter G. Fersht A.R. Besra G.S. Schmidt R.R. Jones E.Y. Cerundolo V. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), in which the four glycan structures are not resolved in the electron density map. The glycans attached by in silico modeling to the heavy chain core of CD1d were of the GlcNAc2Man9 type in a configuration consistent with the most populated conformer derived from a data base of experimental glycan structures (28Wormald M.R. Petrescu A.J. Pao Y.L. Glithero A. Elliott T. Dwek R.A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Glycan attachment, conformational search, and clash analysis were performed with Glyco-Pack, an in-house software package designed for glycoprotein structural analysis. Refined modeling was performed using the Insight II software from Accelrys using the Discover module with the cvff force field for the simulated annealing and the energy minimization. The solvent accessibility was calculated with Naccess 2.1.1 with a 1.5 Å radius probe. 6S. J. Hubbard and J. M. Thornton, personal communication. None of the Four N-Linked Glycans Are Essential for CD1d Assembly and Transport—To investigate the roles of the CD1d glycans, we used mutagenesis to change the Asn residues in each of the four N-glycosylation sequons (Fig. 1A) to Ala and generated transfectants of the human C1R B cell line stably expressing the wild-type or mutant forms. Quantitative Western blotting revealed that each of the CD1d mutants was present at somewhat less than 50% of the wild-type level, with the glycan 4 mutant the most poorly expressed (Fig. 1B). To investigate plasma membrane expression, the cells were stained with a PE-conjugated mAb CD1d42 specific for CD1d-β2m heterodimers and analyzed by flow cytometry. All the glycosylation mutants were expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1C). This suggests that assembly and transport through the secretory pathway is not dependent on the presence of any single N-linked glycan. None of the Four Glycans of CD1d Are Essential for Recognition by NKT Cells—We then wished to determine whether the absence of any of the N-linked glycans interferes with lipid loading and presentation to CD1d-restricted NKT cells. α-Gal-Cer can bind to cellular CD1d by direct exchange at the plasma membrane or in the endocytic system (6Burdin N. Brossay L. Koezuka Y. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J. Gui M. Taniguchi M. Hayakawa K. Kronenberg M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3271-3281PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kawano T. Cui J. Koezuka Y. Toura I. Kaneko Y. Motoki K. Ueno H. Nakagawa R. Sato H. Kondo E. Koseki H. Taniguchi M. Science. 1997; 278: 1626-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). A derivative, Gal-GalCer, can bind to CD1d but cannot stimulate NKT cells unless the terminal galactose residue is removed by lysosomal α-galactosidase to generate α-GalCer (30Prigozy T.I. Naidenko O. Qasba P. Elewaut D. Brossay L. Khurana A. Natori T. Koezuka Y. Kulkarni A. Kronenberg M. Science. 2001; 291: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). C1R cells expressing wild-type or mutant CD1d molecules were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with vehicle control (Me2SO) or lipid (100 ng/ml α-Gal-Cer or GalGalCer), fixed, and then co-cultured with the 6F5 NKT cell line for 22 h. The culture supernatants were assayed for secreted IFN-γ by a sandwich ELISA. All the CD1d mutants were able to present both α-GalCer and GalGalCer to the NKT cell line to about the same extent as wild-type CD1d (Fig. 2). Moreover, even in the absence of exogenously added antigen, IFN-γ release was readily detected, indicating that endogenous lipid loading by the mutants was normal. It was also evident from these experiments that the reduced surface expression of the mutant forms, seen in Fig. 2C, did not result in proportionate reductions in NKT cell recognition. Thus the absence of any single glycan had no discernable effect on the lipid binding and T cell recognition characteristics of CD1d. Intracellular Transport of the CD1d Single N-Glycosylation Mutants—N-glycans can facilitate glycoprotein folding and trafficking through the secretory pathway (31Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The expression of the CD1d mutants on the cell surface showed that they were transported but did not address whether the absence of any of the individual glycans affects the efficiency of folding or the rate of transport. To examine this question, the C1R transfectants were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min, chased up to 8 h, and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in TBS. The proteins were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibodies CD1d51 or D5, which recognize CD1d-β2m heterodimers or free heavy chains, respectively (25Exley M. Garcia J. Wilson S.B. Spada F. Gerdes D. Tahir S.M. Patton K.T. Blumberg R.S. Porcelli S. Chott A. Balk S.P. Immunology. 2000; 100: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transport was monitored by acquisition of resistance to Endo H treatment. The transport properties of the mutants lacking glycan 1, 3, or 4 were similar to that of wild-type CD1d. The glycans of the CD1d-β2m dimers began to acquire Endo H resistance at 2 h of chase, and by 8 h, the majority was in the mature, complex form (Fig. 3). The mutant lacking glycan 2 was transported more rapidly, with Endo H-resistant mature glycans detectable at 1 h of chase. Control immunoprecipitation using the anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody BB7.2 gave no bands upon SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Wild-type CD1d molecules with mature glycans were predominantly associated with β2m, measured by efficient immunoprecipitation with the CD1d51 mAb as compared with the D5 mAb. This is best seen at the 4- and 8-h time points, looking at the Endo H-treated lanes of Fig. 3. The mutants lacking glycan 3 or 4 resembled wild-type CD1d. In contrast, more of the mature forms of the mutants lacking glycan 1 or 2 reacted with the D5 mAb, consistent with a lack of associated β2m. The effect was most pronounced for the mutant lacking glycan 2. CD1d heavy chains associate with β2m in the ER, as suggested by Fig. 3 and as described previously (21Kang S.J. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and surface CD1d molecules are predominantly β2m-associated. Therefore these observations suggested either that CD1d heavy chains lacking glycan 1 or 2 can be transported from the ER efficiently without β2m association or that the heterodimers they form dissociate more readily upon detergent solubilization. CD1-β2m Dimers Lacking Glycan 2 Dissociate Readily in Detergents—Different detergents have variable effects on protein-protein interactions. For example, the interaction of transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) with the transmembrane glycoprotein tapasin is preserved in digitonin but disrupted in Triton X-100 (32Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the stability of wild-type and mutant CD1d-β2m dimers in digitonin and Triton X-100. Transfected C1R cells were labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 4 h to ensure that the majority of the molecules had exited the ER. Aliquots of the cells were extracted in either 1% Triton X-100 or 1% digitonin in TBS, and immunoprecipitations were performed with the D5 mAb or a rabbit anti-human β2m antibody to compare the amounts of free heavy chain and CD1d-β2m dimers. Control experiments using untransfected C1R cells showed little background in immunoprecipitations using these antibodies (Fig. 4A). In digitonin, wild-type CD1d and the mutants lacking glycan 1, 3, or 4 were predominantly β2m-associated (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in Triton X-100, substantially more free heavy chains were observed, indicating that digitonin preserves the dimers better than Triton X-100. In the case of the glycan 1 mutant, a sharp band likely corresponding to unprocessed free heavy chains was observed in both digitonin and Triton X-100. This is consistent with the data presented in Fig. 3. For the mutant lacking glycan 2, there was considerable free mature heavy chain even in digitonin, suggesting that this glycan has a critical role in maintaining the stability of the CD1d-β2m heterodimer upon detergent extraction. To confirm the results in Fig. 4A and to rule out a role for differences in the extraction capacity of the two detergents, cells were similarly labeled and extracted in 1% digitonin, and the CD1d-β2m heterodimers were immunoisolated with anti β2m antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were then incubated for 4 h either in TBS or in TBS containing 1% digitonin or 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation. The extent to which free heavy chains dissociated from β2m upon incubation in the various conditions was assessed by immunoprecipitation of the supernatants with the D5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, for all the species, Triton X-100 induced substantial heavy chain dissociation from β2m as compared with incubation in the absence of detergent or in the continued presence of digitonin. As expected from the data in Fig. 4A, the most pronounced effect was observed for C"

In this article, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to evaluate the role of microtubules in intracellular GLUT4 vesicle mobility. A comparison of the rate of fluorescence recovery (t½), and the maximum fluorescence recovered (Fmax) was made between basal and insulin-treated cells with or without nocodazole treatment to disrupt microtubules. We found that intracellular mobility of fluorescently tagged GLUT4 (HA-GLUT4-GFP) was high in basal cells. Mobility was not increased by insulin treatment. Basal mobility was dependent upon an intact microtubule network. Using a constitutively active Akt to signal GLUT4 redistribution, we found that microtubule-based GLUT4 vesicle mobility was not obligatory for GLUT4 plasma membrane insertion. Our findings suggest that microtubules organize the insulin-signaling complex and provide a surface for basal mobility of GLUT4 vesicles. Our data do not support an obligatory requirement for long range microtubule-based movement of GLUT4 vesicles for insulin-mediated GLUT4 redistribution to the cell surface. Taken together, these findings suggest a model in which insulin signaling targets membrane docking and/or fusion rather than GLUT4 trafficking to the cell surface.

Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 redistribution is critical to identifying defects that result in insulin resistance and will reveal relevant targets for treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes.The pool of GLUT4 vesicles that are insulin responsive is developmentally regulated.

The fate of newly synthesized GLUT4 is controversial in that it is unclear if GLUT4 is targeted to the plasma membrane and trafficked to the insulin-responsive pool through the early endosome (9Al-Hasani H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17504-17510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or targeted directly to the insulin-responsive pool from the biosynthetic pool arising from the TGN (10Watson R.T.

The insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicle pool can form as a specialized postendocytic compartment that is separate from the general recycling endosome pool (4Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R.

The increase in exocytosis could arise from a variety of regulated steps including fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane, stimulation of the rate of movement of vesicles to the plasma membrane, increased fission from an endosomal precursor, or a combination of these processes.In an attempt to characterize the molecular basis that underlies GLUT4 trafficking and membrane fusion, several laboratories have explored the role of the microtubule network in this process. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary rat adipocytes it has been shown that pharmacological disruption of the microtubule network blocks insulin-dependent GLUT4 redistribution (14Karylowski O. Zeigerer A.

However, none of these studies clearly distinguished where the defect is occurring in the insulin signaling/GLUT4 redistribution pathway. It remains poorly defined whether there is a defect in the formation of the insulin signaling complex or in trafficking of GLUT4 vesicles for fusion with the plasma membrane. To date the favored hypothesis has been that the microtubule network may be involved in GLUT4 trafficking (22Semiz S. Park J.G. Nicoloro S.M.C. Furcinitti P. Zhang C. Chawla A. Leszyk J. Czech M.P.

A common interpretation of existing data is that insulin either stimulates the rate of intracellular mobility of GLUT4 vesicles or insulin releases vesicles from a molecular tether (8Zeigerer A.

Our data suggest that GLUT4 is not tethered in the basal state, but rather is highly mobile in the cell in the absence of insulin. These data support a newer model holding that insulin governs GLUT4 redistribution by stimulating GLUT4 vesicle docking and fusion with the plasma membrane (23Lizunov V.A. Matsumoto H. Zimmerberg J. Cushman S.W. Frolov V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Koumanov F. Jin B. Yang J. Holman G.D.

Our results demonstrate that the microtubule network does play a significant role in GLUT4 mobility, but this role in mobility is not obligatory for GLUT4 redistribution to the plasma membrane. In addition, we demonstrate that the microtubule requirement in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 redistribution lies upstream of Akt/PKB activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture repository (Manassas, VA), cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and maintained in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate by incubation of the cells with DMEM plus 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 175 nm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 4 days the medium was changed to DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 175 nm insulin, with the incubation period continuing an additional 3 days.Electroporation—100-mm plates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes 5 days postdifferentiation were washed with PBS and incubated 10 min with 2 ml of trypsin/EDTA and 2 ml of PBS with 4 mg of collagenase. Cells were resuspended and pelleted at 900 rpm for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM containing 25 mm glucose. 0.5 ml of cell suspension was transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), and 45 μg of DNA was added. Cells were electroporated in a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 0.18 kV and 950 μF. Cells were allowed to recover for 10 min at room temperature. Equivalent amounts of cell suspension and fresh medium were added together and plated on 4 chamber BD Falcon CultureSlides (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) or 30-mm glass bottom dishes (WillCo, Ft. Washington, PA). All experiments were conducted 18-24-h postelectroporation.Live Cell Imaging—3T3-L1 adipocytes electroporated with HA-GLUT4-GFP were plated onto glass-bottomed tissue culture dishes and allowed to recover overnight. Cells were starved for 2 h at 37 °C in ambient air in Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 33 μm nocodazole as indicated. Cells were treated with or without 100 nm insulin in the Leibovitz medium. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscope with META on an Axiovert 200 stand with a 37 °C heated stage and a ×63 water objective, numerical aperture, 1.2; pinhole, 250 μm. For FRAP experiments, 25 iterations of a 75-100% maximal power Argon 488 laser light were used to photobleach regions of interest, and cells were imaged at 1-5% laser power. FRAP movies were generated using Zeiss imaging software and compressed using QuickTime Pro. Fluorescence recovery over time of FRAP experiments were quantified using Zeiss imaging software.

Cells were treated with or without 100 nm insulin in serum-free F-12 Hamm's medium for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min with no permeabilization. Paraformaldehyde-treated cells were quenched for 10 min in 0.05 m ammonium chloride in PBS. Cells were incubated with α-HA antibody (Covance), and the antibody was detected using anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).

We tested the insulin-stimulated redistribution of GLUT4 in living 3T3-L1 adipocytes using the HA-GLUT4-GFP reporter. 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the HA-GLUT4-GFP construct were insulin-stimulated and monitored by confocal microscopy. Confocal images at various time points after insulin stimulation showed a decrease in fluorescence intensity in the perinuclear-localized HA-GLUT4-GFP (Fig. 1A). The concomitant increase in GLUT4 at the cell surface is not easily quantified by confocal microscopy given that HA-GLUT4-GFP is redistributing from small vesicles with a high ratio of GLUT4 to membrane lipid (31Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to a large membrane pool, thus diminishing the GFP fluorescent signal because of dilution. Given that it was difficult to quantify the appearance of HA-GLUT4-GFP at the cell surface in live cells, we looked for loss of reporter fluorescence from the perinuclear compartment. Quantification of multiple cells from three independent experiments showed a significant decrease in perinuclear fluorescence in insulin-treated cells compared with basal cells (Fig. 1B).GLUT4 Mobility in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The kinetics of GLUT4 redistribution to the plasma membrane in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes have been measured by several laboratories using the measurement of an exposed epitope in the first exofacial loop of a GLUT4 reporter (4Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4787-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Govers R. Coster A.C.F. James D.E. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44212-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The limitation of these studies is that the kinetics of exocytosis measures a combination of trafficking and membrane fusion. We sought to separate intracellular GLUT4 trafficking from GLUT4 vesicle membrane fusion by directly measuring GLUT4 mobility using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). FRAP has been used previously to measure dynamic protein movement in a variety of cell types (for recent reviews see Refs. 33Day R.N. Schaufele F. Mol. Endo. 2005; 19: 1675-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and 34Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref Scopus (967) Google Scholar). We define mobility as the overall change in GLUT4 distribution, not as the change in the movements of individual GLUT4 containing vesicles. 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP were imaged on an inverted Zeiss confocal microscope at 37 °C. Discrete sections of HA-GLUT4-GFP fluorescence in one z-plane at the cell periphery were photobleached in the indicated boxed area (Fig. 2A) and allowed to recover over 8 min with image acquisition at 15-s intervals. The initial photobleach destroys both the immobile and mobile pools of the fluorescently tagged protein, and the maximum recovery is the amount of mobile fluorescent protein. A second photobleach was performed after initial recovery, and the cell was allowed to recover again. This second recovery curve represents bleaching and recovery of only the mobile fraction, giving an estimate of the size the mobile fraction as well as the relative rate of mobility of the GLUT4 reporter in the bleached region of the cell. The second curve was analyzed by transforming the data using a double-reciprocal plot to estimate the rate of fluorescence recovery (t½) and the maximum fluorescence recovered (Fmax). Because each transfected cell had variation in the fluorescence intensity, the fluorescence measurements were normalized to the initial prebleached level, assigning it a value of one. The variability in the raw fluorescence was random, likely caused by variation in reporter expression levels. However, the variation in fluorescence intensity was not dependent upon the experimental treatment applied to the cell (data not shown). These values were obtained for each of three independent experiments for a given FRAP area, and the mean and standard deviation for each condition are summarized for all experiments in Table 1.FIGURE 2Cell periphery FRAP of GLUT4-GFP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

We do not believe that the FRAP results from lateral diffusion of HA-GLUT4-GFP in the plasma membrane, because the fluorescence signal is diluted in this large membrane compartment and is difficult to visualize in confocal microscopy of the whole cell.The recovery of fluorescence following both the first and second (from the new initial fluorescence) photobleach was ∼90%, indicating that there is a 10% loss of signal because of either cell imaging or re-equilibration of vesicles between the mobile and immobile fraction. To confirm that the recovery plateau was reached by 265 s following the second photobleach, we carried out the recovery period for 530 s (supplemental Fig. S1). The half-time for recovery and maximal recovery was not different after 530 s compared with 265 s (Table 1). These data support that a true plateau was reached, and all subsequent experiments were carried out for 265 s to minimize the effects of cell mobility over the longer recovery period.This linear transformation and quantification of the second recovery curve demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the half-time of recovery (t½) or the maximal fluorescence (Fmax) recovered in insulin-treated versus basal cells at the cell periphery (Fig. 2B, Table 1, and supplemental Movies M1 and M2). Experiments were also carried out over shorter time periods (3 min using 5-s intervals between image acquisition), and the results were similar to the 15-s interval experiments (data not shown).To confirm that the recovery after photobleaching was caused by mobility of intact HA-GLUT4-GFP into the FRAP area, and not simply refolding of photobleached GFP, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with paraformaldehyde before imaging to eliminate protein mobility in cells. These fixed cells did not recover fluorescence after bleaching to the same extent as control cells (Fig. 2C and supplemental Movies M3 and M4). Quantification of these experiments demonstrated that the recovery of paraformaldehyde treated cells was unable to be fitted to a linear curve upon transformation, indicating a significant loss of the mobile pool compared with basal cells.GLUT4 mobility in the cell interior apart from the perinuclear area of intense GLUT4-GFP fluorescence (i.e. in the cytosol) was also tested to determine if insulin affected a change in mobility in that compartment (Fig. 3A). Insulin also did not significantly affect the rate of fluorescence recovery in the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 3B, Table 1, and supplemental Movies M5 and M6).FIGURE 3Cytosolic and perinuclear storage compartment FRAP of GLUT4-GFP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Nonetheless, fluorescent recovery rates were unchanged between insulin and basal states in the perinuclear compartment (Fig. 3D, Table 1, and supplemental Movies 7 and 8). Shorter time scale experiments (3 min using 5-s intervals between image acquisition) were also carried out in the cytosol and perinuclear areas and were similar to the 15-s interval experiments (data not shown). Therefore, insulin stimulation showed no statistically significant change in the rate of recovery in any of the three locations tested by FRAP (Table 1).GLUT4 Mobility in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes without a Functional Microtubule Network—Previous studies from several laboratories have established that the microtubule network is necessary for"
https://openalex.org/W2078297670,"The human c-rel proto-oncogene (REL) encodes a subunit of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) transcription factor. In this report, we have identified an identical point mutation in two human B-cell lymphomas (follicular (FL) and mediastinal) that changes serine (Ser)525 (TCA) to proline (Pro) (CCA) within the REL transactivation domain. This mutation was not identified in a similarly sized cohort of healthy individuals. In the mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, the mutation in REL is of germ-line origin. In both tumors, the S525P mutant allele is over-represented. REL-S525P shows enhanced in vitro transforming activity in chicken spleen cells. REL-S525P has a reduced ability to activate the human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) promoter in A293 cells; however, the MnSOD protein shows increased expression in REL-S525P-transformed chicken spleen cells as compared to wild-type REL-transformed cells. Ser525 is a site for phosphorylation by IκB kinase (IKK) in vitro. The S525P mutation reduces IKKα- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α-stimulated transactivation by a GAL4-REL protein. Furthermore, REL-S525P-transformed chicken spleen cells are more resistant to TNFα-induced cell death than cells transformed by wild-type REL. These results suggest that the S525P mutation contributes to the development of human B-cell lymphomas by affecting an IKKα-regulated transactivation activity of REL."
https://openalex.org/W2039710381,"Glycoprotein (GP) VI, the main signaling receptor for collagen on platelets, is expressed in complex with the FcR gamma-chain. The latter contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, which becomes phosphorylated, initiating a signaling cascade leading to the rapid activation and aggregation of platelets. Previous studies have shown that signaling by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing receptors is counteracted by signals from receptors with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Here we show, by immunoprecipitation, that the GPVI-FcR gamma-chain complex associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-containing receptor, PECAM-1. In platelets stimulated with collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL), tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 precedes that of the FcR gamma-chain, implying direct regulation of the former. The GPVI-FcR gamma-chain complex and PECAM-1 were present in both lipid raft and soluble fractions in human platelets; this distribution was unaltered by activation with CRP-XL. Their association occurred in lipid rafts and was lost after lipid raft depletion using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. We propose that lipid raft clustering facilitates the interaction of PECAM-1 with the GPVI-FcR gamma-chain complex, leading to the down-regulation of the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2139349453,"Protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism that controls many cellular activities. Phosphorylation of a given protein is precisely controlled by two opposing biochemical reactions catalyzed by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. How these two opposing processes are coordinated to achieve regulation of protein phosphorylation is unresolved. We have developed a novel experimental approach to directly study protein dephosphorylation in cells. We determined the kinetics of dephosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2, phosphoproteins involved in insulin receptor signaling. We found that insulin-induced ERK1/2 and Akt kinase activities were completely abolished 10 min after inhibition of the corresponding upstream kinases with PD98059 and LY294002, respectively. In parallel experiments, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and insulin receptor substrate-1/2 was decreased and followed similar kinetics. Our findings suggest that these proteins are dephosphorylated by a default mechanism, presumably via constitutively active phosphatases. However, dephosphorylation of these proteins is overcome by activation of protein kinases following stimulation of the insulin receptor. We propose that, during acute insulin stimulation, the kinetics of protein phosphorylation is determined by the interplay between upstream kinase activity and dephosphorylation by default. Protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism that controls many cellular activities. Phosphorylation of a given protein is precisely controlled by two opposing biochemical reactions catalyzed by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. How these two opposing processes are coordinated to achieve regulation of protein phosphorylation is unresolved. We have developed a novel experimental approach to directly study protein dephosphorylation in cells. We determined the kinetics of dephosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2, phosphoproteins involved in insulin receptor signaling. We found that insulin-induced ERK1/2 and Akt kinase activities were completely abolished 10 min after inhibition of the corresponding upstream kinases with PD98059 and LY294002, respectively. In parallel experiments, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and insulin receptor substrate-1/2 was decreased and followed similar kinetics. Our findings suggest that these proteins are dephosphorylated by a default mechanism, presumably via constitutively active phosphatases. However, dephosphorylation of these proteins is overcome by activation of protein kinases following stimulation of the insulin receptor. We propose that, during acute insulin stimulation, the kinetics of protein phosphorylation is determined by the interplay between upstream kinase activity and dephosphorylation by default. The reversible phosphorylation of proteins has emerged as a major mechanism for the regulation of cellular signal transduction (1Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Disruption of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation has been linked to many pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, and cardiovascular disease (3Alonso A.

Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Despite the critical importance of protein phosphorylation in signaling and disease, the underlying mechanisms that determine the kinetics of dephosphorylation remain unresolved. Two general models have been proposed to describe these mechanisms. One model posits that the phosphorylation level is determined by constitutively active phosphatases and transiently activated kinases (2Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 6Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This model was established based on results gathered using potent phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid on intracellular proteins as well as in in vitro cell-free assays. Therefore, although it is an attractive explanation, it may not reflect mechanisms operative in intact living cells. A second model based on studies employing advanced molecular techniques conducted in both animals and genetically engineered cell lines suggests that both kinases and phosphatases are coordinately regulated (3Alonso A.

Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, most of these studies assessed protein dephosphorylation in the presence of upstream kinase activity; therefore, potential influences from constitutively active phosphatases may have been hidden and thus overlooked. Methods to directly measure protein dephosphorylation in vivo in the absence of upstream kinase activity are lacking. As a result, despite the aforementioned studies, we still do not know the relative contribution of inducible and constitutively active phosphatases in determining the phosphorylation state of key protein effectors in receptor-mediated signaling cascades. Insulin signaling is controlled by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of many phosphoprotein effectors downstream of the insulin receptor (11White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After binding insulin, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase in the β-subunit of the insulin receptor activates and phosphorylates diverse substrates, including insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 3The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphoinositol 3-kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IR, insulin receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; HNMPA-(AM)3, hydroxyl-2-naphthalenylmethylphosphonic acid trisacetoxymethyl ester; DTT, dithiothreitol; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; SGK, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase; PP, protein phosphatase. -1 and IRS-2. Phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated following recruitment to phosphorylated IRS-1/2 and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt (also known as protein kinase B) (12Pullen N.

Phosphorylated IRS-1/2 also induces activation of MEK, leading subsequently to phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2, members of the MAPK family (15Myers Jr., M.G. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Zhang Y. Yenush L.

Although the insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2 is well characterized, the mechanisms that control the dephosphorylation of these signaling molecules are not definitively known. To determine whether activation of phosphatases is required for protein dephosphorylation, we developed a novel experimental approach to directly determine the dephosphorylation rate in living cells. Cells were stimulated with insulin to induce maximum protein phosphorylation. Then, well defined protein kinase inhibitors were added, and the rates of dephosphorylation of IRS-1/2, Akt, and ERK1/2 were determined. Our findings reveal the existence of a potential mechanism whereby downstream effectors of insulin signaling are dephosphorylated, unless upstream kinases are active. We refer to this observation as “dephosphorylation by default.” Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the wild-type human insulin receptor (IR), rat IRS-1, and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mouse Akt (CHO/IR/IRS-1/HA-Akt cells) were grown in nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (18Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). H2.35 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum and 200 nm dexamethasone (19Liu J.K. DiPersio C.M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Zaret K.S. DiPersio C.M. Jackson D.A. Montigny W.J. Weinstat D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9076-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were grown in growth medium (50% high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 40% nutrient mixture F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 nm dexamethasone, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 95% air and 5% CO2. At 80% confluence, cells were fasted in serum-deprived high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 16 h (CHO and H2.35 cells) or 6 h (primary hepatocytes) and then incubated with or without insulin (100 nm) for the indicated times (21Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Inhibitors, including sodium orthovanadate (500 μm), hydroxyl-2-naphthalenylmethylphosphonic acid trisacetoxymethyl ester (HNMPA-(AM)3; 500 μm), LY294002 (50 μm), and PD98059 (250 μm), were added at the indicated times before or after addition of insulin. At the end of treatment, cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT) for immunoblot analysis or in lysate buffer (see below) for immunoprecipitation. Primary Hepatocyte Isolation—Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated using a modified protocol according to Klaunig et al. (22Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Chacko J. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The liver was perfused with calcium and magnesium-free Hanks' buffered salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with EGTA (prewarmed to 37 °C and gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) for 4 min at a rate of 4 ml/min, followed by Hanks' buffered salt solution supplemented with 5.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.025 mg/ml Blendzyme III (Roche Diagnostics) for 5 min at a rate of 4 ml/min. The digested liver was excised rapidly, and hepatocytes were released with gentle shaking of the digested liver into 15 ml of chilled (4 °C) hepatocyte isolation medium (high glucose 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 40% nutrient mixture F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 nm dexamethasone, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin). Cells were then filtered through a 70-μm nylon filter (BD Biosciences) into a 50-ml conical tube and washed twice with the same medium by centrifugation at 50 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of hepatocyte isolation medium. Cell viability was assessed via trypan blue staining and was >85%. cells (3.5 × 105/well) were plated in a collagen-coated 12-well plate. After allowing the cells to attach for 2 h at 37°C, they were washed once, and the medium was replaced with growth medium. Immunoblot Analysis—For whole cell lysate immunoblotting, cells were lysed directly in Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1 m DTT and sonicated. Proteins in whole cell lysates were further denatured by boiling for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5 or 10% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.15 m NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% milk and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibody (catalog nos. 420292 and 420293, EMD Biosciences), anti-HA antibody (clone F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Akt phospho-Ser473 antibody (catalog no. 9271, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (catalog no. 9101, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), or anti-ERK2 antibody (clone C-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Following incubation with antibodies, membranes were washed three times with TBST and then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at a 1:3000 (v/v) dilution for 30 min. For the detection of tyrosine phosphorylation, membranes were directly probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies PY20 and PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at a 1:3000 (v/v) dilution for 30 min. Membranes were washed with TBST and TBS and developed with SuperSignal™ substrate (Pierce) for 5 min. Bands were detected by exposing the membranes on Kodak BioMax MR film (18Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4) and lysed in 1 ml of lysate buffer A (buffer A containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm Na3VO4, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, or anti-HA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured with protein A-agarose beads (Invitrogen) and washed three times with lysate buffer A (18Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PI3K Activity Assay—IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was determined by incorporation of [32P]phosphate into phosphatidylinositol using anti-IRS-1 immune complexes. Immune complexes were washed successively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4; 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm LiCl and 100 μm Na3VO4; and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm Na3VO4. The washed immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and combined with 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 and 10 μl of 2 μg/μl phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) that had been sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EGTA. The assay was initiated by addition of 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP solution (0.88 mm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 mm MgCl2). The reaction proceeded for 10 min at room temperature and was terminated by addition of 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). The samples were vortexed and centrifuged. The lower organic phase was removed and applied to silica gel thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck). The plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography (18Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Akt Activity Assay—Akt activity was measured in anti-HA immune complexes obtained from CHO/IR/IRS-1/HA-Akt cells (18Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were washed successively with lysate buffer A, lysate buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, and kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MnCl2). The reaction was started by addition of 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μm Akt substrate peptide (RPRAATF, found in SGK; Upstate) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA was added to stop the reaction, and 20-μl aliquots were spotted on P-81 filter papers. The papers were washed five times with 1% phosphoric acid and once with acetone, dried, and counted in a Packard 2200 CA scintillation counter. Partial Purification of MAPK and Assay for MAPK Activity (24Anderson N.G. Kilgour E. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10131-10135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)—Cells were washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed in 1 ml of lysate buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EGTA containing 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm Na3VO4). Lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. Ethylene glycol was added to the supernatant fraction (10% final concentration), and 0.5 ml was immediately mixed with 150 μl of packed phenyl-Sepharose for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged briefly, and unbound material was removed. The phenyl-Sepharose was then successively washed with lysate buffer B containing 10% ethylene glycol and lysate buffer B containing 35% ethylene glycol. MAPK was eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose with 200 μl of lysate buffer B containing 60% ethylene glycol and assayed for MAPK activity using myelin basic protein as a substrate. The reaction was initiated with 5 μl of partially purified MAPK in 40 μl of buffer containing 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm magnesium acetate (pH 7.5), 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μg of myelin basic protein and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of stop solution (0.6% HCl containing 1 mm ATP and 1% bovine serum albumin). Aliquots (20 μl) were spotted on P-81 filter papers. The papers were washed with 1% phosphoric acid and acetone, dried, and counted in the Packard 2200 CA scintillation counter (25Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12721-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IRS-1, Akt, and ERK1/2 in CHO/IR/IRS-1/HA-Akt Cells during Insulin Stimulation—To investigate protein dephosphorylation, we created a model cell line that overexpressed rat IRS-1 and HA-tagged mouse Akt in CHO cells overexpressing the human IR (CHO/IR/IRS-1/HA-Akt cells). Application of insulin rapidly induced phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins in this cell line, including the β-subunit of the IR, IRS-1, Akt, and ERK1/2 (Fig. 1). Maximum levels of phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the IR β-subunit at tyrosyl residues occurred within 30 s (Fig. 1A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the IR was observable for at least 60 min (Fig. 1A). Akt was serine-phosphorylated in response to insulin (at Ser473); maximum phosphorylation occurred at 2 min after insulin stimulation and remained elevated for 60 min (Fig. 1B, upper panel). No dephosphorylation of IRS-1 or Akt was observed within the first 30 min of insulin stimulation. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was transient, peaking within 5 min and rapidly fading after 10 min of insulin addition (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1/2 remained elevated above basal levels for 60 min following insulin treatment (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Changes in the magnitude of phosphorylation of these proteins were not due to changes in protein levels (data not shown). The intensity of IRS-1, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation is thought to reflect the degree of their biological activities (11White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the insulin-induced IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and Akt and ERK1/2 activation in our model cell system. IRS-1-associated PI3K activity peaked within 10 min after insulin treatment and remained elevated for 1 h (Fig. 2A). The same activity profile was observed for insulin-induced activation of Akt (Fig. 2B). ERK1/2 activation was transient and peaked at 5 min. ERK1/2 activity decreased by 15 min, but remained elevated above basal levels for 1 h (Fig. 2C). The activities of IRS-1-associated PI3K, Akt, and ERK1/2 were consistent with their phosphorylation levels, as shown in Fig. 1. LY294002 is a potent inhibitor of PI3K (26Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When added to the medium before insulin stimulation, no insulin-induced PI3K or Akt activity was observed (data not shown). When cells were stimulated with insulin for 10 min (to activate PI3K), application of LY294002 rapidly abolished PI3K activity (Fig. 2A). To our surprise, addition of LY294002 also concurrently abolished Akt activity (Fig. 2B). Because PI3K is an upstream kinase for Akt, this suggested that inactivation of an upstream kinase leads to the simultaneous inactivation of its downstream effector. To determine whether the same holds true for the ERK1/2 pathway, we used PD98059, a potent and specific inhibitor of MEK, which is the upstream kinase for ERK1/2 (27Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.J. Guan K.L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20883-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When added to the cells after the initial insulin stimulation, ERK1/2 activity was also completely suppressed (Fig. 2C). Together, these results support the existence of a common mechanism operating to decrease Akt and ERK1/2 activities following inactivation of their corresponding upstream kinases. Dephosphorylation of Akt—Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 or ERK1/2 at Thr202/Tyr204 has been shown to correlate with kinase activity and is considered to be a marker for kinase activation (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 29Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar, 30Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P.A. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Complete loss of Akt and ERK1/2 activities immediately following inhibition of their corresponding upstream kinases prompted us to further examine their dephosphorylation. To measure the dephosphorylation rate of phosphorylated Akt in vivo, cells were stimulated with insulin for 10 min to trigger maximum phosphorylation of Akt (Figs. 1 and 3A, lane i); subsequently, LY294002 was added to the medium to inhibit PI3K. The levels of phosphorylation of Akt were determined by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody against Akt phospho-Ser473 to assess the dephosphorylation rate. The insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was completely abolished 20 min after addition of LY294002 (Fig. 3A, lane f versus lanes i and k). In control cells, Akt Ser473 remained phosphorylated during 30 min of insulin stimulation (Figs. 1B and 3A, lanes i–k), and preincubation of cells with LY294002 for 10 min prevented the insulin-induced Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3A, lane d). We also determined the rate of dephosphorylation of Akt following inhibition of PI3K activity with LY294002. Significant dephosphorylation (by 80%) was detected at 2.5 min, and the effect was nearly complete by 5 min (Fig. 3B, lanes b–e versus lanes f–h). Taking the diffusion rate of LY294002 across the cell membrane into consideration, dephosphorylation of Akt was notably expeditious. We next determined whether protein phosphatase (PP)-2A and PP1 are responsible for Akt dephosphorylation by using calyculin A, a specific inhibitor of PP2A and PP1 (31Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Calyculin A failed to prevent the dephosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3A, lane h versus lanes f, i, and k) when cells were exposed to the PI3K inhibitor after maximum insulin stimulation. This raises the possibility that other phosphatases dephosphorylate Akt under insulin-stimulated conditions. Interestingly, adding calyculin A in the absence of ligand slightly increased the basal phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (Fig. 3A, lane a versus lane c), indicating that calyculin A inhibited PP2A and PP1 in the unstimulated condition and thus may participate in dephosphorylation of Akt in basal states. The experiments above were conducted in a transformed cell line designed to overexpress the IR, IRS-1, and Akt; to determine whether the rapid dephosphorylation following addition of LY294002 occurs in more physiologically relevant systems, we carried out similar experiments in the hepatocyte cell line H2.35 and in freshly isolated mouse primary hepatocytes. H2.35 is an epithelium-like cell line derived from mouse primary hepatocytes infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 virus; it maintains some hepatocyte behavior, including synthesis of albumin (19Liu J.K. DiPersio C.M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Zaret K.S. DiPersio C.M. Jackson D.A. Montigny W.J. Weinstat D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Jackson D.A. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4405-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results obtained with CHO/IR/IRS-1/HA-Akt cells, rapid dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Akt was observed following inhibition of PI3K in both H2.35 cells (Fig. 3C, upper and middle panels, lanes a–d versus lanes i–l) and primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3C, lower panel, lanes a–d versus lanes i–l). Moreover, this effect was seen even with 1 nm insulin (Fig. 3C, lane b versus lane j). Dephosphorylation of ERK1/2—To determine whether the rapid dephosphorylation of proteins is specific to Akt or whether it is a general phenomenon, we examined the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cells after inhibition of MEK with PD98059. The insulin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was completely abolished 20 min after addition of PD98059 (Fig. 4A, lane f versus lanes i–k). In contrast, ERK1/2 remained phosphorylated during 30 min of insulin treatment (Fig. 4A, lanes i–k). We determined the dephosphorylation rate of ERK1/2 following inhibition of MEK with PD98059. As with Akt, significant dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 (by >80%) occurred within 2.5 min (Fig. 4B, lane f versus lanes b and c) and was complete within 10 min of PD98059 application (lane h versus lane e). It should be pointed out that the kinetics of dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 surprisingly resembles that of Akt (Fig. 3B). Calyculin A was introduced to determine the contribution of PP2A/PP1 in dephosphorylation of ERK1/2. Calyculin A only partially prevented the effect of PD98059 on ERK1/2 dephosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lane h versus lanes f and i). In contrast to Akt, basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not affected by calyculin A (Fig. 4A, lane a versus lane c). Dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also examined in H2.35 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Consistent with the results obtained with CHO/IR/IRS-1/HA-Akt cells, rapid dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 occurred after MEK was inhibited in both H2.35 cells and primary hepatocytes (Fig. 4C, lanes a–d versus lanes i–l). As with Akt, this effect was also seen with 1 nm insulin (Fig. 4C, lane b versus lane j). Dephosphorylation of IRS-1—Finally, we examined the levels of insulin-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 following inhibition of IR tyrosine kinase with HNMPA-(AM)3, a relatively specific inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase activity (34Baltensperger K.

Preincubation of cells with HNMPA-(AM)3 for 10 min prevented the insulin-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and the IR (Fig. 5, lane d versus lane i), suggesting that HNMPA-(AM)3 can inhibit IR tyrosine kinase activity in our cell line. When maximum tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 was first achieved by 10 min of insulin stimulation, followed by inhibition of IR"

Disruption of normal imprinting leads to abnormal embryogenesis, certain inherited diseases, and is associated with various cancers. In the context of screening for the gene(s) responsible for the alteration of phenotype in cyclophilin A knockdown (CypA-KD) P19 cells, we observed a silent paternally expressed gene, Peg3. Treatment of CypA-KD P19 cells with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-dC reversed the silencing of Peg3 biallelically. Genomic bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR revealed DNA hypermethylation in CypA-KD P19 cells, as the normally unmethylated paternal allele acquired methylation that resulted in biallelic methylation of Peg3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated a loss of acetylation and a gain of lysine 9 trimethylation in histone 3, as well as enhanced DNA methyltransferase 1 and MBD2 binding on the cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) islands of Peg3. Our results indicate that DNA hypermethylation on the paternal allele and allele-specific acquisition of histone methylation leads to silencing of Peg3 in CypA-KD P19 cells.

This study is the first demonstration of the epigenetic function of CypA in protecting the paternal allele of Peg3 from DNA methylation and inactive histone modifications. DNA methylation regulates a number of biological processes, including genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and repression of retroviral elements (1Bird A.

Genomic imprinting relies on establishing and maintaining the parent-specific methylation of DNA elements that control the differential expression of maternal and paternal alleles (3Reik W. Walter J.

Although the essential DNA methyltransferases and methyl-CpG-binding proteins have been discovered (5Razin A. Kantor B. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2005; 38: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), proteins that regulate the establishment and maintenance of allele-specific methylation of DNA have not been identified. Nevertheless, data for an active role of DNA methylation in gene silencing are both correlative and functional. In addition, DNA methylation may occur in conjunction with histone modification to play a critical role in biallelic silencing through chromatin remodeling (6Li T. Vu T.H. Ulaner G.A. Littman E.

The Peg3 gene is one of several genes identified in an imprinted region mapped to human chromosome 19q13.4 (14Kim J. Ashworth L. Branscomb E. Stubbs L. PCR Methods Applications. 1997; 7: 532-540Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mouse homolog of Peg3 was the first imprinted gene identified from the proximal region of mouse chromosome 7 (15Kuroiwa Y. Kanekoishino T. Kagitani F. Kohda T. Li L.L. Tada M. Suzuki R.

Its high conservation between mice and humans suggests that it possesses critical cellular functions. Peg3 appears to be ubiquitous, but the highest mRNA levels are found in placenta, uterus, ovary, brain, and testis (16Hiby S.E. Lough M. Keverne E.B. Surani M.A. Loke Y.W. King A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In mice, targeted disruption of the paternally inherited copy of Peg3 eliminates Peg3 expression. Peg3-negative heterozygous mice suffer growth impairment. Females display compromised nurturing behavior, resulting in a high death rate in their offspring (17Li L.L. Keverne E.B. Aparicio S.A.

Recently, different aspects of biological functions of CypA have emerged, suggesting that CypA is involved in multiple signaling events of eukaryotic cells. It might either act as a catalyst for prolyl bond isomerization or form stoichiometric complexes with target proteins. CypA possesses enzymatic peptidylprolyl isomerase activity, which is essential to protein folding in vivo. It promotes proper subcellular localization of Zpr1p, regulates interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase activity, and is required for retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation in P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells (19Ansari H.

It has been demonstrated that CypA specifically interacts with SIN3-Rpd3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) in vitro, suggesting that CypA affects gene expression by physically interacting with HDAC (22Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Cardenas M.E. Wu X. Hanes S.D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3739-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In screening for the gene(s) responsible for the alteration of phenotype in CypA-KD P19 cells (21Song J. Lu Y.C. Yokoyama K. Rossi J. Chiu R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we observed a silent paternally expressed gene, Peg3. Subsequently, we found an inverse relationship between mRNA expression and DNA hypermethylation as well as Peg3 reactivation from CypA-KD P19 cells by demethylation reagents and HDAC inhibitor, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the regulating of Peg3 expression in CypA-KD P19 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated a loss of acetylation and a gain of lysine 9 trimethylation in histone 3, as well as enhanced DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and MBD2 binding on the CpG islands of Peg3 in CypA-KD P19 cells. Our data demonstrate the epigenetic function of CypA, which protects the paternal allele of Peg3 from DNA methylation and inactive histone modifications. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Quantitative Real-time (QRT)-PCR—Total RNA samples were isolated from 3 × 106 cells by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's protocols. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of RNA using SuperScript™ (Invitrogen). The 20-μl products of reverse transcription were diluted to 40 μl, and 2 μl were used for each PCR reaction. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 2 μm primers and 12.5 μl of the Power SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The primers used in real-time PCR were cPeg3-F (5′-GCCTAAACCAACCCAT-AATGTC-3′) and cPeg3-R (5′-CTGAAAGAGT-CCCTGCGTTC-3′). As an input control, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified using the following primers: GAPDH-F (5′-CAGTGGCAAAGTGG-AGATTG-3′) and GAPDH-R (5′-AATTTGCCG-TGAGTGGAGTC-3′)S. QRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min for the initial denaturing followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The data were analyzed using the function 2–ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = (CT, Target – CT, GAPDH)sample – (CT, Target – CT, GAPDH)calibrator. In our experiments, GAPDH was used as an internal control to normalize PCR for the amount of RNA added to the reverse transcription reactions. We arbitrarily used wild type (WT P19) cells as a calibrator while using KD (CypA knockdown P19) cells as a sample to indicate the relative difference. Primer and template designs followed the same criteria for each target, and primers and Mg2+ concentrations had been optimized to render efficiency for each target near one per assumption underlying the 2–ΔΔCT method. Genomic Bisulfite Sequencing and Methylation-specific PCR—Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two μg of DNA were digested with EcoRI, extracted with phenol-chloroform, and then subjected to sodium bisulfite conversion, using the EZ DNA methylation Kit (ZYMO Research). The converted DNA was diluted to 20 μl, and 4 μl were used for each PCR reaction. To amplify all of the CpG islands for bisulfite sequencing, regardless of methylation status, unbiased primers Peg3 S-F (forward, 5′-GTAGTTTGATTGGTAGGGTG-3′) and Peg3 S-R (reverse, 5′-CAATCTACAACCTTATCAATT-AC-3′) were used to perform PCR under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min for the initial denaturing followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. To monitor the efficiency of bisulfite treatment, the PCR products were subcloned into the TA cloning vector, and 15 different clones were sequenced individually. If >95% of cytosine was converted into thymidine, we selected those DNA samples for bisulfite sequencing analyses. Methylation-specific PCR was performed using primers Peg3 M-F (5′-AGACGTTGGGGAGTTAGGAG-TCGC-3′) and Peg3 M-R (5′-TATAATCTACCG-CCCCTAACCCGCG-3′) for methylated DNA and primers Peg3 U-F (5′-AGATGTTGGGG-AGTTAGGAGTTGT-3′) and Peg3 U-R (5′-TATAATCTACCACCCCTAACCCACA-3′) for unmethylated DNA. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 3 min for the initial denaturing followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. To directly observe bands representing methylated and unmethylated DNA, PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. ChIP Analysis—ChIP assays were carried out using a kit from Upstate according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Dnmt1 ChIP, cells were treated for 2 h with 5 μm 5-aza-dC to arrest the fleeting covalent association of methyltransferase with the DNA substrate. Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were used per ChIP assay. After 10 min of 1% formaldehyde treatment, the cells were harvested and sonicated for 3 × 20 s using a Tekmar sonic disrupter set to 30% of maximum power to produce soluble chromatin, with average sizes between 300 and 1000 bp. The chromatin samples were then diluted 8-fold in the dilution buffer and precleaned for 1 h using 75 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A- or G-agarose beads. Ten μg of antibodies were then added to each sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C. To collect the immunocomplex, 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A- or G-agarose beads were added to the samples for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once in each of the following buffers, in order: low salt, high salt, and LiCl immune complex wash buffer; they were then washed twice in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The bound protein-DNA immunocomplexes were eluted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer and subjected to reverse cross-linking at 65 °C for 6 h. The reverse cross-linked chromatin DNA was further purified by proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction. DNA was then precipitated in ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer. Two microliters of DNA were used for each QRT-PCR with primers gPeg3-F (5′-ACCCTGAC-AAGGAGGTGTCCC-3′) and gPeg3-R (5′GTCTAGTGCACCCACACTGAAC-3′). For a positive control, RNA polymerase II antibody was used to immunoprecipitate actively expressed promoter, and mouse GAPDH promoter was amplified by using primers mGAPDHpF (5′-TACTCGCGGCTTTACGGG-3′) and mGAPDHpR (5′-TGGAACAGGGAGGAGCAG-AGAGCA-3′). QRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min for the initial denaturing followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The data were analyzed using the function 2–ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = (CT, IP – CT, input)sample – (CT, IP – CT, input)calibrator. In our experiments, input was used as an internal control to normalize PCR for the amount of chromatin DNA added to the ChIP assay. We arbitrarily used WT P19 cells as a calibrator; whereas KD (CypA-knockdown P19) cells were compared with WT to generate the relative difference. Cyclophilin A Knockdown (CypA-KD) Selectively Affects the Expression of Imprinted Genes—To identify genes that could be affected by the CypA-KD in P19 EC cells, we found repressed Peg3 in CypA-KD P19 EC cells (S1–7) by using subtraction-differential screening of the subtractive library. Undetectable Peg3 expression was also exhibited in the other stable CypA-KD clone S3-2, suggesting that suppression of Peg3 resulted from the knocking down of CypA (Fig. 1A). To determine whether CypA-KD also affects the expression of other imprinted genes, we performed semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR as well as QRT-PCR to detect Usp29, Peg1/Mest, Igf2, H19, and Igf2r, using specific primers (Fig. 1). Again, we observed that Usp29 expression levels were undetectable, suggesting that Usp29 shares the same imprinting control region with Peg3 and coordinates silencing of the imprinted transcript Usp29 with Peg3. H19 localized in a different locus was also undetectable, suggesting that cells lacking the CypA switch expressed H19 to silence. QRT-PCR analysis clearly demonstrated a 3–4-fold increase in Igf2, reduced Igf2r mRNA, but no effect upon Peg1/Mest expression in S1–7 and S3-2 cell lines (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these findings indicate that CypA-KD can selectively affect the expression of certain imprinted genes. Peg3 Expression Is CypA-dependent—Results from the stable CypA-KD clones S1–7 and S3-2 clearly demonstrated that knockdown of CypA resulted in suppression of Peg3. To rule out the possibility that the observed changes resulted from clonal selection, we performed transient transfection of pshRNA-CypA into WT P19 EC and F9 EC cells (Fig. 2A). Nonspecific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and an empty vector were used as negative controls. Our results demonstrated that the silencing of Peg3 is accompanied by transient CypA-KD in both P19 EC and F9 EC cells, confirming our hypothesis that CypA-KD alone causes Peg3 silencing and suggesting further that the mechanism may be a general phenomenon in EC cells. To determine whether CypA-knockout (KO) also results in repression of Peg3 expression, we measured Peg3 expression from CypA-KO Jürkat cells (a generous gift from Dr. Jeremy Luban) using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, lane 9, we detected low levels of Peg3 as compared with those in wild type Jürkat cells. Together, these data clearly demonstrate that Peg3 expression is CypA-dependent. CypA Isomerase Activity Is Required to Maintain Expression of Peg3—To determine whether CypA isomerase or FK506-binding protein isomerase activity is required to maintain expression of Peg3, WT P19 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml CsA and FK506 (100 ng/ml) or rapamycin (100 ng/ml), which inhibits the isomerase activity of CypA and FKBPs, respectively. After 72 h of CsA, FK506, or rapamycin treatment, the cells were harvested to prepare total RNAs. Two μg of total RNA were used to perform RT-PCR to detect Peg3 using a pair of specific primers. Only CsA-treated WT P19 cells had undetectable Peg3 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the isomerase enzymatic activity of CypA is necessary for Peg3 expression. Silencing of Peg3 Is Reactivated by Treating CypA-KD Cells with the DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor—To determine whether DNA methylation is involved in silencing of Peg3 in CypA-KD P19 EC cells, we treated the S1–7 and S3-2 cell lines for 5 days with 1.0 μm 5-aza-dC, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, followed by amplification of the Peg3 129-bp fragment using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and QRT-PCR. Fig. 3 shows that, upon 5-aza-dC treatment, the silent Peg3 gene in S1–7 and S3-2 was reactivated. These results demonstrate an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and Peg3 expression and support the hypothesis that Peg3 transcription is regulated by promoter methylation. CypA-KD Resulted in Biallelic Methylation of CpG Islands Encoded within the Promoter, First Exon, and First Intron of the Peg3 Gene—To directly show methylation of the Peg3 gene, we used bisulfite modification and DNA sequencing to analyze the methylation status of 445-bp CpG islands encoded within the promoter, first exon, and first intron of this gene (Fig. 4). Analysis of 15 individual clones revealed that, in CypA-KD P19 cells, 26 CpG dinucleotides were 98% methylated, indicating biallelic methylation, whereas in WT P19 cells, the methylated CpG islands were at 42.3% frequency, which is consistent with monoallelic methylation of the imprinted gene (Fig. 5A). We next performed methylation-specific PCR on sodium bisulfite-modified genomic DNA. Two pairs of primers (U and M) were used for annealing to unmethylated and methylated DNA, respectively. Primers were designed within the Peg3 CpG islands containing frequent cytosine to distinguish methylated from unmethylated DNA. A biallelic methylation pattern was observed in S1–7 and S3-2, whereas a monoallelic methylation represented by both unmethylated and methylated DNA bands was observed in WT P19 cells (Fig. 5B), correlating with the monoallelic methylation of the imprinted gene.FIGURE 5Biallelic methylation of CpG islands within the promoter region, first exon, and first intron of the Peg3 gene.

Wang Y.F. Cantemir C. Muller M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). QRT-PCR analysis of ChIP products generated by immunoprecipitation with antibody against Dnmt1 (Abcam) in the WT P19 and CypA-KD P19 cell lines revealed that the Dnmt1-bound DNA fraction in CypA-KD P19 cells was ∼2.07-fold higher than that of wild type cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, RNA polymerase II-bound GAPDH promoter as a positive control showed no significant difference between the two cell lines (Fig. 6). These results further substantiate the hypothesis that CypA-KD mediates biallelic methylation of the Peg3 promoter and the first exon. Partial Relief of the Repressed Peg3 in CypA-KD Cells by Treatment of Cells with the HDAC Inhibitor—It has been well established that the methyl-CpG-binding protein silences transcription by recruiting the HDAC-repressive machinery, which removes acetyl groups from histone, resulting in gene silencing (24Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar, 25Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). To determine whether histone deacetylation is involved in silencing Peg3 in CypA-KD P19 EC cells, because HDAC binds to CypA (Fig. 7A), the S1–7 and S3-2 cell lines were treated for 3 days with 10 or 20 ng/ml trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, followed by amplification of the Peg3 129-bp fragment using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Our data demonstrated that trichostatin A only partially relieves CypA-KD-mediated Peg3 repression (Fig. 7B). This partial relief indicates that additional mechanisms of repression by methyl-CpG repressory complexes might exist in addition to the recruitment of histone deacetylation. We therefore examined various histone modifications in the Peg3 promoter of WT P19 and CypA-KD P19 cells by ChIP assays, using antibodies against modified histones (acetyl Lys-H3 and trimethyl Lys-9-H3) followed by QRT-PCR analysis. Reciprocal Pattern of Acetyl Lys-H3 and Trimethyl Lys-9-H3 Was Enriched in the CypA-KD Cells—Histone acetylation was observed in both WT P19 and CypA-KD P19 cells but with a 33% weaker signal in CypA-KD P19 cells (Fig. 8A). Our results suggest that a less-acetylated histone binds to the Peg3 promoter in the CypA-KD P19 cell line S1–7, which correlates with repressed Peg3 expression in this cell line. The level of trimethyl Lys-9-H3 in the CypA-KD cells was ∼2.5× greater than that in WT P19 cells, which were set as 50/50 for two parental alleles (Fig. 8A), indicating a gain of histone methylation on the Peg3 promoter. A positive control, GAPDH promoter bound by RNA polymerase II, showed no significant difference between WT- and CypA-KD cell lines (Fig. 8A). In a pattern reciprocal to that of acetyl Lys-H3, trimethyl Lys-9-H3 was enriched exclusively in the CypA-KD P19 cell line. This predominant enrichment of the trimethylation of Lys-9-H3 correlated with the inverse relationship of paternally expressed Peg3 in WT P19 cells and biallelic methylation and silencing in CypA-KD P19 cells. We conclude that silencing of Peg3 in the CypA-KD P19 cell line correlates with a gain of trimethyl Lys-9-H3 on the promoter region of the paternal allele. MBD2 Is Involved in the Silencing of Peg3 Expression—Our data demonstrate that P19 EC cells have abundant MBD2, which also binds to CypA (Fig. 8B). It has been demonstrated that MBD2 is associated with HDACs in the MeCP1 repressor complex (26Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To determine whether silencing of the hypermethylated Peg3 gene is consistent with a model involving methyl-CpG-binding proteins, ChIP analysis was used to study the occupancy of the methylated Peg3 promoter by MBD2 in the CypA-KD P19 cell line as compared with WT P19 EC cells. QRT-PCR analysis of ChIP products generated by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against MBD2 in the WT P19 and CypA-KD P19 cell lines revealed the MBD2-bound DNA fraction in the CypA-KD P19 cell lines was ∼1.8-fold higher than that in WT-P19 cells (Fig. 8B), suggesting that MBD2 is involved in the silencing of Peg 3 expression. Using a revolutionary RNA interference (RNAi) technique, we have been able to analyze loss-of-function phenotypes for the first time to define the function of CypA, which is required to maintain the differential methylation of the CpG islands and histone modification in the promoter and its extended exonic region of the Peg3 gene. Although off-target effects have been documented during RNAi experiments and integration of an RNAi vector, this is not the case in our presented data. Based on the BLAST sequence data base, we did not find any other sequence identical to our designed targeting site, as described previously (21Song J. Lu Y.C. Yokoyama K. Rossi J. Chiu R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, using a nonspecific sequence of shRNA (Fig. 2A, NS1 and NS2) and an empty vector as a negative controls did not result in the silencing of Peg3, suggesting that our observation was of CypA-KD-mediated effects. Double-stranded RNA derived from a processing of RNAi can also produce transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and mammalian cells (27Mette M.F.

Science. 2004; 305: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Transcriptional gene silencing mediated by double-stranded RNAs was shown to be due to RNA-dependent DNA methylation. RNA-dependent DNA methylation requires a double-stranded RNA to target DNA and is subsequently processed to yield short RNAs. These short double-stranded RNAs happened to include sequences identical to genomic promoter regions and in turn proved capable of inducing methylation of the homologous promoter and subsequent transcriptional gene silencing. Once again, we conducted a sequence BLAST search, and there were no sequences identified in the promoter region and first exon of the Peg3 gene identical to S1, which was used to target CypA (21Song J. Lu Y.C. Yokoyama K. Rossi J. Chiu R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this report, results from the stable CypA-KD clones S1–7 and S3-2 clearly demonstrated that suppression of Peg3 resulted in cells lacking CypA. Silencing of Peg3 was also accompanied by transient knockdown CypA in both P19 and F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, indicating that the observed silent Peg3 does not result from clonal selection. Furthermore, treatment of P19 cells with CsA, an isomerase inhibitor, resulted in silencing of Peg3, suggesting that the isomerase enzymatic activity of CypA is necessary for Peg3 expression. In contrast, treatment of P19 cells with FK506, rapamycin, FKBP isomerase blocking agents, did not affect Peg3 expression. These results further substantiate the notion that the isomerase enzymatic activity of CypA (and not FKBPs or calcineurin phosphatase activity) is required for Peg3 expression. In addition, data obtained from CypA-KO Jürkat cells clearly demonstrated that Peg3 expression is CypA-dependent (Fig. 2A). An attempt to rescue the silent Peg3 with a CypA cDNA expression plasmid that is not targetable by the RNAi-CypA failed (data not shown). This failure to rescue implicated that the irreversible covalent bond modification of DNA methylation has been established. The inverse relationship between mRNA expression and DNA hypermethylation as well as our findings of Peg3 reactivation by demethylation agents suggest that this epigenetic mechanism plays an important role in Peg3 regulation in CypA-KD P19 cells. Epigenetic switches consist of both DNA methylation and histone methylation (6Li T. Vu T.H. Ulaner G.A. Littman E. Ling J.Q. Chen H.L. Hu J.F. Behr B. Giudice L. Hoffman A.R. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 11: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Bisulfite genomic sequencing and MSP analysis clearly demonstrated a biallelic methylation of CpG islands within the promoter region, first exon, and first intron of the Peg3 gene in CypA-KD P19 cells, whereas methylation of this region in the WT P19 cells remains monoallelic (Fig. 5). CpG methylation at any critical site may increase the likelihood of binding of methylcytosine-binding proteins, which can recruit HDACs and H3-Lys-9 methyltransferase to mediate inactive chromatin remodeling. We hypothesized that MBD2 associates with methylated DNA within the promoter region of the repressed Peg3 gene. ChIP analysis with MBD2 antibody showed that more MBD2 was associated with the promoter region of Peg3 in the CypA-KD P19 cells (Fig. 8B). Additionally, a reciprocal pattern of acetyl Lys-H3 and trimethyl Lys-9-H3 was enriched in the CypA-KD cells compared with WT P19 cells, as indicated by ChIP assays (Fig. 8A). Trimethylation of histone 3 on Lys-9 provides a histone code indicative of inactive chromatin structure. Therefore, DNA methylation is both a cause for and a result of heterochromatinization. Methylation patterns depend upon the activity of DNA methyltransferases. A Dnmt activity assay using a synthetic template, poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), showed no increase in global Dnmt activities (data not shown), whereas the Dnmt1-bound Peg3 promoter is 2.07-fold higher in the CypA-KD cells than than in WT P19 cells (Fig. 6). Collectively, our data indicate that selective hypermethylation of DNA might have occurred in the CypA-KD cells, and Dnmt1 is involved in at least the maintenance of this hypermethylation. CypA may be necessary to retain a modulator, which is required for maintenance of imprinting gene expression, in the inactive cytoplasmic form as reported previously for the function of Hsp90 in chromatin remodeling (30Ruden D.M. Xiao L. Garfinkel M.D. Lu X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R149-R155Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Soldars V. Lu X. Xiao L. Wang X. Garfinkel M.D. Ruden D.M. Nat. Genet. 2005; 33: 70-74Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The precise temporal and spatial control of imprinting gene expression may be altered when cells lack CypA. It has been reported that DNA methylation patterns are remarkably stable and change little with the in vitro culture of cancer cell lines (32Turker M.S. Swisshelm K. Smith A.C. Martin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11632-11636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated a simple epigenetic switch for Peg3 by knocking down CypA. The precise mechanism underlying this switch remains to be elucidated. It is possible that the lack of isomerase activity of CypA leads to a global redistribution of factors required for epigenetic modifications. Inactivation of Peg3 by hypermethylation likely confers a survival advantage, as Peg3 regulates the translocation of the proapoptotic Bax from cytoplasm to the mitochondria (33Deng Y.B. Wu X.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CypA-KD P19 cells are indeed less sensitive to retinoic acid plus BMP4-induced apoptosis as compared with wild type cells. 3Y.-C. Lu, J. Song, H.-Y. Cho, G. Fan, K. K. Yokoyama, and R. Chiu, unpublished data. Peg3 hypermethylation has been reported in gliomas, and re-expression of a Peg3 cDNA in glioma cell lines resulted in a loss of tumorigenecity in nude mice, suggesting that this gene production functions as a tumor suppressor (34Kohda T. Asai A. Kuroiwa Y. Kobayashi S. Aisaka K. Nagashima G. Yoshida M.C. Kondo Y. Kagiyama N. Kirino T. Kaneko-Ishino T. Ishino F. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Taken together, this epigenetic alteration would seem to provide CypA-KD P19 cells with cell survival advantages compared with wild type cells. This statement is also supported by our previous data indicating that CypA-KD cells have a faster growth rate than wild type P19 cells (21Song J. Lu Y.C. Yokoyama K. Rossi J. Chiu R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24414-24419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2093491850,"An adequate and appropriate response to physiological and pathophysiological stresses is critical for long-term homeostasis and viability of the aging organism. Previous work has pointed to the immune system, telomeres and DNA repair pathways as important and distinct determinants of a normal healthy lifespan. In this study, we explored the genetic interactions of telomeres and DNA-PKcs, a protein involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and immune responses, in the context of a key aspect of aging and lifespan – the capacity to mount an acute and appropriate immune-mediated stress response. We observed that the combination of DNA-PKcs deficiency and telomere dysfunction resulted in a shortened lifespan that was reduced further following viral infection or experimental activation of the innate immune response. Analysis of the innate immune response in the DNA-PKcs-deficient mice with short dysfunctional telomeres revealed high basal serum levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and hyper-active cytokine responses upon challenge with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC). We further show that serum cytokine levels become elevated in telomere dysfunctional mice as a function of age. These results raise speculation that these genetic factors may contribute to misdirected immune responses of the aged under conditions of acute and chronic stress."
