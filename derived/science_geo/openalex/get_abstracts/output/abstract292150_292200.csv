https://openalex.org/W1994179563,"A field-effect transistor has been fabricated from polymer materials by printing techniques. The device characteristics, which show high current output, are insensitive to mechanical treatments such as bending or twisting. This all-organic flexible device, realized with mild techniques, opens the way for large-area, low-cost plastic electronics."

Ferromagnetism occurs even for the smallest sizes: for clusters with fewer than about 30 atoms the magnetic moments are atomlike; as the size is increased up to 700 atoms, the magnetic moments approach the bulk limit, with oscillations probably caused by surface-induced spin-density waves. The trends are explained in a magnetic shell model. A crystallographic phase transition from high moment to low moment in iron clusters has also been identified."
https://openalex.org/W1979858986,"This article describes the use of synchrotron radiation to study chemical and structural changes of catalysts during actual operating conditions. Described are techniques using x-ray absorption near edge structure, extended x-ray absorption fine structure, pre-edge x-ray absorption, and x-ray diffraction. Some of the catalysts examined are those used to produce methanol from synthesis gas and to produce light olefins from methanol. 21 refs., 3 figs."

The present topography of the Asal rift results from the tectonic dismemberment during the last 100,000 years of a large central volcanic edifice that formed astride the rift zone 300,000 to 100,000 years ago. Three-dimensional deformation of this volcano has been quantified from the combined analysis of the topography and geology. The analysis indicates that spreading at 17 to 29 millimeters per year in a N40° ± 5°E direction accounts for most of the separation between Arabia and Somalia. The small topographic subsidence relative to extension suggests that tectonic thinning of the crust has been balanced by injection and underplating of magmatic material of near crustal density. The methodology developed in this study could also be applied to quantify deformation in relatively inaccessible areas where the main available information is topography or bathymetry."

Upon gamma-ray irradiation of [(CH(3))(3)Si](8)Si(8)O(20), which is the trimethylsilylated derivative of the silicate anion with a double four-ring (D4R) cage, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra revealed that a single hydrogen atom is encapsulated in the center of the D4R cage and is stable for periods of many months. Attack by chemically reactive species such as oxygen was prevented by the D4R cage, but the ESR signal of the hydrogen atom was sensitive to the magnetic interaction caused by the presence of the O(2) molecule near the cage."

https://openalex.org/W1985016869,"Hot massive stars represent only a small fraction of the stellar population of the galaxy, but their enormous luminosities make them visible over large distances. Therefore, they are ideal standard candles, used to determine distances of near galaxies. Their mass loss due to supersonic winds driven by radiation pressure contributes significantly to the interstellar medium and thus to the chemical evolution of galaxies. All hot stars are soft x-ray sources; in contrast to the sun with its highly variable x-ray flux, long time scale x-ray variability is not common among hot stars. An analysis is presented here of an unusual increase in x-ray flux observed with the roentgen observatory satellite during a period of 2 days for the hot supergiant ζ Orionis, the only episode of x-ray variability that has been found in a hot star. These observations provide the most direct evidence so far for the scenario of shock-heated gas in the winds of hot stars."
