https://openalex.org/W4240099764,"THE most striking reactions associated with the growth of micro-organisms are synthetic ones, particularly those concerned with protein synthesis. The synthesis of each compound is a stepwise process, each step being catalysed by an enzyme ; if the necessary enzyme is in some way inhibited or has been lost during evolution of the organism, then growth will be slowed down or stopped unless the product of the reaction in which that enzyme was involved is now provided in the external environment. When the synthesis of a compound essential for growth is impossible through natural loss of an enzyme system, then that compound becomes for the organism a ‘growth-factor'. By this term it is not meant to imply that the compound in question is not essential for those organisms which do not require it to be present in the external environment ; all growth-factors investigated have been shown to be synthesized by a wide variety of organisms which do not require them pre-formed and, where these are known, to have the same functions as in the more exacting organisms. Thus it seems justifiable to consider all growth-factors as ‘essential metabolites' and to regard the differences in requirements for them as differences in synthetic ability of the organisms investigated. On this basis, interference with the functioning or further utilization of the essential metabolite would produce the same metabolic lesion in those organisms which are able to synthesize it as already exists naturally in those which are not."

https://openalex.org/W2013761257,"THE changes in bone in avitaminosis A have been reported by Mellanby1, Wolbach and Bessey2, and Wolbach3, who consider that the vitamin is concerned with the control of bone modelling. Mellanby found excessive formation of bone in certain areas during avitaminosis and that the osteoblasts and osteoclasts could reverse their positions at the effective bony surfaces. Wolbach3 considered that appositional bone formation continued in the normal site, but that concurrent resorption of bone ceased. Excessive doses of vitamin A have been found by many writers to cause spontaneous fractures of bones and internal haemorrhages (see Moore and Wang4 for a review of the literature). Wolbach3 considered that bone remodelling was greatly accelerated and that a defective tissue was laid down."

Though this scheme accounts for the experimental facts, we regard the proposed initiation reactions as unsatisfactory, for they suggest that formaldehyde is oxidized directly to formic acid, whereas it is highly probable that this does not take place in a single step. Our recent experiments on the oxidation of gaseous acetaldehyde2 have led us to propose as an initiation process the reaction of an oxygen molecule with an acetaldehyde molecule to form the acetyl radical and the perhydroxyl radical (HO2). If an analogous initiation reaction is postulated for the oxidation of formaldehyde, we have"
