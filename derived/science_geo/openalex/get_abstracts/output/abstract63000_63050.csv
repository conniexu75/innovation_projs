https://openalex.org/W1509804778,"Intact heme groups undergo exchange between molecules of human hemoglobin under physiological conditions. This phenomenon requires the presence of ferrihemoglobin and is blocked by heme ligands or the prior binding of hemoglobin to haptoglobin. The kinetics of heme exchange between hemoglobins A and F allows a calculation of the rate constants for the dissociation of heme and globin. The rate of exchange of hemes between the non-α chains of ferrihemoglobins A and F is approximately 8 times that between the α chains. Mixtures of ferrihemoglobins and oxyhemoglobins exchange hemes at a rate greater than predicted from the rates of exchange observed in mixtures containing only oxyhemoglobin or ferrihemoglobin. Ferriheme groups also undergo exchange between hemoglobin not bound to haptoglobin and methemalbumin, although at equilibrium the affinity of human albumin for ferriheme is only about one-fifteenth that of globin. Only primate albumins possess appreciable affinity for ferriheme; albumins from the nonprimate species examined appeared to be incapable of forming methemalbumin. Depletion of hemes from ferrihemoglobin by excess human albumin leads to the accumulation of free, precipitable globin."

https://openalex.org/W1534362816,"Abstract A glutaminase has been isolated from Escherichia coli in apparently homogeneous form. Two active sites per molecule are revealed by titration of the active sites with the specific analogue inhibitor, 6-14C-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, and estimation of molecular weight by gel filtration (mol wt 110,000). The pure enzyme has a specific activity, at pH 5.0 and 25°, of 1,520 µmoles per min per mg of protein, or a turnover number (kcat) per active site of 1,265 sec-1 when glutamine is the substrate. Km and kcat values are reported for the known substrates, which include amides, esters, and thioesters of glutamic acid. From studies with a large number of structurally related compounds it is concluded that the enzyme will bind only substances having an unsubstituted l-glutamyl acyl portion and a substituent in the γ position no larger than 2-hydroxyethylamino or 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, and will hydrolyze only those in which the substituent is no larger than methylamino or ethoxy. Transfer of the acyl moiety to hydroxylamine or methanol occurs, but at a relatively low rate. It is concluded that the enzyme has a water site. Heavy metals inhibit the enzyme, but iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, o-phenanthroline, and hydrogen peroxide do not. These observations suggest that this enzyme is not related to other well known enzymes with similar catalytic action, such as the serine esterases, thiol acylases, or metal-dependent acylases."
https://openalex.org/W1981277516,Mice infected with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii for periods of as long as 7 months were resistant to challenge with numbers of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium that were uniformly lethal to normal mice. This resistance did not appear to depend on the strain of toxoplasma employed or the route of inoculation of either toxoplasma or bacteria. Onset of immunity to listeria was demonstrable as early as 1 to 2 days after infection with toxoplasma. Resistance to toxoplasma was not demonstrable in mice immune to listeria. Interferon did not appear to be a mediator of the immunity observed in toxoplasma-infected mice.
https://openalex.org/W1519820833,"Abstract In an attempt to characterize the active site of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase B, we have studied the inhibition of this enzyme by several specific sulfonamide inhibitors and their N-chloroacetyl derivatives. In addition, two of the modified inhibitors were found to react irreversibly with the enzyme, resulting in inactivation. Enzymatic activity was determined from its catalytic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. The CO2-hydrating activity was also determined in some experiments and paralleled the activity determined from the esterase assays. N-Chloroacetylation at an amino group on the inhibitor far from the sulfonamide group resulted in little change or a decrease in the Ki values of the two inhibitors tested. Modification at the sulfonamide group abolished the inhibitory ability of two inhibitors, but two others retained their ability to inhibit the enzyme although the Ki values were higher. These are the only amide N-substituted sulfonamides that have been clearly shown to inhibit carbonic anhydrase reversibly. These two inhibitors, chloroacetylchlorothiazide and chloroacetylcyclothiazide, also reacted slowly with 1 eq of histidine per molecule of enzyme and caused complete, irreversible inactivation. After removal of the zinc atom from the enzyme, chloroacetylchlorothiazide failed to undergo this specific irreversible reaction. It is thought that the reactive histidine must be at or near the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1484423632,"Abstract A human macroglobulin (γM) was separated from the serum of normal donors who had been immunized with typhoid vaccine. The γM antibody to Salmonella typhi O 12 antigen was obtained by chromatography of the γM-globulin on a column of specific immunoadsorbent. The somatic antigen, i.e. the lipopolysaccharide of S. typhi, was extracted from the bacterium and partially hydrolyzed. A tetrasaccharide, which is the antigenic determinant of the lipopolysaccharide, was separated by paper chromatography. Equilibrium dialysis of the purified γM antibody with the tetrasaccharide showed that the antibody had 10 antigen-combining sites per molecule and an association constant with antigen of 2.7 x 104."

https://openalex.org/W1514192489,"Abstract Rat liver ribosomes in vitro incorporated labeled amino acids into proteins which showed the immunological behavior of the plasma lipoproteins. The presence of carrier lipoprotein or carrier lipid was required for the isolation and ultracentrifugal purification of immunologically reactive, labeled low and high density lipoproteins. The identity of the lipoproteins was further characterized by solubility criteria and a peptide-mapping technique. A high correlation between the peptide labeling patterns of ribosome-labeled and slice-labeled preparations was found. It is suggested that rat liver ribosomes in vitro are capable of synthesizing the protein moieties of the plasma lipoproteins. These apoproteins are then capable of binding lipid. Rat liver mitochondria and rat kidney ribosomes in vitro were also capable of incorporating radioactive amino acids into lipoproteins, but these proteins were immunologically different from the plasma lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1532578196,"Abstract l-Alanine dehydrogenase in Bacillus subtilis is inducible by its substrate, l-alanine. In addition to l-alanine, 10 other l-amino acids as well as d-alanine and 11 other d-amino acids are also inducers. The physiological role of the enzyme is to catabolize l-alanine to pyruvate and ammonia. The majority of the l-amino acid inducers can be converted to l-alanine by l-alanine transaminase. Similarly, the majority of the d-amino acid inducers can be converted to d-alanine by d-alanine transaminase. l- and d-Alanine, in turn, are interconvertible by alanine racemase. In a mutant deficient in alanine racemase, neither l-alanine nor any of the other l-amino acid inducers can induce l-alanine dehydrogenase, whereas the enzyme is still inducible by d-alanine and the other d-amino acid inducers. These results show that the l-amino acids induce l-alanine dehydrogenase only if they can be converted first to l-alanine and then to d-alanine. The pattern of control observed illustrates a new form of end product regulation, whereby d-alanine regulates its own biosynthesis via alanine racemase by the induction of l-alanine dehydrogenase. l-Alanine dehydrogenase catabolizes l-alanine, and thereby limits the amount of l-alanine available to alanine racemase for the synthesis of d-alanine."
https://openalex.org/W1492167474,"Abstract An enzyme has been obtained from extracts of a methionine-vitamin B12 auxotroph of Escherichia coli K-12 which catalyzes the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine from 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid and l-serine in the presence of ATP. This enzymatic activity appeared only during the later stages of growth and could not be detected when the organism was grown in a glucose-methionine-salts medium containing 2.0 µm FeSO4. The appearance of enzymatic activity from these iron grown cells, when incubated again in fresh medium, was dependent upon the presence of a chelating agent and synthesis de novo of protein. It is suggested that iron may be acting as a corepressor of the synthesis of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1579131478,"Abstract Some conditions of RNA synthesis in vitro in isolated mitochondria of Tetrahymena pyriformis were investigated. Sucrose gradient centrifugation analyses and methylated albumin-coated Kieselguhr column chromatography of the RNA synthesized in vitro demonstrate that RNA ranging from 14 S to 18 S, not transfer RNA, was synthesized. Furthermore, the RNA is hybridizable with mitochondrial DNA, and the hybridization is not inhibited by the addition of RNA isolated from the material sedimenting at 105,000 x g after centrifugation of mitochondrial lysate for 1½ to 2 hours. Although net transfer RNA synthesis does not occur, the transfer RNA fraction was labeled if 3H-ATP was used for incorporation, suggesting that the incorporation is due to the addition of 3H-ATP at the terminus of the transfer RNA molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1531727817,"Abstract An oligomer of deoxyribothymidylate in 5'-ester linkage to cellulose particles serves as a primer and template for the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, as a template for RNA polymerase, and as an initiator for the calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Synthesis by DNA polymerase of the homopolymer pair, polydeoxyriboadenylate and polydeoxyribothymidylate, takes place when oligodeoxyribothymidylate cellulose is hydrogen-bonded to an oligodeoxyriboadenylate to form a template pair. The product contains deoxythymidylate covalently linked to the cellulose and deoxyadenylate hydrogen-bonded to the deoxythymidylate. Block copolymers formed by transferase extension of an oligonucleotide cellulose can form hybrids with other synthetic polymers according to base pair specificities. Single stranded DNA extended with a homopolymer by terminal transferase can hydrogen bond via the homopolymer region to a complementary derivative of polynucleotide cellulose. Upon replication with DNA polymerase, the product strand is covalently attached to the cellulose. The advantages of the polynucleotide cellulose system include the known polarity of primer and product, the ease of quantitative collection and separation of the insoluble template and complementary product, and the capacity to distinguish between reactions occurring free in solution and those involving components fixed to a solid state matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2070888252,Specific antibodies to several bacteria pathogenic to humans were detected in the serums of white perch from surface waters adjacent to heavily populated areas on Chesapeake Bay. White perch from surface waters adjacent to sparsely populated areas were free of such antibodies. We suggest that fish may become actively infected with human pathogens by exposure to contaminated water and may constitute a hazard to public health.

https://openalex.org/W1656264601,"Abstract Myxobacter strain AL-1 excretes a bacteriolytic enzyme designated as AL-1 protease. A procedure is described for obtaining homogeneous preparations of the enzyme. Physical studies revealed s020,w = 2.40 S; D020,w = 14 x 10-7 cm2 per sec; [n] = 1.66 ± 0.1 ml per g; a molecular weight of 14,300; frictional coefficient (f/f0) = 1.0. AL-1 protease contains 136 amino acids, a value which corresponds to a minimal molecular weight of 13,977. In contrast to many exocellular enzymes, this protein contains 1 disulfide bond, 1 mole of hexose, a relatively high content of aromatic amino acids, and an E1%1 cm = 15.8 at 280 mµ. The shortest peptide which served as a substrate was a tetrapeptide. Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly yielded Gly-Gly; Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly yielded Gly-Gly and Gly-Gly-Gly; l-Ala-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly yielded l-Ala-Gly-Gly and Gly-Gly; Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-l-Ala yielded Gly-Gly-Gly and Gly-l-Ala; Gly-Gly-l-Ala-Gly-Gly yielded Gly-Gly and l-Ala-Gly-Gly; and N-CBZ-Gly-l-Pro-l-Leu-Gly-l-Pro yielded N-CBZ-Gly-l-Pro and l-Leu-Gly-l-Pro. The hydrolysis points in the oxidized β chain of insulin were Ala-Leu, Val-CySO3H, and Gly-Phe."

https://openalex.org/W1546489691,"Abstract The relative amounts of two valyl-tRNA species from Bacillus subtilis W23 were compared by methylated albumin Kieselguhr column chromatography and by diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography after T1 ribonuclease digestion. The ratio of the two valyl-tRNAs changes significantly during sporulation, during step-up and step-down growth transitions, during the stationary phase of an asporogenous mutant, and during sporulation of B. subtilis 168 Marburg. The change in ratio could not be induced in vitro by treating the tRNA preparations with several chemicals and was not the result of differential hydrolysis of the two valyl-tRNA species during the experimental procedures. The change in ratio was due to the increased valine-accepting ability of one of the two valine tRNAs. These results suggest that the valyl-tRNA ratio changes may be a function of the growth condition and that a regulatory mechanism exists which controls the amino acid accepting capacity of the two valine accepting tRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1966310358,"Osmotically sensitive pools in Escherichia coli are released by treatment with warm water without loss in viability or of cytoplasmic components. The rates of protein release are linear and are inversely dependent on the osmolarity of the medium, and only discrete amounts are released. These pools, which are thought to be periplasmic and mesosomal, are stabilized with magnesium ions; material released in the presence of these ions may have been localized outside of these pools at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2028035386,Monophenol oxidase (or tyrosinase-A1) activity appears to be absent from extracts from pupae of homozygous lozenge-glossy (lzg/lzg) females and (lzg/♂) males of Drosophila melanogaster. Diphenol oxidase (tyrosinase-A2) activity is less in the mutant extracts than in extracts of wild-type Oregon-R pupae of the same age and sex.
https://openalex.org/W2148824354,"Major variables which determine the induction and severity of adoptive autoimmune encephalomyelitis are the age and strain of the animal, and the amount of killed mycobacteria in the adjuvant. Control of these factors results in consistent production of this disease in high incidence and in severe form. The pathologic changes in the central nervous system can be correlated with the clinical disease. Maturity of the target tissues in the central nervous system of the newborn appears to be an important factor which distinguishes the response of the guinea pig from that of other species."

https://openalex.org/W1567029609,"Abstract Fatty acids in a 30,000 to 100,000 x g ultracentrifugal pellet from pituitary glands, liver, and muscle were found to be responsible for an observed alteration of the disc electrophoretic behavior of a number of proteins. Three principal fatty acids were found in the pellet (oleic, palmitic, and stearic) and, of the three, oleic was the most effective in causing the alteration. When analyzed electrophoretically (pH 9.5) with fatty acid or the ultracentrifugal pellet, prolactin and growth hormone, as well as hemoglobin and myoglobin, were converted to forms that migrated in the pre-albumin area and at the electrophoretic buffer front. Aggregated prolactin dissociated to lower molecular weight material; the 19 S component of thyroglobulin was converted to the 12 S form, together with higher molecular weight substances. Muscle aldolase, which normally migrates as one electrophoretic component, showed at least four new bands when analyzed with oleic acid. Alteration of the electrophoretic pattern could be demonstrated with the 100,000 x g pellet before extraction of fatty acids, and even with some crude extracts. Addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate to extracts or ultracentrifugal pellets increased the amount of alteration but was without effect when purified fatty acids were used. Deoxycholate and divalent metal ions prevented alteration in all cases. Modification of electrophoretic patterns by the extracts and pellets was proportional to the sample height if the disc electrophoretic method was used and was minimal when the concentrating gel was eliminated. Sample height effects were not detectable when purified fatty acids were used. Alteration of electrophoretic pattern occurred only under alkaline conditions. Serum albumin and transferrin were unaffected. No alteration of the electrophoretic patterns was caused when red cell stroma or bacterial cell wall was mixed with purified proteins. The studies indicate that caution should be used in interpreting disc electrophoretic patterns when fatty acids are present, as in the analysis of mitochondrial and microsomal preparations. The work also suggests a possible use of fatty acids and disc electrophoresis in the study of protein dissociation."
