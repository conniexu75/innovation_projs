https://openalex.org/W2086601588,"At 4 A resolution the polynucleotides in yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA are seen in a series of electron dense masses about 5.8 A apart. These peaks are probably associated with the phosphate groups, while lower levels of electron density between segments of adjacent polynucleotide chains are interpreted as arising from hydrogen-bonded purine-pyrimidine base pairs. It is possible to trace the entire polynucleotide chain with only two minor regions of ambiguity. The polynucleotide chain has a secondary structure consistent with the cloverleaf conformation; however, its folding is different from that proposed in any model. The molecule is made of two double-stranded helical regions oriented at right angles to each other in the shape of an L. One end of the L has the CCA acceptor; the anticodon loop is at the other end, and the dihydrouridine and TpsiC loops form the corner."
https://openalex.org/W1518934584,"The deoxyribonucleic acid polymerases induced by two mutator, two antimutator, and one neutral temperature-sensitive strain of T4D have been partially purified and compared to each other and to the wild type polymerase. Measurements of polymerase, polymerase-associated exonuclease, and deoxynucleoside triphosphate turnover indicate that the mutators and antimutators may be readily distinguished from wild type by the ratios of these activities. The enzymes prepared from mutators have a much lower exonuclease to polymerase ratio than wild type, and the antimutators have a higher ratio of exonuclease to polymerase and a higher rate of nucleotide turnover. Similar measurements with the neutral temperature-sensitive mutant indicate a close resemblance to wild type. On the basis of these experiments we propose that the spontaneous mutation rate is related to the relative rates of insertion and removal of nucleotides during synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid. Mutations in the structural gene of the polymerase which perturb this exonuclease to polymerase ratio are expressed as mutator or antimutator genes."

(1970) Biochem. J. 117, 405). Levels of glutamate synthase are similar in Escherichia coli grown on 4 mm or 100 mm NH4Cl, but significantly lower levels of enzyme are produced when glutamate replaces NH4Cl as the source of nitrogen. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from crude extracts of E. coli. Homogeneity was established by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies. Stability of the purified enzyme is increased in the presence of α-ketoglutarate and 2-mercaptoethanol. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme exhibits maxima at 278, 380, and 440 nm. The purified enzyme contained 7.8 moles of flavin (both FAD and FMN), 38.4 moles of iron, and 30.4 moles of labile sulfide per 800,000 g of protein. Molybdenum was not detected. Enzyme reduced by dithionite was partially (64%) reoxidized by α-ketoglutarate + l-glutamine. The enzyme is highly specific for its substrates. Substrate saturation kinetics is hyperbolic; Km values for TPNH, α-ketoglutarate, and l-glutamine are 7.7, 7.3, and 250 µm, respectively. The pH optimum for catalytic activity is 7.6. Of more than 50 compounds studied only d- and l-aspartate, l-methionine, d-glutamate, and TPN produced 50% inhibition of catalytic activity at concentrations below 10 mm. l-cysteine, l-serine, glycine, l-homoserine, l-glutamate, l-asparagine, l-alanine, and l-histidine also were significant inhibitors. The purified enzyme sediments as a single symmetrical boundary in the analytical ultracentrifuge (s20,w = 20 S). A molecular weight of 800,000 (for v = 0.73) was determined by sedimentation equilibrium and confirmed by gel filtration. On sucrose gradient sedimentation the purified enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 20 S but the activity in an ammonium sulfate fraction of crude extract has a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 13 S. The purified protein migrates as a single band during electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels at pH 7.2 and pH 8.5 and on cellulose acetate at pH 8.4. Enzyme treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), urea, or guanidine migrates as two components (mol wt 53,000 and 135,000) on SDS or urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme contains 18 half-cystine residues per 200,000 g of protein; one of these is accessible to 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W1507667811,"Abstract A major envelope protein of Escherichia coli was found to exist in two different forms in the envelope. One-third of the protein is covalently linked to the peptidoglycan (bound form) as found by Braun and his co-workers. The remaining two-thirds of the protein are in the envelope but are not covalently linked to the peptidoglycan (free form). In contrast to the free form, the bound form can only be solubilized by 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) after lysozyme treatment of the envelope. The bound form thus solubilized shows a slightly higher molecular weight than the free form on SDS acrylamide gel electrophoresis because it has an attached peptidoglycan fragment. When E. coli cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]- or [14C]arginine for 4 min, all of the radioactivity of the protein in the envelope was found in the free form. Chasing with non-radioactive arginine showed that a portion of the free form was converted into the bound form. The ratio of the radioactivity in the free form to that in the bound form reached a constant level after chasing for one doubling time. These results indicate that the free form of the protein is first synthesized and then converted into the bound form. It appears that the reaction between the two forms is reversible and that there is a dynamic equilibrium between the two forms of the protein in the envelope. The conversion from the free form to the bound form was not inhibited by chloramphenicol, amino acid starvation (arginine), or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone."
https://openalex.org/W1600120419,"Abstract Plasma membranes isolated from Acanthamoeba castellanii are associated with filaments that have been identified as actin by the width of the filaments, their specific interaction with heavy meromyosin to form polarized arrowhead structures, and their removal by conditions that dissociate actin. Some evidence was obtained that the co-isolation of plasma membranes and actin might be a consequence of specific attachment of the filaments to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane in vitro and, by inference, in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1487382673,"Abstract Nucleotide pools were analyzed under different conditions of infection by bacteriophage T4, for three reasons: (a) as an approach to identifying the defective functions associated with conditional lethal phage mutants bearing uncharacterized lesions in DNA replication; (b) to gain information about the control of nucleotide synthesis in phage-infected Escherichia coli; and (c) as an aid to interpretation of earlier data (Mathews, C. K. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 5610) which suggested that the rate of total RNA synthesis decreases when DNA replication is blocked. In infection by wild type T4D there are no significant changes in ribo- or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pool sizes, except for replacement of dCTP by 5-hydroxymethyl-dCTP. By contrast, infection by DNA-negative mutants causes up to 30-fold pool expansions of dATP and dTTP, with hydroxymethyl-dCTP accumulating to similar extents. The dGTP pool, however, does not expand significantly, suggesting that the synthesis of this nucleotide is regulated more closely than those of the others. Ribonucleoside triphosphate pools do not expand dramatically in infection by mutants in genes 42, 44, or 62, but up to 5-fold pool expansion is seen in infection by mutants in genes 41 and 45. These studies indicate that the products of genes 41, 44, 45, and 62 do not directly affect the synthesis of DNA precursors. Moreover, comparative studies on the rates of labeling of RNA precursors late in infection support the earlier reported conclusion that the rate of RNA synthesis decreases considerably when DNA synthesis is blocked. Finally, the data allow calculation of the adenylate energy charge and of approximate concentrations of nucleotides in exponentially growing E. coli. The energy charge is about 0.9, in agreement with published work, and this value does not change significantly under the conditions of infection examined. The intracellular concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates range from 0.1 mm for dGTP to 2.7 mm for ATP. These values allow one to ask which of various enzyme feedback effects observed in vitro might reasonably be assumed to be operating in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2085888839,"Without altering the structural integrity of the placenta by irradiation or drugs, we have shown that it is possible to immunize females both adoptively and actively against the paternally inherited transplantation antigens of their fetuses. Such immunization causes a high incidence of runt disease among the litters. Although the putative chimeric status of the affected offspring has yet to be confirmed, the results of our experiments support the thesis that runt disease is caused by the activities of ""unwanted"" immigrant lymphocytes from the maternal circulation. Our results suggest that immunologically activated cells are more likely to cross the placenta than normal cells and that this greater mobility may not be related to the immunologic specificity of the activated cells. Two factors may have contributed to the apparent failure of numerous previous attempts to demonstrate the capacity of transplantation immunity to affect the well-being of a fetus or, more correctly, its placenta, in the way that might be expected of a homograft. (i) Investigators were preoccupied with obtaining a classic type of rejection, in utero, analogous to the rejection of an orthotopic skin homograft. The birth of consistently healthy-looking litters, interpreted as a failure of the experiment, convinced the investigators of the efficacy of nature's solution of the homograft problem and there was no reason for them to suspect its possible limitations. Observation of the litters for several weeks might have uncovered the phenomenon of maternally induced runt disease. (ii) Most investigators resorted to hyperimmunization of the mothers. This would have facilitated the synthesis of protective isoantibodies capable of interfering with the expression of the potentially harmful cellular immune response (6). Ever since the abnormalities of runt disease were first described they have repeatedly been compared to those observed in patients with certain lymphomas (17). Various theories have been propounded as to how maternally transmitted graft-versus-host reactivity might lead to the development of these tumors. In mice it has been established that graft-versus-host reactivity may result in a high incidence of lymphomas (18). Recent analysis indicates that this graft-versus-host reactivity unmasks and activates normally latent and undemonstrable oncogenic viruses (19). The work we describe in this article may have some relevance to the possible clinical significance of transplacental cellular mobility in man. We suggest that the relatively high incidence of lymphomas in children might also be, in part at least, due to unmasking of oncogenic viruses by subclinical graft-versus-host reactivity mediated by immunocompetent cells of maternal origin. The statistical evidence that male infants are at greater risk than females (20) is concordant with our observation that maternally induced runts include a significantly higher proportion of males than females (10)."

https://openalex.org/W1589997384,"Abstract The linkage between the galactose and the N-acetylgalactosamine of the disaccharide attached to every threonine of the freezing point-depressing glycoproteins from the antarctic fish, Trematomus borchgrevinki, has been previously suggested to be β, 1–3 or 1–4, rather than 1–6. This paper reports some colorimetric chemical evidence favoring a 1–3 linkage. Unsubstituted chromogen is formed from the breakdown of the N-acetylgalactosamine upon β elimination with 0.05 m Na2CO3, indicating a 1–3 linkage. The linkage was proven to be of the β type by the release of the terminal galactose when small glycopeptides, obtained by hydrolysis of the glycoproteins with elastate, were incubated with β-galactosidase (Escherichia coli). Enzymatic oxidation of the C-6 hydroxyls of the galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine to the aldehydes by galactose oxidase resulted in a fully active glycoprotein. The activity was lost, however, by the conversion of these newly formed C-6 aldehydes to negatively charged groups, either by oxidation to carboxyl groups with halogen or by formation of the bisulfite addition products."
https://openalex.org/W1500889816,"The kinetics of the Mg2+ activation of crystalline yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase have been thoroughly investigated from pH 7.40 to pH 9.05 using a sensitive isotope assay in order to determine the role of the divalent metal ion activator in the reaction. A computer program has been devised for calculating the concentration of each of the various components of the complex equilibrium involving Mg2+ and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The reaction rate was measured over a wide range of Mg2+ and PPi concentrations, and the concentration dependence of the measured rate was kinetically analyzed by a computerized algorithm for nonlinear regression. The computer analysis included the testing of several plausible kinetic models for goodness of fit to the data, and determination of best values of kinetic parameters for the various models. The simplest kinetic model which provides a good fit to all of the data involves binding of free Mg2+ by the enzyme followed by binding of PPi ligands. Both MgPPi and Mg2PPi are substrates; at pH 7.40 the latter is hydrolyzed 22% as rapidly as the former. Free PPi is bound but is not hydrolyzed at a significant rate. On the basis of these kinetic studies we propose two roles for the metal ion in this reaction: activation of the enzyme to a form which binds substrate, and formation of substrate by complexing with PPi. These roles are entirely consistent with our previously reported equilibrium binding studies of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1513853538,"Abstract The inducible enzyme, cysteine desulfhydrase, was purified from Salmonella typhimurium to a state of near homogeneity. This enzyme has a very low tryptophanase activity, lacks cystathionase and tryptophan synthetase activities, and appears to be a specific cysteine desulfhydrase. The purified native enzyme has an s20,w of 10.4 and a molecular weight of 229,000 as determined by equilibrium sedimentation. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate showed a single species of polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 37,000 while the pyridoxal phosphate content was found to be 1 mole per 37,700 g of protein. These data, together with the results of amino acid analyses, tryptic peptide maps, and an NH2-terminal amino acid analysis, indicate that the native enzyme is a hexamer, containing 6 moles of pyridoxal phosphate, and composed of six identical polypeptide chains with NH2-terminal serines."
https://openalex.org/W1634487747,"Abstract Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase induced in Escherichia coli by infection with bacteriophage T4 catalyzes the reduction of the 5'-diphosphates of cytidine, uridine, guanosine, and adenosine (CDP, UDP, GDP, and ADP). The specificity of the enzyme for the substrates is governed by different nucleoside triphosphates which act both by changing the maximal velocity of the reaction and the apparent Km for the substrates. Deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and ATP are the prime effectors for the reduction of the pyrimidine ribonucleotides CDP and UDP, deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) is the prime effector for the reduction of GDP, and dGTP is the prime effector for the reduction of ADP. None of the nucleotides is a general inhibitor. Substrate saturation curves are hyperbolic both in the absence and presence of effector. In the presence of the prime effector the maximal velocity with each of the four substrates is of the same magnitude. The Km values for CDP, GDP, and ADP are about 0.3 mm in the absence of effector and about 0.05 mm in the presence of a prime effector. The corresponding Km values for UDP are 1.2 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively. It is suggested that the nucleoside triphosphates act by allosteric mechanisms. Competition experiments indicate that the enzyme contains a single allosteric site and a single catalytic site. The allosteric properties of T4 ribonucleotide reductase are in many ways similar to those of the E. coli enzyme. A main difference, however, concerns the effect of dATP. With the T4 enzyme this nucleotide is a prime effector for the reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleotides while it is an inhibitor for the reduction of all ribonucleotides with the E. coli enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1518343494,"Abstract Milligram quantities of the apparent native form of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), a component of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase, have been purified to apparent homogeneity using a procedure which largely avoided dissociation or proteolysis. The isolated BCCP served as an effective carboxyl acceptor and donor in the biotin carboxylase and transcarboxylase half-reactions of acetyl-CoA carboxylase at concentrations which were 50- to 100-fold lower than those needed with either BCCP(9100) or BCCP(10400) (previously isolated smaller forms of BCCP with molecular weights of 9,100 and 10,400, respectively). The purified BCCP exhibited a single protein band upon electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence or absence of 8 m urea or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and upon isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels. From the latter an isoelectric point of 4.5 was determined. BCCP was found to contain an average of 10.68 µg of biotin per mg of protein, or 1 mole of biotin per 22,900 g of protein. Amino acid analysis revealed 207 residues per residue of biotin, corresponding to a residue molecular weight of 22,156; 2 half-cystine residues were indicated. Only 1 of these half-cystine residues could be titrated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and then only in the presence of denaturing agents such as 8 m urea or 2% SDS. The denaturation by urea was partially reversible. A comparison of the amino acid composition of BCCP with those of BCCP(9100) and BCCP(10400) lends support to the suggestion that these smaller forms were derived from native BCCP by proteolysis. The subunit molecular weight of BCCP was determined by (a) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 1% SDS which, even without prior reduction, gave a single protein band of molecular weight 22,500 ± 1,200, as determined by comparison with the migration of standard proteins; (b) gel filtration along with standard proteins in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride which indicated an average molecular weight of 21,800. These values correlated well with the biotin content, assuming 1 residue of biotin per polypeptide chain. Various multimeric forms of BCCP were detected in vitro by the following. (a) Gel filtration of BCCP in buffer on a column calibrated with standard proteins revealed a dimer of approximate molecular weight 46,000, which under various mild conditions dissociated (apparently irreversibly) to a monomer of approximate molecular weight 24,000; o-phenanthroline largely prevented the dissociation, suggesting the involvement of a metalloprotein in this process. (b) Sedimentation velocity centrifugation of BCCP exhibited a single symmetrical peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 5.7 to 5.9 S; this species may represent a tetrameric form of BCCP; (c) prolonged dialysis of apparently homogenous BCCP resulted in a polydisperse mixture with molecular weight ranging from approximately 20,000 to greater than 200,000 as measured by sedimentation equilibrium. It is apparent that under appropriate conditions BCCP can undergo dissociation or aggregation. The evidence to date suggests that the apparent native form of BCCP is best represented by a dimeric structure (molecular weight 45,000) which is composed of 2 subunits (molecular weight 22,500), each containing one biotin prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W1531068546,"Abstract Ribosomes complexed with poly(U) and Phe-transfer RNA (tRNA) have been examined for their ability to interact with elongation factor G (EF-G). It is shown that Phe-tRNA, bound to ribosomes either at 6 mm Mg2+ in the presence of elongation factor Tu and GTP or at 20 mm Mg2+ in the absence of these compounds, strongly inhibits (50 to 90%) the binding of EF-G, as measured by the formation of either the GDP·EF-G·fusidic acid·ribosome complex or the 5'-guanylyl methylene diphosphonate·EF-G·ribosome complex. Moreover, ribosome-bound Phe-tRNA inhibits also, and to a similar extent, both the GTP hydrolysis associated with the formation of the GDP·EF-G·fusidic acid·ribosome complex and that observed in the presence of only EF-G and ribosomes. These findings, together with the previously observed inhibition of aminoacyl-tRNA binding by ribosome-bound EF-G, lead to the conclusion that EF-G and aminoacyl-tRNA bind to the ribosome at mutually exclusive sites. This provides strong evidence for overlapping or interaction between the binding site of EF-G on the 50 S subunit and that of aminoacyl-tRNA, the ribosomal A-site."

https://openalex.org/W1529670189,"Abstract The acetylenic hydroxy acid, 2-hydroxy-3-butynoate, is an irreversible inactivator of d-lactate dehydrogenase and d-lactate-dependent lactose, proline, and valinomycin-induced rubidium transport in isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli. The compound serves as a substrate for d-lactate dehydrogenase which undergoes some 15 to 30 turnovers prior to inactivation. Similarly, a low activity, membrane-bound l-lactate dehydrogenase is also inactivated presumably by the l isomer of the acetylenic substrate. These effects are highly specific as evidenced by the following observations. 1. Inactivation of d-lactate dehydrogenase in membrane vesicles or in a solubilized, partially purified preparation of this enzyme exhibits similar properties. 2. Although d- and l-lactate oxidation by membrane vesicles and transport in the presence of these electron donors is inactivated by hydroxybutynoate, the oxidation of succinate and NADH, and succinate- and NADH-stimulated transport are not affected. Moreover, ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate-dependent transport is not inactivated by hydroxybutynoate. 3. 3-Butynoate inhibits neither d-lactate dehydrogenase activity nor d-lactate-dependent transport; and 2-hydroxy-3-butenoate (vinylglycolate) serves as a substrate for d-lactate dehydrogenase, and is thus an effective electron donor for transport. 4. Kinetics of inactivation of d-lactate dehydrogenase activity and d-lactate-dependent lactose, proline, and valinomycin-induced rubidium transport are virtually identical with respect to both inhibitor concentration and time. 5. Inactivation of d-lactate-dependent transport by 2-hydroxy-3-butynoate is blocked by d-lactate, but not by succinate and NADH. 6. α-Glycerol-P-dependent threonine transport in Staphylococcus aureus vesicles is not inactivated by hydroxy-butynoic acid. A possible mechanism of inhibition is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W9134973,"Abstract A modification of the reacting enzyme sedimentation technique of Cohen et al. ((1967) Biopolymers 5, 203) has been used to investigate the sedimentation coefficients and probable quaternary structures of the reacting form of pyruvate carboxylase from several different sources. In this technique, the sedimentation of a lamellar layer of enzyme through a reaction mixture is measured by changes in absorption that are due to the appearance of a product or the disappearance of a substrate. In the present studies the method of Cohen et al. has been modified by the addition of malate dehydrogenase as a coupling enzyme, by the inclusion of 50% D2O in the reaction mixture to stabilize the sedimenting band of enzyme, and by the use of the photoelectric scanner accessory to measure the optical changes. The s20,w values for the reacting forms of pyruvate carboxylase from Pseudomonas citronellolis, yeast, and chicken liver have been determined by this procedure to be 12.9 S, 16.3 S, and 15.9 S, respectively. The validity of these results obtained with the coupled enzyme assay were confirmed by experiments in which the direct formation of oxalacetate was observed. The s020,w values which were obtained by sedimentation velocity studies of the protein of the same three varieties of the enzyme were 12.3 S, 16.2 S, and 16.4 S, respectively, and thus are in good agreement with the results of the reacting form studies. Molecular weight determinations of the bacterial enzyme by the principle of Archibald gave values of about 260,000 or approximately one-half of those of the enzymes from yeast and liver. Also, the biotin content of the bacterial enzyme is approximately 2 moles per mole of enzyme compared with 4 moles per mole for the enzyme from yeast or liver. Thus, the cumulative evidence strongly suggests that the predominant reacting form of the bacterial enzyme is a dimer, whereas those of the enzymes from yeast and liver are tetramers."
https://openalex.org/W1534512815,"Abstract When membranes isolated from an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of Escherichia coli grown on oleate were treated with aqueous acetone, approximately 50% of the phospholipids were removed and 70% of the succinic-dichloroindophenol (DCI) reductase activity was lost. Preliminary incubation with total lipids isolated from cells grown on oleate or elaidate restored the reductase activity to the acetone-treated membrane. An Arrhenius plot of the activity remaining in oleate membranes after delipidation showed no discontinuity between 12–37°. When the same membrane preparation was previously incubated with dispersions of lipids, the Arrhenius plot of succinic-DCI reductase activity showed a discontinuity at 19° when oleate lipids were used, and at 28° when elaidate lipids were used. Total cell lipids could be replaced with phospholipids plus coenzyme Q6. However, neither of these alone had a significant stimulatory effect. The Arrhenius plot of succinic-ubiquinone reductase activity of either oleate acetone-extracted membranes or elaidate acetone-extracted membranes gave transitions between 27–29° after preliminary incubation with elaidate phospholipids plus Q6, and between 17–19° after prior incubation with oleate phospholipids plus Q6. The data indicate that the presence of a transition in Arrhenius plot of succinic dehydrogenase (measured by DCI reduction) in the membranes of this mutant is dependent on the phospholipids, and that the temperature at which this transition occurs is determined by the nature of the apolar group of the lipid."

Cyanogen bromide fragments and peptic peptides of the carboxymethylated protein were isolated and their sequences were established by a combination of enzymatic fragmentation and 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Edman degradation. This provided the necessary overlaps for ordering of the tryptic peptides, described in the preceding paper. The oxidation-reduction active disulfide bridge of T4 thioredoxin is present in the NH2-terminal part of the molecule (Cys14 and Cys17). Apart from the 14-membered disulfide ring, the amino acid sequence of T4 thioredoxin shows no homology with thioredoxin from Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1496285003,"Abstract We have measured the amount of tRNA in cotton cotyledons that can be charged with each of the 20 amino acids at four developmental stages in cotyledon embryogenesis and germination. We have examined the number and relative levels of isoaccepting tRNA species for 15 amino acids at the same developmental stages by RPC-2 (Freon) chromatography and by the chromatography of RNAse T1 digests of aminoacyl-tRNA. We have made the same measurements with tRNA from cotton root tissue and from partially purified cotton chloroplasts. The results suggest that there are no differences in the levels of cytoplasmic tRNA species between cotyledons of various developmental stages nor between cotyledons and roots. There is, however, a large increase in the amount of chloroplastic tRNA per cell that occurs during early germination, and this increase is not induced by a light stimulus. Chloroplast tRNA exists in young embryogenic cotyledons and roots, and the amounts of the individual chloroplastic isoaccepting tRNA species do not change relative to each other as they increase in the cotyledon cells during germination. It is concluded from these data that developmental changes in cotton seedlings are not accompanied by changes in the capacity for translating individual code words."

This enzyme preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of certain methionyl dipeptides and for this reason is referred to as dipeptidase m. Of the substrates tested with the homogeneous enzyme methionylalanine and methionylserine were the most rapidily hydrolyzed. Other substrates were cleaved more slowly, if at all, by this peptidase. The substrate specificity of this enzyme suggests that it may be involved in the removal of NH2-terminal methionine from newly initiated E. coli proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1552027598,"Abstract Formation of phosphohistidine at only one of an apparent total of two active sites in Escherichia coli succinyl coenzyme A synthetase results in profound changes in the reactivity of the enzyme. On storage, the dephosphorylated form of enzyme loses activity at a rate approximately 100 times that of the monophosphorylated form. Similarly, there is a difference of two orders of magnitude in the rates of inactivation by trypsin of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated enzymes. There is direct correlation between both the rate and extent of inactivation and the status of phosphorylation of the enzyme. In keeping with the ability of substrates to interconvert the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of enzyme, ATP protects the previously dephosphorylated enzyme from proteolytic attack, whereas the presence of succinate and Mg++ renders previously phosphorylated enzyme susceptible to proteolysis. These effects are observed not only with trypsin, but with a variety of proteases having different specificities. The results indicate that phosphorylation of 1 active site histidine residue per oligomeric enzyme molecule results in a significant change in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme to a tighter conformation, with concomitant stability and, perhaps, distortion of the second active site in the molecule so that its phosphorylation is unfavorable."

In the presence of 0.5 mm puromycin it is quantitatively converted to fMet-(peptidyl)-puromycin derivatives; hence the formation of labeled fMet-puromycin itself, extracted from reaction mixtures continuously exposed to the inhibitor, can be utilized as a quantitative measure of mitochondrial protein initiation by spheroplasts derived from yeast cells in different physiological states and from genetically marked strains. It is low under glucose repression and absent in a strain lacking mitochondrial DNA."

Measures such as specific conductivity for ionic impurities and surface tension for surfactants are better indications of purity. Variation in tapwater solutes makes it possible to distinguish samples by taste so that the same criterion may be true for purity variations in distilled water. This was tested here using once and twice distilled water."
https://openalex.org/W1557299463,"Abstract To elucidate the structural characteristics of bovine serum albumin (BSA) which allow for steroid binding, BSA was digested with pepsin under conditions which afford maximal retention of steroid binding activity consistent with a maximal degree of peptide fragmentation. Digestion with pepsinBSA (w/w), 1:3000, pH 3.0, for 2 hours at 25° afforded a complex mixture of peptide fragments with molecular weights of about 14,000 (a major class of components), and 27,000 and 34,000 (minor classes) estimated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the digest. As much as 40 to 50% of the initial steroid binding activity was retained in the BSA digest; the steroids studied were progesterone, testosterone, and 17β-estradiol. Steroid binding activity was empirically defined as the product of the ratio of bound to unbound steroid times the reciprocal of the total protein or peptide concentration (gram per liter) in an assay system containing Sephadex G-25 or G-10 under conditions of equilibrium. The crude BSA digest was treated successively with 2% and 10% trichloroacetic acid; the respective trichloroacetic acid-precipitable peptides were chromatographed on Sephadex G-75. The 2% trichloroacetic acid chromatographic fractions exhibited a relatively high progesterone binding activity, and also appreciable testosterone and estradiol binding, whereas successive chromatographic fractions of the 10% trichloroacetic acid fraction exhibited diminishing steroid binding activity. Binding activity correlated with the absorbance ratio, 280:258 nm, of the respective chromatographic fractions, suggesting that peptide fragments which are richer in tyrosine tend to retain steroid binding activity to a greater degree. Although the bulk of the peptide material remains to be resolved, two peptide fragments, KL and VI, were isolated from the 2% trichloroacetic acid and 10% trichloroacetic acid fractions, respectively. Peptide KL (mol wt 10,050) is rich in tyrosine. The equilibrium constant, nk, for the formation of a complex of peptide KL with progesterone, testosterone, or 17β-estradiol at 25° was about 0.44, 0.18, or 0.33 x 104 m-1, respectively. Peptide VI (mol wt 2766) appears to be identical with the NH2-terminal or Asp fragment of BSA previously isolated by Peters and Hawn ((1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 1566). Peptide VI contains no tyrosine and exhibits very little steroidbinding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1598397229,"The reassociation of ribosomal subunits to from 80 S monomers is catalyzed by a rat liver cytosol fraction (G-25) and by the initiation factor M1 (formerly called 40 S binding factor). Reassociation requires a template (we have generally used poly(U)) and either aminoacyl-tRNA or deacylated tRNA. Initiation factor-catalyzed formation of 40 S-60 S couples can occur in two ways. The first pathway of reassociation has faster kinetics, requires aminoacyl-tRNA, is insensitive to cycloheximide, and leads to the formation of 80 S ribosomes active in the synthesis of protein. The second pathway has slower kinetics, uses deacylated-tRNA, is sensitive to inhibition by cycloheximide, and the 80 S ribosomes formed do not synthesize protein. Although cycloheximide inhibits reassociation by the second pathway it does not interfere with the binding of deacylated tRNA to 40 S subunits (or of aminoacyl-tRNA, for that matter). That reassociation which occurs in the absence of initiation factors probably proceeds by the second pathway since it has slow kinetics and is inhibited by cycloheximide. Reassociation of ribosomal subunits catalyzed by purified M1 is also inhibited by cycloheximide, which suggests that a second factor is normally required."

https://openalex.org/W1602336189,"Abstract The glutamic acid residue at the active center of bovine carboxypeptidase B was labeled with α-N-bromoacetyl-d-[5-14C]arginine and the alkylated protein was hydrolyzed with pepsin. A 14C-labeled peptide fraction was isolated in a 52% yield by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 followed by ion exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose. Compositional and end group analysis, in addition to enzymatic hydrolysis with carboxypeptidases A and B, aminopeptidase M, and trypsin, suggest the following amino acid sequence: Thr-Phe-Glu-Leu-Arg-Asp-Lys-Gly-Arg-Tyr-Gly-Phe. A comparison with the glutamic acid-containing sequence at the active sites of carboxypeptidases A and B revealed nearly complete homology."
https://openalex.org/W1633024273,"Abstract d-Serine dehydratase from Escherichia coli has two distinct binding sites for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate; a high affinity site (Kdiss 0.03 µm) which binds the catalytically essential coenzyme and a low affinity site (Kdiss near 1000 µm) which binds pyridoxal-P, pyridoxal, or 5-deoxypyridoxal approximately equally, with resultant inhibition of enzymatic activity. Following borohydride reduction, carboxymethylation and chymotryptic digestion of the holoenzyme, a single non-apeptide containing the N6-pyridoxyllysine residue, and thus corresponding to a portion of the high affinity coenzyme binding site was isolated by two different chromatographic procedures and shown to have the sequence: Ser-(Pxy)Lys-Gly-Arg-Ile-Asn-Lys-Ala-Thr. The peptide differs from the corresponding coenzyme-binding site peptides isolated from other pyridoxal-P-dependent enzymes in its highly basic and relatively hydrophilic character. When borohydride reduction of d-serine holodehydratase was carried out in the presence of an inhibitory concentration (7.5 mm) of pyridoxal-P, one additional major pyridoxylpeptide, corresponding to a portion of the low affinity pyridoxal-binding site was isolated. The sequence of this inhibitory site peptide was determined to be: Val-(Pxy)Lys-Ala-Gly-Ala-Phe."
https://openalex.org/W1498969985,"Abstract The small (40 S) ribosomal subunits of embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia salina and the large (50 S) subunits of Escherichia coli can engage in limited, coordinated hybrid function, exemplified by the synthesis of fMet-puromycin and N-acetyl-Phe-Phe. Larger peptides are not produced. At high Mg2+ concentrations these reactions occur non-enzymatically, i.e. in the absence of initiation and elongation factors. At low Mg2+ concentrations the A. salina supernatant initiation factor (eukaryotic initiation factor 1, EIF-1) is required for N-acylaminoacyl-tRNA binding to the 40 S subunit and subsequent puromycin reaction, and aminoacyl transfer factor is needed for Phe-tRNA binding to the hybrid ribosomes and ensuing peptide synthesis. Although these processes are mediated by the large subunit, in this case E. coli 50 S, N-acetyl-Phe-Phe synthesis takes place with eukaryotic elongation factor (EF-1) as well as with prokaryotic factor (EF-T). Glutaraldehyde fixation enables display of the hybrid couples by sucrose density gradient centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1722126591,"A DNA endonuclease has been partially purified from Escherichia coli after infection with bacteriophage λ. The endonuclease, which is not present in uninfected cells or uninduced λ lysogens, catalyzes a magnesium-dependent reaction in which double strand breaks are introduced into duplex DNA. It is active on E. coli and T4 DNA, as well as on λ DNA. At least 1000 breaks can be introduced into λ DNA. A site which is essential for the synthesis of the endonuclease has been identified within the b2 region of the λ genome, but the physiological function of the endonuclease has not been established."
https://openalex.org/W1570564176,Abstract An improved purification method for the preparation of thioredoxin from phage T4-infected Escherichia coli cells is described. Homogeneous T4 thioredoxin contained 87 amino acid residues. From a tryptic digest of reduced and carboxymethylated T4 thioredoxin 12 peptides were isolated by paper electrophoresis and chromatography. Amino acid sequence determinations by enzymatic fragmentation and 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Edman degradation showed that 11 of the tryptic peptides accounted for the total amino acid composition of T4 thioredoxin. The 12th tryptic peptide resulted from incomplete tryptic digestion of a Lys-Arg peptide bond.
