https://openalex.org/W2597646117,"Identification of effective combination therapies is critical to address the emergence of drug-resistant cancers, but direct screening of all possible drug combinations is infeasible. Here we introduce a CRISPR-based double knockout (CDKO) system that improves the efficiency of combinatorial genetic screening using an effective strategy for cloning and sequencing paired single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and a robust statistical scoring method for calculating genetic interactions (GIs) from CRISPR-deleted gene pairs. We applied CDKO to generate a large-scale human GI map, comprising 490,000 double-sgRNAs directed against 21,321 pairs of drug targets in K562 leukemia cells and identified synthetic lethal drug target pairs for which corresponding drugs exhibit synergistic killing. These included the BCL2L1 and MCL1 combination, which was also effective in imatinib-resistant cells. We further validated this system by identifying known and previously unidentified GIs between modifiers of ricin toxicity. This work provides an effective strategy to screen synergistic drug combinations in high-throughput and a CRISPR-based tool to dissect functional GI networks."
https://openalex.org/W2604049161,"Ovarian cancer is a lethal malignancy that has not seen a major therapeutic advance in over 30 years. We demonstrate that ovarian cancer exhibits a targetable alteration in iron metabolism. Ferroportin (FPN), the iron efflux pump, is decreased, and transferrin receptor (TFR1), the iron importer, is increased in tumor tissue from patients with high grade but not low grade serous ovarian cancer. A similar profile of decreased FPN and increased TFR1 is observed in a genetic model of ovarian cancer tumor-initiating cells (TICs). The net result of these changes is an accumulation of excess intracellular iron and an augmented dependence on iron for proliferation. A forced reduction in intracellular iron reduces the proliferation of ovarian cancer TICs in vitro, and inhibits both tumor growth and intraperitoneal dissemination of tumor cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that iron increases metastatic spread by facilitating invasion through expression of matrix metalloproteases and synthesis of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We show that the iron dependence of ovarian cancer TICs renders them exquisitely sensitive in vivo to agents that induce iron-dependent cell death (ferroptosis) as well as iron chelators, and thus creates a metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited therapeutically."

https://openalex.org/W2599413066,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) has increasingly become a clinical challenge. The mechanisms by which neuroendocrine (NE) cells arises from prostate adenocarcinoma cells are poorly understood. FOXA1 is a transcription factor of the forkhead family that is required for prostate epithelial differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that FOXA1 loss drives NE differentiation, demarcated by phenotypical changes and NEPC marker expressions. Mechanistically, this is mediated by FOXA1 binding to the promoter of interleukin 8 (IL-8), a chemokine previously shown elevated in NEPC, to directly inhibit its expression. Further, IL-8 upregulation activates the MAPK/ERK pathway, leading to ERK phosphorylation and enolase 2 (ENO2) expression. IL-8 knockdown or ERK inhibition, on the other hand, abolished FOXA1 loss-induced NE differentiation. Analysis of xenograft mouse models confirmed FOXA1 loss in NEPC tumors relative to its adenocarcinoma counterparts. Importantly, FOXA1 is downregulated in human NEPC tumors compared to primary and castration-resistant prostate cancers, and its expression is negatively correlated with that of ENO2. These findings indicate that FOXA1 transcriptionally suppresses IL-8, the expression of which would otherwise stimulate the MAPK/ERK pathway to promote NE differentiation of prostate cancer cells. Our data strongly suggest that FOXA1 loss may play a significant role in enabling prostate cancer progression to NEPC, whereas IL-8 and MAPK/ERK pathways may be promising targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2596708157,"NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a key transcriptional activator that mediates the inducible expression of antioxidant genes. NRF2 is normally ubiquitinated by KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) and subsequently degraded by proteasomes. Inactivation of KEAP1 by oxidative stress or electrophilic chemicals allows NRF2 to activate transcription through binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and recruiting histone acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein). Whereas KEAP1-dependent regulation is a major determinant of NRF2 activity, NRF2-mediated transcriptional activation varies from context to context, suggesting that other intracellular signaling cascades may impact NRF2 function. To identify a signaling pathway that modifies NRF2 activity, we immunoprecipitated endogenous NRF2 and its interacting proteins from mouse liver and identified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a novel NRF2-binding partner. We found that glucocorticoids, dexamethasone and betamethasone, antagonize diethyl maleate-induced activation of NRF2 target genes in a GR-dependent manner. Dexamethasone treatment enhanced GR recruitment to AREs without affecting chromatin binding of NRF2, resulting in the inhibition of CBP recruitment and histone acetylation at AREs. This repressive effect was canceled by the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Thus, GR signaling decreases NRF2 transcriptional activation through reducing the NRF2-dependent histone acetylation. Consistent with these observations, GR signaling blocked NRF2-mediated cytoprotection from oxidative stress. This study suggests that an impaired antioxidant response by NRF2 and a resulting decrease in cellular antioxidant capacity account for the side effects of glucocorticoids, providing a novel viewpoint for the pathogenesis of hypercorticosteroidism.

https://openalex.org/W2603261241,"The major breast cancer suppressor proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 play essential roles in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair, which is thought to be critical for tumor suppression. The two BRCA proteins are linked by a third tumor suppressor, PALB2, in the HR pathway. While truncating mutations in these genes are generally pathogenic, interpretation of missense variants remains a challenge. To date, patient-derived missense variants that disrupt PALB2 binding have been identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2; however, there has not been sufficient evidence to prove their pathogenicity in humans, and no variants in PALB2 that disrupt either its BRCA1 or BRCA2 binding have been reported. Here we report on the identification of a novel PALB2 variant, c.104T>C (p.L35P), that segregates in a family with a strong history of breast cancer. Functional analyses showed that L35P abrogates the PALB2–BRCA1 interaction and completely disables its abilities to promote HR and confer resistance to platinum salts and PARP inhibitors. Whole-exome sequencing of a breast cancer from a c.104T>C carrier revealed a second, somatic, truncating mutation affecting PALB2, and the tumor displays hallmark genomic features of tumors with BRCA mutations and HR defects, cementing the pathogenicity of L35P. Parallel analyses of other germline variants in the PALB2 N-terminal BRCA1-binding domain identified multiple variants that affect HR function to varying degrees, suggesting their possible contribution to cancer development. Our findings establish L35P as the first pathogenic missense mutation in PALB2 and directly demonstrate the requirement of the PALB2-BRCA1 interaction for breast cancer suppression."

https://openalex.org/W2598130841,"Ewing Sarcoma is the second most common solid pediatric malignant neoplasm of bone and soft tissue. Driven by EWS/Ets, or rarely variant, oncogenic fusions, Ewing Sarcoma is a biologically and clinically aggressive disease with a high propensity for metastasis. However, the mechanisms underpinning Ewing Sarcoma metastasis are currently not well understood. In the present study, we identify and characterize a novel metastasis-promotional pathway in Ewing Sarcoma, involving the histone demethylase KDM3A, previously identified by our laboratory as a new cancer-promoting gene in this disease. Using global gene expression profiling, we show that KDM3A positively regulates genes and pathways implicated in cell migration and metastasis, and demonstrate, using functional assays, that KDM3A promotes migration in vitro and experimental, post-intravasation, metastasis in vivo. We further identify the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) as a novel KDM3A target gene in Ewing Sarcoma, and an important effector of KDM3A pro-metastatic action. Specifically, we demonstrate that MCAM depletion, like KDM3A depletion, inhibits cell migration in vitro and experimental metastasis in vivo, and that MCAM partially rescues impaired migration due to KDM3A knock-down. Mechanistically, we show that KDM3A regulates MCAM expression both through a direct mechanism, involving modulation of H3K9 methylation at the MCAM promoter, and an indirect mechanism, via the Ets1 transcription factor. Finally, we identify an association between high MCAM levels in patient tumors and poor survival, in two different Ewing Sarcoma clinical cohorts. Taken together, our studies uncover a new metastasis-promoting pathway in Ewing Sarcoma, with therapeutically targetable components."
https://openalex.org/W2598314069,"CTCF is a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene with diverse normal functions in genome structure and gene regulation. However the mechanism by which CTCF haploinsufficiency contributes to cancer development is not well understood. CTCF is frequently mutated in endometrial cancer. Here we show that most CTCF mutations effectively result in CTCF haploinsufficiency through nonsense-mediated decay of mutant transcripts, or loss-of-function missense mutation. Conversely, we identified a recurrent CTCF mutation K365T, which alters a DNA binding residue, and acts as a gain-of-function mutation enhancing cell survival. CTCF genetic deletion occurs predominantly in poor prognosis serous subtype tumours, and this genetic deletion is associated with poor overall survival. In addition, we have shown that CTCF haploinsufficiency also occurs in poor prognosis endometrial clear cell carcinomas and has some association with endometrial cancer relapse and metastasis. Using shRNA targeting CTCF to recapitulate CTCF haploinsufficiency, we have identified a novel role for CTCF in the regulation of cellular polarity of endometrial glandular epithelium. Overall, we have identified two novel pro-tumorigenic roles (promoting cell survival and altering cell polarity) for genetic alterations of CTCF in endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2596478722,"ICD-10(International Classification of Diseases 10th revision) is a classification of a disease, symptom, procedure, or injury. Diseases are often described in patients' medical records with free texts, such as terms, phrases and paraphrases, which differ significantly from those used in ICD-10 classification. This paper presents an improved approach based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and semantic similarity for automatic Chinese diagnoses, mapping from the disease names given by clinician to the disease names in ICD-10. LCS refers to the longest string that is a subsequence of every member of a given set of strings. The proposed method of improved LCS in this paper can increase the accuracy of processing in Chinese disease mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2598198911,"Juan Cadiñanos and colleagues perform an insertional mutagenesis screen with a single-copy inactivating Sleeping Beauty transposon to look for Pten-cooperating tumor suppressor genes in mice. They find novel candidate cancer genes, verify their clinical relevance in patient cohorts and functionally demonstrate their synergistic relationship to Pten in tumor suppression. The overwhelming number of genetic alterations identified through cancer genome sequencing requires complementary approaches to interpret their significance and interactions. Here we developed a novel whole-body insertional mutagenesis screen in mice, which was designed for the discovery of Pten-cooperating tumor suppressors. Toward this aim, we coupled mobilization of a single-copy inactivating Sleeping Beauty transposon to Pten disruption within the same genome. The analysis of 278 transposition-induced prostate, breast and skin tumors detected tissue-specific and shared data sets of known and candidate genes involved in cancer. We validated ZBTB20, CELF2, PARD3, AKAP13 and WAC, which were identified by our screens in multiple cancer types, as new tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer. We demonstrated their synergy with PTEN in preventing invasion in vitro and confirmed their clinical relevance. Further characterization of Wac in vivo showed obligate haploinsufficiency for this gene (which encodes an autophagy-regulating factor) in a Pten-deficient context. Our study identified complex PTEN-cooperating tumor suppressor networks in different cancer types, with potential clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2599453624,"OCT4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4) is essential for embryonic stem cell self-renewal. Here we show that OCT4 increases the aggressiveness of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC) by inactivating the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway and enhancing mitotic stability in cancer cells. OCT4 drives the expression of Nuclear Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase type 1 (NIPP1) and Cyclin F (CCNF) that together inhibit Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1). This results in pRB hyper-phosphorylation, accelerated cell proliferation and increased in vitro tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cells. In parallel, OCT4 and NIPP1/CCNF drive the expression of the central Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) components, Borealin, Survivin and the mitotic kinase Aurora B, promoting the clustering of supernumerary centrosomes to increase mitotic stability. Loss of OCT4 or NIPP1/CCNF results in severe mitotic defects, multipolar spindles and supernumerary centrosomes, finally leading to the induction of apoptosis. These phenotypes were recapitulated in different cancer models indicating general relevance for human cancer. Importantly, activation of these parallel pathways leads to dramatically reduced overall survival of HG-SOC patients. Altogether, our data highlights an unprecedented role for OCT4 as central regulator of mitotic fidelity and RB tumor suppressor pathway activity. Disrupting this pathway represents a promising strategy to target an aggressive subpopulation of HG-SOC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2601757086,"Nucleus accumbens-associated protein-1 (NAC1), a nuclear factor of the BTB/POZ gene family, has emerging roles in cancer. In this study, we identified the NAC1-HDAC4-HIF-1α axis as an important pathway in regulating glycolysis and hypoxic adaptation in tumor cells. We show that nuclear NAC1 binds to histone deacetylase type 4 (HDAC4), hindering phosphorylation of HDAC4 at Ser246 and preventing its nuclear export that leads to cytoplasmic degradation of the deacetylase. Accumulation of HDAC4 in the nuclei results in an attenuation of HIF-1α acetylation, enhancing the stabilization and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α and strengthening adaptive response of cells to hypoxia. We also show the role of NAC1 in promoting glycolysis in a mouse xenograft model, and demonstrate that knockdown of NAC1 expression can reinforce the antitumor efficacy of bevacizumab, an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Clinical implication of the NAC1-HDAC4-HIF-1α pathway is suggested by the results showing that expression levels of these proteins are significantly correlative in human tumor specimens and associated with the disease progression. This study not only reveals an important function of NAC1 in regulating glycolysis, but also identifies the NAC1-HDAC4-HIF-1α axis as a novel molecular pathway that promotes survival of hypoxic tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2596068914,"In China, Fusarium head blight is caused mainly by the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), which produces trichothecene toxins. The FGSC is divided into three chemotypes: 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), and nivalenol (NIV). In order to predict the geographical changes in the distribution of these chemotype populations in major winter wheat-producing areas in China, the biological characteristics of twenty randomly selected isolates from each of the three chemotypes were studied. No significant difference was exhibited in the growth rate of 3-ADON, 15-ADON, and NIV isolates at 15°C. At 20°C and 25°C, the growth rate of 15-ADON isolates was the highest. At 30°C, the growth rate of NIV and 3-ADON isolates was significantly higher than that of 15-ADON isolates. The 15-ADON isolates produced the highest quantities of perithecia and two to three days earlier than the other two populations at each temperature, and released more ascospores at 18°C. The aggressiveness test on wheat seedlings and ears indicated there was no significant difference between the 3-ADON and 15-ADON isolates. However, the aggressiveness of NIV isolates was significantly lower than that of the 3-ADON and 15-ADON isolates. The DON content in grains from heads inoculated with the 3-ADON isolates was higher than the content of 15-ADON and NIV isolates. The results showed that 15-ADON population had the advantage in perithecia formation and ascospore release, and the 3-ADON population produced more DON in wheat grains. We suggested that distribution of these three chemotype populations may be related to these biological characteristics."

Histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) is an abundant DNA-bridging, nucleoid-associated protein that binds to an AT-rich conserved DNA sequence motif and regulates both the shape and the genetic expression of the bacterial chromosome. Although there is ample evidence that the mode of H-NS binding depends on environmental conditions, the role of the spatial organization of H-NS-binding sequences in the assembly of long-range nucleoprotein structures remains unknown. In this study, by using high-resolution atomic force microscopy combined with biochemical assays, we explored the formation of H-NS nucleoprotein complexes on circular DNA molecules having different arrangements of identical sequences containing high-affinity H-NS-binding sites. We provide the first experimental evidence that variable sequence arrangements result in various three-dimensional nucleoprotein structures that differ in their shape and the capacity to constrain supercoils and compact the DNA. We believe that the DNA sequence-directed versatile assembly of periodic higher-order structures reveals a general organizational principle that can be exploited for knowledge-based design of long-range nucleoprotein complexes and purposeful manipulation of the bacterial chromatin architecture.

In keeping with this notion, during the bacterial growth cycle the H-NS nucleoprotein complex appears to expand from the initial binding loci in both directions along the genomic DNA, whereby this spreading mechanism has been implicated in gene silencing (20Kahramanoglou C.

H-NS can polymerize also on a single DNA duplex leading to its apparent stiffening (32Liu Y. Chen H. Kenney L.J. Yan J.

Furthermore, H-NS was shown to efficiently constrain negative supercoils in the DNA in vitro (36Tupper A.E. Owen-Hughes T.A. Ussery D.W. Santos D.S. Ferguson D.J. Sidebotham J.M. Hinton J.C. Higgins C.F. The chromatin-associated protein H-NS alters DNA topology in vitro.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and modulate the DNA topology in vivo (8Blot N.

Homeostatic regulation of supercoiling sensitivity coordinates transcription of the bacterial genome.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whereas there is ample evidence that changing environmental conditions can determine the binding and polymerization mode of H-NS on the DNA, the role of the spatial pattern of high-affinity H-NS binding sequences in the ensuing three-dimensional structure remains unknown. To answer this question we used circular DNA constructs carrying identical H-NS binding sequences in different spatial arrangements. We demonstrate that distinct arrangements of binding sequences not only result in distinct morphology and periodicity of the H-NS nucleoprotein structure but also a different capacity to constrain supercoils and compact the DNA. We thus provide the first experimental evidence that variation in linear arrangement of identical binding sequences for an abundant NAP leads to organization of different long-range DNA structures. To investigate the impact of spatial organization of H-NS binding sites on higher-order nucleoprotein complex formation, we generated three circular constructs containing the regulatory DNA sequences from the Escherichia coli proV and tyrT gene promoters in different spatial arrangements. ProV is the first structural gene of an operon encoding a transport system involved in sensing of elevated osmolarity. The negative regulatory element (NRE) of this operon partially overlaps the 5′-end of proV gene and contains multiple H-NS binding sites including two identical high-affinity sites (Kd values between ≪15 nm and 25 nm) separated by ∼10 helical turns of DNA. H-NS binds cooperatively at this region, silencing the operon. Whereas the sequence periodicity of the proV NRE favors plectonemic coiling of DNA, nucleation of H-NS binding at the helically phased high affinity sites facilitates the bridging of duplexes (22Bouffartigues E. Buckle M. Badaut C. Travers A. Rimsky S. H-NS cooperative binding to high-affinity sites in a regulatory element results in transcriptional silencing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35Kotlajich M.V. Hron D.R. Boudreau B.A. Sun Z. Lyubchenko Y.L. Landick R. Bridged filaments of histone-like nucleoid structuring protein pause RNA polymerase and aid termination in bacteria.Elife. 2015; 4: e04970Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, the upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the tyrT (tyrosyl tRNA) gene promoter is characterized by bending anisotropy favoring toroidal coiling (37Lazarus L.R. Travers A.A. The Escherichia coli FIS protein is not required for the activation of tyrT transcription on entry into exponential growth.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which potentially would impede the bridging of DNA duplexes by H-NS. So far, no high-affinity binding sites for H-NS have been reported in tyrT UAS. We thus constructed plasmids containing the proV NRE sequences (denoted as “P”) and the tyrT UAS sequences (denoted as “U”) in three different tandem arrangements, PUUP, UPUP, and UPPU, in which the proximal high-affinity H-NS binding sites of two P elements were separated by 941, 544, and 147 bps of DNA, respectively (Fig. 1). These three plasmid constructs were used to visualize the nucleoprotein structures generated after incubation with increasing concentrations of H-NS by atomic force microscopy (AFM). To avoid complications of visualizing distinct structures arising from tangling of the supercoiled DNA, the plasmid constructs were uniquely nicked with Nt.BspQI nuclease (see “Experimental procedures”). All experiments (except AFM on a APTES-modified surface) were carried out in the presence of Mg2+ ions facilitating the DNA bridging by H-NS (34Lim C.J. Lee S.Y. Kenney L.J. Yan J. Nucleoprotein filament formation is the structural basis for bacterial protein H-NS gene silencing.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2: 509Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, three classes of structures indicating an extensive bridging of DNA by H-NS were observed with all constructs. Two of the observed classes of bridged complexes displayed clearly distinct architectures, denoted as bridge-loop (BL) and loop-bridge-loop (LBL) structures (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2), whereas the third class comprised more complex structures (representative examples of the observed structures are shown in Fig. 3). Notably, statistical measurements showed that these three classes of structure were formed in different proportions depending on both H-NS concentration and on the construct used (Table 1). With the PUUP construct harboring two proV NRE regions separated by two copies of the tyrT UAS sequences, the LBL structures prevailed over BL structures at low and intermediate H-NS concentrations, whereas at the highest used H-NS concentration (H-NS:DNA molar ratio of 13:1) the BL structures (∼50%) were predominantly observed (Table 1). Also with the UPUP construct, the LBL structures prevailed at low and intermediate H-NS concentrations, yet in contrast to PUUP at the highest used H-NS concentrations, the BL and LBL structures formed with equal efficiency. Interestingly, the third construct, UPPU, in which the two adjacent proV NRE regions were flanked by tyrT UAS, formed exclusively LBL structures, attaining their maximum (∼17%) at the highest used H-NS concentration (Table 1). For these three constructs the overall amount of H-NS-bridged complexes was also different, being lowest for UPPU (56%, comparable with pBR322 control), slightly higher for UPUP (∼65%), and highest for PUUP (∼80%). These data suggested that whereas H-NS can bridge the DNA duplexes in all three constructs, the spatial arrangement of P sequences with high-affinity binding sites determines both the efficiency of binding and the preferred morphology of ensuing DNA structures.Figure 3Close-up AFM images of various structures formed by H-NS DNA complexes. Control DNA formed either completely relaxed structures or structures with one or two self-crossings (Unbound); H-NS bound DNA formed predominantly either bridge-loop or loop-bridge-loop structures (Bound). Other more complex structures were also present in H-NS-bound samples, although their frequency was low compared with BL or LBL structures.

One of the shape parameters we measured was the persistence length lp, a basic mechanical property of DNA quantifying its flexibility. As expected, the persistence lengths of the unbound PUUP, UPUP, and UPPU DNA constructs provided fairly similar values of lp ∼ 60 ± 2 nm. The addition of H-NS significantly affected the persistence lengths for PUUP and UPPU constructs (Table 2). Furthermore, at the highest H-NS concentration used, we obtained significantly lower persistence-length values for UPPU (lp = 44 ± 2 nm) compared with both UPUP and PUUP (lp = 54 ± 2 nm and lp = 64 ± 2 nm, respectively).Table 2Comparison of various shape parameters of DNA constructs at high H-NS concentration(H-NS:DNA ratio - 13:1 and 20:1) and different deposition methods (MgCl2 and APTESmodified mica surface) Open table in a new tab Measurements of the bridged filament lengths (Lbf) again demonstrated differences between the three constructs (Table 2). The bridged filament formed on UPUP showed a slightly higher average length (Lbf = 75 ± 30 nm) compared with UPPU (Lbf = 65 ± 30 nm), whereas those formed on PUUP had the largest average length (Lbf = 155 ± 70 nm; see Fig. 2, lower panel). However, all these exceeded the lengths measured for the pBR322 control. We verified these differences by imaging the nucleoprotein complexes on the APTES-modified mica surface, which was due to strong charge interactions kinetically trapping the complexes and, thus, better preserving their three-dimensional configuration (38Lyubchenko Y. Shlyakhtenko L. Harrington R. Oden P. Lindsay S. Atomic force microscopy of long DNA: imaging in air and under water.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

When deposited on the APTES-treated surface, the morphology of the nicked DNA changed significantly. Despite this, the observed differences between the H-NS-DNA complexes formed on various constructs were similar (Fig. 4; Table 2), indicating that these differences were robust and independent of the deposition method used. We also measured the propensity of branching for APTES-deposited DNA by defining the branching probability as the ratio between the number of DNA molecules having three ends (branches) to the total number of DNA molecules (branching = N3ends/Ntotal; typical branched molecules are indicated by white arrows in Fig. 4). We found that the PUUP construct showed the highest propensity of branching (Table 2). Thus, the PUUP and UPPU constructs with opposite arrangements of the P and U sequences bind H-NS with different propensity, favor, respectively, BL and LBL structures, and significantly differ in their average bridged filament lengths (see Table 2). Furthermore, plotting of the bridged filament lengths at the maximal used H-NS concentration (H-NS:DNA molar ratio 20:1) against the plasmid contour length revealed a clear inversely linear dependence for PUUP, which was less pronounced for UPPU but completely absent in the case of UPUP (Fig. 5A). Finally, we found that these bridged filaments also demonstrated clear differences in measured height (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these measurements with various constructs indicated a difference in DNA packing by H-NS.Figure 5Shape parameters of the bridged filaments. A, DNA contour length dependence on H-NS-bridged filament length. PUUP construct shows a clear inversely linear dependence on filament length, indicating a linear shortening of the contour length as the function of H-NS-bridged filament growth (on average a 30-nm DNA contour length compaction for every 100 nm of DNA filament). This dependence is less pronounced for UPPU (on average a 15-nm DNA contour length compaction for every 100 nm of DNA filament) and absent in the case of UPUP. B, measured height distributions along H-NS-bridged filament for PUUP and UPPU constructs.

We used the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, as a model for investigating this phenomenon. We show that infection of pulmonary endothelial cells by P. aeruginosa induces production and release of a cytotoxic amyloid molecule with prion characteristics, including resistance to various nucleases and proteases. This cytotoxin was self-propagating, was neutralized by anti-amyloid Abs, and induced death of endothelial cells and neurons. Moreover, the cytotoxin induced edema in isolated lungs. Endothelial cells and isolated lungs were protected from cytotoxin-induced death by stimulation of signal transduction pathways that are linked to prion protein. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected from human patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia demonstrated cytotoxic activity, and lavage fluid contained amyloid molecules, including oligomeric τ and Aβ. Demonstration of long-lived cytotoxic agents after Pseudomonas infection may establish a molecular link to the high rates of death as a result of end-organ damage in the months after recovery from pneumonia, and modulation of signal transduction pathways that have been linked to prion protein may provide a mechanism for intervention.-Balczon, R., Morrow, K.

Additionally, during this time, 203 hypothermic stunned green turtles were found incidentally captured due to power plant water intake entrapment. Overall, 63.9% of 4,529 hypothermic stunned turtles were found alive, and 92.0% of those survived rehabilitation and were released. Numbers of green turtles recorded as stranded and as affected by hypothermic stunning increased over time, and were most numerous from 2007 through 2015. Large hypothermic stunning events (with more than 450 turtles documented) occurred during the winters of 2009–2010, 2010–2011, 2013–2014, and 2014–2015. Hypothermic stunning was documented between November and March, but peaked at various times depending on passage of severe weather systems. Hypothermic stunning occurred state-wide, but was most prevalent in South Texas, particularly the Laguna Madre. In the Laguna Madre, hypothermic stunning was associated with an abrupt drop in water temperatures strong northerly winds, and a threshold mean water temperature of 8.0°C predicted large turtle hypothermic stunning events. Knowledge of environmental parameters contributing to hypothermic stunning and the temporal and spatial distribution of turtles affected in the past, can aid with formulation of proactive, targeted search and rescue efforts that can ultimately save the lives of many affected individuals, and aid with recovery efforts for this bi-national stock. Such rescue efforts are required under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and respond to humanitarian concerns of the public."
https://openalex.org/W2595356694,"Intrasexual competition is an important element of natural selection in which the most attractive conspecific has a considerable reproductive advantage over the others. The conspecifics that are approached first often become the preferred mate partners, and could thus from a biological perspective have a reproductive advantage. This underlines the importance of the initial approach and raises the question of what induces this approach, or what makes a conspecific attractive. Identification of the sensory modalities crucial for the activation of approach is necessary for elucidating the central nervous processes involved in the activation of sexual motivation and eventually copulatory behavior. The initial approach to a potential mate depends on distant stimuli in the modalities of audition, olfaction, vision, and other undefined characteristics. This study investigated the role of the different modalities and the combination of these modalities in the sexual incentive value of a female rat. This study provides evidence that the presence of a single-sensory stimulus with one modality (olfaction, vision, or ‘others’, but not audition) is sufficient to attenuate the preference for a social contact with a male rat. However, a multisensory stimulus of multiple modalities is necessary to induce preference for the stimulus over social contact to a level of an intact receptive female. The initial approach behavior, therefore, seems to be induced by the combination of at least two modalities among which olfaction is crucial. This suggests that there is a cooperative function for the different modalities in the induction of approach behavior of a potential mate."

Nondestructive Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra from MVs were assessed as a technique to provide new biochemical insights into a LPS-induced monocyte model of septic shock. FTIR spectroscopy provided a quick method to investigate relative differences in biomolecular content of different MV populations that was complementary to traditional semiquantitative omics approaches, with which it is difficult to provide information on relative changes between classes (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates) or protein conformations. Time-dependent changes were detected in biomolecular contents of MVs and in the monocytes from which they were released. Differences in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine contents were observed in MVs released under stimulation, and higher relative concentrations of RNA and α-helical structured proteins were present in stimulated MVs compared with MVs from resting cells. FTIR spectra of stimulated monocytes displayed changes that were consistent with those observed in the corresponding MVs they released. LPS-stimulated monocytes had reduced concentrations of nucleic acids, α-helical structured proteins, and phosphatidylcholine compared with resting monocytes but had an increase in total lipids.

https://openalex.org/W2596467588,"Manganese is essential to life, and humans typically absorb sufficient quantities of this element from a normal healthy diet; however, chronic, elevated ingestion or inhalation of manganese can be neurotoxic, potentially leading to manganism. Although imaging of large amounts of accumulated Mn(II) is possible by MRI, quantitative measurement of the biodistribution of manganese, particularly at the trace level, can be challenging. In this study, we produced the positron-emitting radionuclide 52Mn (t1/2 = 5.6 d) by proton bombardment (Ep<15 MeV) of chromium metal, followed by solid-phase isolation by cation-exchange chromatography. An aqueous solution of [52Mn]MnCl2 was nebulized into a closed chamber with openings through which mice inhaled the aerosol, and a separate cohort of mice received intravenous (IV) injections of [52Mn]MnCl2. Ex vivo biodistribution was performed at 1 h and 1 d post-injection/inhalation (p.i.). In both trials, we observed uptake in lungs and thyroid at 1 d p.i. Manganese is known to cross the blood-brain barrier, as confirmed in our studies following IV injection (0.86%ID/g, 1 d p.i.) and following inhalation of aerosol, (0.31%ID/g, 1 d p.i.). Uptake in salivary gland and pancreas were observed at 1 d p.i. (0.5 and 0.8%ID/g), but to a much greater degree from IV injection (6.8 and 10%ID/g). In a separate study, mice received IV injection of an imaging dose of [52Mn]MnCl2, followed by in vivo imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo biodistribution. The results from this study supported many of the results from the biodistribution-only studies. In this work, we have confirmed results in the literature and contributed new results for the biodistribution of inhaled radiomanganese for several organs. Our results could serve as supporting information for environmental and occupational regulations, for designing PET studies utilizing 52Mn, and/or for predicting the biodistribution of manganese-based MR contrast agents."

Moreover, venomics, as a well-established approach in systems biology, helps to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of the production of such a great molecular biodiversity. Today the advances made in the proteomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics fields, favor venomics, allowing the in depth study of complex matrices and the elucidation even of minor compounds present in minute biological samples. The present study illustrates a rapid and efficient method developed for the elucidation of venom composition based on NextGen mRNA sequencing of venom glands and LC-MS/MS venom proteome profiling. The analysis of the comprehensive data obtained was focused on cysteine rich peptide toxins from four spider species originating from phylogenetically distant families for comparison purposes. The studied species were Heteropoda davidbowie (Sparassidae), Poecilotheria formosa (Theraphosidae), Viridasius fasciatus (Viridasiidae) and Latrodectus mactans (Theridiidae). This led to a high resolution profiling of 284 characterized cysteine rich peptides, 111 of which belong to the Inhibitor Cysteine Knot (ICK) structural motif. The analysis of H. davidbowie venom revealed a high richness in term of venom diversity: 95 peptide sequences were identified; out of these, 32 peptides presented the ICK structural motif and could be classified in six distinct families. The profiling of P. formosa venom highlighted the presence of 126 peptide sequences, with 52 ICK toxins belonging to three structural distinct families. V. fasciatus venom was shown to contain 49 peptide sequences, out of which 22 presented the ICK structural motif and were attributed to five families. The venom of L. mactans, until now studied for its large neurotoxins (Latrotoxins), revealed the presence of 14 cysteine rich peptides, out of which five were ICK toxins belonging to the CSTX superfamily. This in depth profiling of distinct ICK peptide families identified across the four spider species highlighted the high conservation of these neurotoxins among spider families."
https://openalex.org/W2596192614,"In order to investigate the importance of spatial and environmental factors on the structure and diversity of bacterial communities, high-resolution 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing was applied to bacterial communities in the littoral sea. Seawater samples were prepared from seven different stations in the South Sea of Korea, the marginal sea in the western Pacific Ocean, and were divided into three groups according to distances from the coastline. The majority of 19,860 sequences were affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria (58.2%), Gammaproteobacteria (7.9%), and Bacteroidetes (13.9%). The bacterioplankton community at each station was highly diverse and varied among the samples. Major bacterial lineages showed different niche preferences among three locational groups. Alphaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial class, and it harbored the most frequently recorded operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all sampling stations. However, dominant groups at the order levels showed a clear difference among the samples. The SAR11 clade was more abundant in coastal waters while the Roseobacter clade prevailed at stations far away from the coastline. Furthermore, members of Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria also exhibited spatial variability. The OM1 clade in Actinobacteria constituted a predominant fraction in coastal samples, but it was essentially absent at the distal stations closer to open ocean. In contrast, Synechococcus was the predominant taxon in the distal samples, accounting for 7.1–19.5%, but was hardly detected in coastal waters, representing less than 0.7%. In Bacteroidetes, NS5 and NS9 groups tended to inhabit coastal waters while the genera Polaribacter and Ulvibacter were more abundant in distal stations. Clustering analysis and principle coordinates analysis based on OTU data indicated that bacterial communities in the studied area were separated into three groups that coincided with locational grouping. Statistical analysis showed that phosphate and dissolved oxygen concentration had a significant influence on the bacterial community composition."

The adjusted mortality models yielded hazard ratios of 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 0.74) at 90 days and 0.61 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.73) at 1 year for the group consuming >0-168 g/week when compared to abstainers. Adjusted hazard ratios showed that the group consuming >0-168 g/week had a 0.91 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.11) risk of prosthetic infection, 0.68 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.92) risk of cardiovascular disease and 0.88 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.15) risk of deep venous thrombosis when compared to abstainers.This study demonstrates that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption prior to primary hip or knee arthroplasty is associated with lower risks of mortality at both 90 days and 1 year after surgery and of cardiovascular disease after 30 days. More research from longitudinal studies is needed to identify specific causal relations and explanations."
https://openalex.org/W2603530373,"Inflammation is one of the major risk factors for cancer. Here, we show that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma (CAMK2γ) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) modulates inflammatory signals and promotes colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in mice. We have identified CAMK2γ as a downstream target of colitis-induced WNT5A signaling. Furthermore, we have shown that CAMK2γ protects against intestine tissue injury by increasing IEC survival and proliferation. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma knockout mice displayed reduced CAC. Furthermore, we used bone marrow transplantation to reveal that CAMK2γ in IECs, but not immune cells, was crucial for its effect on CAC. Consistently, transgenic over-expression of CAMK2γ in IECs accelerated CAC development. Mechanistically, CAMK2γ in IECs enhanced epithelial signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation to promote survival and proliferation of colonic epithelial cells during CAC development. These results thus identify a new molecular mechanism mediated by CAMK2γ in IECs during CAC development, thereby providing a potential new therapeutic target for CAC."

Cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) serves as a major precursor for phospholipid synthesis. Given the peculiarities of lipid biogenesis, understanding the mechanism and physiological importance of CDP-DAG synthesis is particularly relevant in T. gondii. Here, we report the occurrence of two phylogenetically divergent CDP-DAG synthase (CDS) enzymes in the parasite. The eukaryotic-type TgCDS1 and the prokaryotic-type TgCDS2 reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and apicoplast, respectively. Conditional knockdown of TgCDS1 severely attenuated the parasite growth and resulted in a nearly complete loss of virulence in a mouse model. Moreover, mice infected with the TgCDS1 mutant became fully resistant to challenge infection with a hyper-virulent strain of T. gondii. The residual growth of the TgCDS1 mutant was abolished by consecutive deletion of TgCDS2. Lipidomic analyses of the two mutants revealed significant and specific declines in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol levels upon repression of TgCDS1 and after deletion of TgCDS2, respectively. Our data suggest a “division of labor” model of lipid biogenesis in T. gondii in which two discrete CDP-DAG pools produced in the endoplasmic reticulum and apicoplast are subsequently used for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol in the Golgi bodies and phosphatidylglycerol in the mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W2596227705,"Understanding the ranging behaviours of species can be helpful in effective conservation planning. However, for many species that are rare, occur at low densities, or occupy challenging environments, this information is often lacking. The Martial Eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus) is a low density apex predator declining in both non-protected and protected areas in southern Africa, and little is known about its ranging behaviour. We use GPS tags fitted to Martial Eagles (n = 8) in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa to describe their ranging behaviour and habitat preference. This represents the first time that such movements have been quantified in adult Martial Eagles. Territorial eagles (n = 6) held home ranges averaging ca. 108 km2. Home range estimates were similar to expectations based on inter-nest distances, and these large home range sizes could constrain the carrying capacity of even the largest conservation areas. Two tagged individuals classed as adults on plumage apparently did not hold a territory, and accordingly ranged more widely (ca. 44,000 km2), and beyond KNP boundaries as floaters. Another two territorial individuals abandoned their territories and joined the ‘floater’ population, and so ranged widely after leaving their territories. These unexpected movements after territory abandonment could indicate underlying environmental degradation. Relatively high mortality of these wide-ranging ‘floaters’ due to anthropogenic causes (three of four) raises further concerns for the species’ persistence. Habitat preference models suggested Martial Eagles used areas preferentially that were closer to rivers, had higher tree cover, and were classed as dense bush rather than open bush or grassland. These results can be used by conservation managers to help guide actions to preserve breeding Martial Eagles at an appropriate spatial scale."

These conditions have contributed to a surge in the number of patients with chronic wounds worldwide. Furthermore, many cost-effective wound-healing technologies have been developed in order to keep up with the increased demand. In this paper, we performed a quantitative study of the trends associated with wound-healing technologies using patent data.We analyzed the trends considering four different groups of patent applicants: firms, universities, research institutes, and individuals using a structural topic model. In addition, we analyzed the knowledge flow between patent applicants using citation analysis, and confirmed the role of applicants in the knowledge-flow network using k-means clustering. As a result, the primary wound-healing technology patents applied for by the four groups varied considerably, and we classified the roles of patent applicants were found in the knowledge-flow network.Our results showed the organizations that are leading each area of wound-healing technology. Furthermore, from the results, we identified specific institutions that are efficient for spreading knowledge related to wound-healing technology based on the patents. This information can contribute to the planning of investment strategies and technology policies related to wound-healing."

https://openalex.org/W2595217488,"Bone is a living tissue whose main mechanical function is to provide stiffness, strength and protection to the body. Both stiffness and strength depend on the mineralization of the organic matrix, which is constantly being remodelled by the coordinated action of the bone multicellular units (BMUs). Due to the dynamics of both remodelling and mineralization, each sample of bone is composed of structural units (osteons in cortical and packets in cancellous bone) created at different times, therefore presenting different levels of mineral content. In this work, a computational model is used to understand the feedback between the remodelling and the mineralization processes under different load conditions and bone porosities. This model considers that osteoclasts primarily resorb those parts of bone closer to the surface, which are younger and less mineralized than older inner ones. Under equilibrium loads, results show that bone volumes with both the highest and the lowest levels of porosity (cancellous and cortical respectively) tend to develop higher levels of mineral content compared to volumes with intermediate porosity, thus presenting higher material densities. In good agreement with recent experimental measurements, a boomerang-like pattern emerges when plotting apparent density at the tissue level versus material density at the bone material level. Overload and disuse states are studied too, resulting in a translation of the apparent-material density curve. Numerical results are discussed pointing to potential clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2596898951,"Intraspecific social behavior can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. While much research has focused on how characteristics of individuals influence their roles in social networks, we were interested in the role that landscape structure plays in animal sociality at both individual (local) and population (global) levels. We used female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Illinois, USA, to investigate the potential effect of landscape on social network structure by weighting the edges of seasonal social networks with association rate (based on proximity inferred from GPS collar data). At the local level, we found that sociality among female deer in neighboring social groups (n = 36) was mainly explained by their home range overlap, with two exceptions: 1) during fawning in an area of mixed forest and grassland, deer whose home ranges had low forest connectivity were more social than expected; and 2) during the rut in an area of intensive agriculture, deer inhabiting home ranges with high amount and connectedness of agriculture were more social than expected. At the global scale, we found that deer populations (n = 7) in areas with highly connected forest-agriculture edge, a high proportion of agriculture, and a low proportion of forest tended to have higher weighted network closeness, although low sample size precluded statistical significance. This result implies that infectious disease could spread faster in deer populations inhabiting such landscapes. Our work advances the general understanding of animal social networks, demonstrating how landscape features can underlie differences in social behavior both within and among wildlife social networks."

Despite over-whelming evidence of these compounds' carcinogenicity in humans, the specific underlying molecular mechanisms that govern metal induced cellular transformation remain unclear. In this study, we found that there were slightly different effects on decreased SLBP mRNA and protein as well as increased polyA H3.1 in our nickel exposed cells. This suggested that nickel and arsenic have similar effects on canonical histone mRNA transcription and translation. We also saw that the depletion of SLBP protein was reversed by inhibiting the proteosome. Finally, we showed that inhibiting the SLBP mRNA and protein levels were rescued by epigenetic modifiers suggesting that nickel's effects on SLBP may be mediated via epigenetic mechanisms. Taken together these results suggest a similar mechanism by which both arsenic and nickel may exert their carcinogenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2595875859,"Objective Breast cancer treatment, including radical surgery, is also pursued as late as the 7th - 8th decade of women’s lives. Standard physical rehabilitation procedures offered to those women are predominantly focused on attenuating specific functional deficits of the upper limb and trunk. Seldom do they entail any regimens specifically aimed at recovering overall functionality, and reducing exposure to falls-risk. The study aimed to assess potential interrelationships between the self-reported falls, individual functional capabilities and appreciably reducing exposure to falls-risk in a group of post-menopausal, post-surgical breast cancer survivors. Methods The study recruited 102 women (aged 65–79; mean age 70.2), post-surgical breast cancer survivors. The subjects were stratified by age into three groups: Group 1 (65–69 years); Group 2 (70–74 years), and Group 3 (75–79 years). Individual functional capabilities were assessed with Eight-foot up & go test (8UG), chair stand test (CST), and 2-minute step test (2ST). Tinetti POMA test was applied to assess gait and balance disorders. Self-reported falls in the past year were ascertained through a questionnaire. Results Assessment of individual aerobic endurance (2ST) also demonstrated a clear deficit in the mean scores category in all respective age sub-groups, as compared against the reference values. The deficits ranged from 4.86 to 15.90 steps less than the normative values; the oldest subjects demonstrating the largest deficit. The aerobic endurance tests results significantly impacted the ultimate assessment of an individual falls-risk in the oldest group. The analysis of the number of falls sustained within the recent year indicated that 43.67% of the subjects fell victim of such incidents. Conclusion An individual exposure to falls-risk was found to be appreciably more dependent upon individual aerobic endurance rather than overall strength of the lower part of the body in the breast cancer survivors over 75."
https://openalex.org/W2601311854,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the metastatic form of the disease is incurable. We show here that the drebrin/EB3 pathway, which co-ordinates dynamic microtubule/actin filament interactions underlying cell shape changes in response to guidance cues, plays a role in prostate cancer cell invasion. Drebrin expression is restricted to basal epithelial cells in benign human prostate but is upregulated in luminal epithelial cells in foci of prostatic malignancy. Drebrin is also upregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines and co-localizes with actin filaments and dynamic microtubules in filopodia of pseudopods of invading cells under a chemotactic gradient of the chemokine CXCL12. Disruption of the drebrin/EB3 pathway using BTP2, a small molecule inhibitor of drebrin binding to actin filaments, reduced the invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays. Furthermore, gain- or loss-of-function of drebrin or EB3 by over-expression or siRNA-mediated knockdown increases or decreases invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays, respectively. Finally, expression of a dominant-negative construct that competes with EB3 binding to drebrin, also inhibited invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays. Our findings show that co-ordination of dynamic microtubules and actin filaments by the drebrin/EB3 pathway drives prostate cancer cell invasion and is therefore implicated in disease progression."

However, the association of smoking on patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has not been studied. The current study utilized data from the Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL, NCT00081731) clinical trial to evaluate the effects of smoking on the risk of cardio-renal events and kidney function in this population. Baseline data showed that smokers (n = 277 out of 931) were significantly younger at enrollment than non-smokers (63.3±9.1 years vs 72.4±7.8 years; p<0.001). In addition, patients who smoke were also more likely to have bilateral renal artery stenoses and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Longitudinal analysis showed that smokers experienced composite endpoint events (defined as first occurrence of: stroke; cardiovascular or renal death; myocardial infarction; hospitalization for congestive heart failure; permanent renal replacement; and progressive renal insufficiency defined as 30% reduction of GFR from baseline sustained for ≥ 60 days) at a substantially younger age compared to non-smokers (67.1±9.0 versus 76.1±7.9, p<0.001). Using linear regression and generalized linear modeling analysis controlled by age, sex, and ethnicity, smokers had significantly higher cystatin C levels (1.3±0.7 vs 1.2±0.9, p<0.01) whereas creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were not different from non-smokers. From these data we conclude that smoking has a significant association with deleterious cardio-renal outcomes in patients with renovascular hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2596543726,"Androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid receptor family and a therapeutic target for all stages of prostate cancer. AR is activated by ligand binding within its C-terminus ligand-binding domain (LBD). Here we show that overexpression of the AR NTD to generate decoy molecules inhibited both the growth and progression of prostate cancer in castrated hosts. Specifically, it was shown that lentivirus delivery of decoys delayed hormonal progression in castrated hosts as indicated by increased doubling time of tumor volume, prolonged time to achieve pre-castrate levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA nadir. These clinical parameters are indicative of delayed hormonal progression and improved therapeutic response and prognosis. Decoys reduced the expression of androgen-regulated genes that correlated with reduced in situ interaction of the AR with androgen response elements. Decoys did not reduce levels of AR protein or prevent nuclear localization of the AR. Nor did decoys interact directly with the AR. Thus decoys did not inhibit AR transactivation by a dominant negative mechanism. This work provides evidence that the AR NTD plays an important role in the hormonal progression of prostate cancer and supports the development of AR antagonists that target the AR NTD."

There are considerable efforts underway to understand the ecology of the red panda and to increase its populations in natural reserves. Yet it is difficult to design an effective strategy for red panda reintroduction if we do not understand its basic biology. Here we report the resting metabolic rate of the red panda and find that it is higher than previously measured on animals from a zoo. The resting metabolic rate was 0.290 ml/g/h (range 0.204–0.342) in summer and 0.361 ml/g/h in winter (range 0.331–0.406), with a statistically significant difference due to season and test temperature. Temperatures in summer were probably within the thermal neutral zone for metabolism but winter temperatures were below the thermal neutral zone. There was no difference in metabolic rate between male and female red pandas and no difference due to mass. Our values for metabolic rate were much higher than those measured by McNab for 2 red pandas from a zoo. The larger sample size (17), more natural conditions at the Panda Base and improved accuracy of the metabolic instruments provided more accurate metabolism measurements. Contrary to our expectations based on their low quality bamboo diet, the metabolic rates of red pandas were similar to mammals of the same size. Based on their metabolic rates red pandas would not be limited by their food supply in natural reserves."
https://openalex.org/W2596506225,"ErbB2 is a member of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors that plays a major role in breast cancer progression. Located at the plasma membrane, ErbB2 forms large clusters in spite of the presence of growth factors. Beta1 integrin, membrane receptor of extracellular matrix proteins, regulates adhesion, migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Physical interaction between beta1 integrin and ErbB2 has been suggested although published data are contradictory. The aim of the present work was to study the interaction between ErbB2 and beta1 integrin in different scenarios of expression and activation. We determined that beta1 integrin and ErbB2 colocalization is dependent on the expression level of both receptors exclusively in adherent cells. In suspension cells, lack of focal adhesions leave integrins free to diffuse on the plasma membrane and interact with ErbB2 even at low expression levels of both receptors. In adherent cells, high expression of beta1 integrin leaves unbound receptors outside focal complexes that diffuse within the plasma membrane and interact with ErbB2 membrane domains. Superresolution imaging showed the existence of two distinct populations of ErbB2: a major population located in large clusters and a minor population outside these structures. Upon ErbB2 overexpression, receptors outside large clusters can freely diffuse at the membrane and interact with integrins. These results reveal how expression levels of beta1 integrin and ErbB2 determine their frequency of colocalization and show that extracellular matrix proteins shape membrane clusters distribution, regulating ErbB2 and beta1 integrin activity in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2952434794,"Mark-recapture estimators are commonly used for population size estimation, and typically yield unbiased estimates for most solitary species with low to moderate home range sizes. However, these methods assume independence of captures among individuals, an assumption that is clearly violated in social species that show fission-fusion dynamics, such as the Asian elephant. In the specific case of Asian elephants, doubts have been raised about the accuracy of population size estimates. More importantly, the potential problem for the use of mark-recapture methods posed by social organization in general has not been systematically addressed. We developed an individual-based simulation framework to systematically examine the potential effects of type of social organization, as well as other factors such as trap density and arrangement, spatial scale of sampling, and population density, on bias in population sizes estimated by POPAN, Robust Design, and Robust Design with detection heterogeneity. In the present study, we ran simulations with biological, demographic and ecological parameters relevant to Asian elephant populations, but the simulation framework is easily extended to address questions relevant to other social species. We collected capture history data from the simulations, and used those data to test for bias in population size estimation. Social organization significantly affected bias in most analyses, but the effect sizes were variable, depending on other factors. Social organization tended to introduce large bias when trap arrangement was uniform and sampling effort was low. POPAN clearly outperformed the two Robust Design models we tested, yielding close to zero bias if traps were arranged at random in the study area, and when population density and trap density were not too low. Social organization did not have a major effect on bias for these parameter combinations at which POPAN gave more or less unbiased population size estimates. Therefore, the effect of social organization on bias in population estimation could be removed by using POPAN with specific parameter combinations, to obtain population size estimates in a social species."

ATM and ATR substrate analysis reveals extensive protein networks responsive to DNA damage.Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Both Rad3 and Tel1 show preference for serine and threonine residues followed by glutamine or hydrophobic residues, and they phosphorylate an overlapping set of effector proteins. The best understood downstream targets of both Rad3 and Tel1 are the protein kinases Chk1 and Cds1 (Chk2 in mammals), that serve to reduce cyclin-dependent kinase activity leading to cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair before replication or mitosis continues.

Rad3 is activated by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is therefore also activated during every S phase where it regulates the firing of replication origins and repair of damaged replication forks to prevent premature onset of mitosis (7Paulovich A.G.

Replication protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric complex that recognizes and coats exposed ssDNA and hereby serves to mark these vulnerable sites in the DNA. Rad26 binds the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold of replication protein A via its most N-terminal helix and thus localizes Rad3 to ssDNA (8Ball H.L. Ehrhardt M.R. Mordes D.A.

To gain mechanistic insight into Rad26 and how it is able to recruit Rad3, I determined its crystal structure. This shows that Rad26 forms a compact unit with an unexpected fold of non-classical helical repeats. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that a conserved C-terminal domain together with a conserved kinase-docking motif is required for Rad3 kinase recruitment and further that the binding surface on Rad3 is located within a few HEAT repeats. The structure of Rad26 also provides insight into the oligomeric state of the protein, and the data support that Rad26 uses a large and highly conserved N-terminal domain for dimerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments confirm Rad26 dimerization in solution, and analytic gel filtrations show that Rad3 and Rad26 likely exist as a heterotetrameric complex that can be directly observed using single-particle electron microscopy. To understand Rad26 structurally, I crystallized the protein from Myceliophthora thermophila devoid of the flexible N terminus (residues 373–841, hereafter referred to as Rad26). M. thermophila is a thermophile fungus evolutionary closer to fission yeast compared with budding yeast or human, and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe nomenclature is therefore used throughout. The structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using selenomethionine-substituted Rad26 (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Eight of twelve possible selenium sites were found, and in the initial experimental electron density maps Rad26 was clearly seen (supplemental Fig. S1C). The Rad26 structure was built, and the selenium sites served as good makers to assign the correct amino acid registry. The Rad26 structure was refined using data extending to 3.15 Å resolution with a final free R factor of 23.5% and excellent geometry (Table 1), and most side chains were well defined in the final electron density map even in the high b-factor regions (supplemental Fig. S1D). Rad26 shows an unexpected fold and is built of helical repeat with unique arrangements distinct from the more common HEAT or ARM units (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of Rad26 (α1-α2) is not forming repeats, but instead the two helices are arranged perpendicular to each other with an extended loop region in between. The central part of the structure is formed by five helical repeats (α3-α4, α5-α7, α8-α10, α11-α12, and α13-α15) forming an α-solenoid arrangement similar to HEAT and ARM structures. The C-terminal domain (CTD) comprises the last three helices in the structure where the helical repeats diverges and shows a large positive twist of ∼45° between the helical axes compared with the preceding helical repeats. The last 10 C-terminal residues (hereafter referred to as the kinase-docking motif) are too flexible to be clearly defined in the electron density maps. The closest structural homologs to Rad26 as found by a Dali search is HspBP1 (Protein Data Bank entry 1xqr, root mean square deviation of 3.0 Å over 244 residues), which acts as a nucleotide-exchange factor for Hsp70 (12Shomura Y. Dragovic Z. Chang H.-C. Tzvetkov N. Young J.C. Brodsky J.L. Guerriero V. Hartl F.U. Bracher A.

Cell. 2005; 17: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HspBP1 is built of regular ARM repeats and superposes surprisingly well over the central part of Rad26, exemplifying the low sequence requirement (9% identity between Rad26 and HspBP1) for this basic helical fold.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsProteinM. thermophila Rad26 (373–841, SeMet)Protein Data Bank code5LOIData collectionWavelength (Å)0.979Space groupI 4 2 2a, b, c (Å)210.8, 210.8, 104.8α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 90Total reflections540,554Unique reflections20,640Resolution range (Å)105.4–3.15 (3.27–3.15)aThe highest resolution shell is in parentheses.Completeness (%)99.4 (100.0)Redundancy26.2 (26.8)Rmerge (%)12.3 (478.1)Rpim (%)2.5 (93.7)CC½ (%)99.9 (61.2)I/σ(I)23.0 (0.8)Wilson B-factor (Å2)140.6RefinementRwork (%)/Rfree (%)20.7/23.5Number of atoms3013B-factors (Å2)147.1Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.009Bond angels (°)1.02Estimated coordinate error (Å)0.51Estimated phase error (°)28.5Ramachandran (%) (favored/allowed/outliers)97.4/2.6/0.0Rotamer outliers (%)0.0MolProbity clashscore6.97a The highest resolution shell is in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Next I wanted to experimentally validate that Rad26 is able to bind the Rad3 kinase, which is vital for correct function. Pulldown experiments using recombinant purified Rad3 fragments of its N-terminal HEAT domain and histidine-tagged Rad26 (residues 373–841) confirmed that the structural domain of Rad26 binds Rad3 (residues 36–899) (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). The slightly shorter Rad3 (residues 1–719) fragment failed to bind Rad26, showing that residues 719–899 in Rad3 are vital for Rad26 binding (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). Additionally, pulldown with the N-terminal truncated form of Rad3 including residues 495–899 likewise showed binding of Rad26 to this fragment (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7), showing that the first 494 residues in Rad3 are not required for Rad26 binding, which contradicts previous yeast two-hybrid reports (13Ball H.L. Cortez D. ATRIP oligomerization is required for ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To validate these pulldown results, I measured the physical interaction between Rad26 and Rad3 using bio-layer interferometry. Histidine-tagged Rad26 (residues 373–841) were immobilized on anti-His biosensors, and association and dissociation to different concentrations of Rad3 were measured. From the sensorgrams obtained, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values were calculated for Rad3 (residues 36–899) to 9.4 ± 5.9 nm and for Rad3 (residues 495–899) to 7.9 ± 2.2 nm with fits of 0.999 and 0.997, respectively. In agreement with the pulldown experiments, no detectable binding was observed with Rad3 (residues 1–719), showing that residues 719–899 in Rad3 are needed for Rad26 binding. The PIKK kinases family members Rad3(ATR), Tel1(ATM), and DNA-PKcs bind a conserved kinase-docking motif located in the C termini of their respective activating proteins Rad26 (ATRIP), Nbs1, and Ku80 (14Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Conserved modes of recruitment of ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs to sites of DNA damage.Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). To understand in more detail how Rad26 recruits Rad3, I conducted structure guided mutations in Rad26 and examined their effects on Rad3 binding. Rad3 from M. thermophila contains a conserved C terminus, which has similarity to the kinase-docking motif in human ATRIP, Nbs1, and Ku80 (Fig. 3A). Wild-type Rad26 (residues 373–841) associates with Rad3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–3), but a truncated version of Rad26 lacking the last 12 residues lost most of its binding to Rad3 (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Mutating conserved residues in the motif (Asp-832/Glu-833 or Glu-839) into alanines did not have any observable effect on Rad3 binding (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, a GST-fused version containing only the last 12 C-terminal residues failed to recruit Rad3, showing that additional elements in Rad26 are important for Rad3 binding (Fig. 3B, lane 7). The notion that other elements in Rad26 are required for Rad3 recruitment is supported by the observation that Rad26 lacking the kinase-docking motif still associates with measurable amounts of Rad3 (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Examination of the Rad26 structure showed that the CTD has a distinct acidic patch neighboring the kinase-docking motif (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, this part of the structure is highly conserved between Rad26 orthologs (Fig. 3C), arguing that the CTD might be the structural element responsible for full Rad3 recruitment. To test this, I mutated conserved glutamates in this region and measured the relative effect these mutants had on binding Rad3 in pulldown experiments (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S2A). Mutating Glu-804/Glu-805 had a marginal effect, and mutation of Glu-816/Glu-819 or Glu-823/Glu-826 had no observable effect, whereas mutating Glu-810 into an alanine resulted in a more dramatic decrease in Rad3 binding (Fig. 3D). Together, these experiments show that Rad26 uses both its C-terminal kinase-docking motif and its conserved acidic CTD to bind and recruit Rad3. Rad26 contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain believed to be essential for dimerization (13Ball H.L. Cortez D. ATRIP oligomerization is required for ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, I find that Rad26 can form a dimer independently of the coiled-coil domain. Analytic gel filtration chromatography analysis of the Rad26 fragment comprising residues 373–841 without the coiled-coil domain shows that the protein elutes in two distinct peaks, indicating different oligomeric states (supplemental Fig. S3A). Inspection of the crystal lattice shows that one molecule of Rad26 makes extensive contact to a neighboring Rad26 molecule (Fig. 4, A and B). Additionally, the most N-terminal helix (α1) from one molecule extends and interacts with the concave helical repeats of the neighboring molecule, and this helix-swap stabilizes a Rad26 dimer. Because this putative dimer interface is formed across a special position crystallographic 2-fold axis, I reprocessed the data in lower symmetry (I4) with one dimer in the asymmetric unit instead of the I422 symmetry, which has only the monomer in the asymmetric unit, thereby allowing the two Rad26 molecules to be different. The loop region (residues 385–390) connecting α1 to the rest of the molecule is flexible, but even in the lower I4 symmetry space group, this connection is not visible in the electron density, arguing that I422 symmetry is correct. Sterically, it would be possible for α1 to fold back on itself, and this could occur when Rad26 is in a monomeric form. This crystal-packing dimer has a PISA (15Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6768) Google Scholar) score of 1.0, which implies that the interface is important for complex formation. The N-terminal part of two Rad26 molecules comes together in a “handshake” fashion and forms an intimate interface involving a total of eight helices. The interface footprint is more than 1907 Å2 and involves 51 residues that make hydrogen bonds and numerous hydrophobic interactions to the neighboring Rad26 molecule (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the large dimerization surface between two Rad26 molecules very nicely explains the high level of sequence conservation seen in this area (Figs. 3C and 4B). To validate that Rad26 makes a dimer in solution I performed SAXS experiment on the protein (residues 185–841) containing the coiled-coil part (supplemental Table S1). Comparing the experimental scattering curve to the theoretical scattering curves revealed a good fit of the Rad26 dimer described above (χ2 = 2.5) but a very poor fit to the Rad26 monomer (χ2 = 32.0) (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, low resolution ab initio reconstruction in DAMMIN produced 20 similar models that could be convincingly averaged and superimposes well with the crystal dimer of Rad26 (Fig. 4E). Thus, the SAXS data are in good agreement with the observed Rad26 dimer in the crystal. The orientation of the Rad26 dimer and the finding that the CTD together with the kinase-docking motif are the interaction site with Rad3 opens the possibility that two molecules of Rad3 can bind a Rad26 dimer simultaneously. To investigate this further, I did analytic gel filtration chromatography on isolated Rad3 and Rad26 and the complex between them. Because I and others (13Ball H.L. Cortez D. ATRIP oligomerization is required for ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have observed that the Rad3-Rad26 complex is more stable if the coiled coil of Rad26 is present, I used a Rad26 construct encompassing residues 185–841. Rad3 (residues 36–899) and Rad3 (residues 185–841) elute as single monodisperse peaks (Fig. 4F). Masses estimated by comparing their elution volumes with those of known molecular mass standards corresponded well with the actual molecular mass of a dimer Rad26 (145.1 kDa) and a monomer Rad3 (95.8 kDa). When Rad26 was preincubated together with Rad3, the complex elutes as a higher molecular mass species close to position of the 440-kDa standard, indicating a potential heterotetrameric 2:2 complex (336.7 kDa) (Fig. 4F). To gain structural information of how Rad3-Rad26 is organized, I used EM to investigate negative-stained samples of the purified complex (supplemental Fig. S4A). Particles were clearly resolved, and the best micrographs were further processed. Reference-free 2D class averaging of more than 5000 particles shows that the Rad3-Rad26 complex has a dimeric nature, and several classes contain protrusions from the center of the particles (supplemental Fig. S4A). The longest axis measures ∼150 Å, which corresponds nicely with the length of the Rad26 dimer (∼110 Å) plus the diameter of two HEAT repeats from Rad3 (∼20 Å each). The internal symmetry observed is most likely created by the Rad26 dimer that positions two opposing binding sites for Rad3 that are rotated 180° relative to each other. A very similar dimeric architecture was recently observed in a 3D reconstruction of the orthologs complex in yeast Mec1-Ddc2 (16Sawicka M. Wanrooij P.H. Darbari V.C. Tannous E. Hailemariam S. Bose D. Makarova A.V. Burgers P.M. Zhang X. The dimeric architecture of checkpoint kinases Mec1ATR and Tel1ATM reveal a common structural organization.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 13436-13447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the combined data, it is possible to suggest a model of how Rad3-Rad26 assembles into a heterotetrameric complex, in which the Rad26 dimer is the central scaffold binding two molecules of Rad3 through their HEAT domains (Fig. 4G). The crystal structure of Rad26 reveals a compact helical protein with a highly conserved CTD that together with a flexible kinase-docking motif recruits Rad3. The data support that Rad26 forms a dimer that is probably further strengthened by its N-terminal coiled-coil domain. The coiled-coil domains in Rad26 orthologs are very well conserved, and it has been demonstrated very elegantly that the coiled-coil domain in human ATRIP is important for oligomerization and increased the affinity for ATR (13Ball H.L.

However, Xenopus ATRIP was shown to form oligomers and could bind ATR independently of the coiled-coil domain, showing differences between species (18Kim S.-M. Kumagai A. Lee J. Dunphy W.G.

The organization of the suggested Rad26 dimer exposes two Rad3 binding sites orientated in opposite directions, and electron microscopy of purified Rad3-Rad26 suggests how this complex is arranged at low resolution. The dimensions and dimeric architecture of the Rad3-Rad26 complex is in good agreement with a recent single-particle electron microscopy reconstruction of yeast Mec1-Ddc2 (16Sawicka M. Wanrooij P.H.

Tel1 forms inactive dimers or higher-order multimers that dissociates after autophosphorylation into active monomers in response to DSB (19Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B.

The data now support that Rad26 is a dimer and most likely forms a 2:2 complex with Rad3; however, the dynamics and biological role of this oligomeric state remain elusive. Recently, it was shown that the Nek1 kinase associates and stabilizes the Rad3-Rad26 complex and primes it for an effective DNA-damage response, suggesting that Nek1-mediated phosphorylation is important for Rad3-Rad26 stability (30Liu S. Ho C.K. Ouyang J. Zou L. Nek1 kinase associates with ATR-ATRIP and primes ATR for efficient DNA damage signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rad3 binds Rad26 through its N-terminal HEAT repeats, and here I show that the interaction site is within a few HEAT repeats in the middle and located within residues 719–899 (∼881–1085 in human ATR). Yeast two-hybrid experiments have previously shown that human ATRIP interact with the very N terminus of ATR (residues 30–346) (31Ball H.L. Myers J.S. Cortez D.

Cell. 2005; 16: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but I find that the first 495 residues (approximately residues 1–472 in human) are not required for effective binding. The mapped Rad26 interaction site in Rad3 near the middle of the HEAT domain overlaps with the HEAT region in Tel1 that binds Nbs1 (32You Z. Chahwan C. Bailis J. Hunter T. Russell P.

https://openalex.org/W2595423089,"In Eurotransplant, 50% of simultaneous liver kidney transplantations (SLK) are performed for polycystic disease. Classically, liver and kidney are transplanted in two steps: liver through a subcostal incision, kidney through a separate oblique incision. Liver and kidney volume can make this ‘two-step’ procedure challenging, especially if simultaneous native nephrectomy is indicated. A ‘one-step’ SLK through a xiphopubic laparotomy might be a safe alternative, facilitating mobilization of the voluminous polycystic liver and native nephrectomy whilst offering access to iliac fossae for kidney transplantation. One-step SLK procedures for polycystic disease were introduced in 08/2013 at IKEM Prague (n = 6) and 11/2014 at University Hospitals Leuven (n = 6). Feasibility and safety of the one-step technique were investigated. We compared surgical data and outcomes obtained with the one-step technique to all consecutive two-step procedures performed for polycystic disease at the University Hospitals Leuven between 2008–2014 (n = 23). Median (interquartile range) are given. One-step SLK offered broad and adequate exposure for the hepatectomy, nephrectomies and transplantations, which were all uneventful. Morbidity, patient (100% vs 91%, p = 0.53) and graft survival (100% graft survival for liver and kidney in both groups) were comparable between one-step and two-step SLK. Liver cold ischaemia time was comparable [6.0 (4.4–7.6) vs. 7.1 (3.9–7.3), p = 0.077], kidney cold ischaemia time was shorter in one-step compared to two-step SLK [8.1 (6.4–9.3) vs. 11.7 (10.0–14.0), p<0.001)]. Total procedural time was also shorter in one-step compared to two-step SLK [6.8 (4.1–9.3) vs. 9.0 (8.7–10.1), p = 0.032], while all underwent bilateral (67%) or unilateral (33%) nephrectomy (compared to 0% and 52% in two-step SLK, respectively). In one-step SLK, 67% received a pre-emptive kidney transplant compared to 46% in two-step SLK. 5/12 two-step SLK became dialysis dependant after pre-transplant nephrectomy, the 4 dialysis-dependant patients with one-step SLK had not undergone pre-transplant nephrectomy. In conclusion, one-step SLK for polycystic disease is feasible and safe."

Nasopharyngeal washes (NPWs) were obtained from 83 of 120 individuals at variable times post adenotonsillectomy, in the absence of ARI symptoms. A look back at virus detection results in NPWs from the same 83 individuals at the time of tonsillectomy revealed that 73.5% (61/83) were positive for one or more viruses. The overall frequency of respiratory virus detection in post-tonsillectomy NPWs was 58.8%. Rhinovirus (RV) was the agent most frequently detected, in 38 of 83 subjects (45.8%), followed by enterovirus in 7 (8.4%), human metapneumovirus in 6 (7.2%), human respiratory syncytial virus in 3 (3.6%) and human coronavirus in 1 (1.2%). Remarkably, there was no detection of adenovirus (HAdV) or human bocavirus (HBoV) in asymptomatic individuals in follow-up of adenotonsillectomy.

https://openalex.org/W2596352493,"Due to the ubiquitous presence of treatment heterogeneity, measurement error, and contextual confounders, numerous social phenomena are hard to study. Precise control of treatment variables and possible confounders is often key to the success of studies in the social sciences, yet often proves out of the realm of control of the experimenter. To amend this situation we propose a novel approach coined “lock-in feedback” which is based on a method that is routinely used in high-precision physics experiments to extract small signals out of a noisy environment. Here, we adapt the method to noisy social signals in multiple dimensions and evaluate it by studying an inherently noisy topic: the perception of (subjective) beauty. We show that the lock-in feedback approach allows one to select optimal treatment levels despite the presence of considerable noise. Furthermore, through the introduction of an external contextual shock we demonstrate that we can find relationships between noisy variables that were hitherto unknown. We therefore argue that lock-in methods may provide a valuable addition to the social scientist’s experimental toolbox and we explicitly discuss a number of future applications."
