https://openalex.org/W2133279102,"Distant regulatory sequences affect transcription through long-range chromatin interactions. Visualization of transcriptional activity of genes that compete for distant elements, using the globin locus as a model, has revealed the dynamics of chromatin interactions in vivo. Multiple genes appear to be transcribed alternately rather than at the same time to generate several messenger RNAs in one cell. The regulator may stably complex with one gene at a time and switch back and forth between genes in a flip-flop mechanism."

To elucidate Ral function, we have searched for proteins interacting with an activated form of RalA using the two-hybrid method and a Jurkat cell library. We have identified a partial cDNA encoding a protein, RLIP1, which binds to activated RalA and this binding requires an intact effector domain of RalA. Biochemical data with purified RalA confirm the genetic results. This protein also bears a region of homology with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domains that are involved in the regulation of GTPases of the Rho family and, indeed, RLIP1 displays a GAP activity acting upon Rac1 and CDC42, but not RhoA. This GAP region is not required for RLIP1 binding to Ral.The whole cDNA was cloned, and it encodes a 76-kDa polypeptide, RLIP76, which also binds RalA. The Rho pathway is involved in membrane and cytoskeleton modifications after mitogenic stimulation and acts in parallel to and synergistically with the Ras pathway. We propose that these pathways are linked through a cascade composed of Ras → RalGDS → Ral → RLIP76 → CDC42/Rac1/Rho, allowing modulation of the Rho pathway by the Ras pathway.

Although several mammalian BMP type I receptors have been identified, the mammalian BMP type II receptors have remained elusive. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel transmembrane serine/threonine kinase from human skin fibroblasts which we demonstrate here to be a type II receptor that binds BMP-4. This receptor (BRK-3) is distantly related to other known type II receptors and is distinguished from them by an extremely long carboxyl-terminal sequence following the intracellular kinase domain. The BRK-3 gene is widely expressed in a variety of adult tissues. When expressed alone in COS cells, BRK-3 specifically binds BMP-4, but cross-linking of BMP-4 to BRK-3 is undetectable in the absence of either the BRK-1 or BRK-2 BMP type I receptors. Cotransfection of BRK-2 with BRK-3 greatly enhanced affinity labeling of BMP-4 to the type I receptor, in contrast to the affinity labeling pattern observed with the BRK-1 + BRK-3 heteromeric complex. Furthermore, a subpopulation of super-high affinity binding sites is formed in COS cells upon cotransfection only of BRK-2 + BRK-3, suggesting that the different heteromeric BMP receptor complexes have different signaling potential.

The ability of the mammalian BMP type I receptors to form a complex with the nematode Daf-4 type II receptor as well as with other proteins having the expected size of the type II receptor in endogenous systems (5Koenig B.B.

Indeed, expression of a BMP type I receptor in COS cells is insufficient to reproduce the high affinity binding observed in endogenous systems, suggesting that the high affinity complex is composed of both type I and type II receptor subunits(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L. Ventura F. Grant R.A. Chen G.-X. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Rosenbaum J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5961-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Since complex formation between the type I and type II receptors is a prerequisite for signal transduction induced by TGF-β-related ligands (13Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar), identification of the mammalian BMP type II receptor(s) is necessary in order to fully understand the nature of the BMP receptor signaling complex. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a human BMP type II receptor, which we term BRK-3 (BMP Receptor Kinase-3) that is identical in sequence to a novel receptor Ser/Thr kinase isolated on the basis of its ability to interact with type I receptor kinase domains in the yeast two hybrid system(23Kawabata M. Chytyl A. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5625-5630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As is observed for the activin and TGF-β type II receptors(6Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 7Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), BRK-3 binds ligands on its own when expressed in COS cells. However, in contrast to what is established for other type II receptors, cross-linking of 125I-labeled BMP-4 to this human BMP type II receptor is not observed in the absence of a BMP type I receptor. We demonstrate that, while BRK-3 is capable of forming a complex with either the BRK-1 or BRK-2 BMP type I receptors, a high affinity complex is formed only when BRK-2 is coexpressed with BRK-3 in COS cells. PCR was carried out using approximately 0.2-μg cDNAs prepared from human skin fibroblasts mRNA as a template and the following degenerate primers: TSK1 (sense, kinase subdomain II), 5′-GACGTNGCNGTNAA(AG)(AG)TNTT-3′; AVR5 (sense, kinase subdomain IV), 5′-ATGAA(AG)CA(TC)GA(AG)AA(TC)AT-3′; TSK4 (antisense, kinase subdomain VIB), 5′-CA(AG)CANGTNA(AG)(AG)TC(AG)TT(TC)TT-3′; and TSK2 (antisense, kinase subdomain VIII), 5′-GAC(TC)TCNGGNGCNA(TAG)(AG)TA-3′. The first round of PCR (94°C for 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 92°C for 40 s, 48°C for 40 s, 75°C for 90 s, followed by 5 min at 75°C for 5 min after the 35th cycle), was carried out with 15 μM of the TSK1 and TSK2 primers in a total volume of 50 μl using a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). Amplified DNA of about 470 base pairs was isolated and used subsequently as a template for the second round of PCR with the AVR5 and TSK4 primers under similar conditions. The final PCR products of about 300 base pairs were isolated and ligated into the SmaI site of pGEM7Zf(+) (Promega). cDNA libraries of human skin fibroblasts were constructed in the λgt10 vector using SuperScript Choice System (Life Technologies, Inc.), yielding 8 × 105 independent recombinants. Hybridization screening with one of the PCR clones was carried out as described(24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.1-11.6Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence was determined on both strands using an ABI DNA sequencer 373 after subcloning several restriction fragments into suitable vectors such as M13mp18/mp19. The binding studies described herein were performed after expression of a truncated version of the full-length hBRK-3 in COS cells because of initial difficulties in obtaining the full-length hBRK-3 clone due to the extremely long carboxyl terminus. To construct the truncated form of BRK-3 (tBRK-3), a stop codon was inserted after Ile540 in the carboxyl terminus with an aid of PCR, generating a truncated carboxyl terminus corresponding to the length of the activin type II receptor(6Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The stop codon was inserted using the primer, (5′-ACGCGGTACCTCACTAAATTTTTGGCACACGC-3′), corresponding to the antisense sequence of nucleotides 2013-2028, followed by a KpnI restriction site, and the sense primer (5′-GTAGACATGTATGCTCTTGG-3′), derived from nucleotides 1618-1637, corresponding to the area of the AflIII restriction site. The 400-base pair fragment was generated using PCR and digested with AflIII and KpnI. The cDNA from BRK-3 was digested with EcoRV and AflIII. This EcoRV/AflIII fragment and the digested PCR fragment were subcloned into the EcoRV/KpnI sites of the pJT4 expression vector(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E.

DNA Sequencing & Mapping. 1993; 3: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were also subcloned into pJT4. COS-7 and COS-1 cells were maintained and transfected using electroporation or DEAE-Dextran, respectively, as described previously(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L. Ventura F. Grant R.A. Chen G.-X. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Rosenbaum J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5961-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For COS-7 cell expression, 10 μg of type I receptor and 20 μg of type II receptor cDNAs were added to a 5 × 106 cell suspension in a final volume of 0.8 ml, unless otherwise indicated. For COS-1 cell expression, 2 μg/ml type I receptor and 4 μg/ml type II receptor were added to a 100-mm plate of cells at approximately 50-80% confluence, unless otherwise indicated. Recombinant human BMP-4 dimer was produced in CHO cells and purified as described previously(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L. Ventura F.

The IODO-BEAD reaction was carried out using 500 μCi of 125I (Amersham Corp.; 2200 Ci/mmol), 2 μg of lyophilized BMP-4 taken up in 50 μl of 10 mM acetic acid and added to 450 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma), with one IODO-BEAD for 10 min on ice. The two methods yielded iodinated BMP-4 of comparable specific activity (4000-9000 Ci/mmol). Whole cell binding, affinity labeling, and immunoprecipitation experiments were as described previously(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L.

The competition curves were analyzed using the INPLOT program (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA, version 4.0). For immunoprecipitations, antibodies were generated against the VII-VIII loop of the BRK-1 receptor(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L.

In this region, BRK-1 and BRK-2 differ by only a single amino acid; antiserum 1379 was found to recognize BRK-1 most efficiently, and antiserum 1380 was found to recognize BRK-2 most efficiently. For this reason, antiserum 1379 was used to immunoprecipitate BRK-1:BRK-3 receptor complexes, and antiserum 1380 was used to immunoprecipitate BRK-2-BRK-3 receptor complexes, with the same results as antisera specific for the BRK-1 extracellular domain or the BRK-2 juxtamembrane region (data not shown). Human MTN blots (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1.9-kilobase pair cDNA encoding the NH2-terminal region of BRK-3 from amino acids 15-657 was labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Megaprime kit (Amersham) and hybridized at 42°C overnight in the standard hybridization solution containing 50% formamide(24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.1-11.6Google Scholar). The final wash was performed at 50°C with 0.1 × SSC, and results obtained by autoradiography using a BAS2000 Bio Image Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). To account for the possibility of differential loading of mRNA in each lane, the blot was rehybridized with the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe after removing the BRK-3 signals by boiling in water. To isolate a novel human receptor protein kinase related to type II receptors for TGF-β and activin, we first employed PCR to amplify cDNA from human skin fibroblasts. In addition to the human activin type II receptor cDNA(25Matzuk M.M. Bradley A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we obtained a 289-nucleotide PCR fragment encoding a portion of a novel Ser/Thr kinase. We isolated several overlapping cDNAs from human fibroblast libraries by hybridization screening. Analysis of the entire coding sequence reveals the BRK-3 protein to be a 1038-amino acid member of the transmembrane Ser/Thr kinase family, identical to the T-ALK receptor recently identified from a HeLa cell cDNA library(23Kawabata M. Chytyl A. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5625-5630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although we have isolated additional 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of the cDNA. The sequence of BRK-3 has been deposited to the GSDB/DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI data bases under the accession number D50516. Several structural features suggest that the BRK-3 protein is a type II receptor for a member of the TGF-β superfamily. First, both an upstream Cys box in the extracellular domain and an intracellular GS domain that are conserved only in type I receptor sequences(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J.

Second, the sequence of the BRK-3 kinase domain is more closely related to other type II receptors, particularly the MISRII(26Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.L. Post M. van der Schoot P.J.C.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. de Winter J.P. Uilenbroek J.Th. J. Karels B. Wilming L.G. Meijers J.H.C. Themmen A.P.N. Grootegoed J.A. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar, 27diClemente N.

Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) receptors, than it is to the type I receptors (data not shown and (23Kawabata M. Chytyl A. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5625-5630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). Third, BRK-3 has a unique 533-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail rich in Ser, Thr, and Pro residues that is absent in the type I receptors. Fig. 1 shows the tissue specific expression of the BRK-3 gene as determined by Northern blot analysis in different human tissues. Four distinct transcripts of >10, 8, 6.5, and 5 kilobase pairs were detected in almost all tissues examined, except liver, leukocyte, testis, and thymus, where the longest transcript of the BRK-3 gene was not detected. The BRK-3 gene was expressed abundantly in lung, placenta, and testis. The relative abundance of the three major transcripts (>10, 8, and 5 kilobase pairs) varied depending on the tissue and may reflect tissue-specific processing of the transcripts. To determine whether the BRK-3 protein binds BMP-4, COS-7 cells were transfected with tBRK-3 alone or in combination with either the BRK-1 or BRK-2 type I receptor, and whole cell binding to a single concentration of 125I-labeled BMP-4 was measured (Fig. 2). tBRK-3 binds 125I-labeled BMP-4 by itself when expressed alone in COS cells. Binding of 125I-labeled BMP-4 is greatly enhanced by coexpression of tBRK-3 with BRK-2 and to a lesser extent by coexpression of tBRK-3 with BRK-1. These increases in binding could be due either to an increase in binding affinity or to an additive effect of binding to the different receptor proteins. In contrast to the whole cell binding experiments, affinity labeling experiments reveal that tBRK-3 is not efficiently cross-linked by 125I-labeled BMP-4 when expressed alone in COS-1 cells (Fig. 3A). However, coexpression of tBRK-3 with either BRK-1 or BRK-2 reveals a new band at ˜94 kDa, in addition to the cross-linked type I receptor bands at ˜75-78 kDa. (All approximate molecular weights are assumed to include the molecular weight of the BMP-4 monomer.) Allowing for the presence of three potential N-glycosylation sites in the BRK-3 extracellular domain, the new ˜94-kDa band is consistent with the predicted molecular weight of tBRK-3, cross-linked to the BMP-4 monomer. Interestingly, coexpression of BRK-2 with BRK-3 results in a more intense labeling of the type I receptor band, in contrast to what is observed when the BRK-1 type I receptor is coexpressed with BRK-3. The ˜150-kDa band that is most apparent in the BRK-2 + BRK-3 cotransfected cells may represent cross-linking with endogenous BRK-3 (see below). The nature of the minor ˜110-kDa band that is observed when BRK-3 is coexpressed with either type I receptor is unknown and could be due either to differential glycosylation or cross-linking of the ligand dimer to tBRK-3.Figure 3:Affinity labeling of the BMP receptors in COS cells expressing BRK-3 in combination with different BMP type I receptors. A, tBRK-3 does not cross-link to 125I-labeled BMP-4 on its own when expressed in COS cells. COS-1 cells were affinity labeled with 270 pM tracer, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiment was repeated once with similar results. B, tBRK-3 forms a complex with either BRK-1 or BRK-2 in the presence of 125I-labeled BMP-4. COS-1 cells were affinity-labeled with 350 pM tracer and immunoprecipitations were performed using antibodies for the BMP type I receptor kinase domain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Antiserum 1379 was used in lanes 1, 2, 3, and 7, whereas antiserum 1380 was used in lanes 4-6 and 8. The experiment was repeated three additional times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoprecipitation of cells cotransfected with tBRK-3 and either BRK-1 or BRK-2 resulted in the appearance of the same additional bands apparent in the cross-linking studies, indicating that tBRK-3 formed a complex with either type I receptor in the presence of 125I-labeled BMP-4 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, an additional band of ˜150-180 kDa is apparent in the BRK-2 receptor immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B), suggesting that an additional protein exists in the complex of BRK-2 with tBRK-3 in the presence of 125I-labeled BMP-4. Interestingly, this additional protein corresponds in size to the fulllength BRK-3 receptor cross-linked to the BMP-4 monomer, 2T. Nohno, T. Ishikawa, T. Saito, K. Hosokawa, S. Noji, J. Ting, B. B. Koenig, A. L. Pequet, and J. S. Rosenbaum, unpublished observations. and may represent the endogenous COS cell BRK-3 that exists in the complex with the truncated type II receptor in the presence of ligand and the type I receptor. When affinity labeling to the BRK-2 + BRK-3 receptor complex was performed with 125I-labeled BMP-4 in the absence and presence of 10 nM BMP-2, DR-BMP-2(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L. Ventura F. Grant R.A. Chen G.-X. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Rosenbaum J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5961-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), or BMP-4, binding was completely abolished to all bands in the BRK-2 + BRK-3 complex, whereas 50 nM TGF-β1 was completely ineffective, indicating that this receptor complex specifically binds either BMP-2 or BMP-4, but is not accessible to TGF-β1 (data not shown). Finally, the differential change in affinity labeling of the BRK-1 versus BRK-2 band that is observed in the type I-BRK-3 receptor complex is in contrast to what is observed when DAF-4 is cotransfected with either type I receptor, where an increase in affinity labeling of either type I receptor is observed (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that, whereas similar increases in either binding affinity or affinity labeling occur when DAF-4 is the type II receptor, tBRK-3 forms different complexes with the two different BMP type I receptors. In order to address the possibility that the differential affinity labeling of the BRK-1 or BRK-2 receptor bands that is observed in the presence of BRK-3 is reflective of a differential nature of the receptor complex that is dictated by the type I receptor, the binding affinity of BMP-4 to the two different receptor complexes was examined. Fig. 4A compares the affinity of BMP-4 in cells transfected with either BRK-1 alone to that in cells transfected with BRK-1 + BRK-3. No change in binding affinity for BMP-4 is observed (IC50 = 1.24 × 10-9M for BRK-1 alone versus 1.25 × 10-9M in cells cotransfected with BRK-1 + BRK-3). Although the binding affinity of BMP-4 is similar in cells transfected with either BRK-1 or BRK-2 alone, cotransfection of BRK-3 with BRK-2 results in an increase in the binding affinity of BMP-4 (IC50 = 4.58 × 10-9M for BRK-2 alone versus IC50 values of 3.35 × 10-13M and 1.34 × 10-8M in cells cotransfected with BRK-2 + BRK-3 (Fig. 4B)). Furthermore, the formation of a super-high affinity binding site population (where the data are best described by a two binding site model for the competitor, p < 0.0001) is observed only in cells cotransfected with the BRK-2 type I receptor and the BRK-3 type II receptor. We have isolated a new member of the receptor Ser/Thr protein kinase superfamily that is structurally related to the type II receptors for members of the TGF-β superfamily. When expressed in COS cells, this human type II receptor is capable of forming differential heteromeric complexes with either the murine BRK-1 or the chicken BRK-2 type II receptors in the presence of BMP-4. It has been demonstrated previously that murine and human BMP type I receptors form a complex with the nematode DAF-4 type II receptor(5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P.

Given the high degree of sequence conservation among the ligands and receptors of this family, it is unlikely that the observed differential binding properties for the type I-type II receptor complexes described herein are due to the species differences of the type I receptors. Rather, the differential binding properties described below most likely reflect the different signaling potential of the receptor complexes, which has been demonstrated for the TGF-β and activin receptor systems to be dependent on the type I receptor in the complex(13Cárcamo J.

The mammalian BRK-3 receptor binds BMP ligands on its own when transfected into COS cells, as is observed for mammalian type II receptors for TGF-β1(7Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A.

The finding that BRK-3 binds ligands on its own in COS cells, coupled with the finding that both truncated BRK-3 and a protein that corresponds in size to the full length BRK-32 can be brought down in a complex with the type I receptor when BRK-2 and truncated BRK-3 are cotransfected into COS cells (Fig. 3B) is consistent with the model that these receptors are heterotetramers, composed of pre-existing homodimers of the type II receptor(31Chen R.-H.

We cannot say at the present time whether the BRK-3 type II receptor homodimer is formed in the absence of ligand. In contrast to other type II receptors, cross-linking to BRK-3 is not evident in the absence of the type I receptor (Fig. 3A). A sequential binding model for TGF-β and activin receptors has been proposed wherein the ligand first binds to a preexisting type II receptor homodimer, with subsequent association of the type I receptor into the complex(22Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar, 31Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that recruitment of the type I receptor into the complex causes a conformational change in either the ligand or the receptor such that the ability of the lysines on the ligand and the receptor to cross-link is altered, resulting in an increased cross-linking efficiency of the type I versus the type II receptors(37Moustakas A. Takumi T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 765-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Takumi T. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to the TGF-β and activin receptor systems, it appears that the conformational change in the BMP ligand-receptor complex that occurs when both the type I and type II receptors contact the ligand results in an increased tendency for the ligand to be cross-linked to the BMP type II receptor. Additionally, in contrast to the TGF-β and activin receptor systems, both BMP type I (5Koenig B.B. Cook J.S. Wolsing D.H. Ting J. Tiesman J.P. Correa P.E. Olson C.A. Pecquet A.L. Ventura F. Grant R.A. Chen G.-X. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Rosenbaum J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5961-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and type II receptors are capable of binding BMP ligand on their own when transfected into COS cells. Hence, it cannot be said at the present time whether the same sequential binding model applies to the BMP receptor complex. Nevertheless, the distinction between the ability to bind and to cross-link to the receptor appears to be an important one for the BRK-3 mammalian BMP type II receptor, and it appears that a conformational change in either the ligand or the type II receptor is taking place as the type I receptor is recruited into the complex. While this does not seem to be the case for the nematode BMP type II receptor DAF-4, which does cross-link to BMPs in the absence of a cotransfected type I receptor(18Estevez M. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Albert P.S. Massagué J. Riddle D.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), it is interesting that a similar result is obtained for the Drosophila Punt receptor, in which cross-linking to 125I-labeled activin is apparent in the absence of a cotransfected activin type I receptor (19Childs S.R. Wrana J.L. Arora K. Attisano L. O'Connor M.B. Massagué J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9475-9479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas cross-linking to 125I-labeled BMP-2 is not apparent in the absence of a cotransfected Drosophila BMP type I receptor(21Letsou A. Arora K. Wrana J.L. Simin K. Twombly V. Jamal J. Staehling-Hampton K. Hoffmann F.M. Gelbart W.M. Massague J. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 1995; 80: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), implying a differential distribution of lysines at the ligand-type II receptor interface for activin versus BMPs. We also observe a dramatic difference in the binding affinity of BMP-4 to the different type I-BRK-3 type II receptor complexes (Fig. 4). While both the BRK-1 and BRK-2 BMP type I receptors are capable of forming a complex with BRK-3, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 3B), an increase in binding affinity of BMP-4 is only observed when the BRK-2-BRK-3 complex is formed in COS cells. After submission of this manuscript, Liu et al.(39Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of an alternatively spliced human BMP type II receptor that is 10 amino acids shorter than the artificially truncated form of human BRK-3 studied here. Affinity labeling studies with 125I-labeled BMP-2 and 125I-labeled BMP-7 demonstrate complex formation of BRK-3 with ALK-3 (the human homologue of BRK-1), ALK-6 (the murine homologue of BRK-2), and ActRI/SKR1 in the presence of both ligands but the largest signal was observed when BMP-7 was the ligand and ActRI was the type I receptor(39Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BMP-2 did not signal at all when BRK-1 or BRK-2 was the type I receptor. These authors did not report the binding affinity of these ligands to the different receptor complexes. The increase in binding affinity that we observe with BMP-4 in the presence of the appropriate receptor components is analogous to what is observed for other multicomponent cytokine receptor systems, in which it is the high affinity state of the receptor that is responsible for signaling(40Miyajima A. Hara T. Kitamura T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 378-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We predict that the BRK-2-BRK-3 receptor complex will represent a functional signaling complex for low concentrations of BMP-4, whereas the BRK-1-BRK-3 complex will be insufficient to transduce the BMP-4 signal at low concentrations of ligand. It therefore follows that a requirement for formation of a functional receptor signaling complex for BMPs will not only be that the individual receptor subunits bind ligand and form a complex, but that they form a high affinity complex in the presence of the appropriate ligand. In addition, the signaling receptor subunits will need to be colocalized in the same cell or tissue in vivo in order to represent a physiologically relevant receptor complex. Investigations of the signaling potential of the different BMP receptor complexes, as well as the colocalization of the individual BMP receptor subunits in vivo are currently in progress"

In the context of the model, copurifying G-proteins and guanyl nucleotides serve to regulate the degree of cooperativity between successive equivalents of muscarinic ligands. G-protein-mediated signaling is widely held to occur via a transient complex between the G-protein and the receptor; similarly, a mixture of uncoupled and G-protein-coupled receptors generally is assumed to account for heterogeneity seen in the binding of agonists (Gilman, 1987; Birnbaumer et al., 1990; Conklin and Bourne, 1993). The binding patterns are analyzed almost universally in terms of distinct, noninteracting, and noninterconverting sites (e.g. Munson and Rodbard(1980)), but that approach embodies a mechanistic paradox: in particular, the receptors appear to interconvert between the different states. Guanyl nucleotides act via the G-protein to effect an interconversion from higher to lower affinity for the agonist; there is a similar effect of sodium in some systems, whereas an interconversion from lower to higher affinity is promoted by magnesium (Birnbaumer et al., 1990). Also, the relative number of receptors ostensibly in one state or another differs among different agonists (e.g. Kent et al.(1980), Wong et al.(1986), Sinkins et al.(1993)). Variants of the “mobile receptor” or “ternary complex” model (De Lean et al., 1980) accommodate the apparent interconversion and complement biochemical evidence that a complex between receptors and G-proteins is stabilized by agonists and destabilized by guanyl nucleotides (Gilman, 1987; Birnbaumer et al., 1990). In such schemes, the allosteric interactions between agonists and guanyl nucleotides are described explicitly in terms of ligand-regulated equilibria between free receptors (R) and free G-proteins (G), or subunits thereof, on the one hand and one or more complexes on the other (e.g. De Lean et al. (1980), Onaran et al.(1993), Samama et al. (1993)). Agonists bind with higher affinity to RG than to R, and therefore promote coupling, whereas antagonists are indifferent or exhibit the opposite preference; guanyl nucleotides bind with higher affinity to G than to RG and therefore promote uncoupling. Schemes based on the mobile receptor hypothesis have been used to describe the binding properties of several receptors (e.g. Wreggett and De Lean(1984), Ehlert(1985), Neubig et al.(1988), Leung et al.(1990)), but a model that is fully consistent with the data has proved to be elusive (Lee et al., 1986; Wong et al., 1986; Wreggett, 1987; Ehlert and Rathbun, 1990). In the absence of a viable mechanistic scheme, there is no conceptual basis for interpreting the consequences of disease, mutagenesis, or other perturbation that affects the binding of agonists. Since the multiple states of affinity and their sensitivity to guanyl nucleotides are a measure of efficacy and intrinsic activity (e.g. Kent et al.(1980), Ehlert(1985)), an inability to account for the binding properties implies uncertainty over the process whereby a receptor elicits a response. Recent studies in our laboratory have focussed on an alternative to the notion of a ligand-regulated distribution of receptors between free and G-protein-coupled states. Several lines of evidence suggest that the binding properties of membrane-bound receptors and their attendant G-proteins are a manifestation of cooperative effects between successive equivalents of the ligand bound at interacting sites; moreover, the reciprocal allosteric interactions between agonists and guanyl nucleotides emerge as changes effected by one ligand in the degree of cooperativity associated with the other (Chidiac and Wells, 1992; Sinkins and Wells, 1993). If a multivalent receptor retains its structural integrity over time in a system at equilibrium, multiple states of affinity can arise from asymmetry alone or from cooperativity. The potential complexity is much greater, however, if the ligand itself promotes either the formation or the dissociation of an oligomer (e.g. Hirschberg and Schimerlik(1994)). Similarly, guanyl nucleotides may regulate the oligomeric status of G-proteins (Jahangeer and Rodbell, 1993) in addition to affecting the interaction between α and βγ subunits within the G-protein heterotrimer itself (Gilman, 1987). Finally, agonists, antagonists, and guanyl nucleotides may regulate the interaction between receptors and G-proteins as described above. In systems comprising ligand-regulated equilibria and transient complexes, the binding properties depend upon the local concentrations of the interacting proteins (Lee et al., 1986). In contrast, cooperative systems in which oligomeric integrity is ligand-independent might be expected to behave similarly under disparate conditions. To investigate these possibilities under controlled conditions, M2 muscarinic receptors have been purified from porcine atria and studied for their binding properties in solution.

Bacitracin, N-methylscopolamine, protease inhibitors, Sephadex G-50, sodium cholate, trimethylchlorosilane, and Tween 20 were from Sigma. Digitonin was obtained either as the pure compound from Wako Chemicals or at a purity of 50% from Sigma (catalog number D-1407). Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (lot number SL208992) and Fast-Flow DEAE-Sepharose were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Econo-Pacs and Econo-Columns were from Bio-Rad. Reagents and film for the recording of chemiluminescence were purchased from Amersham (ECL™, Hyperfilm MP) or DuPont NEN (Reflection).

Polyclonal antibodies raised to the subunits of G-proteins were purchased from DuPont NEN. The epitopes were as follows: the C terminus of the α-subunits of Gi1 and Gi2 (AS/7, Goldsmith et al., 1987), Gq and G11 (QL, Shenker et al., 1991), or Gs (RM/1, Simonds et al., 1989); the N terminus of the α-subunit of Go (GC/2, Spiegel, 1989); and the C terminus of β-subunits (SW/1, Spiegel, 1989). Ascites fluid containing a monoclonal antibody to the porcine M2 muscarinic receptor was provided by Dr. Neil M. Nathanson, Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington (31-1D1, Luetje et al., 1987). Anti-IgGs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham. Coupling of ABT to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B was performed essentially as described by Haga and Haga(1983), employing the capping modifications described by Florio and Sternweis(1985). The incorporation of ABT was 3.4 μmol/ml, as estimated from the peak absorbance (294 nm) measured in a difference spectrum (Cary 118, Varian Instruments) of the ABT-reacted gel and an equivalent amount of epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B prepared as a 50% slurry in distilled ethylene glycol. The molar extinction coefficient of ABT at 294 nm (2.06 × 106M−1 cm−1) was estimated from a set of standards prepared in 50% ethylene glycol from a stock solution of the ligand (0.1 M in 0.1 M HCl). Muscarinic receptors were purified from porcine atria, which contain only the M2 subtype (Luetje et al., 1987; Maeda et al., 1988). Sarcolemmal membranes were prepared and solubilized according to a procedure modified from that described by Peterson and Schimerlik(1984). Hearts were obtained at the time of death at Toronto Abattoirs Ltd. The complete left atrium and the right atrial appendage were removed within minutes, avoiding the sinus and atrioventricular nodes, and were transported on ice to the laboratory. Fat, blood clots, and excess tissue were removed, and the atria were rinsed in ice-cold PBS. 2All solutions described here and in the text were titrated to the desired pH at room temperature. The constituents of the various buffer solutions were as follows: PBS, 20 mM KH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 with KOH; PBSTM, PBS containing 5% non-fat dried milk and 0.05% Tween 20; buffer A, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μg/ml bacitracin, pH 7.6 with HCl; buffer B, 20 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 2.5% detergent stock, pH 7.4 with KOH; buffer C, buffer B supplemented with 20 mM NaCl; buffer D, 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.6 with NaOH. Buffers A and D were obtained by dilution of a stock solution prepared at the desired pH and at 10-fold the final concentration. The rinsed tissue was minced in a Waring blender (20 s at full power) in 2.5 volumes (by original weight of tissue) of ice-cold buffer A, and the mixture was homogenized on ice with three bursts of a Polytron (20 s at setting 7, 20-s intervals). The homogenate then was centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C and 1000 × g; this step was repeated once following resuspension of the pellet in 1 volume of buffer A in the Waring blender. The pooled supernatant was poured through eight layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged for 40 min at 4°C and 100,000 × g (Beckman, 45Ti). The pellet then was resuspended in a few milliliters of buffer A, briefly homogenized (Polytron, 10 s, setting 7), and diluted with the same buffer to obtain a convenient volume for the next step (0.2-0.6 ml/g of original weight). The diluted homogenate (about 20 ml/tube) was centrifuged for 60 min at 2°C and 100,000 × g (Beckman, SW28) through a stepwise gradient of 13% (w/v) sucrose (6 ml) and 28% (w/v) sucrose (7 ml) in buffer A. Material at the sucrose interface was recovered with a Pasteur pipette, diluted at least 3-fold with buffer A, and centrifuged for 40 min at 4°C and 100,000 × g (Beckman, 45Ti). The final pellet was resuspended in a few milliliters of buffer A, briefly homogenized (Polytron, 10 s, setting 7), and diluted to about 0.05 ml/g of original weight. Sarcolemmal membranes obtained from this step usually were stored overnight at 2°C in a polypropylene tube. To solubilize the sarcolemmal membranes, the suspension described above was diluted with buffer A to obtain a protein concentration of 5.5 mg/ml. Nine volumes of the diluted suspension then were mixed with 1 volume of a stock solution containing 4% digitonin (Wako) and 0.8% sodium cholate in buffer A. After gentle mixing by vertical rotation (30 rpm) for 10 min at room temperature, the membranes were collected by centrifugation for 40 min at 4°C and either 100,000 × g (Beckman, 45Ti) or 150,000 × g (Beckman, 70Ti). The pellet was resuspended in a few milliliters of buffer A, gently homogenized (Polytron, about 10 s, setting 4), and diluted with buffer A to 39% of the original volume. This preparation contained about 10 mg of protein/ml, assuming a 30% loss of protein from the first step (Peterson and Schimerlik, 1984). Four volumes of the suspension were mixed with 1 volume of the buffered detergent stock, and the preparation was rotated for 10 min as described above. An equal volume of ice-cold buffer A then was added, the mixture was centrifuged as described above, and the supernatant was stored at 2°C in a polypropylene tube. The material from this step was the crude solubilized preparation used in all subsequent procedures. All steps of the purification were performed at 4°C unless indicated otherwise. The solubilized atrial membranes were applied at a rate of about 0.5 ml/min to a column of Fast-Flow DEAE-Sepharose (20 ml, 3.5 cm in diameter) previously equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1% digitonin (Wako) and 0.02% sodium cholate. The sample was washed into the column with a further 20 ml of the equilibrating buffer. Elution was carried out at a rate of about 1 ml/min with 80 ml of buffer B containing 50 mM NaCl followed by 80 ml of buffer B containing 250 mM NaCl; the last 60 ml of eluate was retained as the fraction containing the receptor. That fraction was concentrated about 30-fold (Amicon, Centriprep-30), diluted with buffer B such that the concentration of NaCl was reduced to 20 mM, and then used to suspend 3 ml of ABT-Sepharose previously equilibrated in buffer C. It was found that [3H]NMS binding activity was cleared from the solution if the sample was diluted about 10-fold prior to its application to the affinity resin. The suspension was mixed gently by vertical rotation (30 rpm) in a polypropylene tube for 12-16 h at 4°C and then packed into an Econo-Column at a rate of 1 ml/min. Nonretained material was eluted with 1 bed volume of buffer C, and the column was washed with 20 bed volumes of buffer B containing 0.2 M NaCl. The column then was transferred to room temperature and washed with 4 bed volumes of buffer C prepared without Na2EDTA. The receptor was recovered from the column at room temperature with this same buffer supplemented with 0.3 M carbachol. One bed volume of the agonist-containing buffer was passed into the column, which then was left to incubate for 30 min; 4 more bed volumes were used for elution, and the eluate was collected as the fraction containing the receptor. The material recovered from the affinity column was divided in two, and each half was processed at room temperature according to one of two chromatographic methods. Originally introduced to remove carbachol, each method subsequently was found to yield a distinct preparation of the receptor (see below). The material was processed by hand-held disposable plastic syringes, and the two procedures were carried out in parallel. In the first procedure, the receptor-containing sample was supplemented with 1 mM EDTA from a solution previously adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH. That sample then was concentrated to less than 0.2 ml (Amicon, Centricon-10), adjusted to a volume of 0.2 ml with buffer C, and applied to an Econo-Pac P6 cartridge (5 ml, size-exclusion column) previously equilibrated with buffer C. Elution was carried out with buffer C at a rate of about 4 ml/min. The receptor was collected in 1.7-4.0 ml of eluate, and that fraction is designated here as preparation M2G. In the second procedure, the material eluted from the affinity column was applied to an Econo-Pac HPT cartridge (1 ml, ceramic hydroxyapatite column) at a rate of about 0.5 ml/min. The resin was washed first with 3 ml of EDTA-free buffer C and then with 15 ml of a phosphate buffer (0.12 M KH2PO4) containing 0.1% digitonin (Wako), 0.02% sodium cholate, and 0.1 mM PMSF. The receptor then was eluted with 6 ml of the same buffer prepared with 0.5 M KH2PO4. The phosphate buffers were prepared from stock solutions of phosphate (1 M KH2PO4, adjusted to pH 7.6 with KOH) and detergent (4% digitonin (Wako), 0.8% sodium cholate). The first bed volume of eluate was discarded. The remainder was concentrated and then processed on an Econo-Pac P6 cartridge as described above in order to transfer the receptor into buffer C. That fraction of the eluate containing the purified receptor is designated here as preparation M2. Both preparations were stored in polypropylene tubes at 2°C. The two preparations differed in their complement of G-proteins, which were largely absent from M2 but copurified with the receptor in M2G. All of the procedures described above, from initial homogenization of the tissue to the elution of nonretained material from ABT-Sepharose, were carried out in magnesium-free buffers containing EDTA. Such conditions promote the removal of endogenous guanyl nucleotides (e.g. Chidiac and Wells(1992)), and GDP therefore is expected to be absent from the G-proteins in M2G. Electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gels was performed according to the method of Laemmli(1970). Proteins resolved in the gel either were visualized by silver or Coomassie staining or else were transferred to a supported nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) over about 1 h at 5 mA/cm2 in a semi-dry blotting apparatus equipped with a plate cooling coil (Biometra, Maidstone, United Kingdom) (Towbin et al., 1979). All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Nonspecific protein-binding sites on the nitrocellulose were blocked by incubation for 30 min with PBSTM. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBSTM to obtain the concentrations indicated in the legends to the figures, and the solution was incubated with the blots for 3 h. The blots were washed with PBSTM, incubated for 45 min with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 or 1:3000 dilution in PBSTM), and washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and once with PBS alone. The activity of bound horseradish peroxidase was visualized by means of enhanced chemiluminescence and recorded on x-ray film, which was exposed for a range of times to obtain an optimal result. The data then were quantitated by computer-assisted densitometry on an image analyzer (MCID, Imaging Research Inc., St. Catherines, Canada) with a resolution of 256 gray levels per image point. To probe sequentially for different antigens, IgGs were removed from previously treated nitrocellulose by means of a stripping buffer (125 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol, adjusted to pH 6.8 with HCl). The buffer was applied twice for 20 min at 70°C (Kaufmann et al., 1987), and the membrane then was rinsed thoroughly at room temperature in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. All samples containing detergent were prepared for electrophoresis by extraction with chloroform and methanol. After separation of the phases by the addition of water, the insoluble material was sedimented in a microcentrifuge, air-dried, and sonicated into SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol at 0.1 M. The samples then were boiled for 5 min prior to application on the gel. In one experiment, the samples were left at room temperature for 20 min rather than boiled. The extraction procedure served both to concentrate the material and to remove constituents, such as salt and detergent, which impaired the performance of the gels. In some cases, the samples were concentrated at 2°C on ultrafiltration membranes (Amicon, Microcon-10) before the extraction. Aliquots of the receptor-containing solution (2-5 μl) were diluted to 50 μl by the addition of buffer D containing 0.1% digitonin (Wako), 0.02% sodium cholate, 0.1 mM PMSF, and various ligands as required. The samples were incubated at 30°C in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, and the total contents of the tube then were transferred to the top of a bed of Sephadex G-50 fine (0.3 × 6.5 cm) packed in polypropylene columns (Disposaflex, Kontes Glass Co.) pre-equilibrated at room temperature with buffer D containing 0.025% digitonin (Sigma). For those steps up to and including application of the sample to the resin, all plastic making contact with the receptor was silanized by pretreatment with trimethylchlorosilane vapor. Elution was carried out at room temperature with buffer D containing 0.025% digitonin (Sigma). All of the eluant up to and including the void volume (1.45 ml) was collected in a plastic counting vial and mixed with a commercial scintillant (3 ml of ACS, Amersham or 4 ml of Ready-Safe, Beckman). The conditions of elution were optimized to provide virtually complete separation of free and bound radioligand with no loss of the latter through dissociation from the receptor. Assays were performed in duplicate, and the radioactivity in each sample was measured twice for 5 min at an efficiency of about 23% (ACS) or 33% (Ready-Safe). The four values then were averaged to obtain the mean (±S.E.) for use in subsequent calculations; standard errors typically were about 2% of the mean. To estimate the binding capacity of samples collected at different stages of purification, the specific binding of [3H]NMS was measured at a concentration of 300 nM. Nonspecific binding was taken throughout as total binding in the presence of 0.1-1 mM unlabeled NMS. All data were analyzed with total binding taken as the dependent variable (picomolar). Any subsequent manipulations were for the purpose of presentation only and did not alter the relationship between the data and the fitted curve. Nonspecific binding increased linearly with the concentration of unbound radioligand for each of the three compounds used in the investigation. Data acquired at graded concentrations of the radioligand were described empirically in terms of the Hill equation to obtain estimates of the Hill coefficient (nH) and the concentration required for half-maximal specific binding (EC50). The solution included an implicit correction for depletion of the free radioligand (i.e. Equations 203-205 in Wells(1992)). Cooperativity was modeled according to Fig. SI, in which a radiolabeled probe (P) and an unlabeled ligand (A) compete for sites on a tetravalent receptor (R) that presumably is an oligomer (tetramer). Bivalent (dimer) and trivalent (trimer) receptors can be described by truncated forms of R. It is assumed that the oligomeric integrity of R is retained under the conditions of the binding assays; the model can accommodate processes in which dissociated monomers regroup without exchanging partners, but there can be no exchange of individual subunits within the system. Asymmetry cannot be detected with the present data, and all sites of the vacant oligomer were assumed to bind P or A with the microscopic dissociation constant KP or KA (e.g. KP = [P][R]/[PR]). 3Microscopic or intrinsic dissociation constants (K) and macroscopic dissociation constants (K′) are related according to the expression K = K‘ [(n + 1 − i)/i], where i is the ith equivalent of ligand, and n is the total number of interacting sites (e.g. Wyman and Gill(1990) and Wells (1992)). If the values of K for binding of the radioligand to a tetrameric receptor are KP, p2KP, p2p3KP, and p2p3p4KP, the corresponding values of Ki‘ are (1/4)KP, (2/3)p2KP, (3/2)p2p3KP, and 4p2p3p4KP. The parameters pj and aj represent the cooperativity factors for binding of the jth equivalent of P or A to form RPj or AjR, respectively (j ≥ 2) (e.g. [RPj−1][P]/[RPj] = Πi=2,j cj, c‘j, and c”j represent cooperativity factors in the formation of mixed complexes, as shown in Fig. SI. The model was fitted to the data by means of, in which Bobsd represents total binding of the radioligand; [P]b represents specific binding at a total concentration [P]t, and NS is the fraction of unbound radioligand that appears as nonspecific binding. Bobsd={[P]b+NS([P]t+[P]b)}(Eq. 1) The value of [P]b was calculated according to, or for the bivalent, trivalent, or tetravalent forms of R, respectively. The concentration of each complex was obtained as described below. Coefficients greater than 1 reflect the degree of occupancy by P, since R is defined as multivalent, and the multiple forms of liganded receptor at each level of occupancy. Stoichiometrically equivalent species are functionally indistinguishable with the present data, and the microscopic dissociation constant therefore was taken as the same for all vacant sites on partially liganded R (e.g. [P][POOA]/[PPOA] = [P][POOA]/[POPA], where O represents a vacant site on tetravalent R). The triliganded species A2RP1 and A1RP2 also were taken as identical (i.e. c3 = c‘3), as were the tetraliganded species A3RP1, A2RP2, and A1RP3 (c4 = c′4 ≡ c”4). They are not necessarily indistinguishable in binding studies, but the additional parameters were found to be without effect on the sum of squares. [P]b=2[RP]+2[RP2]+2[ARP](Eq. 2a) [P]b=3[RP]+6[RP2]+3[RP3]+6[ARP]+3[A2RP]+6[ARP2](Eq. 2b) [P]b=4[RP]+12[RP2]+12[RP3]+4[RP4]+12[ARP]+12[A2RP]+24[ARP2]+12[A2RP2]+4[A3RP]+12[ARP3](Eq. 2c) The values of individual terms in Equations 2a-2c were calculated from the equilibrium dissociation constants and the free concentrations of the reactants. The latter were obtained by solving a set of implicit equations derived from the equations of state for each ligand and the receptor. Solutions were obtained according to the Newton-Raphson procedure, but successful convergence often required initial estimates that were close to the desired roots. Values near or equal to the answer were computed in an iterative procedure that involved successive estimates of the free concentration of R on the one hand and of P and A on the other. The total concentrations of both ligands were taken as equal to the free concentrations and substituted in the equation of state for the receptor to obtain the value of [R] (i.e. [R] = f{[R]t, [P], [A], KP, KA, pj, aj, cj}); the latter then was used to obtained revised estimates of the former (e.g. [P] = f{[P]t, [A], [R], KP, KA, pj, aj, cj}), and the cycle was repeated until convergence occurred. Further details regarding the formulation of cooperative models have been described elsewhere (Wells, 1992). All parameters were estimated by nonlinear regression, and values at successive iterations of the fitting procedure were adjusted according to the algorithm of Marquardt(1963). The squared residual for each measurement was weighted by the reciprocal of the estimated variance. Most analyses involved multiple sets of data, and the assignment of shared parameters is described where appropriate. Other details related to the statistical procedures have been described previously (Wong et al., 1986; Chidiac and Wells, 1992; Sinkins et al., 1993). The purification was monitored by means of samples collected at each stage of the 2-day procedure and tested subsequently for immunoreactivity and the specific binding of [3H]NMS. Results from the screening of a Western blot are shown in Fig. 1, where various fractions from a single purification are compared for their reactivity with antibodies specific either for various G-protein subunits or for the M2 muscarinic receptor. Similar results were obtained with fractions from several other runs. As described previously (Peterson and Schimerlik, 1984), the lower concentration of detergent use"

In contrast to the effects of TCDD, induction kinetics and CYP1A1 mRNA half-life were dependent on ICZ concentration, and the response from low doses of inducer was transient due to rapid clearance of ICZ. TCDD and ICZ produced the same maximum response (i.e. equal efficacies) from a TCDD-responsive CAT reporter construct in Hepa-1 cells. When measured by the immediate responses associated with CYP1A1 expression, including cellular uptake of inducer, receptor transformation and binding to DRE (gel mobility shift assay), initiation of transcription (nuclear run-on assay), and short-term accumulation of mRNA (Northern blot assay), ICZ also exhibited an efficacy equal to that of TCDD and a potency that corresponds to its receptor affinity. ICZ is a potent and selective noncompetitive inhibitor of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (K = 1.5 nM).

https://openalex.org/W2040816846,"Purified high conductance calcium-activated potassium (maxi-K) channels from tracheal smooth muscle have been shown to consist of a 60-70-kDa α subunit, encoded by the slo gene, and a 31-kDa β subunit. Although the size of the β subunit is that expected for the product of the gene encoding this protein, the size of the α subunit is smaller than that predicted from the slo coding region. To determine the basis for this discrepancy, sequence-directed antibodies have been raised against slo. These antibodies specifically precipitate the in vitro translation product of mslo, which yields an α subunit of the expected molecular mass (135 kDa). Immunostaining experiments employing smooth muscle sarcolemma, skeletal muscle T-tubules, as well as membranes derived from GH3 cells reveal the presence of an α subunit with an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa. The difference in size of the α subunit as expressed in these membranes and the purified preparations is due to a highly reproducible proteolytic decay that occurs mostly at an advanced stage of the maxi-K channel purification. In the purified maxi-K channel preparations investigated, the full-length α subunit, an intermediate size product of 90 kDa, and the 65-kDa polypeptide, as well as other smaller fragments can be detected using appropriate antibodies.

Comparison of the predicted primary sequence of these channels with that of voltage-gated K+ channels revealed a core structure that has six putative transmembrane domains, termed S1 to S6, with a conserved region, between S5 and S6, defining a presumed pore structure. However, the slo maxi-K channel genes encode a subunit of >1100 amino acid residues in length, twice the typical length of voltage-gated K+ channels. This is due to the presence of a long tail sequence located at the C-terminal side of the core, which does not exist in other voltage-gated K+ channels. One remarkable feature of this C-terminal tail domain is the occurrence of four additional hydrophobic regions, termed S7 through S10, of unknown topology and the existence of several splice sites. Recently, it has been shown that injection of mRNA for either C-terminal or N-terminal truncated forms of mslo (the channel cloned from mouse brain and skeletal muscle) into Xenopus oocytes does not lead to the appearance of functional channels(12Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, coinjection of mRNA encoding both truncated forms produces functional maxi-K channels indistinguishable from those obtained from the gene encoding full-length mSlo. These studies have led to the suggestion that open time, conductance, and voltage dependence of maxi-K channels are determined by the N-terminal core, whereas Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel appears to involve a region of several negatively charged residues at the C-terminal core. In addition, co-expression experiments with mSlo and the β subunit of the maxi-K channel indicate that the later subunit affects the Ca2+ sensitivity of mSlo by shifting the mid-point of activation about 80 mV to more hyperpolarized potentials(13McManus O.B.

However, the smooth muscle maxi-K channel α subunit appears upon SDS-PAGE as a band of 60-70 kDa, which corresponds to a protein of only 600-700 residues(5Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B. Giangiacomo K.M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 676-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have employed a battery of sequence-directed antibodies to resolve the discrepancy in apparent size between Slo and the purified α subunit of the smooth muscle maxi-K channel. Our results indicate that the membrane-bound α subunit, as expressed in native smooth muscle tissue, has a size of 125 kDa and that the difference in size with the purified α subunit is due to a highly reproducible proteolytic decay that occurs at an advanced stage of maxi-K channel purification. Despite this proteolytic event, all of the resulting fragments remain associated throughout the purification procedure and can only be resolved after denaturation of the preparation with SDS under reducing conditions. Moreover, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the level of channel expression in different tissue preparations and provide evidence for the occurrence of distinct splice variants at the protein level in native tissue. A preliminary report of these findings has been made in abstract form(15Knaus H.-G. Eberhart A. Munujos P. Kaczorowski G.J. Schmalhofer W.A. Warmke J.W. Garcia M.L. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): 267Google Scholar). ChTX was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories and radioiodinated as previously described(15Knaus H.-G. Eberhart A. Munujos P. Kaczorowski G.J.

Affinity-purified alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, nitro blue tetrazolium, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, Tween 20, and Triton X-100 were obtained from Sigma. Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose was from Pharmacia. Prestained molecular mass standards (range 14.4-106 kDa) and PVDF membranes (Immobilon) were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents employed were of the highest purity grade commercially available. A detailed description of the membrane preparations employed in this study and the channel purification procedure has been previously published(5Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B. Giangiacomo K.M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 676-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal sera were raised against several regions of the α subunit of the smooth muscle maxi-K channel. The sequences of the synthetic peptides employed and their location along the mSlo sequence are: MDA LII PVT MEV P (anti-α(28-40)); HFT QVE FYQ GSV LNP (anti-α(421-435)); DPD AED ASN IMR VIS IK (anti-α(459-475)); MRH DPL LIP GND QID NMD (anti-α(693-710)); VND TNV QFL DQD DD (anti-α(913-926)), and ELE ALI AEE NAL RGG (anti-α(978-992)). The amino acid numbering refers to the mSlo clone previously published(8Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To facilitate coupling of the peptide to the carrier protein prior to immunization, either a cysteine residue (anti-α(421-435) and anti-α(693-710)) or a lysine residue (anti-α(459-475)) was added. Three sequence-directed antibodies (anti-α(28-40), anti-α(913-926), and anti-α(978-992)) were raised against peptides synthesized on a lysine core linked to a solid-phase peptide synthesis support. For immunization, the peptides were either coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with 3-maleidobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidylester (anti-α(421-435) and anti-α(693-710)) or bovine serum albumin employing glutaraldehyde (anti-α(459-475)). The conjugates, emulsified in Freund's adjuvant, were injected into each of two rabbits. The procedure was repeated 1 month later, and serum collection was begun 2 weeks thereafter. Antibody production was monitored by ELISA analysis following standard protocols. Peptides (2 μmol) were dissolved in 100 mM NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.5, and incubated with 1 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose (4 ml of gel) for 12 h at 4°C. The coupling efficiency was monitored by determining the absorbance at 215 nm before and after coupling. Thereafter, the affinity matrix was alternately washed with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, and 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5 (500 ml each), and equilibrated with 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (TBS). Depending on the titers of the antisera, 2-8 ml of crude serum was incubated under gentle rotation with the affinity matrix for 12-15 h at 4°C. After collecting the unbound material and washing the gel with TBS, the antibodies were eluted within 5 min with either 100 mM glycine buffer, pH 2.5, or 5 M MgCl2. The glycine buffer was neutralized immediately with 2 M Tris base, and the MgCl2 eluate was diluted 5-fold with ice-cold TBS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and washed several times with ice-cold TBS in a centricon-30 device (Amicon Inc.). The overall recovery, as determined by ELISA, was usually 20-40%. The antibodies were stored for several months at 4°C in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 without any loss in activity. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred under constant cooling in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol onto PVDF membranes for 60 min at 100 V constant voltage using a mini-trans-blot cell. After protein transfer, the PVDF membrane was incubated with 10% skim milk powder, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 dissolved in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (TBS) for 180 min at 22°C and then with antiserum diluted in 1% skim milk powder, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS for 12 h at 4°C. Blots were washed three times with 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS and incubated with affinity-purified alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:2000 dilution for 120 min at 22°C. After washing for six times with the buffer described above, the blots were developed in 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.033% nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.017% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate until the bands of interest were clearly visible (2-10 min). The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 M EDTA/Tris, pH 7.4, up to a final concentration of 20 mM. The immunprecipitation studies were performed as previously outlined(17Knaus H.-G. Folander K.

Genet. 1994; 8: 1239-1243Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using the manufacturer's protocol. Standard SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli(19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar). Prestained molecular weight standards were used to generate standard curves from which the apparent molecular mass of the fragments was calculated by non-linear regression analysis. Protein concentration was determined as described(20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214256) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. To visualize the [35S]methionine-labeled translation product of mslo, the gels were incubated with Enlightning reagent (DuPont NEN) according to the manufacturer's protocol and developed overnight on a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Amino acid sequence of isolated internal peptide fragments obtained after tryptic digestion of the α subunit of the purified bovine tracheal maxi-K channel suggests that this protein is nearly identical to mSlo(14Knaus H.-G. Garcia-Calvo M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3921-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the size of the purified α subunit determined after SDS-PAGE is significantly smaller than that predicted for the product of the slo gene(5Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B.

Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To investigate the reason for this discrepancy and to determine the molecular weight of Slo expressed in different tissues, sequence-directed antibodies have been raised against seven peptide sequences of mSlo (Fig. 1)(8Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). These antibodies have been affinity purified by chromatography on their respective peptide columns. Anti-α(28-40) is directed against residues 28-40, which are thought to form the N-terminal end of the protein. Two other antibodies, anti-α(421-435) and anti-α(459-475), recognize sequences adjacent to the S6 segment, whereas anti-α(693-710) interacts with a stretch of amino acids between the putative transmembrane segments S8 and S9, close to the splice site A. Anti-α(913-926) is directed against a sequence within a putative extracellular loop between transmembrane segments S9 and S10, while anti-α(978-992) recognizes a sequence that is thought to be located on an intracellular site of the α subunit shortly beyond the putative S10 segment. ELISA analyses indicate that each of the antisera displayed a significant titer and that each reacted specifically with its corresponding peptide antigen. To determine the utility and specificities of these affinity-purified, sequence-directed antibodies, they were further analyzed by immunoblotting 1-10 fmol of maxi-K channels present in bovine tracheal smooth muscle membranes. All of the antibodies listed above reacted in Western blots with the α subunit of the maxi-K channel (Fig. 2, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 2, a single major immunoreactive protein of 125 kDa is detected in this smooth muscle tissue (Fig. 2A). To investigate the tissue distribution and the level of maxi-K channel expression in different tissues, membranes derived from different smooth, cardiac, and striated muscle, as well as GH3 cells and kidney, were screened for the presence of maxi-K channel α subunits with anti-α(913-926). As already suggested by recent cloning (8Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 11Moss G.W.J. Marshall J.

In all cases, this polypeptide has an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa. Furthermore, this polypeptide in these tissues was also immunostained by all other antibodies employed in this study, although in some cases additional polypeptides were nonspecifically labeled to certain extents (data not shown). The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed by inclusion of the corresponding antigenic peptide (1 μM), which virtually abolished the immunostaining reaction (Fig. 2, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5).Figure 4:Proteolysis of the α subunit of the bovine tracheal smooth muscle maxi-K channel. Approximately 18 fmol of [125I]ChTX binding sites were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Thereafter, the α subunit was visualized by immunoblotting employing anti-α(421-435) after each individual purification step. 1, after chromatography on a wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose column (second purification step); 2, after chromatography on a Mono-Q ion exchange column (third purification step); 3 and 4, after chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column (fourth purification step) in the absence (3) or in the presence (4) of 1 μM of the corresponding competing peptide. Fractions after the hydroxylapatite purification step were also immunostained with anti-α(459-475) (5 and 6) in the absence (5) or presence (6) of 1 μM of corresponding peptide.

In marked contrast, membranes from kidney, liver, testis, and cardiac sarcolemmal membranes (Fig. 2, D and F, and data not shown) did not show any specific immunostaining signal, regardless of which sequence-directed antibody was employed. To determine the relative level of maxi-K channels that are expressed in these tissues, identical amounts of membrane protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed in immunostaining experiments employing anti-α(913-926). The highest expression levels were observed in bovine trachea, bovine aorta, and rat uterus smooth muscle membranes, whereas only intermediate levels were seen in membranes from GH3 cells (Fig. 2G). A significantly lower tissue expression level was found in skeletal muscle T-tubule membranes (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data quantitate the relative levels of maxi-K channels expressed in these tissues and support data from earlier studies using electrophysiological or molecular biological methods(8Butler A.

The data presented above indicate that the molecular mass of membrane-bound α subunits, independent of the tissue under investigation, is in the 125-kDa range.

Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and the human hslo(10Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Thus, when mslo is translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and separated by SDS-PAGE, the [35S]methionine-labeled translation product of mslo migrates with the 133-kDa protein standard (Fig. 3). To verify that the labeled product is indeed encoded by mslo, immunoprecipitation studies using anti-α(421-435), anti-α(693-710), and anti-α(913-926) were performed. All three antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated mSlo (some data not shown), whereas a sequence-directed antibody against the β subunit of the maxi-K channel (17Knaus H.-G. Folander K. Garcia-Calvo M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Smith M. Swanson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17274-17278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not capable of recognizing this polypeptide (Fig. 3B). The purified α subunit of the bovine tracheal maxi-K channel has been shown to display a molecular mass of 60-70 kDa (5Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B. Giangiacomo K.M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 676-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, all smooth muscle membrane preparations possess an α subunit with a molecular mass of about 125 kDa. Since the membrane-bound α subunit displays a higher apparent molecular mass, experiments were performed to address this discrepancy. For these studies, membrane-bound or partially purified maxi-K channels were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunostained with anti-α(421-435). After subjecting the bovine tracheal smooth muscle α subunit to solubilization and purification as previously outlined(5Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B. Giangiacomo K.M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 676-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the staining pattern remains unchanged up to and including the third purification step, which corresponds to ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q ion exchange column (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). However, after the fourth purification step, which employs a hydroxylapatite column, the α subunit undergoes significant proteolytic decay (Fig. 4, lane 3). Identical results were obtained with antiα(459-475) (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). At this stage, maxi-K channels have been purified almost 100-fold when compared to the digitonin-solubilized starting material. A significant part of the 125-kDa full-length α subunit is proteolyzed into two distinct α subunit core fragments of ˜65 kDa (α65) and ˜90 kDa (α90), which are clearly recognized by anti-α(421-435). The specificity of this antibody is indicated by the fact that 1 μM of the corresponding antigenic peptide virtually abolished the immunostaining reaction (Fig. 4, lane 4). Depending on the scale of the purification, up to 30% of the full-length maxi-K channel α subunit (α125) remains unproteolyzed. The reason for this reproducible but incomplete proteolysis is not well understood at the present time. To investigate whether proteolysis occurs at either the N- or the C-terminal domain of the α subunit, a sequence-directed antibody (anti-α(28-40)) raised against the predicted first 13 N-terminal residues of the protein was employed in immunoblots. The same proteolysis pattern detected with antiα(421-435) can also be demonstrated with anti-α(28-40) (Fig. 5, lane 1), indicating that all α subunit core fragments (α125, α90, and α65) possess a common N terminus. This suggests that proteolysis occurs within the long C-terminal tail domain of Slo. To narrow the site of proteolysis within the α subunit, several other antibodies directed against synthetic maxi-K channel peptides were employed (see Fig. 1). The immunostaining pattern of anti-α(693-710) reveals that only the core fragments α125 and α90 contain the recognition sequence for this antibody, but α65 is not detected (Fig. 5). A staining pattern that is virtually identical is obtained by employing anti-α(791-805) (data not shown). However, fragments of molecular masses between 45 and 50 kDa (α‘48) are detected by anti-α(693-710) (Fig. 5) and by anti-α(913-926) (Fig. 5; see below). Given that all protein sequences obtained from the purified 60-70-kDa α subunit are identical to those present in Slo (14Knaus H.-G. Garcia-Calvo M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3921-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the most downstream fragment identified corresponds to position 635-640 of mSlo, the α subunit core fragment α65 must extend, at least, to this sequence. These data narrow the site of the proteolytic cleavage that generates α65 to a stretch of residues starting at position 640 and ending at position 690, since anti-α(693-710) does not recognize α65, even though this antibody is clearly capable of staining the full-length α subunit as well as α90 (Fig. 5). Therefore, fragment α′48 must account for the difference in molecular mass between α65 and α125 and represents the remaining C terminus derived from the full-length α subunit. In addition to α′48, a doublet of proteolytic tail fragments with molecular masses of ˜22 and ˜25 kDa (α‘23) are also detected by anti-α(693-710) (Fig. 5). Among all the antibodies employed in this study, only anti-α(693-710) is capable of detecting this 23-kDa doublet fragment derived from the tail domain of Slo. Therefore, these fragments must possess exclusively the recognition sequence for this antibody, and their origin can only be explained by the fact that they account for the difference in molecular mass between α90 and α65 (Fig. 7). Inspection of the mslo coding sequence for the position of putative splice sites reveals that splice site A should be located within fragment α′23. To characterize the second site of proteolysis (α125→α90), experiments were performed with anti-α(913-926) and anti-α(978-992). These antibodies detect the full-length α subunit, α125, but neither of the core fragments, α90 or α65 (Figure 5:, Figure 6:), implying that the smaller fragments lack recognition sites for these antibodies. In addition to the full-length α subunit, two proteolytic tail fragments with molecular masses of ˜45-50 kDa (α‘48) and a doublet fragment of ˜27 and ˜29 kDa (α‘28) are also detected by these antibodies (Fig. 5 and 6). α′48 very likely is identical to the fragment previously stained by anti-α(693-710) (see above). Given the characteristic staining pattern and the molecular mass of this fragment, it could account for the difference in molecular mass between α125 and α65 and should possess as its N terminus residues between 640-690. Furthermore, this fragment ought to contain the recognition sites for the antibodies anti-α(693-710), antiα(913-926), and anti-α(978-992) and extend to the C terminus of the tissue-expressed Slo, which should be located close to residue 1100. The newly detected doublet fragment, α′28, can clearly be resolved into two individual peptide species. They exhibit a sequence recognized only by anti-α(913-926) and anti-α(978-992) and, therefore, originate with high likelihood from the very C-terminal end of the α subunit. This would account for the difference in molecular mass between the full-length α subunit, α125, and the larger core fragment, α90. The position of splice site B should also be contained within this fragment. Keeping in mind that the N terminus is intact and that the overall molecular mass of the full-length subunit is 125 kDa, the second proteolytic fragmentation must occur approximately at residue 850 of mSlo. This would explain the observed molecular masses of both α90 and α′28. Although two incomplete proteolytic clips occur at position 640-690 and near position 850 of Slo to partially degrade the full-length α subunit and to generate α90, α65, and three smaller size tail fragments (α‘48, α′28, and α′23), the maxi-K channel subunit complex remains tightly associated for three additional purification steps after the hydroxylapatite column (two sucrose density gradients and an additional ion exchange chromatographic step(5Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B. Giangiacomo K.M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 676-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This proteolytic cleavage is not paralleled by any significant decay in receptor density or change in the resulting pharmacological profile of the purified receptor(5Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B. Giangiacomo K.M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 676-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, all fragments remain associated as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). The association of the fragments with the maxi-K channel core likely occurs through disulfide bonding (data not shown). All generated fragments possess several cysteine residues through which such bonding to the core fragment could occur. It will be interesting to investigate the disulfide bonding between different extra- or intracellular loops of the native channel protein in further detail, taking advantage of the well defined pattern of proteolysis that is produced during purification procedures. In the present study, we have characterized for the first time the maxi-K channel α subunit as expressed in several smooth muscle membrane preparations, as well as in skeletal muscle T-tubule and GH3 membranes, by employing a battery of site-directed antibodies. An overall molecular mass of 125 kDa was detected for all tissue-expressed α subunits, which is in agreement with the predicted molecular mass from translation of the open reading frame of the cDNA-encoding maxi-K channels. Immunoblotting data indicate that the N terminus of the α subunit is intact and that the C terminus of α125 must be located near position 1100 of the predicted mSlo sequence. In this study, we have also demonstrated that the α subunit of the maxi-K channel undergoes partial proteolytic decay upon purification. This occurs at the fourth purification step, which corresponds to chromatography upon a hydroxylapatite column. The reproducibility in size of the proteolytic breakdown products and their relative abundance appears to be highly consistent when preparations from individual purifications were monitored. The putative protease causing this proteolytic degradation may therefore co-chromatograph with smooth muscle maxi-K channels through DEAE-Sepharose, wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and Mono-Q ion exchange chromatographies. However, no significant decay of the α subunit can be detected until the hydroxylapatite purification step. It is possible that the conformation of the maxi-K channel is altered during this step in such a way that previously masked sites become accessible to the protease. At this moment, we favor the hypothesis that the α subunit possesses distinct recognition sites for what may be a Ca2+-activated protease that copurifies with the maxi-K channel through three purification steps. Immobilization of the maxi-K channel on a hydroxylapatite column either exposes these cleavage sites to this protease and/or activates the protease in the presence of the high Ca2+ found on this chromatography matrix. Moreover, the proteolytic cleavage is never complete, which could be explained by either rapid separation of the protease from the partially purified maxi-K channel preparation on the hydroxylapatite column or inactivation of the enzyme due to a fast increase of the phosphate concentration employed for elution of protein from the column. None of the proteolytic tail fragments that are observed seem to be formed by a single peptide species (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). In essentially all experiments, the bands in a Western analysis appear to be a well resolved doublet with a shadow on the trailing edge. This phenomena could be explained by multiple proteolytic cleavages within close proximity to each other but could more likely be explained by the presence of tissue-expressed splice variants of Slo. This observation is consistent with the fact that both putative splice sites are known to be located within the tail fragments α′48, α′28, and α′23 that result from proteolytic processing (Fig. 7). These splice variants would differ by just 2-3 kDa in molecular mass(8Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 10Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and the reason for not resolving them as part of the full-length α subunit is explained by the inferior resolution of SDS-PAGE in the high molecular mass range. However, the separation of distinct polypeptide species improves as lower molecular mass fragments are generated (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). All the resulting proteolytic fragments appear to remain associated with the maxi-K channel subunit complex, indicating that a tight interaction must be present. This interaction is probably the result of bonding of the fragments via disulfide bridges to the α subunit core fragments, since only a full-length α subunit is observed when the samples are separated on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (data not shown). Additional membrane-spanning segments (S7-S10) have been suggested by hydropathic analysis of Slo. All α subunit tail fragments harbor at least one of the additional putative transmembrane segments S7-S10. To conclusively prove the proposed transmembrane topology of Slo, further in vitro labeling studies employing these sequence-directed antibodies are required. The maxi-K channel α subunit of bovine aortic smooth muscle tissue has recently been cloned(11Moss G.W.J. Marshall J. Morabito M. Moczydlowski E.G. Howe J. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 29Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It displays an extremely high degree of homology with mSlo (8Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and hSlo(10Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), but appears to possess 56 less residues than mSlo at its C terminus. Thus, species-specific splice variants could account for the slight difference in the observed molecular mass between the tissue-expressed α subunit and the in vitro translation product of mslo. Moreover, splice variants of the maxi-K channel may have different biophysical and biochemical properties, and this could have functional consequences for the regulation or physiological function of the channel in various target tissues. These alternatively spliced constructs differ significantly in their single channel properties, such as kinetics of activation or single channel conductance, and Ca2+ sensitivity(8Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 10Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), but all show very slow inactivation over a millisecond time range. Thus, alternative RNA splicing and, perhaps, association with other accessory subunits could contribute to the diversity of Slo channels in general Drs.

Although the N-terminal region of pRb may also mediate interaction with some proteins, no such protein has been identified yet. We demonstrated previously the in vivo protein association between pRb and 73-kDa heat shock cognate protein (hsc73) in certain human tumor cell lines. In this report we analyzed the interaction between these two proteins in vitro. Our data showed that hsc73 interacts with the novel N-terminal region of pRb; that is, pRb binds directly to hsc73 and dissociates from hsc73 in an ATP-dependent manner. By using deletion mutants of cDNA encoding pRb, the hsc73 binding site of pRb was determined to be located in the region (residues 301-372) outside the so-called A pocket (residues 373-579) of this tumor suppressor protein. This finding was compatible with the fact that the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein, which is known to bind to the E2F binding pocket region of pRb, could not compete with hsc73 for the binding. Furthermore, phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibited the binding of pRb to hsc73.

Takahashi S. Sagae S. Sato N. Kikuchi K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1702-1705PubMed Google Scholar). We further analyzed the molecular interaction and mapped the hsc73 binding region of pRb. In this report we show that hsc73 can bind directly to an N-terminal region outside the pockets (residues 301-372 adjacent to the N-terminal boundary of the A pocket) and that phosphorylation of pRb inhibits this association in vitro and perhaps in vivo. 73-kDa heat shock cognate protein mycobacterial 65-kDa heat shock protein human 90-kDa heat shock protein monoclonal antibody(ies) dithiothreitol glutathione S-transferase 3-[(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. A plasmid p4.95BT (from Dr. T. P. Dryja, Harvard Medical School) was digested with BssHII and HindIII. The resultant 4.1-kilobase fragment, which contained the entire pRb coding region, was purified from an agarose gel. The termini of the fragment were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and then ligated to the SmaI site of the pAcYM1 vector(17Matsuura Y. Possee R.D. Overton H.A. Bishop D.H.L. J. Gen.

Purification of pRb was done by column chromatography using phosphocellulose (stepwise elution with 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 M NaCl), heparin-Sepharose (stepwise elution with 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 M NaCl), and Q-Sepharose (stepwise elution with 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 M NaCl). Fractions containing pRb were determined by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Western blotting as described in a previous paper. 2Saijo, M., Sakai, Y., Kishino, T., Niikawa, N., Matsuura, Y., Morino, K., Tamai, K., and Taya, Y.(1995) Genomics27, 511-519.

Anti-hsp90 AC88 mAb was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. A mixture of 0.05 nmol of pRb and 0.05 nmol of hsc73 was incubated for 1 h at 25°C in the presence of 20 μl of buffer 1 (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT). Immobilized mAb beads were prepared as described previously(16Nihei T. Takahashi S. Sagae S. Sato N. Kikuchi K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1702-1705PubMed Google Scholar). About 1 μg of GST fusion protein was incubated with an excess amount of hsc73 in the conditions described above. The mAb beads and glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with the protein mixture at 4°C overnight in 400 μl of buffer 2 (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% CHAPS, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.2 IU/ml aprotinin, 5 mM EDTA), followed by washing five times with CHAPS in a washing buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS, 0.2 M Tris-HCl, and 0.5 M NaCl at pH 8.0. 75 μl of SDS sample buffer (final, 3% SDS, 5 M DTT, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)) was added to the beads containing the immune complexes, and the mixture was then boiled for 5 min. The supernatants were run on an 8% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were Western blotted to the Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking nonspecific binding of proteins to the membrane with 10% skim milk at room temperature for 2 h, mAbs at appropriate dilutions were reacted at room temperature for 1.5 h. The membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 and phosphate-buffered saline and were reacted for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM (H+L) diluted at 1:1,000. The band detection was performed by developing for 15-30 s with ECL detection reagents (RPN2105, Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 mM ATP, ADP, or ATPγS (Boehringer Mannheim) was added into the pRb and hsc73 protein mixture in 20 μl of buffer 3 (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM DTT) followed by incubation at 37°C for 30 min. The mAb beads were then incubated with the protein mixture in 400 μl of buffer 4 (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% CHAPS, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.2 IU/ml aprotinin, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2) including a 10 mM concentration of ATP, ADP, or ATPγS at 4°C overnight. The beads were washed five times with CHAPS washing buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Plasmid p4.95BT described above was digested by the restriction enzymes, and each of the deleted cDNAs was cloned in-frame with GST into expression vector pGT, a derivative of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GST-del Rb1-300 construct lacks amino acids 301-928 between two EcoRI restriction sites. GST-del Rb1-514 construct lacks animo acids 515-928 between NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites. GST-del Rb301-514 construct is made between EcoRI and NcoI restriction sites and lacks amino acids 1-300 and 515-928. GST-del Rb1-602 construct lacks animo acids 603-928 between PstI and EcoRI restriction sites. GST-del Rb373-928 was kindly provided by Dr. Hitoshi Matsushime (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan)(13Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of GST fusion protein were performed in the same manner as described by Smith and co-workers(23Smith D.B. Davern K.M. Board P.G. Tiu W.U. Garcia E.G. Mitchell G.F.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). 50-ml cultures of Escherichia coli (strain AD202 kindly provided by Dr. T. Saito, Chiba University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan) transformed with pGT-pRb deletions were diluted up to 500 ml with Luria-Bertani medium (LB) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, followed by incubation for 5 h at 37°C with shaking. After 2 h of incubation, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. For analysis of total bacterial protein content, aliquots of bacterial cultures were pelleted in microcentrifuge tubes, boiled in an SDS gel-loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For recovery of fusion proteins using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), bacterial cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and were resuspended in 40 ml of sonication buffer (100 ml Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 ml of EDTA, 0.5 ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml lysozyme). The pellets were then lysed on ice by a mild sonication followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Aliquots (1 ml) of supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. After the incubation the beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonspecific binding proteins. Purified pRb was incubated with 30 ng of purified cyclin-p34cdc2 complex (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 25°C for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM cold ATP, 10-30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, 3,000 Ci/mM). After the kinase reaction, purified hsc73 or E1A was added in the mixture, followed by incubation under the same condition as described previously. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described above. Radiolabeled pRb was visualized by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. We determined whether hsc73 could associate preferentially with nonphosphorylated pRb or/and hyperphosphorylated pRb. The cell lysates were reacted with 3a3 mAb, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted and detected by Mh-Rb-02P mAb as described above. As a positive control for hyperphosphorylated pRb in vivo as detected in SDS-PAGE, HOS cells were treated with 100 nM okadaic acid for 2 h at 37°C as described elsewhere(25Yatsunami J. Komori A. Ohta T. Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 239-241PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether hsc73 interacts directly with pRb we tested the ability of purified hsc73 to bind to purified pRb in vitro. Intact pRb was produced using the baculovirus system and purified by several steps of column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1A (lane 1), staining of with Coomassie Brilliant Blue demonstrated only one band corresponding to approximately 110 kDa in molecular size, indicating a high purity (>98.0%) of pRb preparation. Then the mixture of this purified pRb and hsc73 was subjected to immunoprecipitation. pRb was immunoprecipitated with anti-pRb mAb (Mh-Rb-02P), resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-pRb mAb or anti-hsc73 mAb. As shown in Fig. 1B, anti-pRb mAb precipitated pRb having a molecular mass of 110 kDa (lane 1). Anti-hsc73 mAb (3a3) detected a 73-kDa protein in the pRb immunoprecipitates (lane 4). Thus, purified hsc73 appeared to be coprecipitated with purified pRb. To confirm further the direct association of these proteins, hsc73 was precipitated with anti-hsc73 mAb and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-pRb mAb (lane 2) or anti-hsc73 mAb (lane 5). Coimmunoprecipitation of pRb with hsc73 was also observed (lane 2). As a negative control, we used an isotype-matched 109 mAb (IgG1) that reacts to 86-kDa antigen. 109 mAb could not form immune complexes with hsc73 or pRb (lanes 3 and 6). Since the in vivo hsc73-pRb complex recovered from cell lysates had been proven previously to be dissociated in the presence of ATP(16Nihei T. Takahashi S. Sagae S. Sato N. Kikuchi K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1702-1705PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brown C.R. Martin R.L. Hansen W.J. Beckmann R.P. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we tested the ATP-dependent dissociation of the complex formed in vitro with purified proteins. An equal molar ratio of pRb and hsc73 was mixed, followed by the addition of ATP, ADP, or ATPγS. Then the immunoprecipitates made with anti-pRb mAb were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hsc73 mAb. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of ATP resulted in the dissociation of hsc73 from the complex (lane 3). Furthermore, it is noted that the addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγs resulted in considerable dissociation of the complex (lane 5). In contrast, ADP could not dissociate hsc73 from the complex (lane 4). There was no difference in the concentration of ATP required for the dissociation between the complex formed in vivo(25Yatsunami J. Komori A. Ohta T. Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 239-241PubMed Google Scholar) and that formed in vitro with purified proteins. Considering that heat shock protein families act as molecular chaperones for various proteins, other families of hsp may interact with pRb. To assess the specificity of the protein interaction between hsc73 and pRb, an equal molar ratio of purified m65hsp and purified hsp90 was used for the coimmunoprecipitation experiment. Specific mAbs, anti-m65hsp mAb (B97) and anti-hsp90 mAb (3B6), were used to detect these hsps in immunoblotting. These mAbs were shown to detect the specific hsps having compatible molecular masses in the immunoblotting (Fig. 3, lanes 8-10). Using the condition in which hsc73 (lane 5) was coprecipitated with pRb, neither m65hsp (lane 6) nor hsp90 (lane 7) was detected in pRb immunoprecipitates. These data suggest that the protein interaction of hsc73 and pRb is specific among hsp families. To determine the hsc73 binding site in pRb, we assessed the ability of purified hsc73 to bind a series of GST fusion proteins containing different deletion mutants of pRb. The five different deletion mutants prepared contained the N-terminal 300 amino acids (GST-del Rb1-300), 514 amino acids (GST-del Rb1-514), 602 amino acids (GST-del Rb1-602), 213 amino acids (GST-del Rb301-514), and the C-terminal 555 amino acids (GST-del Rb373-928) of pRb (Fig. 4C). Anti-pRb mAb (Mh-Rb-02P) reacting with amino acids 300-380 of pRb could detect estimated molecules of pRb deletion mutants (Fig. 4A, arrow in lanes 1 and 3-5). GST-del Rb1-300 was detected by mAb (G99-2005) reacting with amino acids 1-240 of pRb (Fig. 4A, arrow in lane 2). Although there was a possibility that an 88-kDa band (Fig. 4A, arrow in lane 5) of GST-del Rb373-928 may overlap nonspecific bands with Mh-Rb-02P mAb seen in Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 3, and 4, we confirmed the successful production of GST-del Rb373-928 by using G99-549 mAb that reacts with pRb 514-610 amino acids (Fig. 4A, lane 7). These GST-del Rb mutant proteins were incubated with an excess amount of hsc73, followed by precipitation using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were run on 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hsc73 mAb. As shown in Fig. 4B, hsc73 was not detected in the precipitates of GST-del Rb1-300 and GST-del Rb373-928 (lanes 4 and 7, respectively), whereas it could be detected in the precipitates of GST-del Rb301-514, GST-del Rb1-514, and GST-del Rb1-602 (lanes 3, 5, and 6, respectively). These data suggest that hsc73 may interact with a region containing the N-terminal nonpocket region of 72 amino acids (residues 301-372) adjacent to the N-terminal boundary of the A pocket in pRb as summarized in Fig. 4C. The possibility of hsc73 binding to the pocket regions was excluded by way of a competition experiment. Viral oncoprotein E1A is known to bind to so-called A/B pockets of pRb (Fig. 4C)(3Hu Q. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ewen M.E. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3761-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We tested whether purified E1A protein could compete with hsc73 for binding to pRb in vitro. pRb was immunoprecipitated from the mixture of equal molar amounts of purified hsc73 and purified pRb in the presence or absence of the same molar amounts of purified E1A protein, then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hsc73 mAb. As shown in Fig. 5, pRb could form a complex with hsc73 independent of the presence of E1A protein. The amount of hsc73 coprecipitated with pRb did not differ between the absence (Fig. 5, lane 1) and presence (lane 2) of E1A. Furthermore, the amount of E1A protein coprecipitated with pRb did not differ between the presence (lane 4) and absence (lane 5) of hsc73. These data indicate that hsc73 can associate with pRb in a region distinct from the E1A binding region, suggesting the interaction of hsc73 with the nonpocket region of pRb. Since all of the known pRb-binding proteins can associate only with the nonphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated form of pRb, we analyzed the phosphorylation dependence of the hsc73-pRb physical protein association. Although pRb preparations used in the current experiments appear to contain a weak endogenous kinase activity (Fig. 6A, lane 1), pRb could be phosphorylated efficiently by exogenously added cyclin-p34cdc2 kinase complex in vitro in the presence of ATP (lane 2). Hsc73 was not phosphorylated at all (lanes 3 and 4). Then, we tested the coprecipitation of hsc73 or E1A protein with pRb phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase in vitro (Fig. 6B, lanes 1, 4, and 7). As a nonphosphorylation control, two cases were prepared: pRb and p34cdc2 kinase without ATP (lanes 3, 6, and 9), and pRb and ATP without p34cdc2 kinase (lanes 2, 5, and 8). Samples were incubated with hsc73 or E1A protein followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-pRb mAb and immunoblotting with anti-hsc73 mAb or anti-E1A protein mAb. Both hsc73 and E1A were detected in the pRb precipitates where pRb was not phosphorylated (lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9), whereas neither hsc73 nor E1A could be detected in the sample where pRb was hyperphosphorylated (lanes 4 and 7). We further confirmed that hsc73 could associate preferentially in vivo with the nonphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated form of pRb. Since it was shown previously that okadaic acid treatment could phosphorylate pRb in vivo(25Yatsunami J. Komori A. Ohta T. Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 239-241PubMed Google Scholar), we treated HOS cells with this agent and obtained the phosphorylated from of pRb (Fig. 7, lane 1). In contrast, HOS cells without okadaic acid treatment showed a rather broad band corresponding to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated pRb (lane 2). Then we made the immunoprecipitates with 3a3 mAb and HOS cell lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted and analyzed by Mh-Rb-02P mAb. As shown in Fig. 7, lane 3, it appeared that hsc73 could associate preferentially only with nonphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated pRb. These in vitro and in vivo data indicate that hsc73 can interact with the nonphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated form but not with hyperphosphorylated form of pRb, suggesting that there might be a regulatory mechanism of the molecular interaction similar to that of other pRb-binding proteins such as viral oncoproteins and transcription factors. It is speculated that hsc73 may dissociate from the pRb complex following pRb phosphorylation by cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinases during cell cycle progression. pRb plays an important role in regulating the cell cycle by interacting with some nuclear proteins. The regions of pRb mediating protein interactions have been identified. The region in pRb which mediates the interaction with transcriptional factor E2F is located in the C-terminal region containing regions referred to as A/B pockets (residues 373-771) (7Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) and is necessary in the growth-suppressive function of pRb(8Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 9Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several viral oncoproteins can bind to the pocket region and block the binding of pRb to E2F, resulting in an uncontrolled transcriptional activation and cellular transformation. Nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase was also shown to interact with pRb(15Welch J.W. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Unlike viral oncoproteins, the c-Abl binding region of pRb has been mapped to the C-terminal region downstream from the pockets. In this complex, pRb appeared to regulate the kinase activity of c-Abl during the cell cycle. We have reported previously that one of the 70-kDa heat shock protein families, hsc73, could interact with pRb in vivo(16Nihei T. Takahashi S. Sagae S. Sato N. Kikuchi K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1702-1705PubMed Google Scholar). Our present data showed that hsc73 could interact directly with pRb in vitro and that the interaction was specific since neither hsp90 nor m65hsp could associate with pRb. The mapping of the hsc73 binding site of pRb revealed a novel region within the N-terminal region upstream from the pockets. The binding of hsc73 to pRb was unaffected by the viral oncoprotein E1A, suggesting that there might be a different biological role for this interaction. Protein interactions depend on the unique amino acid motif to interact with each other specifically. BiP, the sole member of the hsp70 families localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cell, is known to recognize polypeptides that contain a heptameric motif best described as HyXHyXHyXHy, where Hy is a large hydrophobic amino acid and X is any amino acid(27Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 301-372 amino acid residues outside the A/B pocket of pRb contain this heptameric motif (residues 331-337). Since the substrate binding domains of BiP and hsc73 are suggested to have the identical structure, it can be speculated that hsc73 binds to pRb by recognizing this motif. We need to consider one other possible explanation for deletion mutant binding studies. Members of the hsp70 family appear capable of recognizing “nonnative” form of proteins(28Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consequently one could argue that the differential binding observed in this study simply represents mutants that have folded either into a native or nonnative-like configuration. Indeed this is a problem that will always have to be considered regarding proteins that bind stably to members of the molecular chaperone family. However, in this present study we showed that all deletion mutants that contain pRb301-372 could bind to hsc73, whereas no deletion mutants lacking this region could bind to hsc73. It is highly unlikely that all mutant proteins that contain pRb301-372 become nonnative or malfolded proteins and consequently bind to hsc73 and vice versa. Therefore, our present studies strongly indicate that the primary pRb 301-372 sequence is important for binding to hsc73. Meanwhile, we also have to mention the stoichiometry or affinity of the pRb and hsc73 interaction. One of the key observations is presented in Fig. 4B on the interaction between hsc73 and a specific region of pRb. In these experiments, 1 μg of the various GST-del Rb constructs is incubated with 1-2 μg of hsc73 and the complexes detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Lane 1 of Fig. 4B corresponds to the input amount of hsc73, therefore comparison with the other lanes gives some indication of the stoichiometry or affinity of pRb and hsc73 interaction. It is indicated that some of the bands are very weak (lane 6). This could be interpreted that the interaction is either of low affinity, that the GST-del Rb proteins are heterogeneous resulting in reduced stoichiometry, or that it is a malfolded subpopulation of the GST-del Rb proteins which interacts with hsc73. Further experiments are required to clarify each of these possibilities. It is known that hsp families act as molecular chaperones(29White E. Spector D. Welch W. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4153-4166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Hsp70 families can associate physically with various intracellular proteins and work for the regulation of conformational changes, translocation, and stabilization of these proteins. Although the functional significance of hsp70 families for cell growth or malignant transformation has not been clarified yet, it has been reported that overexpression of hsc73 could suppress oncogene-mediated transformation (31Yehiely F. Oren M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is speculated that hsc73 can function as a tumor suppressor in the process of transformation and that this function may be mediated by the pRb through their physical association. Hsc73 may change the conformation of pRb so that pRb becomes resistant to phosphorylation since phosphorylation of pRb results in the dissociation of the pRb-E2F complex and the loss of the growth-suppressive effect. We tested the susceptibility of pRb to phosphorylation in vitro by p34cdc2 kinase in the presence of hsc73. However, there was no change in the pRb phosphorylation (data not shown). It is noteworthy that another tumor suppressor, p53, is also associated with hsc73 (32Pinhasi-Kimhi O. Michalovitz D. Bin-Zeev A.

Commun. 1992; 184: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is speculated alternatively that hsc73 may stabilize the nonphosphorylated or the hypophosphorylated pRb and extend its half-life in a manner analogous to that of mutant p53. None of the pRb-binding proteins has been shown to bind to hyperphosphorylated pRb so far. Unexceptionally, hsc73 could not interact with the hyperphosphorylated form of pRb, suggesting a regulatory mechanism of the hsc73-pRb interaction similar to that of other pRb-binding proteins. It has been shown that pRb can be phosphorylated at several serine or threonine residues in various regions. The hsc73 binding region also includes at least two threonine residues, which could become a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase(37Taya Y. Yasuda H. Kamijo M. Nakaya K. Nakamura Y. Ohba Y.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), indicating that the dissociation might depend on the direct phosphorylation of the binding region rather than on the conformational change following phosphorylation of other regions. Interestingly, the hsc73-pRb complex could be disrupted by the addition of a high concentration of ATP. ADP could not induce the disruption efficiently, suggesting that the dissociation might be mediated by ATP hydrolysis by hsc73. However, as shown in Fig. 2, lane 5, we noted that the addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγs did in fact result in considerable dissociation of the complex. This may be consistent with work by Palleros et al.(41Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.L. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is ATP exchange rather than ATP hydrolysis. Finally, two important questions remain to be answered. What is the biological significance of the formation of the hsc73-pRb complex? What is the functional significance of the ATP-dependent disruption of the complex in the cell cycle? Gene transfer experiments using mutant hsc73 or mutant pRb may help to resolve some of these questions. We thank Dr. K.

The yeast DnaJ homolog, YDJ1, has also been shown to interact with yeast hsp70, although the function of this interaction is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of YDJ1 with both yeast and bovine brain hsp70. We found that, in the presence of ATP, where hsp70 is normally monomeric, YDJ1 induced almost all of the yeast and bovine brain hsp70 to form large polymers, which are readily sedimentable. These polymers were much larger than the dimers and trimers of hsp70, which normally form in the presence of ADP. YDJ1 appeared to be acting catalytically since very little YDJ1 copolymerized with the hsp70, and maximum polymerization occurred at low ratios of YDJ1 to hsp70. The polymerization required ATP and was completely reversed when ATP was replaced by ADP. These data suggest that, in the presence of ATP, YDJ1 may present one hsp70 to another just as under other conditions DnaJ is able to present protein substrates to DnaK.

By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, we found that the breast cells also express HER3 and that the ovarian line co-expresses the HER4 message. A dramatic increase in the acidification rate was observed for the mammary carcinoma cells co-expressing high levels of HER2 and HER3. In contrast, the ovarian cells expressing high levels of HER2 and low levels of HER4 or CHO-K1 and 293-EBNA cells expressing HER2 alone were not responsive to heregulin. When these same transfected cells were exposed to monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody followed by anti-IgG to cause aggregation of the HER2 molecules, an increase in the acidification rate was observed, indicating coupling of transfected HER2 to the signal transduction pathway.

The dye was found largely on the surface of the cells when loaded at a concentration of 5 μM for 10 min at 37°C. Five minutes after introduction of EGTA, 83-95% fluorescence disappeared, indicating that most of the fluorophore was on the cell surface. Photobleaching was minimal (3-13%).

Under defined confocal laser scanning microscope settings, a transient fluorescence at the periphery of ∼30% of the cells was observed following 10−8M parathyroid hormone treatment, indicating the presence of outwardly directed calcium transport across the plasma membrane. Calcium efflux usually lasted 7-10 min, peaking at around 2-3 min. Changes in cell shape were also observed.

Whereas pyrimidine dimer formation in the core region of the nucleosome occurred with peaks at approximately 10-nucleotide intervals as previously reported, the distribution of pyrimidine dimers through the linker region was nearly uniform. This distinction between core and linker DNA was found to be independent of linker length over a range of 38-60 nucleotides. Because there is now ample evidence that DNA curvature is the source of the peaks of pyrimidine dimer formation in the core region, the uniform distribution of pyrimidine dimers observed in the linker region indicates that linker DNA is relatively straight.

The possibility that the MPC might be involved in antigen processing was suggested by observations that two genes, LMP7 and LMP 2, located in the MHC class II region code for low molecular weight proteins having amino acid sequences closely similar to some MPC subunits(17Brown M.G. Driscoll J. Monaco J.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 22Glynne R. Powis S.H. Beck S. Kelly A. Kerr L.-A. Trowsdale J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) stimulation of human cells was shown to lead to an increased expression of the LMP7 and LMP2 genes, with the products apparently replacing two highly homologous subunits X and Y (the latter also referred to as subunit δ)(29Früh K. Gossen M. Wang K. Bujard H. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Akiyama K. Kagawa S. Tamura T. Shimbara N. Takashina M. Kristensen P.

Med. 1994; 179: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), respectively. Incorporation of these subunits into the MPC was suggested to generate so called “immunoproteasomes” (33Tanaka K. J. Leuk. Biol. 1994; 56: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that could represent a proteasomal subpopulation capable of more efficiently processing protein antigens into the short 8 to 9 amino acid-containing peptides that are transferred to class I molecules encoded by the MHC for presentation on the cell surface to cytotoxic lymphocytes. Since the majority of peptides generated during antigen processing contain hydrophobic or basic amino acid residues at the COOH terminus, support for the above hypothesis could have been anticipated to come from experiments showing that cells stimulated by IFN-γ would show an increase in expression of the ChT-L and T-L activities of the MPC. Indeed, reports that stimulation of lymphoblastic and mononuclear cell lines in culture by IFN-γ leads to an increase in the rate of cleavage of bonds after hydrophobic and basic residues (34Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) in synthetic peptide substrates, and to similar activity increases in LMP7 gene transfection experiments(35Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Spies T. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), seemed to support this possibility. However, a subsequent study of the effect of exposure of the same cell lines to IFN-γ failed to detect any effect on the ChT-L and T-L activities of the MPC(36Ustrell V. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, exposure of mouse fibroblast cells to IFN-γ was reported to decrease rather than increase the ChT-L activity and to have no effect on the T-L activity(32Boes B. Hengel H. Ruppert T. Multhaup G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.-M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We report here that the contents of LMP7 and BO2 subunits (the latter identical with X) differs markedly in MPCs isolated from bovine lung, pituitary, and liver and that marked changes are also detected in the catalytic profile of complexes isolated from the three organs. Thus, the concentration of LMP7 was found to be greatly increased in the lung compared with that in the liver and pituitary, and this increase was associated with a decrease in the concentration of subunit BO2. Changes in the catalytic profile of MPCs isolated from lung and liver involved a moderate depression of the ChT-L, T-L, PGPH, and SNAAP activities, and a prominent activation of the BrAAP activity with an increase in affinity (lowering of Km) toward substrates containing branched chain amino acid residues in the P1 position. The possible significance of these changes for antigen processing is discussed. Fresh frozen bovine pituitaries, bovine lungs, and bovine livers were obtained from Pel Freeze Inc. (Rogers, AR). Isolation of the MPC from the three tissues was carried out according to a previously described procedure(37Orlowski M. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9270-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After the last purification step the enzyme was stored frozen at −20°C in 0.5-ml aliquots, containing 0.5-1.0 mg protein/ml, and thawed before being used in experiments. HPLC showed that all three preparations contained only the protein subunits of the MPC, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under non-dissociating and dissociating conditions showed about a 95% purity of all three preparations. Substrates for determination of the activity of the five components of the MPC were synthesized as described previously(4Dahlmann B. Kopp F. Kuehn L. Niedel B. Pfeifer G. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 5Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W.

The ChT-L, T-L, and PGPH activities were measured with synthetic substrates Z-GGL-pNA Z-(D)ALR-2NA and Z-LLE-2NA respectively as described previously(8Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 37Orlowski M. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9270-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because of the limited solubility of the first two substrates determination of Km and Vmax values for the ChT-L and T-L activities were carried out with Z-GGF-pAB and Z-GGKR-2NA, respectively, as the substrates. Determination of the activities of the BrAAP and SNAAP components were carried out in a coupled enzyme assay in the presence of excess aminopeptidase N as described previously(7Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Specific activities are expressed as the number of micromole of substrate degraded/milligram protein/hour. DCI (final concentration 20 μM) was preincubated at 26°C with pituitary MPC (0.5 mg protein/ml) in 0.01 M Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the preincubation mixture (5 μg of protein) were transferred at various times to reaction mixtures at 37°C for measurements of residual ChT-L activity, as described above. For measurements of rate constants of BO2 disappearance, aliquots of the incubation mixture containing 25 μg of protein were withdrawn at different times and treated with 10 μmol of dithiothreitol to inactivate DCI, and then subjected to HPLC as described below. Rate constants of disappearance of BO2 were calculated by measuring the decrease of the BO2 peak after HPLC separation of MPC subunits, and integration of the area under the peaks, or by measuring the decrease in peak height in relation to controls. Separations of MPC subunits in 0.05-0.2 ml of MPC containing 0.5 mg protein/ml were carried out on a C4 Deltapak protein column (5 μ, 3.9 × 150 mm, 300 Å) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient established between CH3CN containing 0.1% CF3COOH and a 0.1% aqueous solution of CF3COOH. The initial concentration of acetonitrile was 38%, and its concentration was increased to 55% during 65 min. Emerging peaks were monitored at an absorbance of 210 nm. The area under the peaks was integrated using a CR601 Shimadzu integrator (Kyoto, Japan). PAGE was carried out under denaturing conditions in the presence of SDS in a Hoeffer Scientific vertical slab gel electrophoresis apparatus at a gel thickness of 1.5 mm. A discontinuous buffer system was used (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with the separating gels (10%) and buffers containing 0.1% SDS. Samples of the isolated complex containing 20 μg of protein were treated with 1% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and applied to the top of the gels after boiling for 5 min. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride sequencing membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was carried out as described(39Towbin H.S. Staehelin J. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar, 40Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 112: 195-203Crossref Scopus (5927) Google Scholar) using a Trans-Blott electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). 50 μl of MPC (1 mg protein/ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was treated with 1.0 μl of 1 mM DCI in Me2SO. The reaction was terminated after 10 min by addition of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 1% SDS. Equal amounts of the DCI-treated and native MPC treated only with 2-mercaptoethanol and SDS were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide as described above. Staining was with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The detection of LMP7 in isolated preparations of pituitary, lung, and liver MPC preparations was carried out by immunoblotting, using a specific antiserum directed toward a 15-amino acid COOH-terminal LMP7 peptide, TDVSDLLHQYREANQ, prepared as described previously (41Glynne R. Kerr L.-A. Mockridge I. Beck S. Kelly A. Trowsdale J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. R. Magnusson of this department. Blots were prepared as described above, and LMP7 was visualized using the above antiserum as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody. Conjugates were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For amino acid sequencing, subunits of the MPC separated by HPLC were manually collected and concentrated to a small volume by evaporation under reduced pressure and subjected to amino acid sequencing in a Porton Gas Phase Chromatograph (Beckman Instruments). Alternatively subunits were separated by PAGE under dissociating conditions and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands were excised and subjected to amino acid sequencing as above. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of equal amounts of protein from MPC preparations obtained from pituitary, lung, and liver are shown in Fig. 1. About 14 different protein bands are clearly visible with the overall subunit pattern being similar in all three complexes. Nevertheless, closer inspection shows marked differences, both quantitative and qualitative, in the band patterns of the three complexes. The intensity of some bands is greater in the lung MPC (for example the slowest moving band), whereas some other bands show higher density either in the liver or in the pituitary. The structural and functional significance of these differences, with the exception of those discussed below, remains to be established. The fastest moving, somewhat diffuse band in the pituitary preparation was subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. The obtained 23 amino acid sequence RFSPYAFNGGTVLAIAGEDFSIV showed complete identity with the amino acid sequence of component C5 of the rat hepatoma proteasome(42Tamura T. Tanaka K. Kumatori A. Yamada F. Tsurumi C. Fujiwara T. Ichihara A. Tokunaga F. Aruga R. Iwanaga S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The second fastest moving band, more intense in the pituitary than in the lung and appearing in the liver as a doublet, was shown to correspond to the second peak eluting during HPLC of the MPC isolated from each of the three organs (Fig. 2). Because of its mobility in PAGE and HPLC, the component was designated as BO2 (BO referring to bovine). Identical NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were found for this component both when BO2 was isolated by HPLC and subjected to amino acid sequencing, or when the second fastest moving band in PAGE was blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and then subjected to sequencing (see below). A faint band, clearly visible in the lung but not in the pituitary complex, was identified by immunoblotting as corresponding to LMP7. Its identity with LMP7 was also confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing (see below and Table 1). This band was also visible on direct inspection in PAGE of the liver complex, but its intensity was fainter than that in the lung and is not visible in the photographic prints (Fig. 1). The quantitative differences in the amounts of LMP7 in the three preparations are clearly visible in immunoblots shown in Fig. 3. The intensity of the band in the lung is many times greater than that in the pituitary and also greater than in the liver. Densitometric scanning of the bands in immunoblots showed that the amount of LMP7 in the lung and liver was respectively 10 and 5 times greater than that in the pituitary MPC (for details see legend to Fig. 3, and “Material and Methods”).Figure 2:Subunit patterns obtained by HPLC from MPC preparations isolated from bovine pituitaries (panel A), lung (panel B), and liver (panel C).

Densitometric scanning of immunoblots was carried out in order to determine the relative amounts of LMP7 in the three MPC preparations. The photographic negative obtained during the chemiluminescence procedure was transilluminated with a light box and photographed with a Cohu video camera. The video image was captured on a MacIntosh computer as a digitized black and white image. Intensity of the bands on immunoblots was quantitated using the NIH Image program (version 1.53b), according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. This procedure showed that the amounts of LMP7 in the lung and liver were, respectively, 10 and 5 times greater than in the pituitary. The molecular mass of the LMP7 band is about 23 kDa as derived from the amino acid sequence of this subunit and its position in relation to the other MPC bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HPLC of MPC preparations results in dissociation of subunits of the complex and a reproducible separation of 13 peaks. When equal amounts of protein (25 μg) from each of the pituitary, lung, and liver MPCs were subjected to HPLC, the subunit patterns shown in Fig. 2 were obtained. Several quantitative differences in the patterns are clearly visible in the three preparations. The second well-separated peak (designated as BO2) was markedly higher in the pituitary than in either the lung or the liver. Integration of the areas under the peak in several preparations showed that the BO2 subunit in lung (panel B, in Fig. 2) amounted on average to only 60% of that present in the pituitary (panel A, Fig. 2), and that the corresponding amount in the liver (panel C, Fig. 2) constituted about 80% of that in the pituitary. When 0.5 mg of protein of pituitary MPC was separated by HPLC and the effluent containing the BO2 component was concentrated and subjected to amino-terminal sequencing, the sequence shown in Table 1 was obtained. An identical NH2-terminal sequence was obtained from the second fastest moving band in PAGE of the bovine lung MPC (Fig. 1). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the first 10 amino acids in both bands of the doublet visible in PAGE of the liver MPC were also identical with those of the lung, and the separation of the two bands could have resulted from small differences arising from post-translational modifications in the part of the protein, COOH-terminal to the sequences shown in Fig. 1. The NH2-terminal sequence of BO2 (Table 1) shows complete identity with sequences reported previously for human subunit X(43Akiyama K. Yokota K. Kagawa S. Shimbara N. Tamura T. Akioka H.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the complete amino acid sequence of BO2 and LMP7 showed that within a stretch of 204 amino acids 135 (66%) showed identity, and a considerable number of the remaining amino acids represented conservative replacements. Several lines of evidence indicate that BO2 is necessary for expression of the ChT-L activity of the MPC. Thus, the ChT-L activity is the only catalytic activity of the complex that was reported to be sensitive to inactivation by diisopropylfluorophosphate, and indeed two separate studies have reported incorporation of labeled DFP into this subunit (49Sato S. Shiratsuchi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 50Wagner B.J. Margolis J.W. Yin J. Cur.

Furthermore, the PRE2 gene encoding a subunit showing high homology to the BO2 and LMP7 sequences was shown to be necessary for expression of the ChT-L activity, since yeast pre2 mutants show very low ChT-L activity and accumulation in cells of ubiquitin-protein conjugates(48Heinemeyer W.

https://openalex.org/W2079144882,"We showed previously that replacement of Lys-145 in the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) with Asp resulted in an analog (IL-1ra K145D) with partial agonist activity. To identify additional amino acids that affect IL-1 bioactivity, we created second site mutations in IL-1ra K145D. Substitutions of single amino acids surrounding position 145 were made; none of these substitutions increased the bioactivity of IL-1ra K145D. However, the insertion of the β-bulge (QGEESN) of IL-1β at the corresponding region of IL-1ra K145D resulted in a 3-4-fold augmentation of bioactivity. An additional increase in agonist activity was observed when the β-bulge was coexpressed with a second substitution (His-54 → Pro) in IL-1ra K145D. We also show that the bioactivity of both IL-1ra K145D and the triple mutant IL-1ra K145D/H54P/QGEESN is dependent on interaction with the newly cloned IL-1 receptor accessory protein."

INTRODUCTIONXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) 1The abbreviations used are: XPxeroderma pigmentosumNERnucleotide excision repairCNScentral nervous systemPBSphosphate-buffered salinekbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)X-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactosidePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. is a human autosomal recessive disease characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light and a high incidence of skin cancer because of a defect in nucleotide excision repair (NER) (Cleaver and Kraemer, 1989). Complementation analyses by cell fusion between cells from XP patients have revealed seven complementation groups (A through G) and a variant form, representing different components that are thought to work together in NER. Five of the relevant genes (complementing XP-A, −B, −C, −D, and −G mutations) have been already identified (Tanaka et al., 1990; Weeda et al., 1990; Legerski and Peterson, 1992; Masutani et al., 1994; Flejter et al., 1992; O'Donovan and Wood, 1993; Scherly et al., 1993). Some of these have been shown to correspond to excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency (ERCC) genes, which are human genes that correct NER defects of a set of UV-sensitive rodent cell lines comprising 11 different complementation groups; the XPB gene is equivalent to the ERCC3 gene (Weeda et al., 1990), XPD to ERCC2 (Flejter et al., 1992), and XPG to ERCC5 (O'Donovan and Wood, 1993). Homologs of the XP and ERCC genes have been identified in many organisms, most notably in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A number of yeast radiation-sensitive mutants (rad) have been isolated, and some of the RAD genes are known to be the homologs; XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPG, and ERCC1 share extensive sequence homology at the protein level with RAD14 (Bankmann et al., 1992), RAD25/SSL2 (Park et al., 1992; Gulyas and Donahue, 1992), RAD4 (Legerski and Peterson, 1992; Masutani et al., 1994), RAD3 (Weber et al., 1990), RAD2 (Scherly et al., 1993), and RAD10 (van Duin et al., 1986), respectively. Therefore, the basic features of the NER mechanism are likely to be conserved among eukaryotes. Indeed, expression of the XPD gene in S. cerevisiae was reported to complement the lethality of a mutation in the RAD3 gene (Sung et al., 1993).XP patients manifest a wide variety of symptoms, the most characteristic of which is hypersensitivity to UV light and certain chemical mutagens. XP patients have a 2000-fold increased frequency of skin cancer upon UV exposure compared with the general population (Cleaver and Kraemer, 1989). Among the seven complementation groups, XP-A is the most severe form, and these patients exhibit a wide variety of neurologic abnormalities including microcephaly, progressive mental deterioration, ataxia, abnormal reflexes, and sensory deafness (Cleaver and Kraemer, 1989). The human XPA gene encodes a protein of 273 amino acids with a zinc-finger motif (Tanaka et al., 1990). Replacement of each of the 4 cysteine residues of the zinc-finger structure by serine or glycine resulted in loss of repair activity, indicating the functional importance of the motif (Miyamoto et al., 1992). The XPA protein binds to DNA with a preference for UV-irradiated over unirradiated DNA, suggesting that XPA functions as a key component in recognition of DNA damage during repair (Robins et al., 1991; Jones and Wood, 1993; Asahina et al., 1994).Recently, the haywire gene of Drosophila was found to encode a protein with 66% identity to that encoded by ERCC3, the human gene associated with XP-B (Mounkes et al., 1992; Koken et al., 1992). Flies compromised for haywire function display phenotypes including UV sensitivity, central nervous system (CNS) defects, ataxia, and lethality, suggesting that a Drosophila mutant defective in the function of a human XP homolog could be useful as an animal model of XP. Sophisticated genetic tools available in Drosophila should help in investigating the functions of XP genes.Previously, we cloned a Drosophila homolog of the human XPA gene (Dxpa) (Shimamoto et al., 1991). The Dxpa cDNA encodes a protein of 296 amino acids with 45% identity to that encoded by the human XPA gene. In this report, we show that the Dxpa protein is involved in NER both in vitro and in vivo. We also reveal that the Dxpa gene is expressed strongly in the CNS of Drosophila and determine the localization of the Dxpa gene to 3F6-8 on the X chromosome, where no mutant defective in NER has yet been reported.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Culture ConditionsThe cell lines Kc and C10 were derived from embryos and neurons, respectively, of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. The cell line mei-9 was derived from a Drosophila mutant defective in both meiosis (Baker and Carpenter, 1972) and NER (Boyd et al., 1976). Kc and C10, and mei-9 cell lines were kind gifts from Drs. Y. Miyake and R. Ueda (Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Science), respectively, and were maintained in M3 (BF) medium (Cross and Sang, 1978) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum. For culture of C10 cells, the medium was also supplemented with 10 μg/ml human insulin. WI38VA13 and XP12ROSV were derived from normal human fibroblasts and those from an XP-A patient, respectively, and were cultured in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Production and Affinity Purification of Anti-Dxpa Protein AntibodiesThe Dxpa coding sequence was amplified from the pUC Dxpa cloning vector by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-forward primer containing a BamHI site (5′-GGTCGGATCCAGATGTCTGCGGAGGTCTCTACCAACGAA-3′) and a 3′-reverse primer containing a BglII site (5′-TGACAGATCTCACTACATCTTCTCGTAGGTCTCGCTGTACGGA-3′). This facilitated its cloning into the bacterial expression vector pET-3c via the BamHI site. The recombinant protein starts with 13 amino acids (MASMTGGQQMGRI) derived from the vector, followed by the entire sequence of the Dxpa protein. The recombinant Dxpa protein was purified as described previously (Miura et al., 1991; Asahina et al. 1994). Rabbits were immunized with the protein, and the anti-Dxpa antibodies were then purified by affinity chromatography using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) coupled with the recombinant Dxpa protein.Immunoprecipitation of in Vitro Translated ProductspGEM Dxpa was generated by inserting the Dxpa cDNA HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the entire coding sequence into pGEM-7Zf(-). The plasmid pET-XPAH, which contains the full-length human XPA cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter, was kindly provided by Dr. H. Asahina (Kobe University) (Miura et al., 1991). These plasmids were cut with EcoRI, and in vitro transcription-translation reactions were carried out using SP6 RNA polymerase or T7 RNA polymerase and then rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Amersham Corp.) in the presence of methionine. Ten-μl aliquots of each lysate were incubated with 20 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit anti-Dxpa antibodies or control rabbit IgG in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% gelatin) for 30 min at 4°C, followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose 6MB (Pharmacia Biochem Inc.) for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 s. The pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer and suspended in sample buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.1 M dithiothreitol). After heating at 100°C for 2 min, samples were loaded onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and autoradiographed.ImmunoblottingCells (1 × 106) were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 2 mM EDTA containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatants were collected, and 20 μg of each sample was mixed with 15 μl of sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and separated as described above. The blots were probed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) using a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit anti-Dxpa serum as a primary antibody and a 1:20,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as a second antibody (Promega).Preparation of Whole-cell ExtractThe Kc cell line was grown at 25°C in 150-mm tissue culture plates (Falcon) and collected by gentle pipetting with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The harvested cells were washed with PBS, and whole-cell extract was prepared as described previously (Manley et al., 1980; Wood et al., 1988). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford(1976) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The extract contained 15 mg of protein/ml.Cell-free DNA Repair AssayThe assay was carried out as described previously (Sugasawa et al., 1993). The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 40 mM creatine phosphate/Tris, pH 7.7, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 50 μM dATP, 50 μM dGTP, 50 μM dTTP, 10 μM (1 μCi) [α-32P]dCTP, 0.5 μg of phosphocreatine kinase (Type I, Sigma), 6.4 μg of bovine serum albumin, whole-cell extract (80 μg of protein), 0.3 μg of unirradiated pUC19 replicative form I DNA, and UV-irradiated (200 J/m2) or unirradiated SV40 minichromosomes (0.3 μg of viral DNA). After incubation at 30°C for 3 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and cooling to 0°C. Then, 1 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The products were further treated with a solution of 200 μg/ml proteinase K containing 0.5% SDS. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the products were treated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated with ethanol. The precipitates were solubilized, digested with EcoRI, and loaded onto 1% agarose gels. After electrophoresis at 20-30 V for 12-18 h, the gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80°C using Fuji New RX x-ray film.Transfection Experiments and UV SurvivalFor transfection, the Dxpa cDNA fragment in which the HindIII site was replaced with an EcoRI site by linker ligation was inserted into the EcoRI site of pCAGGSneo, constructed from the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (Niwa et al., 1991) by introducing the neomycin resistance gene MC1neo into the SalI site. Transfection of this vector into the XP-A cell line XP12ROSV was performed by the method of Chen and Okayama(1987). Transfected cells were selected in the presence of the neomycin analog G418 (250 μg/ml). Stable transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution, and expression of the Dxpa protein was checked by immunoblotting.For UV survival experiments, cells were plated at densities varying from 8 × 102 to 1.6 × 106 cells/100-mm Petri dish, depending on the cell line and UV dose used. Cells were rinsed with PBS and exposed to UV light approximately 1 day after plating. A series of dishes was irradiated for each cell line, receiving a single UV dose (three dishes/UV dose). Colonies were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet approximately 10 days after UV irradiation, and percent colony-forming abilities were determined by comparing the colony counts of the irradiated plates with those of unirradiated control plates.Chromosomal in Situ HybridizationSalivary gland polytene chromosomes from late third instar larvae of Canton S strain flies were prepared as described by Zucker et al.(1985). The probe was prepared by labeling Dxpa cDNA with digoxygenin-dUTP, and hybridization was detected using an anti-digoxygenin monoclonal antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim).RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated as described previously (Sambrook et al., 1989). RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis through 1% formamide-agarose gels and transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon filters (Amersham Corp.). The filters were prehybridized for 1 h without probes and then hybridized overnight at 42°C in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSPE (20 × SSPE, 3.6 M NaCl, 0.2 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.7, 0.02 M EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA with probes prepared by labeling a 1.2-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment of Dxpa cDNA or 0.4-kb rp49 cDNA obtained from a polymerase chain reaction product using a Multiprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Corp.). The filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65°C and autoradiographed.Cloning of Genomic DxpaA λEMBL3 Drosophila genomic library (a gift from Dr. Y. Nishida) was screened with the Dxpa cDNA HindIII-EcoRI fragment as a probe according to standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989). Several clones were picked up and checked by restriction enzyme digestion followed by electrophoresis. A fragment consisting of 1.3 kb of 5′-flanking region, 1.2 kb of transcribed region, and 1.5 kb of 3′-flanking region was sequenced by the chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using a Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical Corp.).Chimeric Gene Construction and Germ Line TransformationThe SalI-HaeII fragment of genomic Dxpa consists of 1.3 kb of Dxpa gene promoter, the first exon, a 65-bp intron, and 33 bp of the second exon (see Fig. 6B). This fragment was introduced into pMC1871, a vector for constructing a fusion protein with Escherichia coli β-galactosidase. The correct reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the fusion junction. A 4.4-kb SalI-SalI fragment containing the fusion gene construct was then subcloned into the P-element transformation vector Carnegie 20 (Rubin and Spradling, 1983) at the SalI site (see Fig. 6C).Germ line transformation was carried out essentially by the method of Rubin and Spradling(1982). The recipient Drosophila strain was rosy506/Ki ppP[D2-3, ry+], and the DNA concentration for injection was 1 mg/ml of the Carnegie 20 construct. The embryos for injection were collected, dechorionated, and aligned to the edge of a coverslip. Following injection, embryos were placed in a moist chamber and incubated at 20°C until hatching. Surviving larvae were transferred to standard food vials and allowed to develop into adults (G0), which were then backcrossed to rosy506 flies. G1 progeny with the wild-type eye color were crossed again to rosy506 flies, and the resulting wild-type G2 progeny were mated to each other to establish homozygous lines. Southern blotting of genomic DNA was performed to confirm the presence of the inserted DNA in transformed lines.X-Gal Staining and ImmunohistochemistryThe spatial distribution of β-galactosidase expression was determined by X-gal staining as described previously (Fortini and Rubin, 1990). Flies were frozen in Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound (Miles Inc.), cut into sections 10 μm thick on a cryostat, and thaw-mounted onto glass slides pretreated with VECTABOND™ (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). After air-drying for 30 min, sections were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS for 10 min each time. The sections were submerged in X-gal staining buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 20 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 20 mM potassium ferricyanide, 0.02% X-gal, and 1 mM MgCl2) at 37°C for 16 h and then washed three times in PBS for 10 min each time. They were finally mounted with 80% glycerol in PBS and examined under a light microscope.Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Sections 10 μm thick were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and washed in PBS. After preincubation with PBSG buffer (PBS, 1% normal goat serum, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 30 min, they were incubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-Dxpa antibodies or control rabbit IgG in PBSG buffer at room temperature for 1 h and washed with washing buffer (PBS and 0.01% Triton X-100). The sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature and washed, followed by incubation with ABC complex for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the sections were submerged in peroxidase substrate solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 mg/ml diaminobenzidine, and 0.02% H2O2) for 2-5 min, washed again, and mounted. Immunohistochemistry of whole embryos was performed as described above except for the procedures of fixation and permeabilization; dechorionated embryos were fixed in 0.1 M PIPES, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 6.9, 3.7% formaldehyde solution saturated with n-heptane, and the concentrations of Triton X-100 were raised to 0.1% in PBSG buffer and 0.3% in washing buffer.RESULTSIdentification of Dxpa Protein ExpressionTo characterize the Dxpa protein expression pattern, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a fusion protein comprising 13 amino acids derived from the bacterial expression vector pET-3c and the full-length Dxpa protein (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 1A). The affinity-purified anti-Dxpa antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated two proteins with molecular masses of 43 and 40 kDa in in vitro transcription-translation products of the cloned Dxpa cDNA, while control rabbit IgG did not (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). These two proteins derived from Dxpa cDNA are thought to correspond to human XPA proteins that migrated with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 38 kDa (Miura et al., 1991). The anti-Dxpa antibodies also cross-reacted with in vitro translated products of the cloned human XPA cDNA (Fig. 1B, lane 3), indicating that both Dxpa and human XPA proteins have common epitopes recognized by anti-Dxpa antibodies. To examine the expression of the Dxpa proteins in vivo before and after UV irradiation, immunoblotting analysis was carried out using total lysates from the Drosophila cell lines Kc, C10, and mei-9. Kc and C10 are repair-proficient wild-type cell lines, while the mei-9 cell line is derived from a mutant defective in NER. The antibodies recognized two proteins of the same sizes as those of the in vitro translated Dxpa proteins in all three cell lines (Fig. 1C). The amounts of Dxpa proteins were not increased by UV irradiation. This result coincides with the observed lack of UV inducibility of the human XPA protein (Miura et al., 1991).Figure 1:Recombinant and native Dxpa proteins.

Cells were harvested after 0 h (lanes 1, 4, and 7), 4 h (lanes 2, 5, and 8), and 8 h (lanes 3, 6, and 9), and immunoblotting using affinity-purified rabbit anti-Dxpa antibodies was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Involvement of Dxpa Protein in DNA Repair in DrosophilaThe in vitro DNA repair system was originally developed on the basis of human cell extracts (Sugasawa et al., 1993; Wood et al., 1988). In the cell-free system, repair synthesis is detected in SV40 minichromosomes that have been irradiated with UV light. Since the SV40 minichromosome forms a eukaryotic chromatin structure, this in vitro repair system is thought to reflect in vivo repair conditions faithfully. As an internal control, unirradiated pUC19 plasmids were mixed with the irradiated DNA. A mixture of the two closed circular molecules, SV40 minichromosomes and pUC19, was incubated with whole-cell extract in buffer containing deoxyribonucleotides, [α-32P]dCTP, ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system. During the incubation, some of the pyrimidine dimer photoproducts are removed from irradiated DNA by NER. DNA repair synthesis can be visualized after recovery of the DNAs from the reaction mixture by linearization of the DNAs with a restriction enzyme, gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography.To investigate whether this system would also work for Drosophila, a whole-cell extract was prepared from growing Kc cells by the method of Manley et al.(1980) (see Wood et al.(1988)). Fig. 2A shows that Drosophila Kc whole-cell extracts supported specific incorporation of deoxyribonucleotides into UV-irradiated SV40 minichromosomes. Little nonspecific incorporation was detected in unirradiated SV40 minichromosomes and pUC19, indicating that this system could detect Drosophila NER in vitro (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). When anti-Dxpa antibodies were added to the reaction mixtures, DNA repair synthesis with UV-irradiated SV40 minichromosomes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-12), whereas control rabbit IgG had no effect (lanes 3 and 4). Addition of the recombinant Dxpa protein to the reactions after mixing the anti-Dxpa antibodies with extracts restored the DNA repair synthesis inhibited by the antibodies in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). These findings are consistent with results obtained in experiments using the human XPA protein (Masutani et al., 1993), verifying that the Dxpa protein is involved in DNA repair synthesis in Drosophila.Figure 2:DNA repair synthesis in Kc cell extract. A, DNA repair synthesis and its inhibition by affinity-purified anti-Dxpa antibodies. UV-irradiated (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) or unirradiated (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) SV40 minichromosomes were incubated in standard reaction mixtures, which were preincubated in the presence of 1 μg of control rabbit IgG (lanes 3 and 4) or 1 ng (lanes 5 and 6), 10 ng (lanes 7 and 8), 100 ng (lanes 9 and 10), and 1000 ng (lanes 11 and 12) of anti-Dxpa antibodies for 30 min on ice.

To confirm functional conservation between Drosophila and human XPA proteins, we introduced a Dxpa expression plasmid into XP12ROSV cells. Of stable transfectants, three independent clones strongly expressing the Dxpa protein were selected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). The human XPA protein was not detected in the human repair-proficient cell line WI38VA13 with anti-Dxpa antibodies, although it was recognized by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B and 3A, lane 1). Expression of the Dxpa protein in the three transfectants resulted in the restoration of partial UV resistance (Fig. 3B). This result shows that Drosophila Dxpa partially complements the defect of excision repair in human XP-A cells, indicating that Drosophila Dxpa and human XPA proteins are functionally conserved in evolution (see “Discussion”).Figure 3:Partial correction of the XP12ROSV repair defect by Dxpa cDNA.

Dxpa was mapped at region 3F6-8 on the X chromosome, where neither mutagen-sensitive nor DNA repair-deficient mutants have yet been localized. The mei-9 mutant defective in NER and meiosis was mapped previously within 4B on the X chromosome (Yamamoto et al., 1990). These results indicate that the Dxpa gene is a novel excision repair gene in Drosophila.Figure 4:Cytologic mapping of the Dxpa gene by in situ hybridization.

Fig. 5 shows a single band of 1.4 kb detected on Northern blots prepared with total RNA from embryos, third instar larvae, early pupae, middle pupae, and adults. The level of Dxpa mRNA was changed during development. We compared the relative amount of Dxpa mRNA with the internal control ribosomal protein 49 (rp49) mRNA by densitometric measurement (data not shown); the expression was the lowest at the embryonic stage, increased as development proceeded (˜2-fold (at larval stage) or ˜4-fold (at pupal stage) as compared with the embryonic stage), and finally reached the maximal level in adults (˜5-6-fold). The abundance of Dxpa mRNA appeared to be lower in the head than thorax and abdomen fractions.Figure 5:The Dxpa cDNA hybridized to a 1.4-kb transcript on Northern blots.

https://openalex.org/W2046609493,"We show that nondenaturing agarose gels can be used for the study of the structure and dynamic properties of native (uncross-linked) chromatin. In gels containing 1.7 mM Mg2+, chicken erythrocyte chromatin fragments having from about 6 to 50 nucleosomes produce well defined bands. These bands have an electrophoretic mobility that decreases only slightly with molecular weight. This surprising behavior is not observed in low ionic strength gels. Fragments with less than 6 nucleosomes and low content of histones H1-H5 give rise to broad bands in gels with Mg2+. In contrast, fragments containing only 3-4 nucleosomes but with the normal H1-H5 content are able to form associated structures with a mobility similar to that observed for high molecular weight chromatin. Electron microscopy results indicate that the associated fragments and the fragments of higher molecular weight show similar electrophoretic properties because they become very compact in the presence of Mg2+ and form cylindrical structures with a diameter of ˜33 nm. Our results suggest that the interactions involved in the self-assembly of small fragments are the same that direct the folding of larger fragments; in both cases, the resulting compact chromatin structure is formed from a basic element containing 5-7 nucleosomes.

The results obtained in these studies have suggested different models for the folding and structural organization of the 30-nm chromatin fiber. These models differ essentially in the location of the linker DNA. In the one-start helix models, the linker DNA is folded and connects laterally consecutive nucleosomes(8Butler P.J.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2599-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13McGhee J.D. Nickol J.M. Felsenfeld G. Rau D.C.

In the twisted-ribbon models, a two-start helix is formed by pairs of nucleosomes with the linker DNA parallel to the fiber axis(24Worcel A. Strogatz S. Riley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the linker DNA is extended in the fiber interior. In this work we show that nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis can be used for the study of the folding of chromatin. We have found that, when electrophoresis is performed in the presence of Mg2+, chicken erythrocyte chromatin fragments of a relatively high molecular weight change dramatically their mobility due to the formation of very compact structures. Furthermore, we have found that under these conditions small oligonucleosomes are able to associate forming structures with the same structural characteristics as larger chromatin fragments. The results obtained using gel electrophoresis have been interpreted taking into account the analysis by electron microscopy of the same samples. Our electrophoretic method does not require the cross-linking of the chromatin samples, but the structures produced by the association of uncross-linked oligonucleosome fragments are stable enough to form the well defined bands detected in nondenaturing gels at the end of the electrophoresis. This suggests that the forces that allow the self-assembly of oligonucleosomes are the same that direct the folding of chromatin of higher molecular weight. We have also investigated the role of histones H1-H5 in these structural transitions. Chicken erythrocyte nuclei were obtained in 90 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 mM triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4) and digested with micrococcal nuclease (Sigma, 1 unit/mg of DNA) for 30-90 min in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 at 37°C(32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Digested nuclei were extracted overnight at 4°C with 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM PMSF, and 10 mM triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4), and finally centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min. The soluble chromatin in the supernatant was concentrated (Diaflo PM1O, Amicon) to 5-6 mg of DNA/ml and fractionated by sedimentation on a 5-20% linear sucrose gradient containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM PMSF, and 10 mM triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4). When necessary, prior to density gradient centrifugation, the digested chromatin was depleted of histones H1-H5 following the method of Ruiz-Carrillo et al.(35Ruiz-Carrillo A. Puigdomènech P. Eder G. Lurz R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2544-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Selected fractions from the sucrose gradients were dialyzed against the indicated buffers (see “Results”); other fractions were concentrated (Centricon 10, Amicon) to 2-5 mg/ml and further fractionated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (see below). Chromatin of high molecular weight was obtained as described elsewhere (32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by sucrose gradient sedimentation followed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The length of the isolated DNA corresponding to the different chromatin fragments was analyzed on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. The histone composition of the different samples was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with the fluorescent dye Nile red(36Daban J.-R. Bartolomé S. Samsó M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Photographic negatives were scanned with a Shimadzu CS-9000 densitometer. Electrophoresis of chromatin fragments on gels containing 0.1 × TB (9 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3) was performed following essentially the procedure previously described for the analysis of core particle DNA-histone complexes (37Aragay A.M. Diaz P. Daban J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but using 0.5% agarose gels instead of polyacrylamide gels. These gels were pre-electrophoresed, and the buffer was recirculated between the electrode compartments. Nondenaturing 0.5% agarose gels (10 cm long) of higher ionic strength contained TB and the concentrations of MgCl2 indicated in the figure legends. In this case, pre-electrophoresis and buffer recirculation were omitted. Chromatin samples directly obtained from the sucrose gradients or in the buffers indicated in the figure legends (in all cases without Mg2+) were mixed with 0.25 volume of 5 × TB containing 12.5% Ficoll and loaded onto the TB-Mg2+ gel. Generally, electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V for about 1.7 h. The apparent equilibrium constant for the reaction of association of small chromatin fragments (see “Results”) was calculated from the densitometric analyses of the electrophoretic bands corresponding to the small and associated fragments of chromatin samples having different concentrations (ranging from 0.19 to 1.7 mg of DNA/ml). After electrophoresis the selected bands were cut out of the gel, washed twice with 1.5 ml of TEAB buffer (90 mM triethanolamine-borate, pH 8.6) containing 1.7 mM MgCl2 for 2 h, and treated with 1.5 ml of 0.1% glutaraldehyde for about 15 h at 4°C in the same buffer. Finally, the agarose block containing fixed chromatin fragments was loaded onto an Ultrafree-CL tube (0.45 μm Durapore membrane, Millipore), and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 30 min. The chromatin eluted from each band was used in electron microscopy experiments. The chromatin samples prepared without gel electrophoresis were fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde for about 15 h at 4°C in the indicated buffers before electron microscopy. The specific cross-linking conditions of the chromatin fragments used for second-dimension electrophoretic analyses are described (see “Results”). Spread preparations of the resulting samples (final concentration 2-10 μg of DNA/ml) were obtained as described previously in carbon-coated copper grids pretreated with Alcian blue(38Aragay A.M. Fernandez-Busquets X. Daban J.-R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5022-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The grids were rotary-shadowed with platinum-carbon at an angle of about 7°. Micrographs were obtained at a magnification of × 30,000 using a Hitachi H7000 transmission electron microscope. Images from the original negatives were acquired either directly using a transilluminator and a Hamamatsu C2400 camera or at a higher magnification with the same camera attached to a modified Zeiss Axiotron microscope equipped with a × 5 objective. Additional experimental details have been described elsewhere(32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility of chromatin samples in 0.5% agarose gels containing 0.1 × TB is lower than that found for the DNA extracted from the same samples (Fig. 1a). The relative retardation of the mononucleosome band produced by this nondenaturing agarose gel is lower than that observed in low ionic strength polyacrylamide gels(37Aragay A.M. Diaz P. Daban J.-R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whereas oligonucleosomes cannot enter the polyacrylamide gels(38Aragay A.M. Fernandez-Busquets X. Daban J.-R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5022-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the agarose gels described in this work can be used even with chromatin samples of high molecular weight. The results presented in Fig. 1b show that in 0.1 × TB agarose gels the electrophoretic mobility of native chromatin samples having a wide range of molecular weights is in all cases lower than that of the corresponding free DNA obtained from these samples. In contrast with the results presented in the preceding section, when the electrophoresis on 0.5% agarose gels is performed using buffers of higher ionic strength (see Fig. 2), the mobility of chromatin fragments of increasing molecular weight shows a complex behavior. In gels containing 1 × TB, the plot of the log bp (of the DNA corresponding to a given chromatin sample) versus electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2d) has two regions: one with a small negative slope (corresponding to low molecular weight chromatin samples) and the other with a high negative slope (corresponding to chromatin of higher molecular weight). These differences in electrophoretic behavior are more pronounced using electrophoretic buffers containing Mg2+ (Fig. 2d). We have obtained essentially the same results with gels containing 1.7 and 2.5 mM MgCl2. The transition between the two regions of these plots is observed when the chromatin fragments contain 5-6 nucleosomes. With chromatin samples containing more than 6 nucleosomes, the changes in electrophoretic mobility produced by the increase of the molecular weight of the chromatin are very small. Note that in gels containing Mg2+, the negative slope of the plots shown in Fig. 2d corresponding to samples with more than 6 nucleosomes has a very high value. This surprising behavior of native chromatin produces an apparent increase in the electrophoretic mobility of the high molecular weight chromatin fragments relative to the mobility of free DNA. In fact, whereas the mobility of naked DNA corresponding to chromatin fragments containing 6 nucleosomes is roughly 2-fold higher than that observed for the native fragments, chromatin samples containing about 50 nucleosomes (i.e. DNA of ˜10 kb) show approximately the same mobility than the naked DNA extracted from these samples (see the intersection of the chromatin and DNA curves in Fig. 2d). In agarose gels of low ionic strength, the electrophoretic bands corresponding to chromatin without H1-H5 migrate faster than the equivalent bands of chromatin containing all the histones, but slower than the corresponding free DNA obtained from these samples (see Fig. 1b). In gels of higher ionic strength in absence or in presence of Mg2+, the slope of the plots of log bp versus relative mobility of chromatin depleted of histones H1-H5 (see Fig. 2e) are different from that obtained in gels of low ionic strength. However, in contrast with the results obtained in the case of native chromatin fragments with all the histones, the plots of log bp versus mobility of samples without H1-H5 in gels of relatively high ionic strength cannot be divided in two regions (compare the plots presented in Fig. 2, d and e). This indicates that histones H1-H5 are presumably responsible for the complex electrophoretic behavior of native chromatin in gels containing Mg2+. Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 3a, when chromatin is treated with increasing NaCl concentrations and then electrophoresed on agarose gels with Mg2+, a remarkable structural transition is observed at about 0.6 M NaCl. This transition is not observed with chromatin depleted of histones H1-H5 (Fig. 3b). Taking into account that histones H1-H5 are dissociated from chromatin when the NaCl concentration is 0.6 M(34Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the presence of histones H1-H5 is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the structures that produce the typical electrophoretic bands of native chromatin. Native chromatin fragments containing the four core histones and histones H1-H5 produce broad bands in low ionic strength gels (Fig. 1a). In contrast, fragments with 6 or more nucleosomes form well defined bands in gels with Mg2+ (Fig. 2, a and b). This observation is probably related with the almost invariable mobility in gels with Mg2+ observed for native chromatin samples of increasing molecular weight (see above). Nevertheless, note that, even in gels containing Mg2+, chromatin fragments with less than 6 nucleosomes produce broad bands (Fig. 2b, lanes 1-5). Furthermore, in samples corresponding to fragments containing from 3-4 (Fig. 2, b and c, lane 4) to 5-7 (Fig. 2, b and c, lane 7) nucleosomes, these broad bands are accompanied with a narrow slower band (indicated by a star) that shows the same mobility as the fragments of higher molecular weight. The relative mobility of the additional slower bands is also indicated by stars in Fig. 2d. These bands are not observed in gels without Mg2+. The slow and rapid bands of each lane shown in Fig. 2b contain the same number of nucleosomes. For instance, the analysis of a sample similar to that of lane 4 of Fig. 2b on a second-dimension denaturing gel shows that both the slow and rapid bands contain the DNA corresponding to 3-4 nucleosomes (see Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). One possible interpretation of this surprising observation is that the slow band is due to the association of the oligonucleosome fragments that produce the rapid band. This possibility is demonstrated in the cross-linking experiment shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that whereas the slow band produces cross-linked structures of low mobility in second-dimension denaturing gels (lane 4), the rapid band does not give rise to cross-linked material (lane 5). This result indicates that small fragments of chromatin containing 3-4 nucleosomes can produce associated structures having the same electrophoretic properties as chromatin fragments of higher molecular weight. The association of small chromatin fragments is confirmed in the electron microscopy studies presented below. We have assumed that two small fragments with few nucleosomes associate to form a structure containing about 6 nucleosomes, according to the equation f + f ⇆ F, where f and F correspond, respectively, to the small and associated fragments. The densitometric analysis of gels loaded with samples containing fragments with about 4 nucleosomes has allowed us to estimate that the apparent association constant for this assembly reaction determined at four different concentrations is 1.4 (± 0.7) × 105M-1. The histone composition of the chromatin samples containing more than 6 nucleosomes is the same as that of whole nuclei samples, but the chromatin samples containing few nucleosomes have a low H1-H5 content (see Fig. 5b). Nevertheless, second-dimension electrophoresis shows that the slow band detected in chromatin samples containing less than 6 nucleosomes has approximately the same H1-H5 content as normal chromatin (see Fig. 5a, lane 2 and legend), indicating that these histones are necessary for the association of small chromatin fragments to form the band that has the same mobility as the fragments of higher molecular weight. The similar mobility, in gels with Mg2+, observed for chromatin structures produced by the assembly of small fragments and by native chromatin fragments having a wide range of molecular weights (see above) suggests that all these chromatin samples adopt a compact conformation that make them indistinguishable in the gel. In order to test this possibility, chromatin samples containing 2-3, 3-4, and 5-6 nucleosomes were electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions in presence of Mg2+ and, after electrophoresis, the slow band was cross-linked in the gel with glutaraldehyde; then the cross-linked material was eluted from the gel and finally analyzed in the electron microscope. We have observed that, in all cases, in the presence of 1.7 mM Mg2+, the slow band produces circular structures (see Fig. 6e) similar to those obtained with fragments containing from about 6 to 35 nucleosomes (see Fig. 6g and (32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar)). The measurements presented in Fig. 7 show that the diameter of the structures extracted from the slow bands corresponding to samples containing from 2-3 to 5-6 nucleosomes (Panels b-d) is about 33 nm, i.e. the same diameter found for chromatin samples containing a larger number of nucleosomes (see Panel a). In contrast, the rapid band of samples containing few nucleosomes does not produce the typical circular structure (see Fig. 6d). Before electrophoresis, in presence of 1.7 mM Mg2+, the samples containing few nucleosomes are mixtures of the circular structures and small particles (Fig. 6c). Electrophoresis causes the separation of these two components. Control experiments show that at low ionic strength (Fig. 6a) or in absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 6b) small fragments cannot associate. Without Mg2+, folding of very large fragments cannot take place (Fig. 6f). As can be seen in Fig. 8, the highly magnified images obtained from the associated small chromatin fragments present in the slow electrophoretic bands (indicated by a star in Fig. 2) are equivalent to the typical images of larger chromatin fragments that we have described previously(32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar). The structures assembled from small chromatin fragments, and the fragments of higher molecular weight have approximately the same electrophoretic mobility because they become very compact in presence of Mg2+. In agreement with this interpretation, we have found previously (32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar) that fragments containing from about 6 to 35 nucleosomes show approximately the same diameter (33 nm) in the electron microscope because in presence of Mg2+ they are highly packed, favoring the vertical placement of the resulting short cylindrical structures on the grid. This gives rise to images corresponding to the top view of folded chromatin (see Figure 4:, Figure 8: and Fig. 5 of (32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar)). The remarkable changes in the electrophoretic behavior of chromatin fragments observed when electrophoresis is performed in the presence of Mg2+ has allowed us to detect the assembly of oligonucleosomes and the folding of larger fragments. Note that the experiments with the nondenaturing agarose gels have been performed using uncross-linked chromatin samples. Thus, our findings derived from the electrophoretic studies presented in this study correspond to native chromatin samples. While this investigation was in progress, Krajewski et al.(39Krajewski W.A. Panin V.M. Razin S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported that current agarose gels without Mg2+ can be used for the structural analysis of chromatin cross-linked with glutaraldehyde under different conditions before electrophoresis. We have used glutaraldehyde cross-linking exclusively after electrophoresis in order to stabilize samples for electron microscopy analysis. In this case, before spreading, it is necessary to make a large dilution of the sample that causes nucleosome dissociation in the uncross-linked chromatin (not shown). The main conclusions of this work can be summarized in the scheme presented in Fig. 9. Our results show that about 6 nucleosomes are enough to produce the compact structures having approximately the same electrophoretic mobility as the folded chromatin fragments of higher molecular weights. Early sedimentation studies (8Butler P.J.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2599-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed a marked structural transition when the chromatin fragments analyzed contained 6 nucleosomes. We have found that even small fragments (containing 3-4 nucleosomes) can associate giving rise to compact particles with the same mobility as the folded fragments of higher molecular weight. When observed in the electron microscope all these structures are apparently equivalent. According to our previous observations(32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar), this is due to the fact that the images obtained correspond to the top view of the folded chromatin fragments (see above). These findings suggest that the structure of folded chromatin fibers must be very compact and simple enough to be started and stabilized with a basic element containing about 6 nucleosomes. Such a structure is compatible with the compact one-start helix model proposed from the detailed analysis of the electron microscope images of small chromatin fragments in presence of 1.7 mM Mg2+(32Bartolomé S. Bermúdez A. Daban J.-R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2983-2992PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with our findings about the self-assembly of small chromatin fragments, other laboratories using different techniques have reported results about the association of oligonucleosomes to form higher order structures(35Ruiz-Carrillo A. Puigdomènech P. Eder G. Lurz R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2544-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Grau L.P. Azorín F. Subirana J.A. Chromosoma. 1982; 87: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 41Thomas J.O. Rees C. Pearson E.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 42Muyldermans S. Lasters I. Hamers R. Wyns L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that chromatin fibers are able to self-organize even when there is no covalent continuity in the DNA of the fiber. This stresses the fundamental role of histones in organizing the chromatin structure. Histones H1-H5 are necessary to produce the folding of chromatin fragments. The characteristic electrophoretic behavior of the chromatin fragments analyzed in this study is not observed in samples depleted of these histones. Moreover, the association of small fragments does not take place in the oligonucleosome fraction that has a low H1-H5 content; only the fraction having the normal content of these histones can form self-assembled structures. These results are consistent with previous findings indicating the essential role of histones H1-H5 for chromatin assembly (43Rodríguez-Campos A. Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and folding(44Graziano V. Gerchman S.E. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent results (45Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have shown that histones H1 and H5 suppress the mobility of the histone octamers positioned on constructs of 5 S rRNA. Furthermore, neutron scattering analysis of chromatin containing deuterated histone H1 has indicated that this histone is located in the interior of the folded chromatin at a distance from the fiber axis of about 6 nm(46Graziano V. Gerchman S.E. Schneider D.K. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 1994; 368: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This internal location of H1 (and presumably H5) is probably responsible for the stabilization of the folded structure. It is very likely that the observed association of small chromatin fragments is originated by the same interactions that cause the spontaneous folding of the chromatin fiber. Since the association constant corresponding to this assembly (˜105M-1, see “Results”) is about 103-fold lower than the association constant of histone octamers with DNA (˜108M-1 as estimated from the dissociation analysis of core particles in 0.2 M NaCl)(38Aragay A.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5022-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it can be suggested that DNA in chromatin is packaged following a sequence of compaction steps (core particle formation → H1-H5 binding → folding of the 30 nm fiber) involving lower amounts of free energy release in each consecutive level. Although the binding of histone H1 and similar proteins to naked DNA is very cooperative and the corresponding association constant is apparently very high (47Watanabe F.

Furthermore, it has to be taken into account that even compact chromatin containing histones H1-H5 is not necessarily inert from a functional point of view. It has been found recently that chromatin with the normal H1-H5 content in the presence of 1.7 mM Mg2+ can bound reversibly excess core histones, suggesting that folded chromatin may be involved in the transient association of the core histones released during transcription(56Gallego F.

As a first step in investigating the role of N4SSB in replication and transcriptional activation, we have identified and sequenced the N4SSB gene. The gene encodes a 265-amino acid protein with no apparent sequence homology to other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. We present data indicating that N4SSB is also essential for phage recombination. Mutational analysis of the carboxyl terminus of the protein indicates that this region is required for protein-protein interactions with the N4 replication, N4 recombination, and E. coli transcriptional machineries, while the rest of the protein contains the determinants for single-stranded DNA binding."

INTRODUCTIONConnective tissue cells are embedded within an extracellular matrix of glycoproteins. The integrity of this matrix is dependent upon a balanced rate of cell division, matrix synthesis, and degradation. Most connective tissue cells, including fibroblasts, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells, have been reported to secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP-1fibroblast collagenaseAcacetylBB-94[4-(N-hydroxyamino)-2R-isobutyl-3S-(thiopen-2-yl-thiomethyl)-succinyl]-L-phenylalanine-N-methylamidecdcatalytic domainDpaN-3-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionylDTNB5,5′-dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoate]Mca(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetylMMPsmetalloproteinasesMMP-3stromelysin-1MMP-7matrilysinMMP-8neutrophil collagenaseOEt-OC2H5PCRpolymerase chain reactionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] glycine. (1Matrisian L.M. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The MMP family of enzymes, acting synergistically, can break down all the components of the extracellular matrix at physiological pH. Uncontrolled matrix metalloproteinase activity may lead to the loss of connective tissue integrity and has been implicated in a variety of connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Thus, MMPs have become targets for therapeutic intervention in these pathological processes.Fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1) belongs to the MMP family and has the unique ability of cleaving the triple helical native type I, II, and III collagens(2Stricklin G.P. Bauer E.A. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Horwitz A.L. Hance A.J. Crystal R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). MMP-1 is secreted as a proenzyme which can be activated by the removal of an autoinhibitory prosequence containing a conserved cysteine switch region present in all MMPs(4Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen H. Birkedal-Hansen B. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mature MMP-1 is a 41-kDa protein composed of an NH2-terminal catalytic domain containing the zinc-binding region of the active site and a COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain. Activation in vitro can be facilitated by proteinases (e.g. trypsin, plasmin), oxidants, mercurials, or stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Activation of MMP-1 by proteinases, mercurials, or oxidants produces a variety of active enzymes having either Met-72, Phe-81, Val-82, or Leu-83 as the NH2-terminal residue(5Knäuper V. Krämer S.

The Val-82 and Leu-83 forms accumulate only after extended incubation with p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate or proteinases. Activation with MMP-3, however, gives rise to a 41-kDa mature enzyme with Phe-81 as its NH2 terminus. This 41-kDa Phe-81 form, with an intact carboxyl-terminal hemopexin domain, has higher proteolytic activity against native substrate type I collagen as compared with the partially activated Val-82 and Leu-83 forms(10Suzuki K.

J. 1989; 263: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).The MMP-1 catalytic domain (MMP-1cd) alone can cleave substrates such as casein, gelatin, and synthetic peptide substrates. However, unlike the full-length enzyme, MMP-1cd cannot cleave collagen(14Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Connell P.O. Docherty A.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). And, the missing COOH-terminal hemopexin domain is probably responsible for this difference. With peptide substrates, the catalytic activities of both MMP-1cd and the full-length enzyme are very similar; they differ by only 21%(14Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Connell P.O. Docherty A.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9612-9618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the active site structure of the catalytic domain is an appropriate template for the design of low molecular weight inhibitors. It is intriguing whether the structural differences between the Phe-81 and Val-82 or Leu-83 forms of MMP-1cd will be reflected by any changes in enzyme kinetics. Such understanding may provide additional insight in the design of inhibitors for therapeutic applications.This paper demonstrates high level Escherichia coli expression of soluble 19-kDa rMMP-1cd covering the region between Phe-81 and Gln-249 using the ubiquitin fusion-protein method. We also report in vitro activation methods used to generate homogeneous Phe-81, Val-82, or Leu-83 at the NH2 terminus as well as the purification and comparative kinetic analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction and Protein ExpressionOligonucleotides were synthesized based on the published human MMP-1 and ubiquitin cDNA sequences (15Templeton N.S.

A human fibroblast cDNA pool (Clontech) and plasmid Pnmhub-poly were used as DNA templates to amplify the coding region of MMP-1 and ubiquitin, respectively. Additional oligonucleotides were synthesized to encode the linker sequences spanning the KpnI and BstEII sites. All PCR amplifications were done with standard procedures(17Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3816) Google Scholar).The expression plasmid pUMColl.1 was constructed by standard methods (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The first step involved PCR amplification and cloning of ubiquitin into the final expression plasmid from an existing ubiquitin plasmid Pnmhub-poly. The 5′-ubiquitin PCR primer contained a unique NdeI site that also encoded the ATG for translational initiation. The 3′-ubiquitin PCR primer contained DNA sequence for a unique KpnI site and a downstream EcoRI cloning site. PCR mutagenesis was performed for the collagenase portion of the fusion protein. The 5′ primer introduced a silent mutation to create a BstEII site at Gly-86 codon in the MMP-1 coding region. The 3′ primer contained a unique EcoRI cloning site downstream of Gln-249 codon and the stop codon. This amplified fragment was digested and ligated with a synthetic KpnI-BstEII linker into a cloning vector. The final expression construct was made by excising the KpnI-EcoRI DNA fragment and ligating to the ubiquitin expression plasmid digested with the same two restriction enzymes (Fig. 1). The first Gly residue in the linker region was provided by the ubiquitin coding region at the KpnI site. Plasmid constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and dideoxynucleotide sequencing(19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52347) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5986) Google Scholar)) which were grown at 37°C to mid-log phase and induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for protein production. Cells were harvested 3 h post-induction.Purification of the rMMP-1cd Fusion ProteinInduced E. coli cultures were harvested and cell pellets were resuspended and lysed by microfluidization in the lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM zinc acetate) containing 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C or on ice. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 45 min. The soluble fraction was recovered, dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mM CaCl2) and applied to Q-Sepharose FF column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-200 mM NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled and prepared for activation as described below.Proteolytic Activation of the rMMP-1cd Fusion ProteinsRemoval of the ubiquitin domain and linker sequence could be performed by two different methods.(i) Activation of Ubiquitin-Wild Type Linker-MMP-1cd Fusion Protein by MMP-3 Cleavage to Form a Homogeneous Phe-81 or Val-82 NH2 TerminiThe metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline was added to the pooled Q-Sepharose fractions to a final concentration of 10 μM. The sample was then concentrated with a 0-50% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation and centrifugation at 26,900 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Pelleted protein was resuspended in Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 mM CaCl2, 200 mM NaCl) containing 10 μM 1,10-phenanthroline and applied to a S-100HR size exclusion column which was equilibrated in the same buffer. Fractions containing spontaneously autoprocessed Val-82 MMP-1cd or intact fusion protein were pooled separately. Zinc acetate was added to the pooled intact fusion protein fractions to the final concentration of 0.5 mM and incubated with recombinant human MMP-3cd (expressed and purified in this laboratory) at an rMMP-3cd:fusion protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w) at 37°C for an hour.(ii) Activation of Ubiquitin-Mutant Linker-MMP-1cd Fusion by Autoproteolysis to Form a Homogeneous Leu-83 NH2 TerminusProtein precipitated by 50% ammonium sulfate was resuspended at 20 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM zinc acetate, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h.Purification of Mature rMMP-1cdAfter the ubiquitin domain was cleaved from rMMP-1cd fusion proteins by either autoproteolytic or rMMP-3cd digestion, the protein solution was centrifuged at 26,900 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant solution was recovered and applied to a metal chelate affinity column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) which was saturated with zinc acetate and equilibrated with 3 column volumes of Buffer C (10 mM Na2B4O7, 5 mM CaCl2, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) without prior imidazole saturation. rMMP-1cd was eluted with a 1-25 mM linear imidazole gradient in Buffer C.Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Purified rMMP-1cdMass determination of MMP-3-activated rMMP-1cd was performed with an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. A 110-μg rMMP-1cd sample was denatured in 30 μl of 6 M urea and 40 mM EDTA, then diluted with 0.8 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. This denatured protein sample was injected onto a POROS RP reverse phase column (Perspective BioScience) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient. A 0.5-ml fraction was collected and used directly for electrospray ionization mass spectrometer analysis.Peptide-based Continuous Enzymatic Assays and Determination of kcat/KmThe value of kcat/Km for rMMP-1cd was determined by both a resonance energy transfer fluorogenic assay and a chromogenic assay.(i) Resonance Energy Transfer Fluorogenic AssayWe used a modified version of a procedure previously described by Knight et al.(21Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) employing the coumarin-labeled resonance energy transfer fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Mca-peptide). When intact, the fluorescence of the Mca group is quenched by resonance energy transfer to the Dpa moiety. rMMP-1cd cleaves the Mca-peptide at the Gly-Leu bond and the released product-peptide containing the Mca group fluoresces 130 times greater than the intact substrate. Product formation was determined by continuously measuring the cleavage-induced increase in fluorescence of the reaction mixture. Typical reaction mixtures for kcat/Km experiments contained TCS Buffer (0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM zinc acetate, 2% Me2SO, 5 μM Mca-peptide, and 500 nM rMMP-1cd). The reaction was conducted at 37°C using degassed buffer solutions and an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 328 nm. Incident light was filtered with the broad band-pass UG5 cutoff filter to block stray and scattered light. The fluorescent band of emitted light centered at 393 nm was measured by monitoring all wavelengths greater than 335 nm by the use of the cutoff filter WG-335. 150 μl of the final reaction mixture was mixed rapidly with the stopped flow pneumatic drive and rapid peptide cleavage was followed for 10 min or until peptide cleavage exceeded 85%. The resulting progress curves were fitted by the instrumental nonlinear regression software to for a single exponential decay containing a linear term where F = fluorescence, A = the amplitude of the fluorescence change, kobs = the observed rate constant, t = time, V = the linear rate, and B = final fluorescence level. The linear term accounts for the slight photobleaching observed. F=A⋅exp(-kobs⋅t)+V⋅t+B(Eq. 1) kcat/Km was calculated from the relationship kcat/Km = kobs/[rMMP-1cd], where is the active enzyme concentration determined by the active site titration described below.(ii) Continuous Chromogenic AssayWe used a modified version of a procedure previously described by Weingarten and Feder (22Weingarten H. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the chromogenic thioester-peptilide substrate Ac-Pro-Leu-Gly-S-Leu-Leu-Gly-OEt (thioester-peptilide). rMMP-1cd cleaves this peptide at the Gly-Leu thioester bond generating a free sulfhydryl group. The sulfhydryl group immediately reacts with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) to form the colored product 3-carboxylato-4-nitrothiophenolate with an absorbance maximum at 412 nm. The assay described below was used to determine initial rates of product formation as well as the value of kcat/Km for the thioester-peptilide. Reaction mixtures of a final 1 ml volume contained TCS buffer, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM zinc acetate, 100 μM DTNB, 2% Me2SO, 10 or 100 μM thioester-peptilide, and nM concentrations of rMMP-1cd. For determination of initial rates of product formation, the concentration of thioester-peptilide and rMMP-1cd was 100 μM and 3 nM, respectively. For kcat/Km determination, the concentration of thioester-peptilide was 10 μM and the concentration of rMMP-1cd was 10 or 15 nM. Product formation was detected from the increase in absorbance at 412 nm on a Hewlett-Packard HP8452 diode array spectrophotometer using clear plastic disposable cuvettes. These cuvettes filter incident light by strongly absorbing wavelengths <300 nm. This circumvented low UV-dependent photodegradation of DTNB and hence minimized rMMP-1cd-independent blank rates. However, an important basal blank rate due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of the thioester-peptilide could not be diminished at this pH(22Weingarten H. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mixture was preincubated for 4 min at 37°C before rMMP-1cd was added to initiate the reaction. The progress was followed for 3 min to determine initial rates. The change in absorbance is linear over this time period and less than 5% of the substrate is consumed. During kcat/Km experiments, the reaction progress was followed for 20 min so that >85% of the thioester-peptilide had been cleaved. Progress curves were then fitted to an equation which describes a single exponential decay with a linear term similar to. The linear term accounts for the small residual rMMP-1cd independent blank rate described above. kcat/Km was calculated from the relationship kcat/Km = kobs/[rMMP-1cd].Determination of Active Enzyme Concentration by Active Site TitrationThe concentration of rMMP-1cd was determined by titration of the active site with a strong competitive MMP inhibitor BB-94(23Davies B. Brown P.D. East N. Crimmin M.J. Balkwill F.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2087-2091PubMed Google Scholar). Its Ki of 50 pM against rMMP-1cd (determined in this laboratory) assures stoichiometric binding of BB-94 to the enzyme under the following conditions. rMMP-1cd was diluted to 1 μM with TCS buffer (50 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2, 200 mM NaCl), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM zinc acetate and incubated at room temperature. BB-94 was added in small volumes so that the concentration of BB-94 increased by 100 nM increments. Binding was allowed to progress to completion at room temperature for 5 min for each addition. After each BB-94 addition, a small volume of the incubation mixture was assayed using the thioester-peptilide substrate to determine the residual enzymatic activity. During this assay period, dissociation of the bound inhibitor does not occur. The data were corrected for both dilution and the spontaneous hydrolysis of the thioester peptilide. The concentration of active rMMP-1cd was taken as the abscissal intercept of a linear fit on a plot of residual activity versus BB-94 concentration.RESULTSProduction of human proMMP-1 full-length enzyme in E. coli has been reported to be problematic as it could only be accumulated in E. coli either at relatively low levels or as an insoluble protein sequestered within inclusion bodies(4Windsor L.J.

Expression levels and solubility of proMMP-1 were improved when the heat shock chaperone protein GroESL or DnaK was co-expressed in E. coli(24Lee S.C. Olins P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2849-2852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lowry et al.(25Lowry C.L. McGeehan G. Le Vine III, H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) expressed a recombinant 19 kDa MMP-1cd without the prosequence in E. coli. Again, it existed only as inclusion bodies and required refolding to gain solubility and proteolytic activity(25Lowry C.L. McGeehan G. Le Vine III, H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When the collagenase catalytic domain was initially expressed as a proenzyme (proMMP-1cd) in E. coli in this laboratory, it was also observed that only low amounts of insoluble protein could be produced. Clearly a better system was needed to improve the expression and solubility of proMMP-1cd. Therefore, expression constructs such as pUMColl.1 (Fig. 1) were made. pUMColl.1 contains the T7 gene 10 promoter for efficient transcription. To ensure efficient translation, we applied a two-cistron approach. The ribosome binding site and the first 20 codons of the dihydrofolate reductase gene from a trimethoprim-resistant E. coli strain were used as the first cistron (26Kan C.C. Gehring M.R. Nodes B.R. Janson C.A. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) followed by the ubiquitin-MMP-1cd fusion as the second cistron. Yeast ubiquitin was chosen since it had been used as the NH2-terminal leader to produce various soluble fusion proteins at high levels(16Ecker D.J. Stadel J.M. Butt T.R. Marsh J.A. Monia B.P. Powers D.A. Gorman J.A. Clark P.E. Warren F. Shatzman A. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7715-7719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gly-Gly-Thr-Gly sequence was chosen as the first half of the linker sequence between the ubiquitin and rMMP-1cd domains to introduce both flexibility and distance between the two protein domains and to create a unique KpnI restriction enzyme site for cloning purposes. Based on the solved x-ray structure of proMMP-3cd, 2K. Appelt and R. Almassy, personal communication. it was seen that the last four amino acid residues from the prosequence were exposed to solvent and susceptible to proteolytic attack. Assuming three-dimensional structures around this region of MMP-1 and MMP-3 are similar, we chose to include only the last four residues from the prosequence as the second half of the cleavage site linker sequence. It was anticipated that the linker region between two protein domains would be flexible and susceptible to either autoprocessing or proteolytic attack by MMP-3cd at the His-Phe bond. As shown in Fig. 2, the ubiquitin fusion protein was indeed expressed at a higher level than proMMP-1cd in E. coli. Furthermore, the vast majority of fusion protein was found in the soluble fraction of crude E. coli lysates.Figure 2:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of recombinant collagenase expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Lane 1, molecular mass markers; lanes 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 are pairs of total E. coli lysates prepared from uninduced and induced cultures bearing the procollagenase and fusion-collagenase expression constructs, respectively. After electrophoresis(22Weingarten H. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

This autoprocessing event occurred since both the cysteine switch region and the upstream prosequence were omitted from the fusion proteins. The fusion protein was also shown to be fully active prior to autoactivation or proteolytic processing since it cleaved the Mca-peptide substrate (data not shown). Nevertheless, mature rMMP-1cd enzymes with different but homogeneous NH2-terminal residues could be generated from the fusion protein containing the last four wild type residues of the proMMP-1 sequence. Based on NH2-terminal sequencing, the Phe-81 form was generated by MMP-3cd-catalyzed activation (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Approximately 6 mg of purified Phe-81 rMMP-1cd was obtained per liter of induced E. coli culture. MMP-1cd activated by spontaneous autoproteolysis generated rMMP-1cd with Val-82 as the predominate NH2-terminal residue. However, autoactivation at higher concentrations of fusion protein resulted in accumulation of both Val-82 and Leu-83 in roughly equal proportions. Thus, enzyme concentration seems to shift the proteolytic specificity of this autoprocessing reaction. It is not known whether the Leu-83 NH2 terminus is generated by a primary cleavage or from subsequent cleavage of the Val-82 form. It is noteworthy that low concentrations of 1,10-phenanthroline were necessary for purifying the Phe-81 rMMP-1cd to high homogeneity, since it inhibited autoproteolysis and the accumulation of the Val-82 and Leu-83 forms. The purification scheme was therefore optimized to obtain the Phe-81 and Val-82 forms to high homogeneity (Fig. 3). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the Phe-81 form purification is shown in Fig. 4.Figure 3:Purification scheme.

The single and double arrowheads denote rMMP-1cd and ubiquitin released from the fusion protein after activation, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The second fusion protein, with the last four amino acid residues from the prosequence of MMP-3, was made to determine if the chimeric cleavage site became resistant to autoproteolytic cleavage and thus could result in higher yields of the Phe-81 form after the MMP-3 activation. During purification, more intact fusion protein was indeed observed in pooled Q-column fractions indicating a reduced level of autoproteolysis (data not shown). However, only 80% homogeneity of the Phe-81 form was attained after MMP-3 activation. On the other hand, NH2-terminal sequencing showed that the purified rMMP-1cd possessed Leu-83 homogeneously when allowed to autoprocess at 37°C. The yield of the Leu-83 form was slightly higher than 6 mg/liter of E. coli culture, since its purification did not require the S-100 column chromatographic step needed for the Phe-81 form. Therefore, with these two fusion proteins, we have generated three forms of rMMP-1cd: Phe-81, Val-82, and Leu-83. The degree of homogeneity for each form was determined by NH2-terminal sequence analysis. The data are summarized in Table 1.The carboxyl-terminal integrity of the Phe-81 form of rMMP-1cd was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. The main component of this sample had a molecular mass of 18,896.2 Da, which is essentially identical to the calculated rMMP-1cd (Phe-81 to Gln-249) molecular mass of 18,895.7 Da. However, two minor components comprising less than 5% of the total mass had molecular masses of 18,750 and 18,653 Da."
