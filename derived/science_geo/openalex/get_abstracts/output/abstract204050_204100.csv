https://openalex.org/W2162012704,"The synthesis of oxytocin (I), arginine-vasopressin (2)) and lysine-vasopressin (3-5) has opened the way for the synthesis of analogues of the natural hormones, thus affording an opportunity to study the relationship between structure and biological activity in these hormones. One of the most interesting analogues thus far prepared is arginine-vasotocin, an octapeptide amide containing the ring of oxytocin and the side chain of arginine-vasopressin. Some time after the synthesis of this substance and the investigation of some of its biological effects in this laboratory (6), the arginine-vasotocin was tentatively identified as a naturally occurring hormone in fowl neurohypophysial extracts by Munsick, Sawyer, and van Dyke (7-9) on the basis of pharmacological and chromatographic evidence. Chauvet, Lenci, and Acher (10) in a preliminary communication have reported the isolation of a peptide from fowl neurohypophysial extracts which appears to be arginine-vasotocin. Thus the evidence is convincing at the present time for the occurrence in nature of arginine-vasotocin. If further work substantiates this conclusion, the synthesis of this compound would represent a remarkable example of the synthesis of a polypeptide hormone before its identification as a natural product. Sawyer, Munsick, and van Dyke (8) have also studied neurohypophysial extracts from cold-blooded vertebrates and have advanced the hypothesis that arginine-vasotocin occurs not only in birds but also in reptiles, amphibians, and teleosts. Their evidence also indicates that it appears in the most primitive living vertebrates, the cyclostomes. The one elasmobranch (spiny dogfish) that they studied appeared to possess an active peptide unlike any that they had encountered elsewhere among the vertebrates. Pharmacological studies on the pituitaries of fish, fowl, and frogs by Pickering and Heller (11) also provided evidence for the presence of a peptide different from arginineor lysine-vasopressin in these species. Maetz et ~2. (12, 13) came to a similar conclusion with regard to cold-blooded vertebrates. More recently Acher et al. (14) isolated a substance from frog posterior pituitaries with a composition corresponding to that of arginine-vasotocin. Furthermore, the biological properties of the isolated product corresponded to those of synthetic arginine-vasotocin furnished to these investigators by our laboratory."

https://openalex.org/W161645565,"A chemical modification of a protein by a reagent is one of the most direct methods for determining a group active for a function of the protein, if it is established that the active group in the protein is specifically and stoichiometrically attacked by the reagent under mild conditions (1, 2). For example, information concerning the chemical structure of the active sites of several esterases recently has been obtained by the analysis of the com- pounds of the enzymes with organophosphorus reagents (3-10). Information on the chemical nature of the active site of myosin A-adenosine triphosphatase may be very useful for explanation of muscle contraction at the molecular level, but the chemical structure of the active site of ATPase remains somewhat obscure in spite of much effort by several investigators. Bailey and Perry (II) have reported that the -SH group is involved in the active site of myosin A-ATPase. Turba and Kuschinsky (12) and B&r&y and BBr&ny (13) have observed that myosin A- ATPase is inhibited by th8 modification of the amino group. In these studies, however, ATPase activity disappeared when a large number of the active groups in the myosin A molecule were modified by the reagents. The present authors have attempted to determine the chem- ical structure of the active site of the ATPase, with 2,4,6-trini- trobenzenesulfonate as a reagent which binds specifically and stoichiometrically with a site intimately related to the enzymatic activity. According to Satake et al. (14), TBS’ binds only to the amino group of the protein even at neutral pH and at low temperature. The TNP-amino acid is resistant to acid hydroly- sis and shows a specific absorption around 340 rnp. In the pres- ent report, it is shown that the specific binding of TBS to 2 moles of c-amino group of lysine residues per mole of myosin A reduces the ATPase activity of fresh myosin A, although the ATPase activity of aged myosin A is little changed. The polymer of myosin A, which is formed during storage, is disaggregated by this treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2412528645,"The utilization of glucose by striated muscle of the diabetic animal is markedly impaired. Whether this is a consequence of decreased cellular permeability to glucose or a diminution in the ability of muscle to phosphorylate glucose has not been resolved, since previous investigations have been concerned with measurements of utilization rates, a parameter which does not enable one to distinguish between transport and subsequent phosphorylation. Recent observations on intact animals (1) suggested that both processes are impaired in the diabetic state. A further exploration of this problem has been carried out in vitro with an intact rat diaphragm preparation with the glucose analogue 2-deosyglucose. This sugar is phosphorylated by hexokinase as rapidly as is glucose,’ but the phosphorylated product, 2-deoxyglucose g-phosphate, is not acted upon appreciably by other muscle enzymes and hence accumulates within the cell. These properties permitted the investigation of cellular penetration and phosphorylation as separate events. In the present paper it will be shown that there is a disturbance of both penetration and phosphorylation in diabetic muscle. The former is caused by a lack of insulin, whereas the latter can be attributed, at least in part, to the action of adrenal cortical secretions. Additional observations are recorded which indicate that the cut hemidiaphragm preparation is much more permeable to sugars than the intact preparation.*"
https://openalex.org/W114930231,"A body of evidence has accumulated which indicates that the :purine analogue, 8-azaguanine, has an inhibitory action upon protein synthesis. It has been shown in several laboratories that the production of certain inducible bacterial enzymes may be inhibited by this agent (14). It has also been reported by Mandel (5) that utilization of methionine-Ss5 and cystine-S35 for protein synthesis was markedly depressed in cultures of Bacillus cereus exposed to 8-azaguanine. Antibody production in the mouse may be suppressed by the administration of 8-azaguanine (6), and an effect upon hemoglobin synthesis in the deembryonated chick blastoderm has been noted (7). Although these studies point to an inhibition of protein synthesis as a possible major site of 8-azaguanine action they do not explain the mechanism by which inhibitions occur. These effects could be the result of a direct action on one or more of the biochemical mechanisms intimately involved in protein synthesis, or they could be merely a secondary phenomenon resulting from a more distant biochemical action, e.g. interference with a fundamental process such as phosphorylation, electron transport, amine acid metabolism, etc. To lay a proper foundation for the investigation of the mechanism in a cell-free system from rat liver, the effect of %aaaguanine upon the synthesis of several inducible hepatic enzymes in the rat was investigated."

Evidence is presented that the final preparation is a lipoprotein-sodium deoxycholate complex. An assay procedure with an aqueous medium is presented. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and ferricyanide inhibit the enzyme, whereas iodoacetamide and diisopropyl fluorophos- phate do not, at the concentrations tested. The possible role of the enzyme in the biosynthesis and breakdown of chlorophyll and in the formation of lamellas of the chloroplast is discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2093121897,"A study of the segregation of markers closely linked to the gray ascospore color locus in Sordaria fimicola reveals that there is a high incidence of crossing over very near the locus when it transreplicates, which is much more pronounced in 5:3 than in 6:2 asci. Also, a single 7:1 and several aberrant 4:4 asci are described. At a different spore color locus, transreplication yields only 6:2 ratios, while other spore color loci fail to transreplicate altogether."

https://openalex.org/W2009866496,"FEW data are available on the determination of glycoproteins containing sialic acid in tumour tissues, although the presence of an acid mucopolysaccharide in some kinds of tumour tissue has been reported. We determined the hexosamine and sialic acid contents in tumour cells, the HeLa cells and C3H ascitic hepatoma cells of different types, comparing them with those of non-malignant cells. The liver cells of C3H mice, and FL cells obtained by a tissue culture were used as non-malignant cells. The liver cell is generally considered to be a good example of the basic cell type. The types of the C3H ascitic hepatoma used were MH 134, MH 129 P and MH 129 F 1, which were inoculated into (C3H/HeNdd) F 1 hybrid mice, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. The cells from solid tissue were prepared by use of a tissue presser. The cells were dried with acetone after washing with saline solution. The results of the determination are summarized in Table 1."

Over 75,000 individual tests of cattle erythrocytes were made. When the laboratories tested duplicate samples without knowing they were duplicates, the results were in agreement 99 percent of the time. Tests on samples from the same 199 animals with 56 different reagents from two or more of the laboratories showed agreement 89 percent of the time. The agreement was unexpectedly good, since the primary purpose of the tests was to allow comparison of independently developed reagents and since the sources of error were numerous."

https://openalex.org/W1988731946,"WITH the development of highly sensitive γ-ray detectors, it has become possible to carry out nondestructive measurements of the low levels of γ-ray activity emitted by various biological materials. Since γ-ray measurements may be made rapidly without any special preparation or modification of the material measured, the application of this technique to agricultural research problems has much to recommend it. The advantages of the nondestructive γ-ray measurement technique appear to justify exploratory research to determine if such measurements may be used to estimate other factors to which they may be related1."

https://openalex.org/W1988338585,"RADIATION-INDUCED reactions in aqueous solutions of amino-acids, peptides, and related compounds have been treated in a number of reports from this Laboratory1. In connexion with this work, we have had occasion to examine the effects of γ-irradiation on the ultra-violet absorption spectra of solutions of various simple peptides. The measurements reveal that solutions of the cyclic dipeptides under specific conditions exhibit pronounced and characteristic post-irradiation changes. If, for example, an oxygen-free solution of alanine anhydride is irradiated and examined spectrophotometrically, the differential spectrum (read against unirradiated solution) shows negligible absorption above 2600 Å. so long as the solution is not exposed to the atmosphere. However, if oxygen is introduced, an absorption maximum in the longer wave-length region slowly appears. This post-irradiation change is accelerated by addition of either acid or base. In neutral and basic solution the absorption maximum is at about 320 mµ ; in acid solution the maximum shifts to 340 mµ. This shift is reversible, and the evidence is that the final yield of the absorbing species is essentially independent of the pH of the solution during the post-irradiation oxidation. Solutions of glycine anhydride exhibit quite similar properties except that the wavelength of maximum absorption (320 mµ) is independent of pH. It is also to be noted that these post-irradiation changes are not observed if oxygen is present during irradiation."
