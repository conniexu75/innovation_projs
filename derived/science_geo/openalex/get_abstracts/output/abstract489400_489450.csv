The immune system provides protection from the environment and is critically important for multiple aspects of mammalian biology. It consists of an adaptive component that generates specific antibodies and cells through clonal selection, and an innate component that utilizes preformed receptors. Innate immunity offers the first line of defense against infections and hazards by directly recognizing conserved pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) to alert the immune system (Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Innate immune recognition: mechanisms and pathways.Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Inflammasomes are key components of innate immunity inside the cell. They are formed in response to PAMPs and DAMPs and activate inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1 and -11 (Franchi et al., 2012Franchi L. Muñoz-Planillo R. Núñez G. Sensing and reacting to microbes through the inflammasomes.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012Lamkanfi M. Dixit V.M.

Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Caspase activation can lead to proteolytic maturation of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 and elicit the inflammatory form of cell death pyroptosis, as ways to control exogenous and endogenous invasions. Inflammasomes are supramolecular assemblies composed of at least a sensor protein and a caspase and often the adaptor protein ASC. Based on the domain architecture of the sensor protein, inflammasomes may be divided into two families. The first family is known as ALR (Absent in Melanoma 2 [AIM2]-like receptor), named after the first identified member (Figure 1A). ALRs are composed of an N-terminal PYD and one or two HIN domains (Rathinam et al., 2012Rathinam V.A. Vanaja S.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). AIM2 directly senses the cytosolic PAMPs double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs), such as those associated with viruses, using its HIN domain (Jin et al., 2012Jin T. Perry A. Jiang J. Smith P. Curry J.A. Unterholzner L. Jiang Z. Horvath G. Rathinam V.A.

Vanaja S.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The second class of inflammasomes contains receptors in the NLR (nucleotide-binding domain [NBD] and leucine rich repeat [LRR]-containing receptors) family (Figure 1A). NBD belongs to the AAA+ superfamily of ATPase domains. Most NLRs contain an N-terminal PYD and are known as NLRPs. The best-studied NLRP3 inflammasome is activated following a wide range of pathogen and danger signals, including extracellular ATP and uric acid crystals (Franchi et al., 2012Franchi L. Muñoz-Planillo R. Núñez G. Sensing and reacting to microbes through the inflammasomes.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012Lamkanfi M.

Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Upon activation, both AIM2 and NLRP3 recruit the PYD- and CARD-containing bipartite adaptor ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through PYD/PYD interactions (Masumoto et al., 1999Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. ASC, a novel 22-kDa protein, aggregates during apoptosis of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). ASC, in turn, recruits caspase-1 through CARD/CARD interactions (Figure 1A). PYD and CARD both belong to the death domain (DD) fold superfamily (Ferrao and Wu, 2012Ferrao R. Wu H. Helical assembly in the death domain (DD) superfamily.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), for which structures of two defined DD helical assemblies are known (Lin et al., 2010Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. Wu H.

Malfunctioning of inflammasomes is associated with serious human diseases (Strowig et al., 2012Strowig T. Henao-Mejia J. Elinav E. Flavell R. Inflammasomes in health and disease.Nature. 2012; 481: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). Mutations in inflammasome proteins NLRP3, NLRP12, and MEFV (also known as Pyrin) are linked to autoinflammatory and fever syndromes (Rathinam et al., 2012Rathinam V.A. Vanaja S.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Aberrations in NLR inflammasome activation have been connected to psoriasis, type II diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease (Franchi et al., 2012Franchi L. Muñoz-Planillo R. Núñez G. Sensing and reacting to microbes through the inflammasomes.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012Lamkanfi M. Dixit V.M.

Inflammasomes in health and disease.Nature. 2012; 481: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). The PYD-less ALR member, mouse p202, interacts with the HIN domain of AIM2 to inhibit inflammasome and potentiate lupus (Yin et al., 2013Yin Q. Sester D.P. Tian Y. Hsiao Y.S. Lu A. Cridland J.A. Sagulenko V. Thygesen S.J. Choubey D. Hornung V. et al.Molecular mechanism for p202-mediated specific inhibition of AIM2 inflammasome activation.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 327-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that transfected full-length ASC (ASCFL) and endogenous ASC upon stimulation both form speck-like aggregates (Masumoto et al., 1999Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. ASC, a novel 22-kDa protein, aggregates during apoptosis of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Because transfected PYD and CARD-only ASC fragments are filamentous (Masumoto et al., 2001Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Sagara J. Pyrin N-terminal homology domain- and caspase recruitment domain-dependent oligomerization of ASC.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the specks are most likely dense, crosslinked composites of PYD and CARD filaments. Because of the strong tendency of ASC to aggregate, the structures of ASC PYD (ASCPYD) and ASCFL were solved in monomeric states using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at acidic conditions (de Alba, 2009de Alba E. Structure and interdomain dynamics of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32932-32941Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Liepinsh et al., 2003Liepinsh E. Barbals R. Dahl E. Sharipo A. Staub E. Otting G. The death-domain fold of the ASC PYRIN domain, presenting a basis for PYRIN/PYRIN recognition.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although additional monomeric PYD structures have been reported, including those of NLRP3 (Bae and Park, 2011Bae J.Y. Park H.H. Crystal structure of NALP3 protein pyrin domain (PYD) and its implications in inflammasome assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 39528-39536Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and AIM2 (Jin et al., 2013Jin T. Perry A. Smith P.T. Jiang J. Xiao T.S. Structure of the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) pyrin domain provides insights into the mechanisms of AIM2 autoinhibition and inflammasome assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 13225-13235Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the mode of homo- and hetero-PYD associations is entirely unknown. Here, we used in vitro reconstitution, electron microscopy (EM) and polymerization assays to address assembly mechanisms for ASC-dependent AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. In contrast to the presumption that the different domain structures of AIM2 and NLRP3 may lead to considerable differences in the inflammasome architectures, we showed that both AIM2 upon dsDNA interaction and NLRP3 oligomerized through its NBD nucleate ASCPYD filaments. This is particularly surprising for NLRP3 due to the domain similarity of NLRs to Apaf-1-like molecules that form ring-like platforms (Yuan and Akey, 2013Yuan S. Akey C.W. Apoptosome structure, assembly, and procaspase activation.Structure. 2013; 21: 501-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The overarching paradigm had presumed that NLR inflammasomes are also ring-like structures. The flexibly linked ASC CARD (ASCCARD) then clusters along the ASCPYD filament to act as the platform for caspase-1CARD filament formation, leading to proximity-induced caspase dimerization and activation. The ternary inflammasome complex showed star-shaped branched filamentous morphology and exhibited unequal stoichiometries among the component proteins. We determined the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the ASCPYD filament at near-atomic resolution through helical reconstruction. The structure revealed molecular details of ASCPYD/ASCPYD interactions and allowed modeling of AIM2PYD/ASCPYD and NLRP3PYD/ASCPYD interactions. Structure-based mutagenesis confirmed the importance of ASCPYD/ASCPYD, AIM2PYD/ASCPYD, and NLRP3PYD/ASCPYD interactions in vitro and in cells. EM of immunoprecipitated endogenous NLRP3 inflammasome showed similar filamentous morphology as in-vitro-reconstituted inflammasomes and quantitative western blotting confirmed the overstoichiometry of caspase-1 to ASC. Our studies collectively revealed a universal assembly process for ASC-dependent inflammasomes in both ALR and NLR families that involves nucleation-induced polymerization. To elucidate the assembly mechanisms for ASC-containing inflammasomes, we first reconstituted the interaction between AIM2 and ASC. Coexpression of AIM2PYD with ASCPYD showed that the complex eluted at the void position of a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Figure S1A available online), suggesting formation of large “aggregates.” We used EM to visualize the negatively stained AIM2PYD/ASCPYD complex, which revealed filaments with uniform diameters of ∼9 nm (Figure 1B). AIM2PYD exists in substoichiometric molar ratio in the AIM2PYD/ASCPYD complex (Figures S1A and 1C). To understand this observation, we generated a construct of AIM2PYD capable of enzymatic biotinylation during expression. Coexpression of the AIM2PYD construct with ASCPYD generated a complex with specific biotinylation of AIM2PYD, shown by streptavidin western blotting (Figure 1C). Labeling biotinylated AIM2PYD by 6 nm streptavidin-gold particles showed that AIM2PYD is localized at one end of the filaments (Figure 1D). The number of bound gold particles varies between one and several, consistent with the ability of AIM2PYD to form filaments when expressed alone (Figure S1B). In the presence of ASCPYD, AIM2PYD preferentially associated with ASCPYD to generate short heterogeneous AIM2PYD filaments in complex with much longer ASCPYD filaments. In contrast, Ni-NTA-gold labeling of His-tagged ASCPYD in the biotinylated AIM2PYD/ASCPYD complex showed uniform distribution along the filaments (Figure S1C), confirming that ASCPYD forms the main filament body. The end labeling of AIM2PYD suggested its role as the nucleator for directional polymerization of ASCPYD. To quantitatively assess ASCPYD filament formation, we set up a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay in vitro using a His-MBP-ASCPYD fusion construct with an added C-terminal Cys for conjugating with Alexa 488 fluorophore. The large fusion tag MBP inhibited ASCPYD polymerization to enable His-MBP-ASCPYD to be expressed in the monomeric form (Figure S1D). Polymerization of Alexa-488-labeled monomeric ASCPYD was initiated by addition of the TEV protease to remove His-MBP from the fusion protein. The increase in FP, which indicates ASCPYD polymerization, was monitored as a function of time (Figure 1E). Although ASCPYD did polymerize on its own upon His-MBP removal, the rates of polymerization were dramatically enhanced in the presence of increasing amounts of substoichiometric AIM2PYD (1/16–1/2 molar ratios) (Figure 1E). The initial drop in FP corresponded with His-MBP removal by TEV and the decrease in size of ASCPYD. At 5 min after TEV addition, about 75% His-MBP was removed from the fusion protein (Figure S1E). The AIM2PYD/ASCPYD filaments generated from the polymerization assay (Figure S1F) showed similar morphology to the coexpressed complex (Figure 1B). Full-length AIM2 (AIM2FL) is a cytosolic dsDNA sensor in which the interaction of its C-terminal HIN domain with dsDNA induces ASC recruitment and inflammasome formation. The PYD in AIM2 has been shown to interact with its HIN domain to provide autoinhibition in the absence of dsDNA binding (Jin et al., 2013Jin T. Perry A. Smith P.T. Jiang J. Xiao T.S. Structure of the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) pyrin domain provides insights into the mechanisms of AIM2 autoinhibition and inflammasome assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 13225-13235Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To reconstitute AIM2 inflammasome activation in vitro, we expressed AIM2FL as a His-MBP fusion. Purified His-MBP-AIM2FL was first incubated with equimolar 300 bp dsDNA (molar ratio calculated based on 10 bp footprint of AIM2 on dsDNA), followed by mixing with Alexa-488-labeled His-MBP-ASCPYD. TEV was added to remove His-MBP to initiate ASCPYD polymerization as monitored by FP (Figure 1F). A dramatic increase in FP was observed upon activation of AIM2FL by dsDNA, recapitulating the cellular event of inflammasome activation. These data suggest that overcome of autoinhibition and oligomerization of AIM2 by dsDNAs are crucial for inducing ASCPYD polymerization. NLRs share similar domain architectures and are recognized to be autoinhibited in the absence of suitable ligands. In NLRC4, an NLR with a CARD, its LRR domain plays an important role in inhibiting NLR oligomerization (Hu et al., 2013Hu Z. Yan C. Liu P. Huang Z. Ma R. Zhang C. Wang R. Zhang Y. Martinon F. Miao D. et al.Crystal structure of NLRC4 reveals its autoinhibition mechanism.Science. 2013; 341: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Due to their domain similarity to Apaf-1-like molecules that form ring-like platforms through the NBDs to induce caspase activation and apoptosis (Yuan and Akey, 2013Yuan S. Akey C.W. Apoptosome structure, assembly, and procaspase activation.Structure. 2013; 21: 501-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the overarching paradigm appears to presume that NLRP inflammasomes are also ring-like structures organized by the NBD. Formation of filamentous structures in the AIM2PYD/ASCPYD interaction prompted us to examine ASC-dependent NLRP inflammasomes using the prototypical member NLRP3. We expressed and purified NLRP3PYD, NLRP3PYD-NBD, and NLRP3FL. Although AIM2PYD exists as filamentous oligomers and was sufficient in promoting ASCPYD polymerization, NLRP3PYD is a monomer and did not cause significant enhancement in ASCPYD polymerization (Figure 2A). Both insect cell and E. coli expressed NLRP3PYD-NBD with inclusion of the NBD eluted from the void position of a Superdex 200 gel filtration column and induced greatly increased ASCPYD polymerization (Figure 2B). In comparison, NLRP3PYD-NBD is a much stronger promoter of ASCPYD polymerization than AIM2PYD; it caused significant enhancement of ASCPYD polymerization at a low 1:1,600 molar ratio (Figure 2B). Notably, under the physiological intracellular condition of 140 mM KCl and 10 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) and a lower ASC concentration, ASCPYD did not significantly polymerize unless increasing amounts of NLRP3PYD-NBD were added (Figure S2A), suggesting that ASC does not polymerize under steady physiological state without stimulation. The PYD of NLRP3 is required for ASCPYD polymerization because NLRP3PYD-NBD proteins with mutations on PYD are compromised in this function (see below), suggesting that NBD-oligomerized NLRP3PYD forms the platform for ASCPYD polymerization.Figure S2NLPR3FL and NLRP3PYD-NBD, but Not NLRP3PYD, Promote ASCPYD Filament Formation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) NLRP3PYD-NBD nucleates ASCPYD filament formation (1.4 μM) at the physiological intracellular condition of 140 mM KCl and 10 mM NaCl at pH7.4.

Insect-cell-expressed NLRP3FL showed a wide distribution on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Figure S2B). In keeping with autoinhibition in NLRP3FL as in NLRC4 (Hu et al., 2013Hu Z. Yan C. Liu P. Huang Z. Ma R. Zhang C. Wang R. Zhang Y. Martinon F. Miao D. et al.Crystal structure of NLRC4 reveals its autoinhibition mechanism.Science. 2013; 341: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we found that even the highly aggregated NLRP3FL showed less activity than NLRP3PYD-NBD in promoting ASCPYD polymerization because more molar quantities of NLRP3FL were required to achieve similar degrees of FP enhancement (Figures 2B and 2C). Despite being activated by an extensive list of stimuli, it is uncertain what constitutes the direct activator of NLRP3 (Rathinam et al., 2012Rathinam V.A. Vanaja S.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Regulation of inflammasome signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). We found that addition of ATP enhanced the less aggregated fractions of recombinant NLRP3FL in activating ASCPYD polymerization (Figure 2D); however, this activation is minimal in comparison. It is likely that ATP binding by the NBD is associated with, but not sufficient for, NLRP3 activation. Induction of ASCPYD polymerization by NLRP3 suggests that NLRP3 may reside at the end of ASCPYD filaments. We generated a His-MBP-NLRP3PYD-NBD construct capable of enzymatic biotinylation during expression. We mixed purified His-MBP-NLRP3PYD-NBD-Biotin with His-MBP-ASCPYD and added the TEV protease to cleave off His-MBP to allow ASCPYD polymerization. The purified NLRP3-Biotin/ASC complex was subjected to negative-stain EM and 6 nm streptavidin-gold labeling, which confirmed localization of NLRP3 to the end of ASCPYD filaments (Figure 2E). Using negative-stain EM, we showed that purified NLRP3PYD-NBD is heterogeneous with a mixture of disk-like structures and filaments (Figure S2C). The latter may represent the spiral, lock washer-like mode of oligomerization of the NBD. To generate a homogeneous population of ASCPYD filaments without the AIM2 or NLRP3 nucleators, we used in vitro ASCPYD polymerization starting from purified monomeric His-MBP-ASCPYD (Figure S1D). Upon TEV treatment to cleave off His-MBP, ASCPYD filaments spontaneously formed as shown by cryo-EM (Figure 3A). Cryo-EM images were collected using automated data acquisition on a Titan Krios with a Falcon II direct electron detector. Averaged power spectra of segments from cryo-EM images of the helical filaments showed a strong meridional reflection at 1/13.9 Å−1, which corresponds to the reciprocal of the axial rise but exhibited variable twist (Figures 3B and 3C), like many other helical polymers (Egelman et al., 1982Egelman E.H. Francis N. DeRosier D.J. F-actin is a helix with a random variable twist.Nature. 1982; 298: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The magnitude of this variation can be seen in Movie S1. Images were processed using the Iterative Helical Real Space Reconstruction (IHRSR) method with a solid cylinder as the initial reference (Egelman, 2000Egelman E.H. A robust algorithm for the reconstruction of helical filaments using single-particle methods.Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The helical heterogeneity was dealt with by sorting images by twist to generate a subset with similar helical parameters, resulting in a map at ∼6 Å resolution. Correction of out-of-plane tilt was applied to further improve the map to a conservatively estimated resolution of ∼3.8 Å, as determined by both Fourier shell correlation (FSC) (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003Rosenthal P.B. Henderson R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 721-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A) and comparison with the final atomic model (Figures S3B and S3C). Rigid-body fitting of the NMR structure of ASCPYD (Liepinsh et al., 2003Liepinsh E. Barbals R. Dahl E. Sharipo A. Staub E. Otting G. The death-domain fold of the ASC PYRIN domain, presenting a basis for PYRIN/PYRIN recognition.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) into the cryo-EM map generated a pseudo atomic model of the ASCPYD filament. The fit of the NMR structure resolved the enantiomorphic ambiguity in EM reconstructions, but even without the NMR structure the hand of the α helices in the reconstruction was clear, eliminating such ambiguities. The rigid-body fit was followed by real-space refinement (Schröder et al., 2007Schröder G.F. Brunger A.T. Levitt M. Combining efficient conformational sampling with a deformable elastic network model facilitates structure refinement at low resolution.Structure. 2007; 15: 1630-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to generate a final atomic model with clearly defined side chain densities (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3D). The ASCPYD filament is hollow with inner and outer diameters of ∼20 and ∼90 Å, respectively (Figure 4A). The polar filament has a C3 point group symmetry with 53° right-handed rotation and 14.0 Å axial rise per subunit, after correcting for a mean out-of-plane tilt of ∼6°. The structure of ASCPYD in the filament exhibits conformational differences with that of ASCPYD alone (Figure 4B). This is apparent in the highly variable α2-α3 loop and the short α3 helix, with clear cryo-EM density (Figure S4A). PYDs share a unique feature: the α3 helix is shortened or missing and follows the long and flexible α2-α3 loop (Figure S4B). The conformational changes are likely due to participation of this region in all three types of interactions in the filament (see below and Figure S3D). Although the ASCPYD alone structure was determined at a pH below 4.0 (Liepinsh et al., 2003Liepinsh E. Barbals R. Dahl E. Sharipo A. Staub E. Otting G.

Biol. 2003; 332: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), lack of significant conformational differences elsewhere and absence of acidic residues in α3 helix support the structural changes as due to filament formation. Among known PYD structures, NLRP3PYD and ASC2PYD possess a conformation similar to the filament conformation of ASCPYD (Figure 4C), suggesting that NLRP3PYD and ASC2PYD may be better interactors with ASCPYD. The former similarity may account for the high efficiency of NLRP3PYD-NBD in promoting ASCPYD polymerization (Figure 2B). ASC2 is a PYD only protein that is highly homologous to ASCPYD and has been shown to associate with ASC to modulate caspase-1 activation (Stehlik et al., 2003Stehlik C. Krajewska M. Welsh K. Krajewski S. Godzik A. Reed J.C. The PAAD/PYRIN-only protein POP1/ASC2 is a modulator of ASC-mediated nuclear-factor-kappa B and pro-caspase-1 regulation.Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). If ASC2 can be incorporated into ASCPYD filaments but lacks the effector CARD, it could inhibit caspase-1 recruitment and activation. One face of a cross-section of the filament is largely negatively charged, whereas the opposite face is largely positively charged (Figure 4D), suggesting the role of charge complementarity in filament assembly. There are three major asymmetric interfaces (types I, II, and III) in the filament, one within each of the three-start helical strands (type I), and two between the strands (types II and III) (Figure 4E). Remarkably, despite being within the DD superfamily, the PYD/PYD interactions show remarkable differences to the DD complex structures (Figures 4F and S4C–S4E; Table S1). If one of the subunits is aligned, the corresponding partner subunit would need to rotate by 15°–26°, 21°–35°, and 18°–52° for"

Notably, the visual response of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) is enhanced by locomotion, a tractable and accessible example of a time-locked change in cortical state. The neural circuits that transmit behavioral state to sensory cortex to produce this modulation are unknown. In vivo calcium imaging of behaving animals revealed that locomotion activates vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive neurons in mouse V1 independent of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from basal forebrain. Optogenetic activation of VIP neurons increased V1 visual responses in stationary awake mice, artificially mimicking the effect of locomotion, and photolytic damage of VIP neurons abolished the enhancement of V1 responses by locomotion. These findings establish a cortical circuit for the enhancement of visual response by locomotion and provide a potential common circuit for the modulation of sensory processing by behavioral state."

Using high-resolution crystallography, Diebolder et al. (p. 1260 ) show that human IgGs form hexameric structures by interacting with neighboring IgG molecules, and the complex then activates complement. Thus, IgG molecules and the complement system can coexist in the blood because complement activation will only be triggered after IgG senses a surface antigen and starts to aggregate."
https://openalex.org/W2078819049,"Pathogens and cellular danger signals activate sensors such as RIG-I and NLRP3 to produce robust immune and inflammatory responses through respective adaptor proteins MAVS and ASC, which harbor essential N-terminal CARD and PYRIN domains, respectively. Here, we show that CARD and PYRIN function as bona fide prions in yeast and that their prion forms are inducible by their respective upstream activators. Likewise, a yeast prion domain can functionally replace CARD and PYRIN in mammalian cell signaling. Mutations in MAVS and ASC that disrupt their prion activities in yeast also abrogate their ability to signal in mammalian cells. Furthermore, fibers of recombinant PYRIN can convert ASC into functional polymers capable of activating caspase-1. Remarkably, a conserved fungal NOD-like receptor and prion pair can functionally reconstitute signaling of NLRP3 and ASC PYRINs in mammalian cells. These results indicate that prion-like polymerization is a conserved signal transduction mechanism in innate immunity and inflammation."

The transcription factor SPI-C is selectively expressed by RPM and is required for their development, but the physiologic stimulus inducing Spic is unknown. Here, we report that Spic also regulated the development of F4/80(+)VCAM1(+) bone marrow macrophages (BMM) and that Spic expression in BMM and RPM development was induced by heme, a metabolite of erythrocyte degradation. Pathologic hemolysis induced loss of RPM and BMM due to excess heme but induced Spic in monocytes to generate new RPM and BMM. Spic expression in monocytes was constitutively inhibited by the transcriptional repressor BACH1. Heme induced proteasome-dependent BACH1 degradation and rapid Spic derepression. Furthermore, cysteine-proline dipeptide motifs in BACH1 that mediate heme-dependent degradation were necessary for Spic induction by heme. These findings are the first example of metabolite-driven differentiation of a tissue-resident macrophage subset and provide new insights into iron homeostasis."

Despite the established role of the HBP in metabolism and multiple diseases, regulation of the HBP remains largely undefined. Here, we show that spliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s), the most conserved signal transducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a direct transcriptional activator of the HBP. We demonstrate that the UPR triggers HBP activation via Xbp1s-dependent transcription of genes coding for key, rate-limiting enzymes. We further establish that this previously unrecognized UPR-HBP axis is triggered in a variety of stress conditions. Finally, we demonstrate a physiologic role for the UPR-HBP axis by showing that acute stimulation of Xbp1s in heart by ischemia/reperfusion confers robust cardioprotection in part through induction of the HBP. Collectively, these studies reveal that Xbp1s couples the UPR to the HBP to protect cells under stress."

Correct folding of ER proteins requires covalent attachment of N-linked glycan oligosaccharides. Here, we report that increased synthesis of N-glycan precursors in the hexosamine pathway improves ER protein homeostasis and extends lifespan in C. elegans. Addition of the N-glycan precursor N-acetylglucosamine to the growth medium slows aging in wild-type animals and alleviates pathology of distinct neurotoxic disease models. Our data suggest that reduced aggregation of metastable proteins and lifespan extension depend on enhanced ER-associated protein degradation, proteasomal activity, and autophagy. Evidently, hexosamine pathway activation or N-acetylglucosamine supplementation induces distinct protein quality control mechanisms, which may allow therapeutic intervention against age-related and proteotoxic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2062899786,"The giant elastic protein titin is a determinant factor in how much blood fills the left ventricle during diastole and thus in the etiology of heart disease. Titin has been identified as a target of S-glutathionylation, an end product of the nitric-oxide-signaling cascade that increases cardiac muscle elasticity. However, it is unknown how S-glutathionylation may regulate the elasticity of titin and cardiac tissue. Here, we show that mechanical unfolding of titin immunoglobulin (Ig) domains exposes buried cysteine residues, which then can be S-glutathionylated. S-glutathionylation of cryptic cysteines greatly decreases the mechanical stability of the parent Ig domain as well as its ability to fold. Both effects favor a more extensible state of titin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that S-glutathionylation of cryptic cysteines in titin mediates mechanochemical modulation of the elasticity of human cardiomyocytes. We propose that posttranslational modification of cryptic residues is a general mechanism to regulate tissue elasticity."

The crystal structure of the SET domain of the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methyltransferase ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN 5 (ATXR5) in complex with a H3.1 peptide shows that ATXR5 contains a bipartite catalytic domain that specifically ""reads"" alanine-31 of H3.1. Variation at position 31 between H3.1 and replication-independent H3.3 is conserved in plants and animals, and threonine-31 in H3.3 is responsible for inhibiting the activity of ATXR5 and its paralog, ATXR6. Our results suggest a simple model for the mitotic inheritance of the heterochromatic mark H3K27me1 and the protection of H3.3-enriched genes against heterochromatization during DNA replication."

Although a fair amount is known about the molecular regulation of limb initiation and outgrowth, the cellular events underlying these processes have remained less clear. We show that the mesenchymal limb progenitors arise through localized epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the coelomic epithelium specifically within the presumptive limb fields. This EMT is regulated at least in part by Tbx5 and Fgf10, two genes known to control limb initiation. This work shows that limb buds initiate earlier than previously thought, as a result of localized EMT rather than differential proliferation rates."

Here, we use Drosophila neuroblasts to demonstrate that the SWI/SNF component Osa (ARID1) prevents tumorigenesis by ensuring correct lineage progression in stem cell lineages. We show that Osa induces a transcriptional program in the transit-amplifying population that initiates temporal patterning, limits self-renewal, and prevents dedifferentiation. We identify the Prdm protein Hamlet as a key component of this program. Hamlet is directly induced by Osa and regulates the progression of progenitors through distinct transcriptional states to limit the number of transit-amplifying divisions. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the widespread tumor suppressor activity of SWI/SNF. Because the Hamlet homologs Evi1 and Prdm16 are frequently mutated in cancer, this mechanism could well be conserved in human stem cell lineages.PaperClip/cms/asset/d2d25eb5-ed8e-4e55-9fbd-5b03e969e940/mmc9.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 4.59 MB) Download audio"

https://openalex.org/W1965606791,"Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is essential for innate defense against influenza virus in mice and humans. IFITM3 localizes to endolysosomes where it prevents virus fusion, although mechanisms controlling its trafficking to this cellular compartment are not fully understood. We determined that both mouse and human IFITM3 are phosphorylated by the protein-tyrosine kinase FYN on tyrosine 20 (Tyr(20)) and that mouse IFITM3 is also phosphorylated on the non-conserved Tyr(27). Phosphorylation led to a cellular redistribution of IFITM3, including plasma membrane accumulation. Mutation of Tyr(20) caused a similar redistribution of IFITM3 and resulted in decreased antiviral activity against influenza virus, whereas Tyr(27) mutation of mouse IFITM3 showed minimal effects on localization or activity. Using FYN knockout cells, we also found that IFITM3 phosphorylation is not a requirement for its antiviral activity. Together, these results indicate that Tyr(20) is part of an endocytosis signal that can be blocked by phosphorylation or by mutation of this residue. Further mutagenesis narrowed this endocytosis-controlling region to four residues conforming to a YXXΦ (where X is any amino acid and Φ is Val, Leu, or Ile) endocytic motif that, when transferred to CD4, resulted in its internalization from the cell surface. Additionally, we found that phosphorylation of IFITM3 by FYN and mutagenesis of Tyr(20) both resulted in decreased IFITM3 ubiquitination. Overall, these results suggest that modification of Tyr(20) may serve in a cellular checkpoint controlling IFITM3 trafficking and degradation and demonstrate the complexity of posttranslational regulation of IFITM3."

Here we demonstrate the expression, isolation, and basic characterization of zebrafish VDAC2 (zfVDAC2). Further, we resolved the structure of zfVDAC2 at 2.8 Å resolution, revealing a crystallographic dimer. The dimer orientation was confirmed in solution by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and by cross-linking experiments disclosing a dimer population of ∼20% in lauryldimethine amine oxide detergent micelles, whereas in lipidic bicelles a higher population of dimeric and higher order oligomers species were observed.

The discovery of new lipid droplet-associated proteins added complexity to the current model of lipolysis. In this study, we used cultured human adipocytes to demonstrate that fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27), an abundantly expressed protein in adipocytes, regulates both basal and stimulated lipolysis by interacting with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, also called desnutrin or PNPLA2). We identified a core domain of FSP27, amino acids 120-220, that interacts with ATGL to inhibit its lipolytic function and promote triglyceride storage. We also defined the role of FSP27 in free fatty acid-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes. FSP27 depletion in human adipocytes increased lipolysis and inhibited insulin signaling by decreasing AKT phosphorylation. However, reducing lipolysis by either depletion of ATGL or expression of exogenous full-length FSP27 or amino acids 120-220 protected human adipocytes against the adverse effects of free fatty acids on insulin signaling. In embryonic fibroblasts derived from ATGL KO mice, exogenous free fatty acids did not affect insulin sensitivity. Our results demonstrate a crucial role for FSP27-ATGL interactions in regulating lipolysis, triglyceride accumulation, and insulin signaling in human adipocytes."

Here, we report that musashi (msi-1) is necessary for time-dependent memory loss in C. elegans. Tissue-specific rescue demonstrates that MSI-1 function is necessary in the AVA interneuron. Using RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (IP), we found that MSI-1 binds to mRNAs of three subunits of the Arp2/3 actin branching regulator complex in vivo and downregulates ARX-1, ARX-2, and ARX-3 translation upon associative learning. The role of msi-1 in forgetting is also reflected by the persistence of learning-induced GLR-1 synaptic size increase in msi-1 mutants. We demonstrate that memory length is regulated cooperatively through the activation of adducin (add-1) and by the inhibitory effect of msi-1. Thus, a GLR-1/MSI-1/Arp2/3 pathway induces forgetting and represents a novel mechanism of memory decay by linking translational control to the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons."

Lantibiotics: peptides of diverse structure and function.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Lantibiotics are chemically and structurally very diverse; two subgroups of lantibiotics have been distinguished, based on differences in their structures and modes of action (6.Sahl H.G. Bierbaum G.

Type A lantibiotics, such as nisin, are screw-shaped, elongated, flexible, and amphiphatic peptides with an overall positive net charge and pore-forming activities. Type B lantibiotics, e.g. mersacidin, are globular and carry either no net charge or are negatively charged. A more recent classification of lantibiotics in different subgroups has been proposed, based on the organization of their biosynthetic genes and enzymes, rather than on the activity profile or three-dimensional structure (3.Chatterjee C.

The activity of lantibiotics is based on different killing mechanisms, which may be combined in one molecule. The most extensively studied lantibiotic is nisin (8.Rogers L.

It is produced by some Lactococcus lactis and widely used as a food preservative for more than 40 years. Like many lantibiotics nisin inhibits growth of Gram-positive bacterial strains by interfering with peptidoglycan through binding to the key intermediate lipid II (9.Breukink E.

Lipid II represents the central cell wall building block of peptidoglycan biosynthesis that is structurally conserved among eubacteria. The precursor consists of the bactoprenol carrier lipid (C55-P), and is linked to the peptidoglycan building block N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide-N-acetylglucosamine (MurNAc-pp-GlcNAc) via a pyrophosphate bridge. Lipid II synthesis occurs at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, where the translocase MraY and the transferase MurG link the soluble, UDP-activated sugars UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid-pentapeptide and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to produce lipid I and lipid II, respectively. Lipid II is characteristically modified in different species. In staphylococci, the peptidyltransferases FemXAB catalyze the attachment of a pentaglycine-interpeptide bridge (13.Schneider T.

The fully modified lipid II molecule is then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane (16.Van Heijenoort Y. Derrien M. Van Heijenoort J. Polymerization by transglycosylation in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan of Escherichia coli K12 and its inhibition by antibiotics.FEBS Lett. 1978; 89: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) where it is assembled into the growing peptidoglycan network through the activity of transglycosylases and transpeptidases (penicillin-binding protein (PBPs)), thereby releasing the C55P-carrier, which after dephosphorylation enters a new synthesis cycle. Binding of nisin to lipid II locks the cell wall precursor in a stable complex, thereby blocking the entire peptidoglycan synthesis cycle. Additionally, nisin combines this activity with a unique target-mediated pore formation, using lipid II as a docking molecule, and causing dissipation of the membrane potential, rapid efflux of small metabolites, and cessation of cellular biosynthetic processes (17.Ruhr E.

The renewed interest in the chemotherapeutic potential of antibacterial lantibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis originates from the fact that they are effective in treating infections sustained by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and that they do not show cross-resistance with glycopeptides (7.Cotter P.D.

In fact, binding of lantibiotics does not involve the glycopeptide binding site, i.e. the C-terminal d-alanyl-d-alanine (d-Ala-d-Ala) moiety of the pentapeptide side chain. Rather, lantibiotics containing the nisin-like double ring system at the N terminus bind to the pyrophosphate linkage unit of lipid II, which equally blocks access of the transglycosylase to its substrate (21.Brötz H.

NAI-107 (Fig. 1), also known as microbisporicin or 107891 (20.Castiglione F. Lazzarini A. Carrano L. Corti E. Ciciliato I. Gastaldo L. Candiani P. Losi D. Marinelli F. Selva E. Parenti F.

ATCC PTA-5024, which is active against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and unusually for a lantibiotic, also against some Gram-negative species (20.Castiglione F.

The compound was discovered during a screening program designed to detect all classes of cell-wall inhibitors except for β-lactams and glycopeptides (4.Jabes D. Donadio S.

In addition to one methyllanthionine and three lanthionine bridges and a C-terminal S-((Z)-2-aminovinyl)-d-cysteine, modifications found in other lantibiotics, NAI-107 contains two unusually modified amino acids: 5-chlorotryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyproline (16.Van Heijenoort Y.

These modifications are unique to NAI-107 within the lantibiotic class of compounds and are rare in other ribosomally synthesized peptides. Genetic analysis previously identified the biosynthetic gene cluster and revealed insights into the pathway-specific regulation by an extracytoplasmic function σ-factor·anti-σ-factor complex (26.Foulston L.C. Bibb M.J. Microbisporicin gene cluster reveals unusual features of lantibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

NAI-107 is produced as a complex of two major structurally related 24-amino acid variants (A1, 2246 Da; and A2, 2230 Da), which differ in proline 14 being monohydroxylated in variant A2, or bishydroxylated in variant A1 (28.Jabés D.

Overall NAI-107 seems to combine two known lipid II targeting motifs (Fig. 1) with its 1–11 N-terminal sequence being similar to nisin and its C-terminal ring system, which shares structural elements with epidermin and mersacidin (3.Chatterjee C.

NAI-107 is currently in late preclinical development and displays efficacy in animal models of multidrug-resistant infections superior to the drugs of last resort, linezolid and vancomycin (30.Castiglione F. Cavaletti L. Losi D. Lazzarini A. Carrano L. Feroggio M. Ciciliato I. Corti E. Candiani G. Marinelli F. Selva E. A novel lantibiotic acting on bacterial cell wall synthesis produced by the uncommon actinomycete Planomonospora sp.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5884-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NAI-107-resistant mutants were not observed during these studies. Preliminary mode of action studies gave the first hints toward inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis (28.Jabés D. Brunati C. Candiani G. Riva S. Romanó G. Donadio S. Efficacy of the new lantibiotic NAI-107 in experimental infections induced by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.Antimicrob.

In the present study, we set out to identify the molecular target and the specific mechanism of action of the lantibiotic NAI-107. Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was performed in 96-well polypropylene microtiter plates (Nunc) by standard broth microdilution in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (Oxoid), according to the general guidelines provided by CLSI/NCCLS. NAI-107 was prepared essentially as described (31.Vasile F. Potenza D. Marsiglia B. Maffioli S. Donadio S. Solution structure by nuclear magnetic resonance of the two lantibiotics 97518 and NAI-107.J. Pept. Sci. 2012; 18: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). S. aureus ATCC 29213 was grown overnight in half-concentrated Mueller Hinton Broth and diluted in fresh medium to an optical density (A600) of 0.1. NAI-107 was added in concentrations corresponding to 1× and 2× MIC (4 and 8 μg/ml, respectively). Controls were made either without peptide or with the corresponding amount of dimethyl sulfoxide in the culture. The viable count was monitored up to 24 h. Aliquots were taken at defined intervals, especially focusing on the first 60 min. Colony counts were performed on serially diluted samples in 0.9% NaCl and 100 μl of the dilutions were plated onto MH agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C and the colony forming units (cfu) were read after 24 h. The effect of NAI-107 on the synthesis of macromolecules was studied monitoring the incorporation of 3H- or 14C-labeled precursors (5-[3H]thymidine, [3H]glucosamine hydrochloride, and l-[14C]isoleucine). An overnight culture of Staphylococcus simulans M22 grown in half-concentrated Mueller Hinton Broth containing 1 mm of the respective unlabeled metabolite was diluted 50-fold into fresh medium and cultured at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. Cultures were then split into two aliquots, diluted to an A600 of 0.04 and allowed to regrow to an A600 of 0.1. Subsequently, the respective labeled precursor was added to each culture (final concentration 1 μCi/ml); NAI-107 was added at 0.5× MIC or 1× MIC, and another aliquot was run as a control without adding peptide. Incorporation was monitored for up to 40 min. Macromolecules were precipitated with ice-cold TCA (10%) and incubated for at least 30 min on ice before being filtered through glass microfiber filters (Whatman). Filters were washed with 5 ml of TCA (2.5%) containing 10 mm unlabeled metabolite, dried, and counted. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by the extrusion technique, essentially as described by Wiedemann et al. (11.Wiedemann I. Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Bierbaum G. de Kruijff B. Sahl H.G. Specific binding of nisin to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II combines pore formation and inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis for potent antibiotic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1772-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Vesicles were made of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-PC supplemented with 0.5 mol % of lipid II (referring to the total amount of phospholipid). Carboxyfluorescein-loaded vesicles were prepared with 50 mm carboxyfluorescein and then diluted in 1.5 ml of buffer (50 mm MES-KOH, 100 mm K2SO4, pH 6.0) at a final concentration of 25 μm phospholipid on a phosphorous base. After addition of the peptide, the increase of fluorescence intensity was measured at 520 nm (excitation at 492 nm) on an RF-5301 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) at room temperature. Leakage was documented relative to the total amount of marker release after solubilization of the vesicles by addition of 10 μl of 20% Triton X-100. Cells of Bacillus subtilis 168, S. aureus ATCC 29213, and Micrococcus luteus DSM 1790 were grown in half-concentrated Mueller Hinton Broth to an A600 of 0.5 and incubated for 5 min with 1 μm of the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3); Molecular Probes). NAI-107 was added at 10 times the MIC. 1 μm Nisin was used as positive control. Fluorescence was measured at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 and 515 nm, respectively. S. aureus ATCC 29213 was grown in MH broth to an A600 of 0.7 and supplemented with 130 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. After 15 min antibiotics (NAI-107 or vancomycin) were added at 10× MIC and incubated for 30 min. Cells were harvested and extracted with boiling water. The suspension was then centrifuged (48,000 × g, 30 min) and the supernatant lyophilized. Nucleotide-linked cell wall precursors were analyzed by HPLC and corresponding fractions were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Antagonization of the antibiotic activity of NAI-107 by potential target molecules was performed by a MIC-based setup in microtiter plates. NAI-107 (20 μg/ml corresponding to 5× MIC) were mixed with potential HPLC-purified antagonists (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, C55-P, lipid I, lipid II) in a 10-fold molar excess with respect to the antibiotic. S. aureus ATCC 29213 (5 × 105 cfu/ml) was added and samples were examined for visible bacterial growth after overnight incubation. For potassium efflux experiments a microprocessor pH meter (pH 213; Hanna Instruments, Kehl, Germany) with a MI-442 potassium electrode and MI-409F reference electrode was used. To obtain stable results, the electrodes were pre-conditioned by immersing both the potassium selective and the reference electrodes in choline buffer (300 mm choline chloride, 30 mm MES, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.5) for at least 1 h before starting calibration or measurements. Calibration was carried out before each determination by immersing the electrodes in fresh standard solutions containing 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mm KCl in choline buffer. Cells of B. subtilis 168 were grown in Mueller-Hinton Broth and harvested at an optical density (A600) of 1.0 to 1.5 (3300 × g, 4 °C, 3 min), washed with 50 ml of cold choline buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer to an A600 of 30. The concentrated cell suspension was kept on ice and used within 30 min. For each measurement the cells were diluted in choline buffer (25 °C) to an A600 of about 3. Calculations of potassium efflux in percent were performed according to the equations established by Orlov et al. (32.Orlov D.S. Nguyen T. Lehrer R.I. Potassium release, a useful tool for studying antimicrobial peptides.J. Microbiol. Methods. 2002; 49: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Peptide-induced leakage was monitored for 3 min, with values taken every 10 s, and was expressed relative to the total amount of potassium release induced by addition of 1 μm nisin. NAI-107 was added at 10× MIC. In vitro lipid II synthesis was performed using membranes of M. luteus as described (22.Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Leopold K. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.G.

Isolation of the lipid intermediate in peptidoglycan biosynthesis from Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, lipid I and lipid II were synthesized in vitro using membrane preparations of M. luteus DSM 1790. Membranes were isolated from lysozyme-treated cells by centrifugation (40,000 × g), washed twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and stored under liquid nitrogen until use. Analytical assays were performed in a total volume of 150 μl containing 300–400 μg of membrane protein, 10 nmol of undecaprenylphosphate, 100 nmol of UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide (UDPMurNAc-pp), 100 nmol of UDP-GlcNAc in 60 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. For purification of milligram quantities of lipid II, the analytical procedure was scaled up by a factor of 500. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 28 °C, and lipids were extracted with the same volume of n-butanol, 6 m pyridine-acetate, pH 4.2. Lipid I was synthesized as described for lipid II with the omission of UDP-GlcNAc from the synthesis reaction. Purification of lipid I/lipid II was performed on a DEAE-FF column (5 ml; GE Healthcare) and eluted in a linear gradient from chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1) to chloroform, methanol, 300 mm ammonium bicarbonate (2:3:1). Lipid I- and lipid II-containing fractions were identified by TLC (silica plates, 60F254; Merck) using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (88:48:10:1) as the solvent (13.Schneider T. Senn M.M.

The overall lipid II synthesis reaction was performed as described above using membrane preparations of M. luteus DSM 1790 in a total volume of 150 μl. For quantitative analysis 0.5 nmol of [14C]UDP-GlcNAc (7.4 GBq mmol−1; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the reaction mixture. To determine the enzymatic activity of purified MraY-His6 the assay was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 5 nmol of C55-P or [3H]C55-P (14.8 GBq/mmol; Biotrend), 50 nmol of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 10 mm N-lauroylsarcosine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 7.5 μg of the enzyme and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The MurG activity assay was performed in a final volume of 30 μl containing 2.5 nmol of purified lipid I, 25 nmol of UDP-GlcNAc or [14C]UDP-GlcNAc in 200 mm Tris-HCl, 5.7 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 0.8% Triton X-100 in the presence of 0.45 μg of purified MurG-His6 enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The assay for synthesis of lipid II-Gly1 catalyzed by FemX was performed as described previously without any modifications (13.Schneider T. Senn M.M. Berger-Bächi B. Tossi A. Sahl H.G. Wiedemann I.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity of PBP2 was determined by incubating 2.5 nmol of lipid II in 100 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 5.5, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 7.5 μg of PBP2-His6 and incubated for 1.5 h at 30 °C. The inhibitory effect on NAI-107 on WTA-precursor formation lipid III (undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine) and lipid IV (undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine-N-acetylmannosamine) was investigated as described by Müller et al.

From just two plant species at one site in Peru, we collected 3636 flowers yielding 1478 fly pupae representing 14 Blepharoneura fly species, 18 parasitoid species (14 Bellopius species), and parasitoid-host associations, all discovered through analysis of molecular data. Multiple sympatric species specialize on the same sex flowers of the same fly host-plant species-which suggests extreme niche overlap; however, niche partitioning was exposed by interactions between wasps and flies. Most Bellopius species emerged as adults from only one fly species, yet evidence from pupae (preadult emergence samples) show that most Bellopius also attacked additional fly species but never emerged as adults from those flies."
https://openalex.org/W2138792241,"Arginine, the common substrate for production of nitric oxide (NO) and polyamines in mammals, increases in the uterine lumen during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. However, functional roles of arginine within the uterine lumen for conceptus (embryo and extraembryonic membranes) development have not been elucidated in vivo. To assess roles of arginine in reproductive tissue for survival and development of the conceptus, we conducted an in vivo morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MAO)-mediated knockdown of SLC7A1 mRNA, the arginine transporter in ovine conceptus trophectoderm (Tr). Translational knockdown of SLC7A1 mRNA resulted in retarded conceptus development and abnormal function compared to MAO control. Use of MAO-SLC7A1 knockdown in conceptuses decreased arginine transport (73%, P<0.01), the abundance of ornithine decarboxylase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) proteins, arginine-related amino acids [citrulline (76%, P<0.05) and ornithine (40%, P<0.05)], and polyamines, which likely accounts for their retarded development. Also, no alternative arginine precursors (glutamine and glutamate), isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS1 and NOS2), or alternative pathways for polyamine biosynthesis via arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase were activated to rescue conceptus development. Collectively, SLC7A1 is the key transporter of arginine by conceptus Tr, and arginine is essential for conceptus survival and development.—Wang, X., Frank, J. W., Little, D. R., Dunlap, K.

https://openalex.org/W2335231316,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system facilitates the degradation of ubiquitin-tagged proteins and performs a regulatory role in cells. Elevated proteasome activity and subunit expression are found in several cancers. However, the inherent molecular mechanisms responsible for increased proteasome function in cancers remain unclear despite the well investigated and defined role of the mammalian proteasome. This study was initiated to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of β subunits of the mammalian proteasome. Suppression of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation coordinately decreased the mRNA and protein levels of the β subunits of the 20 S core complex in DU145 cells. Notably, PSMB5, a molecular target of bortezomib, was shown to be a target of STAT3. Knockdown of STAT3 decreased PSMB5 protein. Inhibition of phospho-STAT3 substantially reduced PSMB5 protein levels in cells expressing constitutively active-STAT3. Accumulation of activated STAT3 resulted in the induction of PSMB5 promoter and protein levels. In addition, a direct correlation was observed between the endogenous levels of PSMB5 and constitutively active STAT3. PSMB5 and STAT3 protein levels remained unaltered following the inhibition of proteasome activity. The EGF-induced concerted increase of β subunits was blocked by inhibition of the EGF receptor or STAT3 but not by the PI3K/AKT or MEK/ERK pathways. Decreased proteasome activities were due to reduced protein levels of catalytic subunits of the proteasome in STAT3-inhibited cells. Combined treatments with bortezomib and inhibitor of STAT3 abrogated proteasome activity and enhanced cellular apoptosis.

Overall, we demonstrate that aberrant activation of STAT3 regulates the expression of β subunits, in particular PSMB5, and the catalytic activity of the proteasome. The ubiquitin-proteasome system facilitates the degradation of regulatory and abnormal proteins. Polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. The 19 S regulatory complex recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins, whereas proteolytic activity resides within the 20 S catalytic core of the 26 S proteasome. The 20 S proteasome is comprised of two outer α and two inner β rings (αββα). Each of the α and β rings consists of seven subunits, termed α1-α7 and β1-β7. The α subunits maintain the structure, whereas the core β rings contains proteolytically active subunits such as PSMB5 (β5, chymotrypsin-like), PSMB6 (β1, caspase-like), and PSMB7 (β2, trypsin-like). The proteasome activity is controlled stringently and attuned to cellular requirements. Aberrations of this pathway lead to pleiotropic defects in all aspects of cell function. Because of their indispensable role, inhibitors of the proteasome are routinely used as antineoplastic agents in clinics (1.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L.

Most of the proteasome inhibitors target the chymotrypsin-like activity of PSMB5, although they coinhibit the caspase-like and/or trypsin-like activity at higher concentrations. Bortezomib, a peptide boronic acid congener, is used clinically as a frontline therapy for multiple myeloma as a single agent or in combination with standard therapies. Bortezomib binds and inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the PSMB5 subunit. However, resistance to bortezomib develops in a majority of patients, thereby limiting its clinical efficacy (5.Adams J.

Nrf1 and Nrf2 are key transcription factors involved in the up-regulation of proteasome genes in response to proteasome inhibition. Under normal conditions, Nrf1 undergoes endoplasmic reticulum-mediated degradation, whereas Keap1-bound Nrf2 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In response to proteasome inhibition, these transcription factors translocate to the nucleus and form heterodimers with Maf proteins. The Nrf1/Maf or Nrf2/Maf heterodimers transactivate proteasome genes through the antioxidant response elements in the promoters (10.Steffen J. Seeger M. Koch A. Krüger E.

Brain-specific, conditional knockout mice of Nrf1 exhibit a coordinated down-regulation of the basal levels of various proteasomal genes (13.Lee C.S. Lee C. Hu T. Nguyen J.M. Zhang J. Martin M.V. Vawter M.P. Huang E.J. Chan J.Y. Loss of nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 in the brain leads to dysregulation of proteasome gene expression and neurodegeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 8408-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Conversely, endogenous levels of proteasome subunits remain unaltered in mouse embryonic fibroblasts of nrf1- and nrf2-disrupted mice (11.Radhakrishnan S.K. Lee C.S. Young P. Beskow A. Chan J.Y.

Therefore, on the basis of these observations, Nrf1 or Nrf2 largely regulate the feedback response to proteasome inhibition and contribute minimally to the basal expression of proteasome genes. However, the transcription factors that regulate the basal level expression of proteasome subunits are largely unknown (14.Xie Y. Feedback regulation of proteasome gene expression and its implications in cancer therapy.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2010; 29: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Neoplastic growth is frequently associated with increased proteasome activity and subunit expression to maintain protein homeostasis (15.Ren S. Smith M.J. Louro I.D. McKie-Bell P. Bani M.R. Wagner M.

Activity patterns of proteasome subunits reflect bortezomib sensitivity of hematologic malignancies and are variable in primary human leukemia cells.Leukemia. 2007; 21: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because of their stringent mode of activation, Nrf1 and Nrf2 are unlikely to promote the increased proteasome subunit expression in malignancies unless they are deregulated. Accordingly, colon tumors showed a gain of proteasome activity because of increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 (20.Arlt A. Bauer I. Schafmayer C. Tepel J. Müerköster S.S. Brosch M. Röder C. Kalthoff H. Hampe J. Moyer M.P. Fölsch U.R. Schäfer H.

Thus, to cope with increased proteasome function in malignancies, it is plausible that the proteasome genes are regulated coordinately by oncogenic transcription factor(s). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying increased proteasome subunit expression and activity in cell lines harboring oncogenic STAT3 protein. Importantly, PSMB5 has been shown to be a STAT3 target. All cell lines were purchased from the ATCC and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. DU145, A549, HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and LNCaP cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. HEK293T and PC-3 cells were grown in minimal essential medium and F12, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. All plasmids for transfection were prepared using Qiagen columns (Hilden, Germany). DU145 cells were washed three times with medium without serum following 24 h of serum starvation.

The shRNAs targeting STAT3 were constructed using a U6 promoter-based vector as described previously (21.Jain N. Gupta S. Sudhakar C. Radha V. Swarup G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 36664-36673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The desired synthetic oligonucleotides targeting the nucleotide sequences of STAT3 (NM_139276.2) were annealed and cloned into the BbsI-XbaI-digested mU6 pro vector. The two sequences of oligonucleotides cloned were STAT3sh1 (5′-tttgCAATGGAGTACGTGCAGAAGAttcaaga gaTCTTCTGCACGTACTCCATTGttttt-3′); and STAT3sh2 (5′-tttgAGGAGGAGGCATTTGGAA AGTttcaagagaACTTTCCAAATGCCTCCTCCTtt ttt-3′). This vector expressed the sense, 9 bp of hairpin, and antisense sequence. The mU6pro vector expressing shRNA of an unrelated sequence of the same length was used as a control (21.Jain N. Gupta S. Sudhakar C. Radha V. Swarup G. Role of p73 in regulating human caspase-1 gene transcription induced by interferon-γ and cisplatin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36664-36673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following treatment, cell pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm CHAPS and 5 mm DTT) for 15 min on ice. Subsequently, cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g under cold conditions, and clear supernatant was collected. The supernatant was added to assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mm DTT) containing caspase 3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC, 40 μm) in a final volume of 100 μl as described earlier (22.Kalivendi S.V.

J. 2005; 389: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The incubation was performed for 1 h at 37 °C with readings recorded at 5-min intervals. Fluorescence released by AMC was measured at 360-nm and 460-nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Values were normalized to protein concentration and expressed as fold change of activity relative to DMSO control. Adenoviral vectors were generated using the AdEasyTM adenoviral vector system from Stratagene. The cDNA was isolated from the pRC-CMV-FLAG-mSTAT3 plasmid by PCR and cloned into the Not1/Xho1 site of pAdtrack-CMV plasmid coexpressing green fluorescent protein as a marker to monitor infection efficiency. The cDNA was under the control of the CMV promoter terminated by the simian virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation signal, resulting in pAdSTAT3. The pAdtrack-CMV plasmid was utilized as a control vector. The adenoviruses were generated as described previously (23.Jain N. Sudhakar C. Swarup G. Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced caspase-1 gene expression. Role of p73.FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4396-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Genomatix software predicted a 965-bp PSMB5 promoter. The sequence was amplified by PCR employing human genomic DNA with sequence-specific primers (PSMB5, 5′-GGGGTACCTGGTACATATTTATGCAGTCTC AACCGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGCTCGA GACTGAGACTCCCTGGACCTAGATCCAG-3′ (reverse)). Subsequently, the PSMB5 promoter was cloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase vector and sequenced to ensure the absence of mutations. The sequence matched with Homo sapiens chromosome 14 with sequence identification NC_000014.8 from nucleotides 23,503,983–23,504,947. Putative transcription factor binding sites were determined by using MatInspector from Genomatix software. To determine the promoter activity, PC-3 cells plated in 12-well plates were transfected with 100 ng of pWT-PSMB5 promoter-reporter construct and required concentrations of STAT3 plasmids. The plasmid concentrations were kept constant at 1 μg by the addition of control plasmids. 30 h post-transfection, cellular lysates were prepared for luciferase activity assays according to protocols described by Promega. Relative luciferase activities were calculated after normalizing the values with β-galactosidase enzyme activities (24.Sudhakar C. Nagabhushana A. Jain N. Swarup G. NF-κB mediates tumor necrosis factor α-induced expression of optineurin, a negative regulator of NF-κB.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Peptidase activities of the proteasome were measured in cellular lysates by the addition of 50 μm fluorogenic peptide substrates, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (for chymotrypsin-like), Z-Ala-Arg-Arg-AMC (for trypsin-like) and Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC (for caspase-like activity) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Later, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 125 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 7.5% ethanol, as described previously (12.Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Greenlaw J.L. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Antioxidants enhance mammalian proteasome expression through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8786-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Fluorescence released by AMC was measured at 360-nm and 460-nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, in an EnSpire multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Enzymatic activities were normalized to protein concentration and expressed as a percentage of activities relative to the DMSO control. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out as described previously (21.Jain N. Gupta S. Sudhakar C. Radha V. Swarup G. Role of p73 in regulating human caspase-1 gene transcription induced by interferon-γ and cisplatin.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36664-36673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RNA was reverse-transcribed using reagents from the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions for PSMB1-PSMB7 were one cycle of 3 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and one cycle of 7 min final extension at 72 °C. The primers employed for the amplification of individual subunits were as follows: PSMB1, 5′-TTTCGCCCTACGTTTTCAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TACAGCCCCCTTTCCTTCTT-3′ (reverse); PSMB2, 5′-AAGGCCCCGACTATGTTCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGTTGGCAGATTCAGGATG-3′ (reverse); PSMB3, 5′-GAAGGGGAAGAACTGTGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGGTGGTGATTTTGTCCT-3′ (reverse); PSMB4, 5′-TCAGTCCTCGGCGTTAAGTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTTAGCACTGGCTGCTTCT-3′ (reverse); PSMB5, 5′-CCATACCTGCTAGGCACCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCACCTCCTGAGTAGGCATC-3′ (reverse); PSMB6, 5′-CCTATTCACGACCGCATTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCCGGTAGGTAGCATCAAC-3′ (reverse); PSMB7, 5′-GCAACTGAAGGGATGGTTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAACTAGGGCTGCACCAATG-3′ (reverse); 18 S, 5′-CCTGCGGCTTAATTTGACTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGCCAGAGTCTCGTTCGTT-3′ (reverse); and Bcl2, 5′-CTACGAGTGGGATGCGGGAGATGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGCCGGTTCAGGTACT CAGTCATC-3′ (reverse). PSMB1, 3, and 4 were amplified for 27 cycles. PSMB2 and 5 were amplified for 25 cycles. PSMB6 and 7 were amplified for 22 cycles. Bcl-2 and 18 S RNA were amplified for 28 and 18 cycles, respectively, in 25-μl volumes of PCR mixture (Fermentas) in an Eppendorf Master Cycler®. Following treatments, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were washed twice with Tween Tris-buffered saline before blocking nonspecific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk (Blotto, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 3% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilutions, and the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The phosphoproteins were detected using primary antibodies at 1:500 dilution and incubation of 2 h at room temperature in 0.3% BSA containing Tween-Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were washed three times, and the detection was performed by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (21.Jain N. Gupta S. Sudhakar C. Radha V.

When significant differences were observed, p values for pairwise comparisons were calculated by employing a two-tailed t test. p < 0.01 was considered significant. Bortezomib treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines lead to a significant up-regulation of total and phosphorylated STAT3 (25.Li C. Zang Y. Sen M. Leeman-Neill R.J. Man D.S.

In another study, bortezomib-resistant clones of human monocytic cells (THP1 cell line) manifested a marked increase in PSMB5 protein levels (26.Oerlemans R. Franke N.E. Assaraf Y.G. Cloos J. van Zantwijk I. Berkers C.R. Scheffer G.L. Debipersad K. Vojtekova K. Lemos C. van der Heijden J.W. Ylstra B. Peters G.J. Kaspers G.L. Dijkmans B.A. Scheper R.J. Jansen G. Molecular basis of bortezomib resistance: proteasome subunit β5 (PSMB5) gene mutation and overexpression of PSMB5 protein.Blood. 2008; 112: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a possible role of STAT3 in the regulation of PSMB5 expression. To explore this, we opted for DU145 cells, which harbor aberrantly high levels of activated STAT3 (27.Mora L.B. Buettner R. Seigne J. Diaz J. Ahmad N. Garcia R. Bowman T. Falcone R. Fairclough R. Cantor A. Muro-Cacho C. Livingston S. Karras J. Pow-Sang J. Jove R. Constitutive activation of STAT3 in human prostate tumors and cell lines: direct inhibition of STAT3 signaling induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6659-6666PubMed Google Scholar). DU145 cells were treated with Stattic, an inhibitor of STAT3, at 10 μm concentrations for various time periods (28.Schust J. Sperl B. Hollis A. Mayer T.U. Berg T. Stattic: a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activation and dimerization.Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1235-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Stattic treatment resulted in the down-regulation of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (p-STAT3) from 3 h onwards, whereas total STAT3 protein levels remained unaffected. The protein levels of Bcl-2, a target of STAT3, also decreased significantly by 3 h of treatment. Similar to p-STAT3 and Bcl-2, PSMB5 protein levels also decreased correspondingly. Moreover, PSMB5 protein levels were undetectable from 12 h of treatment (Fig. 1A). To validate the observations with Stattic, we employed another STAT3 inhibitor, WP1066 (29.Iwamaru A. Szymanski S. Iwado E. Aoki H. Yokoyama T. Fokt I. Hess K. Conrad C. Madden T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Priebe W. Kondo Y. A novel inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway induces apoptosis in malignant glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Treatment with WP1066 resulted in a significant reduction of PSMB5 protein levels by 18 h. p-STAT3 levels also concomitantly decreased from 18 h of treatment. Similar to Stattic, STAT3 protein levels remain unchanged in WP1066-treated cells (Fig. 1B). The difference in the inhibition of p-STAT3 protein levels in Stattic- and WP1066-treated cells was probably due to differences in the efficacy of the inhibitors. Previous studies report that resveratrol inhibits Src tyrosine kinase activity and, thereby, blocks STAT3 phosphorylation in DU145 cells (30.Kotha A. Sekharam M. Cilenti L. Siddiquee K. Khaled A. Zervos A.S. Carter B. Turkson J. Jove R. Resveratrol inhibits Src and STAT3 signaling and induces the apoptosis of malignant cells containing activated STAT3 protein.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To further confirm STAT3-dependent PSMB5 subunit expression, we employed resveratrol. Treatment of DU145 cells with resveratrol suppressed p-STAT3 levels in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction in p-STAT3 levels was associated with decreased PSMB5 protein levels in resveratrol-treated cells (Fig. 1C). Further, STAT3 inhibition drastically reduced the mRNA levels of PSMB5 (Fig. 1D). The decrease in protein levels was preceded by reduced mRNA levels of PSMB5 in Stattic-treated cells. To provide further evidence for the requirement of STAT3 in the regulation of PSMB5, we employed a STAT3-directed shRNA. Both constructs of STAT3 shRNA significantly knocked down total STAT3 and p-STAT3 protein levels. In accordance with our earlier observations, knockdown of STAT3 protein resulted in lower PSMB5 protein levels (Fig. 1E). To validate the specificity of STAT3 inhibitors, Stattic-treated DU145 cells were analyzed for p-STAT1 levels. Notably, the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 levels were undetectable in DU145 cells, and total STAT1 levels also remained unchanged (Fig. 1F). Overall, pharmacological inhibition and shRNA-mediated down-regulation of STAT3 levels decreased PSMB5 protein in DU145 cells. Thus, STAT3 activation is essential for PSMB5 expression. Previous reports demonstrated that proteasome genes are regulated coordinately through a common transcription factor (10.Steffen J. Seeger M. Koch A. Krüger E.

Antioxidants enhance mammalian proteasome expression through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8786-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Because the expression of PSMB5 is regulated by STAT3, we analyzed whether the other β subunits are also regulated coordinately by STAT3. To test this assumption, we treated DU145 cells dose-dependently with Stattic for 24 h. It was observed that, like PSMB5, protein levels of PSMB6, PSMB7, and other β subunits decreased significantly in a concerted manner in STAT3-inhibited cells"
https://openalex.org/W1996879653,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is up-regulated by glucose and diabetes and plays a critical role in glucotoxicity, inflammation, and beta-cell apoptosis, whereas we have found that TXNIP deficiency protects against diabetes. Interestingly, human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is also induced by glucose, aggregates into insoluble amyloid fibrils found in islets of most individuals with type 2 diabetes and promotes inflammation and beta-cell cytotoxicity. However, so far no connection between TXNIP and IAPP signaling had been reported. Using TXNIP gain and loss of function experiments, INS-1 beta-cells and beta-cell-specific Txnip knock-out mice, we now found that TXNIP regulates IAPP expression. Promoter analyses and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that TXNIP increases IAPP expression at the transcriptional level, and we discovered that TXNIP-induced FoxA2 (forkhead box A2) transcription factor expression was conferring this effect by promoting FoxA2 enrichment at the proximal FoxA2 site in the IAPP promoter. Moreover, we found that TXNIP down-regulates miR-124a expression, a microRNA known to directly target FoxA2. Indeed, miR-124a overexpression led to decreased FoxA2 expression and IAPP promoter occupancy and to a significant reduction in IAPP mRNA and protein expression and also effectively inhibited TXNIP-induced IAPP expression. Thus, our studies have identified a novel TXNIP/miR-124a/FoxA2/IAPP signaling cascade linking the critical beta-cell signaling pathways of TXNIP and IAPP and thereby provide new mechanistic insight into an important aspect of transcriptional regulation and beta-cell biology.

IAPP deposits are often co-localized with cellular degeneration and apoptosis and have therefore been strongly associated with the progressive loss of pancreatic beta-cell mass in diabetes (3.Zhu T.

Aside from these extracellular amyloid fibrils detected by light microscopy, more recent studies have suggested that smaller non-fibrillar oligomers contribute to the toxic effects of IAPP (2.Westermark P.

Initially, we identified thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as the strongest glucose-induced gene (>10-fold increase) in our human islet oligonucleotide microarray analysis (6.Shalev A.

Follow-up studies revealed that these glucose effects are mediated by enhanced binding of carbohydrate response element-binding protein to a unique non-palindromic E-box motif within the proximal TXNIP promoter, which induces TXNIP transcription (7.Cha-Molstad H. Saxena G. Chen J. Shalev A. Glucose-stimulated expression of Txnip is mediated by carbohydrate response element-binding protein, p300, and histone H4 acetylation in pancreatic β cells.J. Biol.

Moreover, we found that TXNIP levels are dramatically increased in pancreatic islets of diabetic mice, suggesting that it might be involved in the disease pathology (9.Chen J. Saxena G. Mungrue I.N.

TXNIP has been known as an inhibitor of thioredoxin function and a regulator of the cellular redox state (11.Yoshioka J. Schulze P.C. Cupesi M. Sylvan J.D. MacGillivray C. Gannon J. Huang H. Lee R.T. Thioredoxin-interacting protein controls cardiac hypertrophy through regulation of thioredoxin activity.Circulation. 2004; 109: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and was found to be involved in inflammation and ER stress (12.Oslowski C.M.

We discovered that TXNIP induces beta-cell apoptosis (8.Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A.

Thioredoxin-interacting protein: a critical link between glucose toxicity and β-cell apoptosis.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that TXNIP deficiency promotes endogenous beta-cell survival and prevents streptozotocin- and obesity-induced diabetes (8.Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A.

Commun. 2005; 336: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most recently, we discovered that TXNIP is a potent regulator of beta-cell microRNA expression and thereby also inhibits insulin transcription and controls beta-cell function (14.Xu G. Chen J. Jing G. Shalev A. Thioredoxin-interacting protein regulates insulin transcription through microRNA-204.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs are small, ∼22 nucleotide, non-coding regulatory RNAs that bind to the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs leading to degradation or translational inhibition of the target mRNA and down-regulation of target gene expression (15.Sun Y.

Based on these combined findings, TXNIP is currently being pursued as a therapeutic target for diabetes, but the full extent of TXNIP signaling in the beta-cell and its effects on metabolism remain to be determined. Interestingly, the dramatic increase in TXNIP expression in response to glucose in our human islet microarray analysis was also associated with a marked induction of IAPP (4-fold) (6.Shalev A. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Hoffmann S.C. Hirshberg B. Brady J.N. Harlan D.M.

Although this could be explained by the well established glucose effects on IAPP induction (18.Gasa R. Gomis R. Casamitjana R. Novials A.

Islet amyloid polypeptide and insulin gene expression are regulated in parallel by glucose in vivo in rats.Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1008-E1014PubMed Google Scholar), it also raised the question of whether TXNIP may be involved in the observed up-regulation of IAPP. The present studies were therefore aimed at determining the effects of TXNIP on beta-cell IAPP and uncovered a novel gene regulatory system linking the critical beta-cell signaling pathways of TXNIP and IAPP and elucidated the transcriptional mechanisms involved. INS-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 11.1 mm glucose, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol.

Mouse islets were isolated by collagenase digestion (22.Minn A.H. Lan H. Rabaglia M.E. Harlan D.M. Peculis B.A. Attie A.D. Shalev A. Increased insulin translation from an insulin splice-variant overexpressed in diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance.Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 794-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All mouse studies were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Animal Care and Use Committee. Human islets were obtained through the Integrated Islet Distribution Program, and islets from the same donor were used as control. The human IAPP promoter region was amplified from genomic DNA with primers from Table 1 and subcloned into the MluI and HindIII restriction sites of the pGL3 enhancer vector (Promega) providing the IAPP-Luc reporter plasmid. For luciferase assays, transfections were performed as described previously (23.Xu G. Chen J. Jing G. Shalev A. Preventing β-cell loss and diabetes with calcium channel blockers.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was determined by Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega). For siRNA knockdown experiments, INS-1 cells were grown in six-well plates and transfected with specific siRNA oligonucleotides for rat Txnip (Dharmacon; siGENOME SMARTpool gene ID 117514), rat FoxA2 (Dharmacon; ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool gene ID 25099) or with scrambled oligonucleotide (0.1 μm; Dharmacon D-001810-01-20) using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (5 μl/well). The final concentration of oligonucleotides used was 25 nm. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection.

All results were corrected for the 18 S ribosomal subunit (Applied Biosystems) run as an internal standard. Expression of miR-124a was quantified using a TaqMan microRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems), and results were corrected for U6 run as the internal standard. Whole cell protein extracts from INS-1 cells were prepared as described previously (9.Chen J. Saxena G. Mungrue I.N. Lusis A.J. Shalev A.

The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-IAPP IgG (1:1000; Bachem), mouse anti-TXNIP IgG (JY2; 1:1000; MBL), goat anti-FoxA2 IgG (1:500; sc-6554), anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5000, sc-2004), anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:5000, sc-2020), and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:5000, sc-2005) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized by ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare) and quantified by ImageQuant. ChIP assays were performed as detailed previously (7.Cha-Molstad H. Saxena G. Chen J. Shalev A. Glucose-stimulated expression of Txnip is mediated by carbohydrate response element-binding protein, p300, and histone H4 acetylation in pancreatic β cells.J. Biol.

Student's t tests were used to calculate the significance of a difference between two groups. For data sets of more than two groups, we performed one-way analysis of variance calculations. To determine the effects of TXNIP on beta-cell IAPP expression, we performed gain and loss of function experiments using INS-1 cells with TXNIP overexpression (Fig. 1, A and B) and with TXNIP siRNA resulting in a ∼80% TXNIP knockdown (24.Saxena G. Chen J. Shalev A. Intracellular shuttling and mitochondrial function of thioredoxin-interacting protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3997-4005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Indeed, IAPP mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in INS-1 beta-cells overexpressing TXNIP (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas TXNIP knockdown resulted in decreased IAPP expression (Fig. 1E). Importantly, although similarities exist between the IAPP and the insulin promoter, TXNIP does not promote insulin transcription. In fact, TXNIP overexpression led to a decrease in insulin expression (Fig. 1F), consistent with our recently published work and the observed increase in insulin production in islets of TXNIP-deficient mice (14.Xu G. Chen J. Jing G. Shalev A. Thioredoxin-interacting protein regulates insulin transcription through microRNA-204.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This suggested that TXNIP has divergent effects on IAPP and insulin and that the TXNIP-induced transactivation observed was specific for IAPP. Primary islets of ob/ob mice, previously shown to have a ∼4-fold elevation in TXNIP levels (14.Xu G. Chen J. Jing G. Shalev A. Thioredoxin-interacting protein regulates insulin transcription through microRNA-204.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), also demonstrated a marked increase in IAPP expression (Fig. 1G), whereas IAPP expression was again reduced in vivo in primary islets of beta cell-specific Txnip knock-out mice (bTKO) (Fig. 1H), providing additional support for the notion of TXNIP-mediated regulation of IAPP expression. Recently, we demonstrated that verapamil is a powerful tool to reduce endogenous beta-cell TXNIP levels, including in human islets (23.Xu G. Chen J. Jing G. Shalev A. Preventing β-cell loss and diabetes with calcium channel blockers.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We therefore now investigated how modulating endogenous human TXNIP with verapamil would affect human IAPP. Interestingly, we found a dose-dependent decrease in human IAPP in response to decreased TXNIP expression (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with our findings in rat beta-cells and primary mouse islets. Moreover, we also generated a reporter construct driven by the human IAPP promoter and transfection into INS-TXNIP cells, and luciferase assays showed that TXNIP significantly increased human IAPP promoter activity (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the observed TXNIP-mediated induction of IAPP occurred at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, we also assessed the effects of elevated glucose on the induction of human IAPP transcription. Although glucose-induced IAPP transcription as expected, TXNIP had a strong additive effect and was able to activate the human IAPP promoter even beyond levels observed with high glucose alone (Fig. 2D). This suggests that TXNIP confers its effects at least in part by mechanisms that are distinct from those of glucose. To further elucidate the mechanisms by which TXNIP might regulate IAPP transcription, we analyzed the potential transcription factor binding sites in the human IAPP promoter using the MatInspector software, and this revealed two PDX1, four ISL1, and three FoxA2 sites (Fig. 3A). Transcription of the IAPP gene is known to be controlled by a complex promoter region and different transcription factors (25.Shepherd L.M. Campbell S.C. Macfarlane W.M. Transcriptional regulation of the IAPP gene in pancreatic beta-cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1681: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although PDX1 is thought to be the major transcription factor conferring the induction of IAPP by glucose (19.Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Matsuoka T. Fujitani Y. Ji Miyazaki Yamasaki Y. Involvement of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor PDX-1 in islet amyloid polypeptide gene transcription.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15330-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), there are also reports of ISL1 and FoxA2 being involved in the regulation of IAPP expression (19.Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Matsuoka T. Fujitani Y. Ji Miyazaki Yamasaki Y. Involvement of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor PDX-1 in islet amyloid polypeptide gene transcription.Biochem.

Activation of amylin gene transcription by LIM domain homeobox gene isl-1.Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 243-251PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore next assessed whether TXNIP could alter beta-cell expression of any of these transcription factors. Interestingly, only FoxA2 mRNA expression was significantly increased by TXNIP (Fig. 3B), and this was associated with a similar increase in FoxA2 protein levels (Fig. 3C), suggesting that FoxA2 might be a potential candidate for the regulation of IAPP by TXNIP. To further test this possibility, we knocked down FoxA2 using specific siRNA oligonucleotides and achieved significant inhibition of FoxA2 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 4, A and B). This in turn resulted in completely blunted TXNIP-induced IAPP mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 4, C and D), as well as IAPP promoter activity (Fig. 4E), providing additional evidence for the critical role of FoxA2 in these effects. To directly evaluate whether TXNIP induces IAPP transcription by increasing FoxA2 binding to the IAPP promoter, we performed ChIP assays using FoxA2 antibodies and PCR primers flanking the three FoxA2 binding sites identified. We found that FoxA2 specifically bound to the proximal FoxA2 site but not the other two sites and that TXNIP significantly increased in vivo binding of FoxA2 to the IAPP promoter (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, alignment using ClustalW2 showed that, in contrast to the other two more distal sites, this proximal (−606 bp) FoxA2 binding site was also highly conserved across species (Fig. 3A). However, enrichment of FoxA2 at FoxA2 binding sites in the promoters of other known FoxA2 target genes (i.e. Pdx1 and FoxO1) (28.Gao N. LeLay J. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Rieck S. Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H.

These results are consistent with the unchanged expression of Pdx1 observed in response to TXNIP overexpression (Fig. 3B) and suggest that FoxA2 may be acting in concert with other regulatory factors that confer this specificity to the IAPP promoter. Together, these data suggest that TXNIP specifically induces IAPP transcription by promoting FoxA2 binding to its proximal binding site within the IAPP promoter. Interestingly, we found that TXNIP not only enhances FoxA2 binding to the IAPP promoter but also increases the expression level of this transcription factor (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together with our recent dis"
https://openalex.org/W2079077785,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is required for the specification of tissues during embryonic development and is recapitulated during the metastatic progression of tumors. The miR-200 family plays a critical role in enforcing the epithelial state with their expression lost in cells undergoing EMT. EMT can be mediated by activation of the ZEB1 and ZEB2 (ZEB) transcription factors, which repress miR-200 expression via a self-reinforcing double negative feedback loop to promote the mesenchymal state. However, it remains unclear what factors drive and maintain epithelial-specific expression of miR-200 in the absence of EMT-inducing factors. Here, we show that the transcription factor Specificity Protein 1 (Sp1) binds to the miR-200b∼200a∼429 proximal promoter and activates miR-200 expression in epithelial cells. In mesenchymal cells, Sp1 expression is maintained, but its ability to activate the miR-200 promoter is perturbed by ZEB-mediated repression.

Furthermore, we observed co-expression of Sp1 and miR-200 during mouse embryonic development wherein miR-200 expression was only lost in regions with high ZEB expression.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is required for the specification of tissues during embryonic development and is recapitulated during the metastatic progression of tumors. The miR-200 family plays a critical role in enforcing the epithelial state with their expression lost in cells undergoing EMT. EMT can be mediated by activation of the ZEB1 and ZEB2 (ZEB) transcription factors, which repress miR-200 expression via a self-reinforcing double negative feedback loop to promote the mesenchymal state. However, it remains unclear what factors drive and maintain epithelial-specific expression of miR-200 in the absence of EMT-inducing factors. Here, we show that the transcription factor Specificity Protein 1 (Sp1) binds to the miR-200b∼200a∼429 proximal promoter and activates miR-200 expression in epithelial cells. In mesenchymal cells, Sp1 expression is maintained, but its ability to activate the miR-200 promoter is perturbed by ZEB-mediated repression.

Furthermore, we observed co-expression of Sp1 and miR-200 during mouse embryonic development wherein miR-200 expression was only lost in regions with high ZEB expression.

CaMKII is a key mediator and feedback regulator of Ca2+ signaling in many tissues, but its role in β-cells is poorly understood, especially in vivo. Here, we report that mice with conditional inhibition of CaMKII in β-cells show significantly impaired glucose tolerance due to decreased GSIS. Moreover, β-cell CaMKII inhibition dramatically exacerbates glucose intolerance following exposure to a high fat diet. The impairment of islet GSIS by β-cell CaMKII inhibition is not accompanied by changes in either glucose metabolism or the activities of KATP and voltage-gated potassium channels. However, glucose-stimulated Ca2+ entry via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels is reduced in islet β-cells with CaMKII inhibition, as well as in primary wild-type β-cells treated with a peptide inhibitor of CaMKII. The levels of basal β-cell cytoplasmic Ca2+ and of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores are also decreased by CaMKII inhibition. In addition, CaMKII inhibition suppresses glucose-stimulated action potential firing frequency. These results reveal that CaMKII is a Ca2+ sensor with a key role as a feed-forward stimulator of β-cell Ca2+ signals that enhance GSIS under physiological and pathological conditions.

Importantly, we found that this transient morphological contraction of mitochondria is accompanied by a reversible loss or decrease of inner membrane potential. Fission deficiency greatly amplified this phenomenon, which functionally exhibited an increase of inner membrane proton leak. We found that electron transport activity is necessary for the morphological contraction of mitochondria. Furthermore, we discovered that silencing the inner membrane-associated dynamin optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) in fission deficiency prevented mitochondrial depolarization and decreased proton leak without blocking mitochondrial contraction, indicating that OPA1 is a factor in coupling matrix contraction to mitochondrial depolarization.

https://openalex.org/W2034836568,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has always been recognized as one of the most successful pathogens. Bacteriophages that attack and kill mycobacteria offer an alternate mechanism for the curtailment of this bacterium. Upon infection, mycobacteriophages produce lysins that catalyze cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolysis and mycolic acid layer breakdown of the host resulting in bacterial cell rupture and virus release. The ability to lyse bacterial cells make lysins extremely significant. We report here a detailed molecular dissection of the function and regulation of mycobacteriophage D29 Lysin A. Several truncated versions of Lysin A were constructed, and their activities were analyzed by zymography and by expressing them in both Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Our experiments establish that Lysin A harbors two catalytically active domains, both of which show E. coli cell lysis upon their expression exclusively in the periplasmic space. However, the expression of only one of these domains and the full-length Lysin A caused M. smegmatis cell lysis. Interestingly, full-length protein remained inactive in E. coli periplasm. Our data suggest that the inactivity is ensued by a C-terminal domain that interacts with the N-terminal domain. This interaction was affirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Our experiments also demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of Lysin A selectively binds to M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis peptidoglycans. Our methodology of studying E. coli cell lysis by Lysin A and its truncations after expressing these proteins in the bacterial periplasm with the help of signal peptide paves the way for a large scale identification and analysis of such proteins obtained from other bacteriophages."
https://openalex.org/W2024272267,"Analysis of the time-dependent behavior of a signaling system can provide insight into its dynamic properties. We employed the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the transcriptional repressor Mig1 as readout to characterize Snf1-Mig1 dynamics in single yeast cells. Mig1 binds to promoters of target genes and mediates glucose repression. Mig1 is predominantly located in the nucleus when glucose is abundant. Upon glucose depletion, Mig1 is phosphorylated by the yeast AMP-activated kinase Snf1 and exported into the cytoplasm. We used a three-channel microfluidic device to establish a high degree of control over the glucose concentration exposed to cells. Following regimes of glucose up- and downshifts, we observed a very rapid response reaching a new steady state within less than 1 min, different glucose threshold concentrations depending on glucose up- or downshifts, a graded profile with increased cell-to-cell variation at threshold glucose concentrations, and biphasic behavior with a transient translocation of Mig1 upon the shift from high to intermediate glucose concentrations. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data demonstrate that Mig1 shuttles constantly between the nucleus and cytoplasm, although with different rates, depending on the presence of glucose. Taken together, our data suggest that the Snf1-Mig1 system has the ability to monitor glucose concentration changes as well as absolute glucose levels. The sensitivity over a wide range of glucose levels and different glucose concentration-dependent response profiles are likely determined by the close integration of signaling with the metabolism and may provide for a highly flexible and fast adaptation to an altered nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W1993691506,"M-type potassium channels, encoded by the KCNQ family genes (KCNQ2-5), require calmodulin as an essential co-factor. Calmodulin bound to the KCNQ2 subunit regulates channel trafficking and stabilizes channel activity. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of calmodulin by protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase 2) rapidly and reversibly modulated KCNQ2 current. CK2-mediated phosphorylation of calmodulin strengthened its binding to KCNQ2 channel, caused resistance to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion, and increased KCNQ2 current amplitude. Accordingly, application of CK2-selective inhibitors suppressed KCNQ2 current. This suppression was prevented by co-expression of CK2 phosphomimetic calmodulin mutants or pretreatment with a protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A. We also demonstrated that functional CK2 and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) were selectively tethered to the KCNQ2 subunit. We identified a functional KVXF consensus site for PP1 binding in the N-terminal tail of KCNQ2 subunit: mutation of this site augmented current density. CK2 inhibitor treatment suppressed M-current in rat superior cervical ganglion neurons, an effect negated by overexpression of phosphomimetic calmodulin or pretreatment with calyculin A Furthermore, CK2 inhibition diminished the medium after hyperpolarization by suppressing the M-current. These findings suggest that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of calmodulin regulates the M-current, which is tonically regulated by CK2 and PP1 anchored to the KCNQ2 channel complex."

Here we solve the structure of N2N3 from FnBPA in its apo and Fg peptide-bound forms. We show that the latch strand is not required for Fg peptide or FgD (a protolytic fragment of Fg) binding and that only a minimal conformational change occurs in FnBPA on peptide binding. We show that although the Fg-binding site and the most N-terminal Fn-binding site on FnBPA are in close proximity, the residues involved are nonoverlapping. However, studies using intact Fn and Fg and their subdomains, and an FnBPA protein construct containing the adjacent Fg- and Fn-binding sites, provide evidence that Fg binding is sterically regulated by binding of Fn. This regulation is likely to have important implications for S. aureus interactions with host molecules in vivo. Genes encoding the rFnBPA protein constructs (rFnBPA(189–511), rFnBPA(189–505), and AF1(rFnBPA(189–550)); Fig. 1A) were subcloned from a pQE-30 vector containing the cDNA of full-length FnBPA (GenBankTM accession number J04151.1, S. aureus 8325-4 strain) into pET-YSBLIC-3C (34.Bonsor D.

Sequences were confirmed by in-house DNA sequencing. rFnBPA constructs were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Gold cells and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. The His tag was cleaved using HRV 3C protease, and after nickel affinity chromatography to remove the tag and uncleaved material, cleaved rFnBPAs were concentrated and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a prepacked Superdex S75 16/65 HiLoad column (GE Healthcare). AF1 required additional anion exchange chromatography using HiTrap Q FF Sepharose (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.2. The purity and molecular mass of final products were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and MS/ESI, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm. Intact human plasma Fg (341 kDa, product no. 341576) and FgD (a monomeric ∼85-kDa proteolytic fragment of Fg containing the C-terminal regions of Aα, Bβ, and γ chains, product no. 341600) were purchased from Calbiochem-Merck-Millipore.

FgγC comprising the 17 C-terminal residues of the Fg γA chain (Ac-GEGQQHHLGGAKQAGDV-NH2) was purchased as a synthetic peptide from Severn Biotech Ltd. Fibronectin-free Fg was supplied by Enzyme Research Laboratories (Swansea, UK). Experiments were performed using a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter (GE Healthcare) in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2PO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) at 25 °C. Procedures were similar to those reported previously (35.Norris N.C. Bingham R.J. Harris G. Speakman A. Jones R.P. Leech A. Turkenburg J.P. Potts J.R.

Each titration started with one 2-μl injection followed by 27 × 10 μl injections at 0.5 μl/s using 6-min intervals. The stirring speed 307 rpm was used for all titrations except those involving Fg, where the stirring speed was increased to 321 rpm because of the higher viscosity of the Fg solution. Binding isotherms were fitted to a single-site binding model using nonlinear regression analysis in MicroCal-Origin 7.0 software. Experiments were performed at 25 °C using a Biacore T100 system (GE Healthcare) upgraded to a T200 specification. Ligands in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) were immobilized onto the experimental flow cell of a CM5 or C1 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) by amine coupling and subsequent blocking (36.Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Immobilization of proteins to a carboxymethyldextran-modified gold surface for biospecific interaction analysis in surface-plasmon resonance sensors.Anal.

Unless otherwise stated, low level immobilizations (50–150 response units) were used. The running buffer HBS-p + (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) polysorbate 20, GE Healthcare) was applied at 30 μl/min. Analyte contact times were 60–300 s, dissociation times were 180–700 s, and stabilization times were 120–1500 s. Regenerations with low pH solutions were used only when needed and were optimized to minimize volume and harshness; pre- and postregeneration binding levels and curves were compared. Automated experiments were performed to measure dissociation constants (Kd values) by kinetic or equilibrium methods, and binding/inhibition. Five prior start-up cycles ensured stable baselines. For Kd determination, sensorgrams were measured for at least 10 sequential 2-fold analyte dilutions to cover the concentration range 0.1Kd–10Kd. Achievement of a steady-state response enabled Kd determination from the equilibrium binding (37.van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. Affinity and kinetic analysis of the interaction of the cell-adhesion molecules rat CD2 and CD48.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Alternatively, kinetic data series were fitted to a Langmuir 1:1 binding model. Response differences between sample and reference cells were analyzed using Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare). For Kd determination, an upper limit for analyte concentration for sensorgram analysis was determined to ensure reliable curve-fitting indicated by low χ2 values. In the binding/inhibition experiments, either AF1 or the NTD was immobilized; pure or mixed proteins with known concentrations were the analytes.

Clusters of protein crystals grew after 3 days at 18 °C. Clusters were transferred into cryo-protectant (reservoir solution with additional 10% (w/v) of PEG 20000 and 10% (v/v) of PEG monomethyl ether 550, from which a single diffracting crystal was broken off and vitrified in liquid nitrogen. Diffracting crystals of the FnBPA(189–505)·FgγC peptide complex were grown in a Clear Strategy Screen II screen condition containing PEG 2000 monomethyl ether (25%, w/v), 0.2 m calcium acetate, with added 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, isopropanol (10% (v/v)), at an FnBPA(189–505) concentration of 25 mg/ml and a 20-fold molar excess of FgγC. Sitting drop vapor diffusion with the microseeding technique was set up as described above.

https://openalex.org/W2061455429,"Sec13 is a dual function protein, being a core component of both the COPII coat, which mediates protein trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, and the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which facilitates nucleo-cytoplasmic traffic. Here, we present a genetic model to differentiate the roles of these two functions of Sec13 in vivo. We report that sec13(sq198) mutant embryos develop small eyes that exhibit disrupted retinal lamination and that the mutant retina contains an excessive number of apoptotic cells. Surprisingly, we found that loss of COPII function by oligonucleotide-mediated gene knockdown of sec31a and sec31b or brefeldin A treatment did not disrupt retinal lamination, although it did result in digestive organ defects similar to those seen in sec13(sq198), suggesting that the digestive organ defects observed in sec13(sq198) are due to loss of COPII function, whereas the retinal lamination defects are due to loss of the NPC function. We showed that the retinal cells of sec13(sq198) failed to form proper nuclear pores, leading to a nuclear accumulation of total mRNA and abnormal activation of the p53-dependent apoptosis pathway, causing the retinal defect in sec13(sq198). Furthermore, we found that a mutant lacking Nup107, a key NPC-specific component, phenocopied the retinal lamination phenotype as observed in sec13(sq198). Our results demonstrate a requirement for the nuclear pore function of Sec13 in development of the retina and provide the first genetic evidence to differentiate the contributions of the NPC and the COPII functions of Sec13 during organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964806084,"S100B is a prognostic marker for malignant melanoma. Increasing S100B levels are predictive of advancing disease stage, increased recurrence, and low overall survival in malignant melanoma patients. Using S100B overexpression and shRNA(S100B) knockdown studies in melanoma cell lines, elevated S100B was found to enhance cell viability and modulate MAPK signaling by binding directly to the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). S100B-RSK complex formation was shown to be Ca(2+)-dependent and to block ERK-dependent phosphorylation of RSK, at Thr-573, in its C-terminal kinase domain. Additionally, the overexpression of S100B sequesters RSK into the cytosol and prevents it from acting on nuclear targets. Thus, elevated S100B contributes to abnormal ERK/RSK signaling and increased cell survival in malignant melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2024848577,"Early-onset torsion dystonia (EOTD) is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary and sustained muscle contractions that can lead to paralysis and abnormal posture. EOTD is associated with the deletion of a glutamate (ΔE) in torsinA, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident AAA(+) ATPase. To date, the effect of ΔE on torsinA and the reason that this mutation results in EOTD are unclear. Moreover, there are no specific therapeutic options to treat EOTD. To define the underlying biochemical defects associated with torsinAΔE and to uncover factors that might be targeted to offset defects associated with torsinAΔE, we developed a yeast torsinA expression system and tested the roles of ER chaperones in mediating the folding and stability of torsinA and torsinAΔE. We discovered that the ER lumenal Hsp70, BiP, an associated Hsp40, Scj1, and a nucleotide exchange factor, Lhs1, stabilize torsinA and torsinAΔE. BiP also maintained torsinA and torsinAΔE solubility. Mutations predicted to compromise specific torsinA functional motifs showed a synthetic interaction with the ΔE mutation and destabilized torsinAΔE, suggesting that the ΔE mutation predisposes torsinA to defects in the presence of secondary insults. In this case, BiP was required for torsinAΔE degradation, consistent with data that specific chaperones exhibit either pro-degradative or pro-folding activities. Finally, using two independent approaches, we established that BiP stabilizes torsinA and torsinAΔE in mammalian cells. Together, these data define BiP as the first identified torsinA chaperone, and treatments that modulate BiP might improve symptoms associated with EOTD."

https://openalex.org/W2086873619,"Decreasing luminal pH is thought to play a role in the entry of newly synthesized and endocytosed membrane proteins into secretory granules. The two catalytic domains of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a type I integral membrane protein, catalyze the sequential reactions that convert peptidyl-Gly substrates into amidated products. We explored the hypothesis that a conserved His-rich cluster (His-Gly-His-His) in the linker region connecting its two catalytic domains senses pH and affects PAM trafficking by mutating these His residues to Ala (Ala-Gly-Ala-Ala; H3A). Purified recombinant wild-type and H3A linker peptides were examined using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence; mutation of the His cluster largely eliminated its pH sensitivity. An enzymatically active PAM protein with the same mutations (PAM-1/H3A) was expressed in HEK293 cells and AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation revealed more rapid loss of newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A than PAM-1; although release of newly synthesized monofunctional PHM/H3A was increased, release of soluble bifunctional PAM/H3A, a product of the endocytic pathway, was decreased. Surface biotinylation revealed rapid loss of PAM-1/H3A, with no detectable return of the mutant protein to secretory granules. Consistent with its altered endocytic trafficking, little PAM-1/H3A was subjected to regulated intramembrane proteolysis followed by release of a small nuclear-targeted cytosolic fragment. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A adopted the morphology of wild-type AtT-20 cells; secretory products no longer accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and secretory granule exocytosis was more responsive to secretagogue."

Through molecular modeling, we define a mechanism for this interaction and suggest why the I508K and D511K relay mutations fail to suppress R759E. Interestingly, I508K disabled motor function and myofibril assembly, suggesting that productive relay-converter interaction is essential for both processes. We conclude that the putative relay-converter interaction mediated by myosin residues 509 and 759 is critical for the biochemical and biophysical function of skeletal muscle myosin and the normal ultrastructural and mechanical properties of muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1967411550,"Signal transduction within the DNA damage response is driven by the flux of protein-protein interaction cascades that ultimately recruit repair complexes to sites of damage. The protein RAP80 plays a central role in the damage response by targeting BRCA1/BRCA2 tumor suppressors to DNA damage foci through multivalent binding of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Mutations within the high penetrance BRCA1/BRCA2 genes account for ∼20% of familial breast cancers. The genetic basis for the remaining cancers remains unknown, but may involve defects in binding partners for BRCA1 and BRCA2 that lead to impaired targeting to foci and a concomitant role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Recently, an in-frame deletion mutation (ΔE81) in a conserved region from the first ubiquitin interaction motif of RAP80 has been linked to an increase in chromosomal abnormalities. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the N-cap motif within the α-helix of the first ubiquitin interaction motif from ΔE81 undergoes a structural frameshift that leads to abolishment of multivalent binding of polyubiquitin chains. Loss of this single glutamate residue disrupts favorable electrostatic interactions between RAP80 and ubiquitin, establishing a plausible molecular basis for a potential predisposition to cancer unrelated to mutations within BRCA1/BRCA2 genes."
https://openalex.org/W2334660836,"In prion-infected hosts, PrPSc usually accumulates as non-fibrillar, membrane-bound aggregates. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor-directed membrane association appears to be an important factor controlling the biophysical properties of PrPSc aggregates. To determine whether GPI anchoring can similarly modulate the assembly of other amyloid-forming proteins, neuronal cell lines were generated that expressed a GPI-anchored form of a model amyloidogenic protein, the NM domain of the yeast prion protein Sup35 (Sup35(GPI)). We recently reported that GPI anchoring facilitated the induction of Sup35(GPI) prions in this system. Here, we report the ultrastructural characterization of self-propagating Sup35(GPI) aggregates of either spontaneous or induced origin. Like membrane-bound PrPSc, Sup35(GPI) aggregates resisted release from cells treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Sup35(GPI) aggregates of spontaneous origin were detergent-insoluble, protease-resistant, and self-propagating, in a manner similar to that reported for recombinant Sup35NM amyloid fibrils and induced Sup35(GPI) aggregates. However, GPI-anchored Sup35 aggregates were not stained with amyloid-binding dyes, such as Thioflavin T. This was consistent with ultrastructural analyses, which showed that the aggregates corresponded to dense cell surface accumulations of membrane vesicle-like structures and were not fibrillar. Together, these results showed that GPI anchoring directs the assembly of Sup35NM into non-fibrillar, membrane-bound aggregates that resemble PrPSc, raising the possibility that GPI anchor-dependent modulation of protein aggregation might occur with other amyloidogenic proteins. This may contribute to differences in pathogenesis and pathology between prion diseases, which uniquely involve aggregation of a GPI-anchored protein, versus other protein misfolding diseases."
