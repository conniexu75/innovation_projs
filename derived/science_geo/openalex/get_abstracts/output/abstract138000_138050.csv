The physical basis for the observed effects is presented, and the initial successful applications of this technology for information storage are reviewed. Additional opportunities for the exploitation of this technology, which are currently under study, are described."
https://openalex.org/W1973711348,"A combinatorial disulfide cross-linking strategy was used to prepare a stalled complex of human immunodeficiency virus–type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase with a DNA template:primer and a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and the crystal structure of the complex was determined at a resolution of 3.2 angstroms. The presence of a dideoxynucleotide at the 3′-primer terminus allows capture of a state in which the substrates are poised for attack on the dNTP. Conformational changes that accompany formation of the catalytic complex produce distinct clusters of the residues that are altered in viruses resistant to nucleoside analog drugs. The positioning of these residues in the neighborhood of the dNTP helps to resolve some long-standing puzzles about the molecular basis of resistance. The resistance mutations are likely to influence binding or reactivity of the inhibitors, relative to normal dNTPs, and the clustering of the mutations correlates with the chemical structure of the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2041446134,"Interference of atomic de Broglie waves tunneling from a vertical array of macroscopically populated traps has been observed. The traps were located in the antinodes of an optical standing wave and were loaded from a Bose-Einstein condensate. Tunneling was induced by acceleration due to gravity, and interference was observed as a train of falling pulses of atoms. In the limit of weak atomic interactions, the pulse frequency is determined by the gravitational potential energy difference between adjacent potential wells. The effect is closely related to the ac Josephson effect observed in superconducting electronic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2057458887,"A design criterion that permits truly omnidirectional reflectivity for all polarizations of incident light over a wide selectable range of frequencies was used in fabricating an all-dielectric omnidirectional reflector consisting of multilayer films. The reflector was simply constructed as a stack of nine alternating micrometer-thick layers of polystyrene and tellurium and demonstrates omnidirectional reflection over the wavelength range from 10 to 15 micrometers. Because the omnidirectionality criterion is general, it can be used to design omnidirectional reflectors in many frequency ranges of interest. Potential uses depend on the geometry of the system. For example, coating of an enclosure will result in an optical cavity. A hollow tube will produce a low-loss, broadband waveguide, whereas a planar film could be used as an efficient radiative heat barrier or collector in thermoelectric devices."

https://openalex.org/W2010870019,"In situ measurements of the chemical composition of individual aerosol particles at altitudes between 5 and 19 kilometers reveal that upper tropospheric aerosols often contained more organic material than sulfate. Although stratospheric aerosols primarily consisted of sulfuric acid and water, many also contained meteoritic material. Just above the tropopause, small amounts of mercury were found in over half of the aerosol particles that were analyzed. Overall, there was tremendous variety in aerosol composition. One measure of this diversity is that at least 45 elements were detected in aerosol particles. These results have wide implications for the complexity of aerosol sources and chemistry. They also offer possibilities for understanding the transport of atmospheric aerosols."
https://openalex.org/W2045552152,"p53 exerts its cell cycle regulatory effects through its ability to function as a sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor. CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, through its interaction with the N terminus of p53, acts as a coactivator for p53 and increases the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of p53 by acetylating its C terminus. The same N-terminal domain of p53 has recently been shown to be phosphorylated at Ser15 in response to γ-irradiation. Remarkably, we now demonstrate that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 increases its ability to recruit CBP/p300. The increase in CBP/p300 binding was followed by an increase in the overall level of acetylation of the C terminus of p53. These results provide a mechanism for the activation of p53-regulated genes following DNA damage, through a signaling pathway linking p53 N-terminal kinase and C-terminal acetyltransferase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1992933851,Helical polyacetylene was synthesized under an asymmetric reaction field consisting of chiral nematic (N*) liquid crystals (LCs). The chiral nematic LC was prepared by adding a chiroptical binaphthol derivative as a chiral dopant to a mixture of two nematic LCs. Acetylene polymerizations were carried out using the catalyst titanium tetra-n-butoxide-triethylaluminum dissolved in the chiral nematic LC solvent. The polyacetylene film was shown by scanning electron microscopy to consist of clockwise or counterclockwise helical structure of fibrils. A Cotton effect was observed in the region of the pi --> pi* transition of the polyacetylene chain in circular dichroism spectra. The high electrical conductivities of approximately 1500 to 1800 siemens per centimeter after iodine doping and the chiral helicity of these films may be exploited in electromagnetic and optical applications.
https://openalex.org/W2048215059,"We report here that the Shigella invasion plasmid antigen (Ipa)B, which is sufficient to induce apoptosis in macrophages, binds to caspase (Casp)-1, but not to Casp-2 or Casp-3. Casp-1 is activated and its specific substrate interleukin-1β is cleaved shortly after Shigella infection. Macrophages isolated from Casp-1 knock-out mice are not susceptible to Shigella-induced apoptosis, although they respond normally to other apoptotic stimuli. Shigella kills macrophages from <i>casp-3</i>, <i>casp-11,</i> and <i>p53</i> knock-out mice as well as macrophages overexpressing Bcl-2. We propose that Shigella induces apoptosis by directly activating Casp-1 through IpaB, bypassing signal transduction events and caspases upstream of Casp-1. Taken together these data indicate that Shigella-induced apoptosis is distinct from other forms of apoptosis and seems uniquely dependent on Casp-1."
https://openalex.org/W2089454086,"Extracellular matrix molecules such as type I collagen are required for the adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of a number of cell types including osteoblasts. Matrix components often affect cell function by interacting with members of the integrin family of cell surface receptors. Previous work showed that collagen matrix synthesis, induced by addition of ascorbic acid to cells, precedes and is essential for the expression of osteoblast markers and induction of the osteocalcin promoter in murine MC3T3-E1 cells. This later response requires OSE2, the promoter element recognized by Osf2 (also called Cbfa1/AML3/PEBP2αA), a recently identified osteoblast-specific transcription factor. Osteoblasts express several integrins including α2β1 which is a major receptor for type I collagen. This paper examines the role of the α2-integrin subunit in osteocalcin promoter activation and osteoblast differentiation. Disruption of α2-integrin-ECM interactions with a blocking antibody or DGEA peptide containing the cell-binding domain of type I collagen blocked activation of the mouse osteocalcin gene 2 promoter by ascorbic acid as well as induction of endogenous osteocalcin mRNA and mineralization. Furthermore, anti-α2-integrin blocking antibody or peptide reduced ascorbic acid-dependent binding of Osf2 to OSE2 without affecting levels of transcription factor mRNA. Time course studies revealed that ascorbic acid-dependent binding of Osf2 to OSE2 preceded increases in osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein expression and this increase in Osf2 binding was not accompanied by comparable changes in levels of transcription factor mRNA or protein. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that an α2-integrin-collagen interaction is required for activation of Osf2 and induction of osteoblast-specific gene expression. Furthermore, matrix signals may regulate Osf2 through a post-translational pathway or via an accessory factor.

As a cell primarily devoted to matrix production, the osteoblast must have the ability to monitor the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 it is secreting as well as adapt matrix composition to the changing mechanical needs of bone. Consistent with the concept that there is a dialogue between the osteoblast and its ECM, osteoblast precursors must secrete a collagenous matrix before they will differentiate. Inhibition of collagen synthesis by growing cells in the absence of ascorbic acid (AA) or through the use of specific inhibitors totally blocks osteoblast differentiation (1Gerstenfeld L.C.

In vivo, both bone formation and osteoblast differentiation, as assessed by expression of osteocalcin (OCN) and alkaline phosphatase mRNAs, are also severely reduced in vitamin C-deficient animals (7Togari A. Arai M. Nakagawa S. Banno A. Aoki M. Matsumoto S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 68: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Mahmoodian F. Gosiewska A. Peterkofsky B. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the ECM is an important, but poorly understood regulator of the osteoblast differentiation pathway. Integrins are the principle mediators of the molecular dialogue between a cell and its ECM environment (for reviews, see Refs 9Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar and 10Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). These transmembrane receptors convey information from the ECM to the intracellular compartment utilizing several signal transduction pathways including those involving focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (11Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). The unique combinations of integrin subunits determines which ECM molecules will be recognized by a cell. For example, type I collagen interacts with α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1-integrins while fibronectin binds α3β1, α4β1, and α5β1 dimers. Osteoblasts express several integrin species including α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, αv, β1, β2, and β3 subunits (12Clover J. Dodds R. Gowen M. J.

Of particular interest, blocking α2-integrin-type I collagen interactions with specific peptides and antibodies prevents AA-dependent induction of alkaline phosphatase and differentiation-dependent down-regulation of transforming growth factor-β receptors in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells suggesting that this integrin participates in the differentiation process (17Takeuchi Y.

We recently showed that AA increases mouse OCN gene 2 (mOG2) promoter activity approximately 20-fold in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells. Significantly, this response, like the overall differentiation response of osteoblasts, requires collagen matrix synthesis and OSE2, the downstream promoter-binding site for Osf2. Induction of matrix synthesis is also accompanied by a dramatic increase in the binding of a protein in nuclear extracts (presumably Osf2) to OSE2, suggesting that ECM synthesis up-regulates and/or activates Osf2 (26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of α2-integrin-type I collagen interactions in the control of osteoblast-specific transcription and differentiation. As will be shown, blocking integrin-type I collagen binding prevents activation of the OCN promoter by AA and suppresses binding of Osf2 to OSE2 DNA. Interestingly, the dramatic stimulation of Osf2 activity and osteoblast-specific gene expression by AA is not accompanied by comparable increases in transcription factor mRNA or protein suggesting that the ECM activates this factor through either a post-translational pathway or via an accessory factor. Tissue culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham (Arlington Heights, IL). Peptides (DGEA, RGDS, and RGES) were purchased from Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY) while the KDGE peptide was synthesized by the core facility of the University of Michigan. Blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the mouse α2-integrin subunit (clone HMα2) or α5subunit (clone HMα5) and FITC-labeled anti-mouse α2-integrin antibody were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). FITC-labeled IgG (Hamster) was purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MA). Normal hamster IgG was obtained from Sigma. Mouse Osf2 antiserum was prepared in rabbits using a synthetic peptide having the following sequence: SFFWDPSTSRRFSPPS (amino acids 84–99 of the Osf2 sequence (20Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar)). This antiserum exhibited no detectable cross-reactivity with other members of the runt family of transcription factors on either gels retardation assays or Western blots (see Figs. 3 C and 5 A). All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Figure 5Time course of immunoreactive Osf2 protein levels and DNA binding activity. A, specificity of Osf2 antiserum.

Subclone 4 cells express high levels of osteoblast marker mRNAs and form a mineralized ECM after growth in AA-containing medium. Subclone 42 cells similarly exhibit a high differentiation/mineralization potential in the presence of AA and contain stably integrated copies of a 1.3-kilobase mouse osteocalcin gene 2 promoter fragment-firefly luciferase fusion gene (p1.3OG2-luc) that is induced by AA with a time course that parallels endogenous OCN mRNA (26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Both subclones were plated at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2. Medium was changed after 48 h and cells cultured in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml AA as described previously (27Franceschi R.T. Nutr. Rev. 1992; 50: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Subclones were cultured in AA-free α-modified Eagle's medium (MEMα) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). UMR106-01 osteosarcoma cells, a generous gift from Dr. Ronald Midura (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH), were maintained in MEM, 10% FBS, 20 mm HEPES with 1 × non-essential amino acids. C2C12 myoblasts, a gift from Dr. Daniel Goldman (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells (American Type Culture Collection), and 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS. F9 teratocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) and ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, a gift from Dr. Laurie McCauley (University of Michigan School of Dentistry), were grown in MEM, 10% FBS. The Jurkat human T-cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.0 mml-glutamate, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter l-glucose, 10 mm HEPES. For immunofluorescence measurements, subclone 4 cells were cultured on glass slides for 2 days, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed 3 × for 2 min with PBS containing 0.1% goat serum, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C. Slides were blocked with DMEM containing 5% calf serum, 10% normal goat serum for 45 min at room temperature and washed 3 × for 2 min with PBS containing 0.1% goat serum. 50 μl of FITC-labeled anti-mouse α2-integrin Ab (0.1 μg/μl) or the same concentration of FITC-labeled control IgG in 5% FBS/DMEM was then added and slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were then washed 3 × 5 min with PBS containing 0.1% goat serum, mounted with anti-fade mountant, and examined with a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope and Optronics Digital Camera DEI-470 imaging system. For Western blots, whole cell extracts were prepared by rinsing cell layers in phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μl of Sigma protease inhibitor mixture/107 cells. Inhibitor mixture contained 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin and 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then harvested in 1 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer (2% SDS, 2m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Failure to use a combination of protease inhibitors led to the generation of proteolytic fragments of Osf2, particularly in AA-treated cells. To compensate for the increased protein in AA-treated samples, aliquots of whole cell extracts equivalent to 2 μg of DNA were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Primary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse Osf2 antiserum) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Second antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) was used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Blocking and reaction with antibodies was conducted as described previously (28Winnard R.G. Gerstenfeld L.C. Toma C.D. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was determined using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham). Films were scanned and subjected to image analysis using NIH Image version 1.61 software. Total RNA was isolated from cell layers according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). Poly(A)-containing RNA was purified by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography (30Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl.

Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). All cDNA inserts were excised from plasmid DNA with the appropriate restriction enzymes and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis before labeling with α-[32P]dCTP using a random primer kit (Boehringer-Mannheim). Hybridizations were performed as described previously using a Bellco Autoblot hybridization oven (35Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and quantitatively scanned using a Packard A2024 InstantImager. All values were normalized for RNA loading by probing blots with cDNA to 18 S rRNA (36Renkawitz R. Gerbi S.A. Glatzer K.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 173: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subclone 42 cells were plated in 24-well plates and, after 2 days, cultures were treated with the indicated concentrations of antibodies or peptides in the presence or absence of AA. Medium was replenished every other day and cells harvested at day 6. Luciferase assays were performed using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and reagents and protocols from Promega (Madison, WI). The DNA content of each sample was then measured for normalization (37Schneider W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 680-684Crossref Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). To determine the mineralization potential of cultures, cells were grown with the indicated additions for 8 days. Inorganic phosphate was then added to a final concentration of 3.5 mm and, after 24 h, samples were stained using the Von Kossa method (38Marsh M.E. Munne A.M. Vogel J.J. Cui Y. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared and gel retardation assays conducted as described previously (26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 2 μg of DNA equivalents of nuclear extract. For supershift assays, anti-mouse Osf2 serum was incubated with nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min prior to addition of labeled probe. All values are reported as mean ± S.D. based on triplicate independent cell cultures from a representative experiment. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and qualitatively identical results were obtained. Previous work from this laboratory showed that cell-collagen interactions are crucial for osteoblast differentiation and tissue-specific gene expression. Induction of osteoblast markers by AA is blocked by collagen synthesis inhibitors or digestion of the ECM with purified collagenase (35Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, AA-dependent mOG2 promoter activation also requires collagen synthesis (26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Little is known concerning the mechanism of this regulation. One possibility explored in the experiments described below is that osteoblast differentiation requires an α2-integrin-type I collagen interaction. This integrin subunit is a component of the α2β1-integrin, a major binding site for collagens that has previously been detected in osteoblasts (14Hughes D. Salter S. Dedhar S. Simpson R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, MC3T3-E1 cells clearly produce the α2-integrin subunit as detected by both immunofluorescence (panel A) and Northern blotting (panel B). Levels of a 5-kilobase α2-integrin mRNA increased with time in culture (result not shown), but were not substantially changed by AA treatment. To determine whether an α2-integrin-type I collagen interaction is required for activation of the osteocalcin promoter, specific peptides and antibodies were used to disrupt this and related interactions. These experiments used subclone 42 cells, a previously described, highly differentiating MC3T3-E1 subclone containing stably integrated copies of the mOG2 promoter driving expression of firefly luciferase. As previously reported, growth of these cells in the presence of AA induces OCN promoter activity as well as endogenous OCN and BSP mRNAs (26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Induction of osteocalcin promoter activity was selectively inhibited by a DGEA peptide (Fig. 2 A) which is a component of the α2β1-integrin-binding domain of type I collagen (39Staatz W.D. Fok K.F. Zutter M.M. Adams S.P. Rodriguez B.A. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7363-7367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a specific α2-integrin blocking antibody (Fig. 2 B). Inhibition was dose-dependent and highly specific in that a control peptide with the sequence, KDGE, an RGDS peptide which mimics the cell-binding domain of fibronectin and related proteins, the inactive fibronectin cell-binding domain variant, RGES, or an anti-α5-integrin blocking antibody were all totally inactive over the concentration range used for active inhibitors. Both the DGEA peptide and α2-integrin antibody were also found to be highly effective and selective inhibitors of mineralization, the end point for osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 2 C). Cells treated with inhibitors showed no signs of toxicity such as visible cell detachment or significant reduction in the amount of DNA per culture dish (control, 4.7 ± 0.2 μg of DNA/dish; 1.0 mm DGEA, 4.5 ± 0.1 μg of DNA/dish; 12 μg/ml of anti-α2 antibody, 4.4 ± 0.5 μg of DNA/dish). In an earlier study, we showed that AA-dependent activation of the OCN promoter requires OSE2, the cis-acting element in this promoter that is regulated by Osf2. Furthermore, nuclear extracts from AA-treated cells were found to contain more OSE2 binding activity (presumably Osf2) than controls (26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 5, below). Because peptide or antibody blocking of α2-integrin function inhibited osteoblast differentiation and transcriptional activity of the OCN promoter, we considered it important to examine the requirement for this integrin species in Osf2 activation as measured by its ability to bind OSE2 (Fig. 3). This and subsequent experiments used subclone 4 MC3T3-E1 cells grown for various times in the presence or absence of AA. Like the stably transfected subclone 42 cells described above, this subclone also readily differentiates after treatment with AA (26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 3 days in the presence of AA and the indicated peptides or antibodies before RNA or nuclear extracts were prepared. DGEA peptide or anti-α2-integrin antibody selectively suppressed expression of endogenous OCN mRNA (panel A) without affecting the Osf2 message. In contrast, binding of nuclear extracts to OSE2 was clearly inhibited by both of these treatments (panel B). Control peptide, IgG, and anti-α5-integrin antibody were all devoid of inhibitory activity. The shifted species generated when subclone 4 nuclear extracts were reacted with OSE2 did, in fact, contain Osf2 because it was supershifted by an anti-Osf2 antiserum (panel C). The specificity of the anti-Osf2 antiserum was confirmed by demonstrating that it was not able to interact with the shifted species generated between a Jurkat cell nuclear extract and OSE2 (also see Fig. 5 for further information on the specificity of this antiserum). Jurkat cells contain AML1 and -2, two related mammalian runt domain proteins that are also capable of binding the OSE2 core sequence (21Levanon D. Negreanu V. Bernstein Y. Bar A. Avivi L. Groner Y. Genomics. 1994; 23: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that AA-dependent induction of the OCN gene, differentiation/mineralization of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells, and stimulation of Osf2 transcription factor binding to OSE2 all require an α2-integrin-collagen interaction. As noted above, although inhibition of α2-integrin binding to collagen blocked osteoblast-specific gene expression and binding of Osf2 to OSE2, these treatments did not affect Osf2 mRNA levels. Assuming Osf2 mRNA and protein levels are related, this suggests that an integrin-mediated signal increases the transcriptionalactivity of Osf2 without affecting its actual levels. This hypothesis was explored further in the experiments shown in Figs. 4 and 5which compared the temporal relationship between Osf2 mRNA and protein with OSE2 binding activity and osteoblast marker mRNA expression during AA-induced differentiation. As previously reported, several days were required for full induction of OCN and BSP mRNAs (3Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 26Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The first detectable increase in BSP message was seen after 2 days while 4 days were required for induction of the OCN mRNA. At day 6, AA treatment increased OCN and BSP mRNA levels approximately 12-fold (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, levels of Osf2 mRNA were only slightly affected by AA treatment over the same time period. After 4 and 6 days, AA increased Osf2 mRNA only 1.5–2-fold. Western blots were next used to assess Osf2 protein levels in whole cell extracts (Fig. 5). In agreement with a previous report (18Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.Y. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem."

To evaluate the role of SR-BI in plasma lipoprotein metabolism, we have generated transgenic mice with liver-specific overexpression of murine SR-BI. On a chow diet SR-BI transgenic (SR-BI Tg) mice have decreased HDL-CE, apoA-I, and apoA-II levels; plasma triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL apoB were also decreased, compared with control mice. Turnover studies using non-degradable CE and protein labels showed markedly increased total and selective uptake of HDL-CE in the liver and increased HDL protein catabolism in both liver and kidney. To evaluate the changes in apoB further, mice were challenged with high fat, high cholesterol diets. In SR-BI Tg mice plasma apoB levels were only 3–15% of control levels, and the dietary increase in VLDL and LDL apoB was virtually abolished. These studies show that steady state overexpression of hepatic SR-BI reduces HDL levels and increases reverse cholesterol transport. They also indicate that SR-BI can play a role in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. The dual effects of increased reverse cholesterol transport and lowering of apoB-containing lipoproteins that result from hepatic SR-BI overexpression could have anti-atherogenic consequences.

HDL appears to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for catabolism and secretion (reverse cholesterol transport) (3Eisenberg S. J.

A putative cell-surface receptor for this process has been identified (5Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). This receptor, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), mediates high affinity binding of HDL and the selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester (CE) (5Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), a process for delivery of cholesteryl ester into cells without degradation of HDL proteins (6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SR-BI mRNA and protein levels are highest in adrenal gland, ovary, testis, and liver, tissues that display greatest selective cholesteryl ester uptake from HDL (7Cao G. Garcia C.K.

More recently, strong support for the role of SR-BI in HDL metabolism has been provided by studies of mice with a targeted mutation resulting in decreased SR-BI gene expression (12Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 13Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Wang N.

These mice demonstrate increased plasma HDL cholesterol, decreased adrenal cholesterol content (12Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wang N. Huntress V.F. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Gosselin M.L. Dixon K.L. Deeds J.D. Acton S.L. Tall A.R. Huszar D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), suggesting that SR-BI is the major molecule mediating HDL-CE-selective uptake in the liver. By contrast, adenovirus-mediated, hepatic overexpression of SR-BI in mice results in depletion of plasma HDL and an increase in biliary cholesterol concentration (14Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Although these studies nicely demonstrate the effect of acute overexpression of SR-BI on HDL levels (14Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), they do not necessarily demonstrate plasma lipoprotein changes that would accompany steady state overexpression of SR-BI. In this paper we report an in depth study of transgenic mice with hepatic overexpression of murine SR-BI. These studies were designed to understand better the role of SR-BI in HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. During the initial characterization of these animals on a chow diet, we observed decreased LDL cholesterol and apoB levels. Whereas the mouse model studies to date have focused on HDL changes, SR-BI was originally identified as a receptor recognizing both native and modified LDL (15Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, further studies were performed on high fat, high cholesterol diets in order to delineate the effects of SR-BI on plasma apoB levels. A 1.5-kilobase cDNA fragment of murine SR-BI (16Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera-Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) was cloned into the HpaI site of the pLIV-7 plasmid (17Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A. Lauer S.J. Dang Q. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8724-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. John M. Taylor (Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, University of California, San Francisco). A linearized fragment of the construct containing the promoter, first exon, first intron, and part of the second exon of the human apoE gene, the murine SR-BI cDNA, and the polyadenylation sequence, and hepatic control region of the apoE/C-I gene locus was used to generate transgenic mice by standard procedures. Founder animals were backcrossed to C57Bl/6J mice and two transgenic mouse lines, SR-BI Tg(1) and SR-BI Tg(2), were established. Studies in this paper were performed using 8–10-week-old SR-BI Tg(1) or SR-BI Tg(2) N2 or N3 mice positive for both SR-BI transgene genotype and phenotype (decreased plasma total cholesterol) versuscontrol littermates negative for the SR-BI transgene. For studies of responses to high fat diets, mice were fed either a Western type diet containing 20% hydrogenated coconut oil and 0.15% cholesterol (Research Diets, Inc.) or a very high cholesterol diet containing 1.25% cholesterol, 7.5% cocoa butter, 7.5% casein, and 0.5% sodium cholate for 2 weeks. Total plasma cholesterol, free cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides were determined using commercial enzymatic assays (Wako, Japan) (8Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Determination of plasma apoB levels was carried out using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent immunoassay with an affinity purified polyclonal antibody against murine apoB. For SDS-PAGE, VLDL (d <1.006 g/ml), IDL + LDL (d = 1.006–1.055 g/ml), and HDL (d = 1.055–1.21 g/ml) were separated by sequential density ultracentrifugation of pooled mouse plasma. In some experiments VLDL + IDL (d <1.006–1.019) and LDL (d = 1.019–1.055) were separated as indicated. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel analysis of isolated lipoproteins was performed using 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels from Bio-Rad. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, and the identity of individual apolipoproteins was confirmed by Western analysis. HDL was prepared in the density range 1.063–1.21 g/ml from plasma of C57BL/6 wild type mice, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3 mm EDTA and 0.02% NaN3, and radiolabeled in the protein moiety with 125I-N-methyltyramine cellobiose (125I-NMTC) (18Pittman R.C. Taylor Jr., C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 612-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and thereafter with [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether ([3H]CEt, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (19Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]CEt was introduced in a liposomal preparation and exchanged (6 h, 37 °C) into125I-NMTC-labeled HDL using purified recombinant human plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein. The donor liposomes were separated from labeled HDL by ultracentrifugation at d= 1.063 g/ml, followed by another spin at d = 1.21 g/ml to remove cholesteryl ester transfer protein from the labeled HDL preparation. Then the doubly labeled HDL was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3 mm EDTA. Experiments to determine plasma decay of both HDL tracers and their tissue sites of uptake were carried out (19Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen R.C. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Food was removed from five female control and SR-BI Tg mice 4 h before tracer injection, and animals were fasted throughout the 24-h study period but had free access to water. Doubly radiolabeled HDL was injected at 10:00 a.m. in an iliac vein, and blood samples were drawn from the tail vein of each animal at 0.08, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, 9.0, and 24.0 h post-injection. Plasma samples were directly radioassayed for 125I and analyzed for [3H] after lipid extraction (19Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after tracer injection the animals were anesthetized and perfused with saline (50 ml per animal), and organs were collected, weighed, homogenized, and radioassayed. Tissue content of 125I radioactivity was directly assayed and that of [3H] was analyzed after lipid extraction. Based on plasma decay of both HDL tracers, plasma FCRs were calculated using a two-compartment model (21Le N.A. Ramakrishnan R. Dell R.B. Ginsberg H.N. Brown W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Organ FCRs, representing the fraction of the plasma pool of the traced HDL component cleared per h by an organ, were calculated as the plasma FCR × fraction of total tracer (%) recovered in a specific organ (19Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen R.C. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis for SR-BI and Southern and Northern analysis were performed as described (8Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Jiang X Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Dot blot was carried out with a 900-base pair cDNA fragment of mouse apoB to determine hepatic apoB mRNA levels. Hepatic and adrenal cholesterol contents were measured by gas-liquid chromatography (23Plump A. Azrolan S., N. Odaka H. Wu L. Jiang X. Tall A.R. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1033-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma relative LCAT activity was determined by examining conversion of endogenous plasma free cholesterol to cholesteryl ester. Plasma-specific LCAT activity was determined using reconstituted discoidal HDL as exogenous substrate, which was prepared with the sodium cholate method at an initial molar ratio of 80:4:1:160, egg phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:apoA-I:sodium cholate (34Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, each assay mixture contained reconstituted HDL (24 μg of apoA-I), 4% defatted bovine serum albumin, and 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction was initiated by adding the indicated amount of plasma and carried out at 37 °C for 20 min. LCAT activity was determined by the percentage conversion of [14C]cholesterol to CE. Two separate lines of SR-BI Tg mice, SR-BI Tg(1) and SR-BI Tg(2), were established. The SR-BI Tg(1) mice demonstrated a pattern of marked liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI mRNA (Fig. 1 A); there was no appreciable expression in the kidney (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Western analysis showed a 12-fold increase in hepatic membrane SR-BI levels in transgenic mice (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar levels of expression were observed for both lines of SR-BI Tg mice. Analysis of plasma lipids on a chow diet revealed that female SR-BI Tg mice (both lines) had a profound 92–94% decrease of plasma total cholesterol (TC) (Table I), with decreases in both free cholesterol (FC) (∼80%) and cholesteryl ester (CE) (96%). There was also a significant but less pronounced decrease in plasma phospholipids (PL) (∼75%) and triglycerides (TG) (45–58%) (Table I). Similar results were obtained for male mice (not shown).Table IPlasma lipid concentrations of control and SR-BI Tg miceDietAnimalTCFCCEPLTGChowControl67 ± 1115 ± 552 ± 10185 ± 1877 ± 37SR-BI Tg(1)5 ± 21-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.3 ± 21-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.2 ± 11-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.47 ± 61-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.32 ± 61-bp < 0.05.SR-BI Tg(2)4 ± 21-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.2 ± 11-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.2 ± 11-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.45 ± 81-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.42 ± 161-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.WesternControl107 ± 1324 ± 582 ± 11255 ± 30148 ± 30SR-BI Tg(1)78 ± 131-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.56 ± 51-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.16 ± 71-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.213 ± 241-bp < 0.05.93 ± 371-bp < 0.05.SR-BI Tg(2)68 ± 201-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.51 ± 131-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.19 ± 81-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.211 ± 331-bp < 0.05.95 ± 271-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.Very high cholesterolControl114 ± 1141 ± 673 ± 8207 ± 4085 ± 30SR-BI Tg(1)54 ± 251-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.18 ± 81-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.24 ± 31-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.132 ± 441-bp < 0.05.61 ± 24SR-BI Tg(2)16 ± 81-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.8 ± 51-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.8 ± 41-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.82 ± 321-aStatistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.67 ± 37Plasma was collected, and lipid concentrations were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The values are expressed as mg/dl and shown as means ± S.D., n = 7–12 female mice.1-a Statistical significance, p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals on the same diet as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.1-b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Plasma was collected, and lipid concentrations were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The values are expressed as mg/dl and shown as means ± S.D., n = 7–12 female mice. When plasma was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), most of the CE and FC were in the HDL fraction in the control mice on the chow diet (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast HDL-CE and FC were almost undetectable in SR-BI Tg mice. HDL phospholipids were also markedly decreased (Fig. 2 C). There was also a decrease in lipids in VLDL and LDL region, although these were also low in control mice. Assessment of apolipoprotein composition of centrifugally isolated lipoproteins by reducing SDS-PAGE gels revealed a marked decrease of HDL apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoE levels in SR-BI Tg(1) mice (Fig. 3 A). The VLDL and LDL apoB and apoE levels also were decreased. The results were confirmed by Western analysis using antisera specific for murine apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoE. Similar results were obtained in four separate analyses of pooled plasma from a total of 9 SR-BI Tg(1) mice and 10 control mice and were also confirmed in the SR-BI Tg(2) line (data not shown). The changes in HDL in SR-BI Tg mice resemble these occurring 3 days after adenovirus-mediated expression of SR-BI (14Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) where HDL turnover was evaluated using 125I and DiI labels (14Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Next we carried out HDL turnover studies using non-degradable radiolabels (18Pittman R.C. Taylor Jr., C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 612-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the control mice, the higher rate of removal from plasma of the lipid ([3H]CEt), relative to protein (125I-NMTC), represents whole body selective uptake of HDL-CE (Fig. 4 A). There was a significantly accelerated rate of clearance for both tracers in SR-BI Tg mice. The plasma FCRs calculated from these decay curves showed a 370% increase in protein catabolism and 330% increase in lipid tracer catabolism (Fig. 4 B). The selective removal of HDL-CE from plasma, calculated as the difference between CE and protein FCRs, was increased by 260% in SR-BI Tg mice. Tissue sites of tracer uptake from doubly radiolabeled HDL were determined, and results are expressed as the organ FCRs (TableII). The liver was the predominant organ for both HDL lipid and protein catabolism (19Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen R.C. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The higher liver FCR for lipid, relative to protein, indicates selective uptake of HDL [3H]CEt in the liver. In contrast, a negative value of3H minus 125I was derived for kidney FCR (TableII), indicating this organ is a major site for selective HDL protein catabolism (20Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen R.C. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI Tg mice showed a substantial increase in hepatic FCRs for both HDL protein (7.5-fold) and lipid (6.4-fold). The renal FCR of HDL proteins was also markedly increased (6.6-fold) in SR-BI Tg mice, whereas this organ contributed little to the clearance of HDL lipid in wild type or SR-BI Tg mice. Adrenal FCRs for HDL protein and lipid were increased 10.5-and 6.3-fold, respectively, and the adrenal-selective uptake of HDL-CE was increased 5.6-fold. This finding may have reflected an up-regulation of endogenous adrenal SR-BI expression secondary to reduced HDL levels and depletion of adrenal cholesterol stores (see below). Other organs (heart, spleen, and stomach), with minor contribution to HDL lipid and protein uptake, did not display any major changes in SR-BI Tg mice.Table IIOrgan fractional catabolic rates for125I-NMTC/[3H]CEt double-labeled HDL in miceOrganMice125I-NMTC[3H]CEt3H-125ILiverControl16.7 ± 1.554 ± 5.638 ± 5.7SR-BI Tg124 ± 18.12-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.346 ± 742-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.221 ± 572-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.KidneyControl3.5 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.05−3.1 ± 0.4SR-BI Tg23.3 ± 1.22-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.1.8 ± 0.12-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.−21.5 ± 1.12-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.AdrenalControl0.1 ± 0.010.4 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.2SR-BI Tg0.6 ± 0.32-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.2.5 ± 0.92-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.1.9 ± 0.72-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.HeartControl0.2 ± 0.020.3 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.03SR-BI Tg0.6 ± 0.122-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.0.3 ± 0.1−0.3 ± 0.042-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.SpleenControl0.4 ± 0.040.7 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.06SR-BI Tg1.1 ± 0.062-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.1.3 ± 0.12-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.0.2 ± 0.2StomachControl0.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.10.01 ± 0.02SR-BI Tg0.4 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.12-aStatistical significance p < 0.01 between the control and SR-BI Tg animals as determined by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data.0.02 ± 0.2Organs were harvested from five female control and five female SR-BI Tg(1) mice 24 h after injection of labeled HDL.

The HDL turnover studies demonstrated that the reduced plasma HDL lipids and apolipoproteins were at least in part due to accelerated HDL catabolism in SR-BI Tg mice. We also measured hepatic apoA-I mRNA levels and found no difference between the control and SR-BI Tg animals (not shown). Hepatic free cholesterol was increased by 43% (p < 0.001) in SR-BI Tg mice (TableIII). By contrast adrenal cholesteryl ester virtually disappeared in SR-BI Tg mice, and free cholesterol was also decreased (Table III), probably reflecting the decreased plasma HDL-CE levels that result from hepatic overexpression of SR-BI (8Wang N.

This process requires ATP/Mg2+, K+, and several axillary proteins. We have developed a defined system for the assembly of progesterone receptor complexes using purified proteins. Five proteins are needed to form complexes that are capable of maintaining hormone binding activity. These include hsp70 and its co-chaperone, hsp40, the hsp70/hsp90-binding protein, Hop, hsp90, and the hsp90-binding protein, p23. The proteins Hip and FKBP52 were not required for this in vitro process even though they have been observed in receptor complexes. Each of the five proteins showed a characteristic concentration dependence. Similar concentrations of hsp70, hsp90, and p23 were needed for optimal assembly, but hsp40 and Hop were effective at about 1/10 the concentration of the other proteins, suggesting that these two proteins act catalytically or are needed at levels similar to the receptor concentration. ATP was required for the functioning of both hsp70 and hsp90. The binding of hsp70 to the receptor requires hsp40 and about 10 μm ATP; however, hsp90 binding appears to occur subsequent to hsp70 binding and is optimal with 1 mm ATP.

The formation of receptor complexes in this system is dependent upon ATP hydrolysis, the ions Mg2+ and K+, and the participation of a number of proteins (6Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J.

When assembled in vitro, the mature avian progesterone receptor complex closely resembles that obtained from oviduct cytosol and contains hsp90, any one of three immunophilins, and a 23-kDa phosphoprotein, p23. It also contains variable sub-stoichiometric amounts of hsp70. The immunophilins include the cyclosporin A-binding protein, CyP-40, and two FK506-binding proteins, FKBP51 and FKBP52.

Thus, the assembly of PR complexes includes at least two steps and a major intermediate complex. To gain further understanding on the mechanism of receptor complex assembly requires the use of more defined, purified systems. Toward this end, Pratt and co-workers (24Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J.

More recently, they have also shown a requirement for hsp40 (DnaJ homolog) in this system (26Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Their results indicate that glucocorticoid receptor complexes capable of binding hormone can be assembled using only hsp70, hsp40, hsp90, and Hop and that p23 is not essential but it stabilizes the receptor complexes to dramatically enhance hormone binding activity. We now report the assembly of progesterone receptor complexes using highly purified preparations of hsp70, hsp90, hsp40, Hop, and p23. We describe the conditions needed to assemble individual proteins into the complex to generate the hormone-binding state of the receptor.

Additional purification was achieved by fractionating the pool from hydroxylapatite on a Mono Q FPLC column (10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 mKCL. The fractions containing Hop were pooled, dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. The preparation was approximately 94% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. A bacterial expression system for Ydj1p was generously supplied by Dr. Avrom Caplan and has been described previously (32Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography followed by hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The preparation was approximately 80% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Human HDJ-2 was expressed in bacteria and purified as described for YDJ-1. The cDNA for HDJ-2 was generously supplied by Dr. Seishi Kato (33Oh S. Iwahori A. Kato S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression and purification of human p23 has been described (10Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble fraction of bacterial lysate was fractionated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography followed by phenyl-Sepharose (hp1660) FPLC, dialyzed into 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and stored at −70 °C. The preparation was greater than 99% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Chicken oviduct cytosol was prepared from estradiol-stimulated chicks as described previously (4Smith D.F. Schowalter D.B. Kost S.L. Toft D.O. Mol . Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), except that tissue homogenates were prepared in TTg buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mm thioglycerol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture of 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 77 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μm pepsatatin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm EDTA. The cytosol was adjusted to 0.5 m KCl and 5 mm ATP for 30 min on ice prior to the isolation of PR. Either fresh tissue or tissue stored at −70 °C was used. Just prior to use, antibody resin was prepared by incubating PR22 with a slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 100 μm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature. Proportions were 1 mg of antibody to 1 ml (bed volume) of resin. The PR22-conjugated resin was washed three times in TTg buffer and then resuspended as a 1:1 slurry with TTg buffer. For the purification of receptor, 50 μl of PR22/protein A resin slurry was added to 1.6 ml of salt-treated cytosol. This mixture was maintained on ice for 1.5 h with gentle resin suspension. Receptor-resin complexes were rapidly washed with 4 × 1 ml of TTg buffer with brief centrifugation to pellet the resin. Resin pellets were either extracted directly into SDS sample buffer or used in reconstitution trials. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was purchased from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). Unless stated otherwise, lysate was supplemented with 3 mmMgCl2 and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 10 mm phosphocreatinine (di-Tris salt, Sigma) and creatine phosphokinase (3.5 units/100 μl of lysate; type I, from rabbit muscle, Sigma). Pellets of receptor-bound resin (25 μl) were suspended in 400 μl of reticulocyte lysate and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with brief vortexing every 5 min to resuspend resin. For the reconstitution of PR complexes with purified proteins, 25 μl of PR resin pellets were suspended in 200 μl of incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) containing various amounts of hsp70, YDJ-1 or HDJ-2, Hop, hsp90, p23, and 5 mm ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the samples were chilled and supplemented with 5 nm[1,2-3H]progesterone (1.9 TBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) plus 100 nm unlabeled progesterone. The samples were incubated for 1 h on ice and then washed with 4 × 1 ml of incubation buffer by centrifugation and suspension. The final samples were suspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS plus 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and heated for 1 min at 100 °C. Ten μl were removed for the measurement of [3H]progesterone, and the remainder was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). When the avian PR is isolated on antibody resin and stripped of its associated proteins, its hormone binding domain becomes very unstable (12Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Hormone binding activity can be maintained for several hours when in an ice bath, but it is rapidly lost at elevated temperatures. However, binding activity can be maintained at elevated temperatures or restored from the inactive state by reconstitution of the PR·hsp90 complex in reticulocyte lysate (12Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). An example of this is shown in Fig. 1. The A and B forms of the PR were first isolated on antibody resin, and endogenous hsp90 and other associated proteins were removed by treatment with 0.5m KCl (lane 1). Identical PR samples were then treated for 30 min at 30 °C in rabbit reticulocyte lysate to restore the complex with hsp90 (lane 2) or to make an intermediate complex by either limiting the ATP by omitting the ATP-regeneration system (lane 3) or by treatment with the hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA, lane 4). Reversal of GA inhibition could be accomplished by isolating the PR complex and incubating it with fresh lysate (lane 5). Fig. 1 Bshows the hormone binding activities of these preparations using a saturating concentration of [3H]progesterone. A major portion of binding activity can be maintained at 30 °C, but this is not possible when complex formation is compromised by omitting the ATP regeneration system or by treating with GA. Therefore, loss of hormone binding correlates with conditions that decrease hsp90 association in favor of hsp70 binding. In preliminary studies, we were able to reverse the GA-inhibited state (lane 4) by an incubation of the PR complex with three purified proteins, hsp90, hsp70, and p23 (results not shown). This effort was extended to develop a reconstitution system entirely composed of purified proteins as described below. In developing a defined system, we have used both the analysis of protein composition and the measurement of hormone binding to assess PR complex formation. Fig. 2 illustrates the loss of hormone binding activity upon incubation at 30 °C under various conditions. When in the absence of other proteins, the PR loses hormone binding activity progressively over a 30-min period. No stabilization of binding activity was observed when the PR was incubated with hsp70, ATP, and the yeast hsp40 homolog, YDJ-1. However, the third condition (complete) included ATP plus the five proteins, hsp70, YDJ-1, Hop, hsp90, and p23. In this case, there was a transient loss followed by a recovery and maintenance of hormone binding activity. This protein mixture represents the minimum or simplest system for maintaining activity as will be described below. The extent to which binding activity is maintained is somewhat variable within the range of 50–80% of the activity at the start of the experiment. Fig. 2 B shows the protein composition of PR isolated after 30 min incubation under the three conditions. In all cases, the PR-A and PR-B receptor forms are maintained with no loss due to degradation. When all proteins are present, a multi-protein complex including hsp90, hsp70, Hop, and p23 (not shown) is formed with proportions that resemble those of native PR complexes (6Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). When only hsp70 and YDJ-1 are present, they readily bind to the receptor, but they are not sufficient for providing a hormone-binding structure. Although hormone binding is lost in the presence of hsp70 and YDJ-1, these proteins may protect the PR against further denaturation. To test this, two sample sets containing PR-bound resin and 5 mmATP, with or without hsp70 and YDJ-1, were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to destabilize the receptor. The samples were then supplemented to contain all five chaperone proteins and incubated at 30 °C for the times indicated (Fig. 3). A significant amount of hormone binding activity could be restored to the 30 °C-treated PR by a second 30 °C incubation in the presence of all five chaperones. The presence of hsp70 and YDJ-1 from the beginning enhanced the recovery of hormone binding and appeared to protect a portion of the PR from becoming irreversibly denatured. This suggests that although hsp70 and YDJ-1 cannot maintain hormone binding activity, they hold the receptor in a state that can be more readily restored to native structure when all five proteins are present. hsp70 and YDJ-1 are the only two proteins that will bind PR in the absence of other proteins. Both proteins are required, and some of the conditions for this binding are shown in Fig. 4. PR resin was incubated with hsp70 for 30 min at 30 °C with or without ATP, ADP, or YDJ-1. The PR was then isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Background binding of hsp70 in the absence of PR is quite significant as shown in lane 8 (in the absence of PR). Substantial binding to PR is observed only when in the presence of ATP plus YDJ-1 (lane 6) or the closely related human hsp40 homolog, HDJ-2 (lane 7). This is consistent with the predominant model for hsp70 action where hsp70 with bound ATP initially interacts reversibly with substrates and is converted to a more stably bound hsp70-ADP state by ATP hydrolysis which requires the presence of hsp40 (35Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 36Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Comparable results were obtained using either YDJ-1 or HDJ-2; however, we have used YDJ-1 for most of our studies because it was the first cytoplasmic hsp40 that was readily available. It also is somewhat more consistent than HDJ-2 in our hands. The dependence upon each protein in the system for PR complex assembly was tested as shown in Fig. 5. Lane C shows the binding activity of PR kept in ice, and the2nd lane (T) shows the activity in the complete system after 30 °C for 30 min. Individual proteins were omitted from the system which caused a substantial loss of binding activity in all cases. Omission of hsp70 consistently resulted in the greatest loss of binding activity. This figure also shows the system to be completely dependent on ATP and that the addition of GA, a competitive inhibitor for the ATP-binding site on hsp90, inhibits in this system. An ATP regeneration system was found not to be necessary in this system with purified proteins. The relationship between hsp70 and hsp90 is shown more clearly in Fig. 6. In this experiment, the ATP concentration was varied, and the complexes produced were analyzed for hormone binding and composition. hsp70 binding is greatest with 10 μm ATP, whereas hsp90 binding and the development of hormone binding activity are optimal with an ATP concentration of 0.5 to 1 mm. Thus, the ATP requirement for hsp70 binding is much lower than for hsp90 binding, and the hormone binding activity of PR correlates with the binding of hsp90. As the binding of hsp90 progresses, the binding of hsp70 diminishes suggesting a reciprocal relationship between these two chaperones. The correlation between hsp90 binding and the appearance of hormone binding activity is also illustrated in Fig. 7 where complex formation is measured in relation to hsp90 concentration. The binding of p23 (not shown) also correlates with hsp90 binding.Figure 7The dependence of PR complexes on hsp90.PR resin samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with the complete system but with different amounts of hsp90. The samples were then analyzed for hormone binding activity (A) and for protein content (B). B, the hsp90 amounts were as follows: lane 1, 0; lane 2, 2 μg; lane 3, 4 μg; lane 4, 6 μg; lane 5, 10 μg;lane 6, 15 μg; lane 7, 20 μg; and lane 8, 25 μg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We looked more closely at the interaction between hsp90 and p23 in Fig. 8. In this experiment, PR was first incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of hsp70, YDJ-1, Hop, and ATP which caused a loss of hormone binding activity to near background. This was followed by a second 30 °C incubation after adding hsp90, p23, or both. It is clear that both hsp90 and p23 are required to obtain a significant recovery of hormone binding activity. Fig. 8 B shows that some hsp90 is bound to PR in the absence of p23 (lane 3). However, p23 promotes additional hsp90 binding and a corresponding reduction in the binding of hsp70 (lane 2). We have titrated the amount of each protein required in this reconstitution system. Table I lists the amount needed for maximum activity and the concentration at half-maximum. These data clearly illustrate two points. First, very comparable molar amounts of hsp70, hsp90, and p23 are needed. Under our conditions, these proteins are in about 10–20-fold excess over the PR concentration. The second point is that YDJ-1 and Hop are only required in 1/5 to 1/10 the amount of the other proteins. This suggests that they are either catalytic in their activities or that their requirements more closely match the PR concentration. It should be noted that an excess of YDJ-1 is detrimental, causing a marked reduction in the development or maintenance of hormone binding activity. This inhibitory effect has not been observed with the other proteins in the system.Table IConcentration of ingredients for PR assemblyComponentMaximum1-aEstimates were averaged from two experiments for the concentrations required for maximum assembly and for half of the maximum.Half-maximumμmPR (∼0.05 μm)ATP1500300hsp701.40.6hsp901-bThe hsp90 concentration is calculated as a homodimer.0.80.2p231.30.3YDJ-10.20.06Hop0.080.021-a Estimates were averaged from two experiments for the concentrations required for maximum assembly and for half of the maximum.1-b The hsp90 concentration is calculated as a homodimer. Open table in a new tab Our results show that the native state of the PR complex, as indicated by hormone binding capacity and by composition, can be maintained in vitro at 30 °C by the use of the following five additional proteins: hsp70, hsp40, Hop, hsp90, and p23. Once the hormone binding activity is lost, it can be recovered substantially by treatment with these proteins. These results are in agreement with the studies of Pratt and co-workers (24Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 25Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) on the reconstitution of glucocorticoid receptor complexes. Our study provides additional information on the amounts of protein required, the proportions of proteins in the complex, and some of the interrelationships among the proteins. Our studies suggest that PR complex formation proceeds through three primary steps as illustrated in Fig. 9. Initially, perhaps because of some structural instability in the hormone binding domain, the receptor is recognized by hsp70 and hsp40 (step 1). This may involve the rapid but very reversible binding of hsp70-ATP which is then converted to PR-hsp70-ADP through the YDJ-1-dependent hydrolysis of ATP by hsp70. Since the binding of hsp70 (above background) in PR is strictly dependent on YDJ-1 or HDJ-2 and ATP, it is likely that only the tighter binding of hsp70-ADP is observed because it withstands the procedure used for complex isolation. The recruitment of Hop-hsp90 to the PR complex (step 2) would occur once bound hsp70-ATP is converted to hsp70-ADP. Previous studies have shown that Hop can bind hsp70-ADP but not hsp70-ATP (12Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). At this stage, the hsp90 would be either nucleotide-free or bound with ADP since hsp90 treated with ATP and molybdate has a low affinity for Hop (14Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In this intermediate, the receptor might be shared by hsp70 and hsp90 or passed back and forth until its properties change to a state of preferential binding to hsp90. hsp90 can then be converted to the ATP-bound conformation which is stabilized and perhaps facilitated by the binding of p23. The PR acquires hormone binding activity coincident with its conversion during step 3. Hop and hsp70 appear to be released at this step; however, at least in vitro, this release is never complete. This may be because step 3 does not proceed very efficiently in vitro, or there may be a continued need for some hsp70 interaction to maintain the final hsp90 complex. The mechanism of hsp70 release is still unclear, but this is likely to involve the conversion of hsp70 to its ATP-bound state. ATP seems to be important at two steps in this process. It is first needed for the binding of hsp70 to PR, and an ATP concentration of about 10 μm is sufficient for this step. ATP is also needed for the last hsp90-mediated step but at a much higher concentration of about 1 mm. This higher ATP level may serve two purposes. It would be needed to convert hsp90 to its ATP-bound state which is able to bind p23 (29Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It may also facilitate nucleotide exchange and release of hsp70. These results provide an explanation for the earlier observation that PR complex formation in reticulocyte lysate requires the use of an ATP-regeneration system (6Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Without this, the ATP concentration falls below 1 mm, and only intermediate complexes are observed. The steps in Fig. 9 illustrate the order of interactions but do not accommodate the proportions or stoichiometry of interactants. The PR appears able to bind more than one hsp70 molecule, and multiple hsp70 interactions may be needed to partially unfold a region of PR to form a domain that is adequate for hsp90 binding. Unfortunately, little is yet known about the nature of the target sites that interact with hsp90 such as their optimal size or their hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties. Both hsp40 and Hop are required at about 1/10 the concentration of the other proteins. This suggests that their roles may be catalytic,i.e. they participate in complex formation but only transiently, and can then leave and mediate the formation of other complexes. Alternatively, they may have properties that allow them to more closely relate to the target protein concentration. For example, although Hop can bind to hsp70 in the absence of a target substrate (12Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 15Lässle M. Blatch G.L. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it binds preferentially to the ADP-bound form of hsp70. In the present system, the main pool of hsp70-ADP is likely to be that bound to PR. Thus, the amount of the Hop-binding partner, hsp70-ADP, would be determined by the PR concentration. It is possible that the inhibitory effect of excess YDJ-1 noted above is due in part to the generation of excess hsp70-ADP which may both extend the binding of hsp70 to PR and increase the requirement for Hop. The model in Fig. 9 generally agrees with previous models (1Smith D.F. Sci. Am. Sci. Med. 1995; 2: 38-47Google Scholar, 2Pratt W.B. Gehring U. Toft D.O. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Burkhauser Verlagi, Basel1996: 80-95Google Scholar, 3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). However, most previous models have emphasized multi-protein complexes as operational units of these proteins. Two types of hsp90 complexes are abundant in cell extracts, one with Hop and hsp70 and another with p23 and immunophilins (1Smith D.F. Sci. Am. Sci. Med. 1995; 2: 38-47Google Scholar, 2Pratt W.B. Gehring U. Toft D.O. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Burkhauser Verlagi, Basel1996: 80-95Google Scholar, 3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). These complexes are not static, and the interactions among components are influenced by nucleotide binding as discussed above. The three steps in Fig. 9 have not been demonstrated as isolated events, and they may imply a greater separation of events than occurs in the cell. Since pre-formed chaperone complexes exist, they are likely to be operational in this process. For example, one could consider the possibility that all five of the proteins studied here relate closely to a complex or foldosome (44Pratt W.B. Dittmar K.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that is mobile and somewhat variable in composition depending on its stage of activity. The role of p23 in the last step of PR complex assembly is still unclear. In their studies with the glucocorticoid receptor, Pratt and co-workers (25Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that p23 acts to stabilize and increase the amount of GR complexes in the hormone-binding state, but a significant amount of hormone binding complex can be produced in the absence of p23. That p23 is not essential is also indicated in a recent report by Bohen (42Bohen S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using a yeast system containing GR and a reporter gene. He showed that deletion of the p23 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae had a minimal effect on GR action, but it did sensitize the GR to inhibition by the GA-related drug, macbecin II (42Bohen S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Another report by Fang et al. (43Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Rao J. Caplan A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that the deletion of yeast p23 resulted in only a mild reduction in cell growth or the hsp90-dependent activities of the tyrosine kinase v-Src and the androgen receptor. Our results show a marked dependence upon p23 for the generation of hormone binding activity. It is possible that the dependence on p23 would be diminished in the presence of hormone. However, in preliminary experiments where the hormone was included during the 30 °C incubation of PR with chaperones, this resulted in only a slight increase in hormone binding (not shown). It is still quite possible that some contributing factors are missing from our minimal system (see below), and any deficiencies may enhance the dependence on p23. The present experimental system should be considered as a minimal system that is probably still incomplete. Two types of proteins, Hip and the immunophilins, are missing even though these have been clearly observed in steroid receptor complexes. In rabbit reticulocyte lysate, Hip binds to PR complexes at the intermediate stages of steps 1 and 2 (17Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar). Hip has been shown to bind to hsp70 and to stabilize the ADP-bound state of hsp70 (16Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus far, we have not observed any influence of Hip on the reconstitution system described here. Perhaps additional conditions or factors are needed to reveal a role for Hip in this system. Since immunophilin binding does not occur until the final step in assembling PR complexes (12Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), they may not be important to the assembly process per se but may fulfill a role subsequent to assembly. Little is known about the potential functions of FKBP51, FKBP52, and CyP-40. Pratt and co-workers (38Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar, 39Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that FKBP52 may be involved in the nuclear transport of steroid receptors. The immunophilins, having peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, could also interact with the receptor to modulate its conformational state either before or after the binding of hormone. Two recent reports relate to this latter possibility. The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin 1, interacts with and regulates the activities of several mitotic proteins (40Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). It selects these proteins and modifies their conformation by binding to a phosphoserine-proline motif. In another study, CyP-40 was shown to bind the transcription factor c-Myb resulting in an inhibition of its activity (41Leverson J.D. Ness S.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In any case, we have tested one immunophilin, FKBP52, and it does not affect PR complex formation under our conditions. Thus, several important questions remain to be answered concerning the hsp70, hsp90 pathway for the assembly and functioning of target protein complexes. The present system provides a defined framework for future mechanistic studies on the functioning of this chaperoning pathway and for elaborating on additional components and functions of this process.

One consequence of α-MSH stimulation is increased melanization attributable to induction of pigmentation enzymes, including tyrosinase, which catalyzes a rate-limiting step in melanin synthesis. The tyrosinase promoter is a principle target of the melanocyte transcription factor Microphthalmia (Mi), a factor for which deficiency in humans causes Waardenburg syndrome II. We show here that both α-MSH and forskolin, a drug that increases cAMP, stimulate a rapid increase in Mi mRNA and protein levels in both melanoma cell lines and primary melanocytes. This up-regulation requires a cAMP-responsive element within the Mi promoter, and the pathway leading to Mi stimulation is subject to tight homeostatic regulation. Although cAMP signaling is ubiquitous, the Mi promoter was seen to be cAMP-responsive in melanocytes but not in nonmelanocytes. Moreover, dominant negative interference with Mi impeded successful α-MSH stimulation of tyrosinase. The regulation of Mi expression via α-MSH thus provides a direct mechanistic link to pigmentation. In addition, because the human melanocyte and deafness condition Waardenburg syndrome is sometimes caused by haploinsufficiency of Mi, its modulation by α-MSH suggests therapeutic strategies targeted at up-regulating the remaining wild type Mi allele.

Waardenburg syndrome II is a human dominant hereditary pigmentation and deafness condition in which mutations in the Microphthalmia (Mi)1transcription factor gene have been identified (1Hughes A.E.

It is thought that inner ear melanocytes are functionally deficient in Waardenburg patients, suggesting an essential although poorly understood role for pigment cells in sensorineural hearing. Most human mutations in Mi are likely to be functionally null (1Hughes A.E. Newton V.E. Liu X.Z. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Tassabehji M.

Because human Waardenburg Syndrome II often results from haploinsufficiency, it is of interest to understand pathways that might up-regulate Mi expression on the remaining (wild type) Mi allele. Recent work has demonstrated that Mi protein function is subject to regulation in response to cytokine signaling. Activation of the c-Kit cytokine receptor on pigment cells by Steel factor was found to trigger activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which directly phosphorylates Mi at serine 73 (10Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of Mi is modulated through interactions with the transcriptional coactivator p300/CREB-binding protein (11Sato S. Roberts K. Gambino G. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the specific recruitment to Mi of which is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (12Price E.R. Ding H.-F. Badalian T. Bhattacharya S. Takemoto C. Yao T.P. Hemesath T.J. Fisher D.E. J. Biol.

Ding H.-F. Badalian T. Bhattacharya S. Takemoto C. Yao T.P. Hemesath T.J. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17983-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) although not its expression level per se. The pathway also correlates with the phenotypic overlap of mi, Steel, and c-kit mutant mice, all of which are devoid of melanocytes (4Silvers W.K. The Coat Colors of Mice: A Model For Mammalian Gene Action and Interaction. Springer-Verlag, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). Earlier studies have identified Mi as the major transcriptional regulator of the pigment enzyme genes tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 (8Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G.

Mi thus appears to reside at a very central position relative to regulation of pigmentation in melanocytes. For this reason it is plausible that other pathways associated with pigmentation might also operate through regulation of Mi function or expression. α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a pituitary-derived peptide that stimulates melanin production in melanocytes (19Lerner A.B. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1993; 680: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The α-MSH receptor, Mc1r, is a member of the seven-transmembrane receptor superfamily (20Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Cone R.D. Science. 1992; 257: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the Mc1r receptor activates adenyl cyclase via G protein signaling, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP (20Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Cone R.D. Science. 1992; 257: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Treatment of melanocytes with agents that increase cAMP such as forskolin leads to induction of tyrosinase and increased melanin production (15Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Finally, pigment enzyme activity is induced after α-MSH stimulation. These studies have suggested either transcriptional (16Bertolotto C. Busca R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) or post-transcriptional (21Abdel M.Z. Swope V.B. Suzuki I. Akcali C. Harriger M.D. Boyce S.T. Urabe K. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) mechanisms for this up-regulation. Although the tyrosinase promoter could in principal be a direct target of cAMP, the tyrosinase promoter is unresponsive to forskolin in nonmelanocytes (15; see below), and the sequence of a large portion of the tyrosinase promoter has not revealed any cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) (for review, see Ref. 22Ferguson C.A. Kidson S.H. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the tyrosinase promoter could be modulated by a factor that itself is subject to cAMP-dependent regulation. Interestingly, melanoma cells themselves often down-regulate pigmentation by a variety of mechanisms, some involving degradation of tyrosinase (23Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Mi binds as a dimer to a subset of “E box” DNA sequences (8Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) found in target genes. Loss of the Mi binding site significantly disrupts tyrosinase promoter activity within melanocytes as well as α-MSH responsiveness (15Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mi activity could link α-MSH signaling to tyrosinase induction. In addition, stimulation by α-MSH enhances tyrosinase activity, and in one study this was found to be accompanied by increased levels of Mi DNA binding activity, although either absence or presence of Mi protein increases have both been described after α-MSH stimulation (15Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Bertolotto C. Busca R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) The microphthalmia gene contains two promoter/exon-1 combinations, which are alternatively spliced onto a common downstream body (9Steingrimsson E. Moore K.J. Lamoreux M.L. Ferre D.A.A.R. Burley S.K. Zimring D.C. Skow L.C. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). One of these promoter/exon 1 cassettes appears to be expressed exclusively in melanocytes (9Steingrimsson E. Moore K.J. Lamoreux M.L. Ferre D.A.A.R. Burley S.K. Zimring D.C. Skow L.C. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Recently, a fragment from the melanocytic microphthalmia promoter was cloned (24Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and found to contain a cAMP-responsive element. This element suggested a mechanistic link between α-MSH signaling and induction of tyrosinase via regulation of Mi expression. We demonstrate here that elevated intracellular cAMP, triggered by either α-MSH or forskolin, does, in fact, lead to rapid and potent induction of the Mi promoter. This induction is dependent on an intact CRE, which importantly was found to be cAMP-inducible only in melanocytes. Moreover, use of a dominant negative Mi mutant suggested that this up-regulation of Mi expression is essential to the mechanism through which α-MSH up-regulates tyrosinase expression. The B16, 501mel (kindly provided by Ruth Halaban; Ref. 25Zakut R. Perlis R. Eliyahu S. Yarden Y. Givol D. Lyman S.D. Halaban R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2221-2229PubMed Google Scholar), and BHK cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 10% fetal calf serum, and 5% CO2. The BAC1.2F5 cell line (macrophages) was grown in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum plus 20% L cell conditioned media, and the C57 mast cell line (generously provided by Dr. S. Galli) was grown in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.2 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. Primary human neonatal melanocytes were obtained from Clonetics and maintained as recommended by the supplier. Cells were treated with forskolin (20 μm), α-MSH (1 μm), or cycloheximide (20 μg/ml), in DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum for indicated times. At harvest, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, extracted with SDS extraction buffer (250 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol), and immediately boiled. Protein extracts were resolved using either 8.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Prestained size standards were used (Life Technologies, Inc.). Antibodies used for Western blot analysis include mouse anti-Mi (10Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma, T9026), rabbit anti-phospho-CRE-binding protein (CREB; New England Biolabs, 9191), rabbit anti-CREB (New England Biolabs, 9192), rabbit anti-protein kinase A (PKA(α,β,γ); Santa Cruz, 903, 904, 905), rabbit anti-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1; Santa Cruz, 443), and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit and mouse (Cappel, 55550, 55676). Mi, tubulin, phospho-CREB, CREB, and PP1 signals were quantitated by densitometry (Multianalysis, Bio-Rad) of enhanced chemiluminescence-exposed films. To determine the linear range of quantitation by this method, standard curves were generated using recombinant Mi protein. Quantitation was found to be linear over the range of 2–38 pg (i.e. 19-fold). Data points in this range matched the linear best fit with r = 0.992. Experimental data points all lay within this linear range, with the exception of two late time points of Mi decay in the presence of cycloheximide (see Fig. 2 A) indicated asasterisks (see Fig. 2, D and E). 1.5 μg of poly(A+) selected RNA (Qiagen) from B16 cells was separated on a 1% formaldehyde gel, blotted onto a Hybond A-Plus membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Mouse Mi cDNA fragment (corresponding to amino acids 122–590), rabbit protein phosphatase 1α (amino acids 121–820) (26Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or full length human glyceraldehyde 3′-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragments were 32P random-primed labeled and hybridized to immobilized RNA and washed at high stringency (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C), followed by autoradiography. RNA standards were used (Life Technologies, Inc.). Based on the recently sequenced Mi promoter (24Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), primers (hMiP1, 5′-GGGGggtaccCTGCAGTCGGAAGTGGCAGTTATTCG-3′; and hMiP2, 5′-GAAAGTAGAGGGAGGGATAGTCTtctcgagCATGGGG-3′) were used to PCR amplify 484 bp of the Mi promoter corresponding to −387 to +97 from human genomic DNA. Primers were designed to add KpnI and XhoI to the ends of the PCR fragment to allow cloning into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2.basic (Promega). The CRE was destroyed by PCR mutagenesis using the following primers: hMiP3 (5′-gaaaaaaagcaTcAgcTgAagccaggggg-3′) and hMiP4 (5′-ccccctggctTcAgcTgAtgctttttttc-3′). All constructs were verified by sequencing. The somatostatin reporter construct was kindly provided by Marc Montminy and corresponds to −358 to +91 of the somatostatin promoter cloned into the pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid. Transfections into B16 and BHK cells were performed in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE and the “plus” reagent in the case of B16 according to manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). For each well, 0.7 mg of total DNA in 30 μl of serum-free DMEM was mixed with an equal volume of 5% LipofectAMINE in DMEM. Two days later, cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed using Dual Luciferase reagents (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting a constitutive Renilla (sea pansy) luciferase plasmid (Promega). Stimulation of the Mc1r receptor by α-MSH initiates a signal transduction cascade that increases cAMP levels through adenyl cyclase. The recent cloning of the microphthalmia promoter revealed a CRE just upstream of the TATA box (24Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mi expression could be regulated by a signal transduction pathway using cAMP as second messenger. To test whether α-MSH does alter Mi expression, human or murine melanoma cells were treated with α-MSH, and Mi levels were assayed by Western blot. Mi migrates as a doublet in pigment cells, and the two bands differ by the presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation at serine 73, as demonstrated by two-dimensional phosphotryptic mapping (10Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Within 1 h after α-MSH stimulation there is an increase in the intensity of the lower migrating band but not the upper band. By 2 h and beyond, both upper and lower bands are substantially enhanced and equal in intensity, relative to control tubulin levels (Fig. 1 A, quantitated in Fig. 2, D and E). Mi protein thus appears to be up-regulated by α-MSH treatment, and the reproducible appearance of the lower band induction before that of the upper band is consistent with previous evidence that the upper migrating form represents a phosphorylation of the lower isoform (10Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Another test that up-regulation of Mi was related to cAMP signaling came from stimulation of melanoma cells by the cAMP-inducing compound forskolin (Fig. 1 B). Forskolin triggered a nearly identical pattern of Mi up-regulation as seen with α-MSH, including previous appearance of the lower migrating form within the doublet after only 1 h, followed by induction of both doublet bands. Maximal accumulation of Mi protein in both human and mouse melanoma cells occurred 3–4 h after drug treatment. Although B16 cells turn (and remain) deeply pigmented by this treatment (data not shown), Mi levels rise only transiently and after ∼4 h begin to decrease, ultimately to undetectable levels far below basal by 72 h (Fig. 1 C). Forskolin treatment also led to induction of Mi protein in primary neonatal melanocytes (Fig. 1 D); however it did not elicit Mi expression in nonmelanocytic cell types such as fibroblasts or kidney cells (data not shown). Forskolin also did not enhance Mi expression in the nonmelanocytic cell types that normally express Mi, such as macrophages and mast cells. These lineages use a distinct promoter to express an alternative isoform of Mi. As shown in Fig. 1 E, monocytes and mast cells express a larger isoform of Mi (27Weilbaecher K.N. Hershey C.L. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Hemesath T.J. Tashjian A.H. Fisher D.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the levels of which, unlike in melanocytes, do not significantly change with forskolin. It is formally possible that the increase in Mi protein could result from changes in transcription, mRNA stability and processing, translational efficiency, or protein stability. The translational inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) completely blocked the α-MSH induction of Mi protein (Fig. 2 A), which in non-CHX-treated cells produced an ∼10-fold induction after 4 h (Fig. 2 D). Moreover, CHX treatment suggested that Mi has a very short half-life relative to α-tubulin. Northern blot analysis indicated that α-MSH treatment leads to a rapid rise in Mi mRNA, peaking at 2 h (Fig. 2 B). This mRNA induction is unaffected by CHX and suggests that up-regulation of Mi is pretranslational. After 2 h, Mi mRNA levels return to baseline, likely reflecting homeostatic down-regulation and consistent with the subsequent decrease in Mi protein beginning at 4 h (see Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, this fall in Mi mRNA levels is severely retarded by CHX, suggesting that new protein synthesis is required for the homeostatic down-regulation of Mi mRNA levels. Because of the presence of a cAMP-responsive element consensus sequence in the melanocytic Mi promoter (24Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Suzuki H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), it appeared likely that the up-regulation as well as the homeostatic down-regulation could involve a CREB transcription factor family member. cAMP-dependent transcriptional induction of the somatostatin promoter and its homeostatic down-regulation have been previously described in nonmelanocytes (28Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). In this case, high levels of cAMP activate PKA, leading to nuclear translocation in which PKA phosphorylates the CREB at serine 133 (29Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The consequence of phosphorylation of CREB is recruitment of the transcriptional cofactor CREB-binding protein and transcriptional up-regulation of the CRE-containing promoter (30Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 31Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Within hours, CREB phosphorylation is down-regulated by the action of PP1 (32Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) as well as the removal of PKA from the nucleus via binding to protein kinase A inhibitor, a cytoplasmic shuttling factor (33Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine activation of CREB in α-MSH-treated melanoma cells, extracts were Western blotted with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphoserine 133 CREB as well as phospho-ATF-1. As shown in Fig. 2 C, both phospho-CREB and phospho-ATF-1 levels rise within 1 h after treatment with α-MSH in both the absence and presence of CHX. The up-regulation of the Mi promoter follows the same approximate kinetics as the somatostatin promoter (32Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Phospho-CREB peaks at 1 h, followed by the Mi mRNA peak at 2 h, followed by the Mi protein peak at 3 h (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2, A–D and F). In α-MSH-treated melanoma cells phospho-CREB and -ATF-1 levels first rise, peak at 1 h, and then fall rapidly. Concurrent CHX treatment does not affect the activation and phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 but interferes with subsequent down-regulation, leading to a more gradual decrease in phospho-CREB and -ATF-1 (Fig. 2, C and F). When phospho-CREB levels are quantitated and normalized to overall (non-phospho-specific) CREB levels, CHX is seen to stabilize the phospho-specific form (Fig. 2 F). Careful inspection of overall CREB analysis (Fig. 2 C) also reveals a mobility shift associated with phosphorylation, and the shifted isoform fails to revert in the presence of CHX. These data suggest an important role for new protein synthesis in regulating phosphorylation of phospho-CREB. Because one means of modulating phospho-CREB is through phosphatase action of PP1 (32Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), PP1α expression was assessed at both the mRNA and protein levels. In α-MSH-treated cells, a slight increase of PP1α protein was observed in the absence of CHX. In the presence of CHX, PP1α protein levels declined (Fig. 3 A). This was accompanied by a corresponding decline in PP1α mRNA (Fig. 3 B). Because the decline in PP1α levels in CHX parallels the maintenance of phospho-CREB and sustained Mi mRNA expression, these results are consistent with the possibility that PP1α may contribute to the homeostatic down-regulation of Mi induction by α-MSH. Importantly, other levels of regulation may also function, such as increased kinase activity. PKA isoform levels do not substantially change under these conditions (data not shown). Because these data suggest CREB and ATF-1 as transcriptional mediators of α-MSH signaling in melanoma cells, a series of reporter assays was undertaken to analyze the requirement of a functional CREB binding site in the melanocytic Mi promoter for cAMP induction. Transfection of a firefly luciferase reporter driven by 484 bp (−387 to +97) of the human Mi promoter into B16 melanoma cells produced a 20-fold induction of luciferase activity relative to the promoterless (control) pGL2.basic (Fig. 4 A). After transfection into B16 melanoma cells, forskolin treatment further augmented Mi promoter activity by an additional 2–3-fold (Fig. 4 B), similar in magnitude to that seen with other cAMP-responsive elements (see below). Importantly, the Mi promoter was inactive and uninducible in nonmelanocyte (BHK) cells (Fig. 4,A and B), recapitulating the tissue restricted expression of Mi. The CRE (TGACGTCA) found within the Mi promoter appears to be important for promoter activity in melanoma cells, because mutation of the canonical CRE sequence rendered the promoter construct largely (although not entirely) inactive (Fig. 4 A) as well as forskolin nonresponsive (Fig. 4 B). Thus the CRE in the Mi promoter displayed tissue-restricted (melanocytic) cAMP responsiveness. In contrast, a 449-bp fragment from the somatostatin promoter (generously provided by M. Montminy) containing the identical CRE core (TGACGTCA) produced a 2–3-fold induction in either B16 or BHK cells after forskolin treatment and cAMP up-regulation (Fig. 4 B). These data imply the existence of cell type-restricted CRE responsiveness and suggest that the context in which the CRE exists, rather than the CRE sequence itself, may confer tissue specificity. Although the mechanism underlying this restriction is currently unknown, this observation is potentially of importance in explaining how the ubiquitous cAMP signaling pathway regulates an exquisitely tissue-specific factor such as Mi. A similar example of context-dependent cAMP responsiveness was recently reported in deletional studies of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor promoter, in which an intact CRE was needed for phospho-CREB activity, but sequences upstream of the CRE were also essential (34Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D. Shaywitz A. Greenberg M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 35Shieh P. Hu S. Bobb K. Timmusk T. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that other transcription factors bind to this upstream site and may cooperatively interact with CREB. For the Mi promoter, a melanocyte-specific transcription factor might bind sites flanking the CRE and either contribute to basal activity or even interact with CREB cooperatively. Future studies should reveal how this tissue-restricted CRE response is regulated. It has been reported that induction of the tyrosinase promoter after forskolin requires an intact E box element (15Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This sequence is bound by Mi in vitro (8Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and transactivated by Mi in vivo (8Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8058-8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether α-MSH stimulates the tyrosinase promoter activity via up-regulation of Mi levels, or more specifically whether Mi function is necessary for α-MSH-mediated tyrosinase stimulation. Luciferase reporter constructs under the control of either the human tyrosinase promoter or the Mi promoter (control) were cotransfected into B16 cells. Treatment with α-MSH induced both the tyrosinase promoter as well as the Mi promoter above the basal levels found in B16 cells (Fig. 4 C). Endogenous Mi protein was functionally interfered with by expression of dominant negative Mi. Mi-dn(R215del) is a naturally occurring (and previously characterized) mutation that contains a codon deletion within the basic domain of Mi. This allele, Mi mi, is dominantly inherited in mice and is biochemically dominant negative through preserved dimerization activity coupled to ablated DNA recognition (8Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Dominant negative Mi produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both basal and α-MSH-stimulated tyrosinase promoter activity (Fig. 4 C). As control, dominant negative Mi had no effect on the ability of α-MSH to activate the Mi promoter construct (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that Mi is necessary for the α-MSH-triggered signaling cascade that induces tyrosinase expression. Taken together these observations describe a mechanistic connection between α-MSH and the transcriptional induction of pigmentation. After binding to the Mc1r receptor, α-MSH initiates a signaling cascade beginning with G protein activation of adenyl cyclase that produces an increase in intracellular cAMP. A cAMP-regulated kinase then likely activates a member of the CREB family, which, in a context- and cell type-dependent fashion, activates the CRE within the Mi promoter, presumably via cAMP-binding protein- and p300-regulated coactivation. Accumulated Mi protein then secondarily regulates the tyrosinase promoter (and likely other melanocytic promoters), inducing expression of tyrosinase and driving pigmentation. These studies also highlight a number of unresolved questions relating to the same pathway. Although Mc1r is known to up-regulate cAMP levels (20Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Cone R.D. Science. 1992; 257: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), it is unclear precisely which kinase activates the transcription factor responsible for CRE-mediated activation in melanocytes. PKA as well as p90RSK are candidate CREB kinases, although their precise roles in cytokine-mediated melanocyte signaling remain to be fully elucidated (36Bohm M. Moellmann G. Cheng E. Alvarez-Franco M. Wagner S. Sassone-Corsi P. Halaban R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the previous questions regarding pigment enzyme up-regulation at the protein versus mRNA level might possibly relate to this indirect pathway involving Mi and varied RNA or protein stabilities coupled to the apparent homeostatic down-regulation of Mi described above. Humans heterozygous for a mutation in Mi are afflicted with Waardenburg syndrome type II (1Hughes A.E. Newton V.E. Liu X.Z. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Tassabehji M. Newton V.E. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 3Tachibana M. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These patients suffer significant sensorineural hearing loss and have white forelocks attributable to melanocyte dysfunction and loss. One other factor associated with Waardenburg syndrome, Pax-3, has recently been implicated as another transcriptional regulator of Mi expression (37Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because Mi mutations in Waardenburg patients are typically null (38Read A.P. Newton V.E. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), the dominant inheritance likely derives from haploinsufficiency. Therefore, it will be of importance to better understand the state of residual inner ear melanocytes in such patients for the possibility that α-MSH might provide a tissue-specific means of rescuing Mi expression in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2130044736,"The murine Ly49 family contains nine genes in two subgroups: the inhibitory receptors (Ly49A, B, C, E, F, G2, and I) and the noninhibitory receptors (Ly49D and H). Unlike their inhibitory counterparts, Ly49D and H do not contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs but associate with a recently described co-receptor, DAP12, to transmit positive signals to natural killer (NK) cells. DAP12 is also expressed in myeloid cells, but the receptors coupled to it there are unknown. Here we document the signaling pathways of the Ly49D/DAP12 complex in NK cells. We show that ligation of Ly49D results in 1) tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, including phospholipase Cγ1, Cbl, and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and 2) calcium mobilization. Moreover, we demonstrate that although human DAP12 reportedly binds the SH2 domains of both Syk and Zap-70, ligation of Ly49D leads to activation of Syk but not Zap-70. Consistent with this observation, Ly49D/DAP12-mediated calcium mobilization is blocked by dominant negative Syk but not by catalytically inactive Zap-70. These data demonstrate the dependence of DAP12-coupled receptors on Syk and suggest that the outcome of Ly49D/DAP12 engagement will be regulated by Cbl and culminate in the activation of transcription factors."

There are two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX),1 designated COX-1 and COX-2, that catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid.

For example, the expression of COX-2 is increased in inflamed tissues such as rheumatoid synovium (12Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Ristimaki A.P. Sano H. Remmers E.F. Epps H.R. Hla T. J. Clin.

Perhaps the most striking evidence implicating COX-2 in carcinogenesis is the finding that a null mutation for Cox-2 markedly reduced the number and size of intestinal tumors in a murine model of familial adenomatous polyposis, i.e. APCΔ716knockout mice (19Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Cox-2 deficiency also led to an ∼75% decrease in chemically induced skin papillomas (20Tiano H. Chulada P. Spalding J. Lee C. Loftin C. Mahler J. Morham S. Langenbach R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 1727Google Scholar). The recent finding that a selective inhibitor of COX-2 caused nearly complete suppression of azoxymethane-induced colon cancer is further evidence for the importance of COX-2 as a target for anticancer therapy (21Kawamori T. Rao C.V. Seibert K. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 409-412PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that suppressing levels of COX-2 will be an effective strategy for inhibiting inflammation and carcinogenesis. To develop an effective approach for suppressing levels of COX-2, it is important to define the signaling mechanisms that govern the expression of COX-2.Ceramide, a novel lipid second messenger, is formed when the membrane phospholipid sphingomyelin undergoes hydrolysis. Activation of sphingomyelinase (SMase) by extracellular agents such as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D3), tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, γ-interferon, and ultraviolet light causes sphingomyelin hydrolysis and leads to the formation of ceramide and phosphocholine (22Okazaki T.

However, the mechanism by which ceramide signaling leads to increased expression of COX-2 is unknown.In this study, we show that triggering the ceramide pathway with neutral SMase or cell-permeable ceramides stimulates expression of theCOX-2 gene in human mammary epithelial cells. This effect was mediated via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Targeted disruption of the ceramide signaling pathway could represent a novel approach to decreasing levels of COX-2 and synthesis of PGs.DISCUSSIONThese results show that triggering the ceramide signaling pathway with neutral SMase or cell-permeable ceramides induces the expression of COX-2 and synthesis of PGs in human mammary epithelial cells. The induction of COX-2 by ceramide signaling was blocked by calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. This result is consistent with a previous report that ceramide signaling can be mediated by protein kinase C (36Sbrissa D. Yamada H. Hajra A. Bitar K.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1615-G1625PubMed Google Scholar). Although we do not know which isoforms of protein kinase C are activated by ceramide in human mammary epithelial cells, protein kinase C-ξ is activated in vitro by ceramide and in vivo by treatment with SMase (37Lozano J.

Ceramide is known to activate Raf-1 (25Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Hakkinen L. Holmstrom T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a downstream target of protein kinase C. The induction of COX-2 promoter activity by SMase was inhibited by kinase-deficient Raf-1, which is consistent with prior evidence thatCOX-2 is a Raf-1-dependent gene (38Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Ceramide was reported previously to induce p38, JNK, and ERK/MAPK activities (25Reunanen N.

The expression of COX-2 can be affected by changes in MAPK activity (38Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 39Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that ceramide induced COX-2 via activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs. Thus, treatment with SMase induced the activities of ERK, JNK, and p38, whereas inhibitors of MEK and p38 blocked SMase-mediated induction of COX-2. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negatives for ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 suppressed the induction of COX-2 promoter activity by SMase. The current results also suggest that c-Jun is important for mediating the induction of COX-2 by ceramide. We observed increased phosphorylation of c-Jun in cells treated with SMase. Enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun, a consequence of JNK activation, potentiates its ability to activate transcription as either a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Fos (41Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). More important, the link between ceramide, c-Jun, and COX-2 was firmly established by the finding that ceramide-mediated induction of COX-2 promoter activity was suppressed by dominant-negative c-Jun.To further elucidate the mechanism by which ceramide signaling induced the transcription of COX-2, we identified the promoter element that mediated the effects of c-Jun. Ceramide activated theCOX-2 promoter via the CRE. These results are consistent with the findings of Xie and Herschman (38Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 39Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Interestingly, ceramide activates both COX-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 via three distinct MAPK pathways. This suggests that targeted inhibition of the ceramide pathway will coordinately inhibit the induction of COX-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression. Such therapy could be used potentially to treat diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer. There are two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX),1 designated COX-1 and COX-2, that catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and appears to be responsible for the production of PGs that mediate normal physiological functions such as maintenance of the integrity of the gastric mucosa and regulation of renal blood flow (1Smith W.L.

A large body of evidence has accumulated to suggest that COX-2 is an important therapeutic target for preventing or treating arthritis, cancer, and possibly Alzheimer's disease (9Anderson G.D.

For example, the expression of COX-2 is increased in inflamed tissues such as rheumatoid synovium (12Crofford L.J. Wilder R.L. Ristimaki A.P. Sano H. Remmers E.F. Epps H.R. Hla T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and selective inhibitors of COX-2 are useful for the treatment of arthritis (10Lipsky P.E. Isakson P.C. J.

Carcinog. 1995; 12: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most striking evidence implicating COX-2 in carcinogenesis is the finding that a null mutation for Cox-2 markedly reduced the number and size of intestinal tumors in a murine model of familial adenomatous polyposis, i.e. APCΔ716knockout mice (19Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Cox-2 deficiency also led to an ∼75% decrease in chemically induced skin papillomas (20Tiano H. Chulada P. Spalding J. Lee C. Loftin C. Mahler J. Morham S. Langenbach R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 1727Google Scholar). The recent finding that a selective inhibitor of COX-2 caused nearly complete suppression of azoxymethane-induced colon cancer is further evidence for the importance of COX-2 as a target for anticancer therapy (21Kawamori T. Rao C.V. Seibert K. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 409-412PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that suppressing levels of COX-2 will be an effective strategy for inhibiting inflammation and carcinogenesis. To develop an effective approach for suppressing levels of COX-2, it is important to define the signaling mechanisms that govern the expression of COX-2. Ceramide, a novel lipid second messenger, is formed when the membrane phospholipid sphingomyelin undergoes hydrolysis. Activation of sphingomyelinase (SMase) by extracellular agents such as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D3), tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, γ-interferon, and ultraviolet light causes sphingomyelin hydrolysis and leads to the formation of ceramide and phosphocholine (22Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin.

Commun. 1996; 220: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, ceramide up-regulates COX-2 (26Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kirtikara K. Laulederkind S.J.F. Raghow R. Kanekura T. Ballou L.R. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1996; 220: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which ceramide signaling leads to increased expression of COX-2 is unknown. In this study, we show that triggering the ceramide pathway with neutral SMase or cell-permeable ceramides stimulates expression of theCOX-2 gene in human mammary epithelial cells. This effect was mediated via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Targeted disruption of the ceramide signaling pathway could represent a novel approach to decreasing levels of COX-2 and synthesis of PGs. DISCUSSIONThese results show that triggering the ceramide signaling pathway with neutral SMase or cell-permeable ceramides induces the expression of COX-2 and synthesis of PGs in human mammary epithelial cells. The induction of COX-2 by ceramide signaling was blocked by calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. This result is consistent with a previous report that ceramide signaling can be mediated by protein kinase C (36Sbrissa D. Yamada H. Hajra A. Bitar K.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1615-G1625PubMed Google Scholar). Although we do not know which isoforms of protein kinase C are activated by ceramide in human mammary epithelial cells, protein kinase C-ξ is activated in vitro by ceramide and in vivo by treatment with SMase (37Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide is known to activate Raf-1 (25Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Hakkinen L. Holmstrom T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a downstream target of protein kinase C. The induction of COX-2 promoter activity by SMase was inhibited by kinase-deficient Raf-1, which is consistent with prior evidence thatCOX-2 is a Raf-1-dependent gene (38Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Ceramide was reported previously to induce p38, JNK, and ERK/MAPK activities (25Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Hakkinen L. Holmstrom T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The expression of COX-2 can be affected by changes in MAPK activity (38Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 39Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that ceramide induced COX-2 via activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs. Thus, treatment with SMase induced the activities of ERK, JNK, and p38, whereas inhibitors of MEK and p38 blocked SMase-mediated induction of COX-2. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negatives for ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 suppressed the induction of COX-2 promoter activity by SMase. The current results also suggest that c-Jun is important for mediating the induction of COX-2 by ceramide. We observed increased phosphorylation of c-Jun in cells treated with SMase. Enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun, a consequence of JNK activation, potentiates its ability to activate transcription as either a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Fos (41Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). More important, the link between ceramide, c-Jun, and COX-2 was firmly established by the finding that ceramide-mediated induction of COX-2 promoter activity was suppressed by dominant-negative c-Jun.To further elucidate the mechanism by which ceramide signaling induced the transcription of COX-2, we identified the promoter element that mediated the effects of c-Jun. Ceramide activated theCOX-2 promoter via the CRE. These results are consistent with the findings of Xie and Herschman (38Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 39Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Several lines of evidence suggest that ceramide induced COX-2 via activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs. Thus, treatment with SMase induced the activities of ERK, JNK, and p38, whereas inhibitors of MEK and p38 blocked SMase-mediated induction of COX-2. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negatives for ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 suppressed the induction of COX-2 promoter activity by SMase. The current results also suggest that c-Jun is important for mediating the induction of COX-2 by ceramide. We observed increased phosphorylation of c-Jun in cells treated with SMase. Enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun, a consequence of JNK activation, potentiates its ability to activate transcription as either a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Fos (41Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). More important, the link between ceramide, c-Jun, and COX-2 was firmly established by the finding that ceramide-mediated induction of COX-2 promoter activity was suppressed by dominant-negative c-Jun. To further elucidate the mechanism by which ceramide signaling induced the transcription of COX-2, we identified the promoter element that mediated the effects of c-Jun. Ceramide activated theCOX-2 promoter via the CRE. These results are consistent with the findings of Xie and Herschman (38Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 39Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, phorbol esters, γ-interferon, and UV light stimulate the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and induce COX-2 (22Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J.

Hence, it seems likely that these agonists induce COX-2 at least, in part, via ceramide signaling. Other agents, e.g. nerve growth factor (44Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (22Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Ceramide and COX-2 also have important effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis (45Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

For example, treatment with ceramide causes a significant arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (45Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J.

Tsujii M. Sheng H. Beauchamp R.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 733-737PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the induction of COX-2 by ceramide contributes to the block in cell cycle progression. Ceramide and COX-2 appear to have opposite effects on apoptosis. Ceramide induces apoptosis, whereas overexpressing COX-2 inhibits apoptosis (46Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.-H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 48Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic effects of ceramide may be counteracted, in part, by its ability to up-regulate COX-2. This raises the possibility that compounds that inhibit COX-2 such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, retinoids, or resveratrol will potentiate ceramide-mediated apoptosis (49Mestre J.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that ceramide signaling regulates the expression of genes implicated in inflammation and cancer. Interestingly, ceramide activates both COX-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 via three distinct MAPK pathways. This suggests that targeted inhibition of the ceramide pathway will coordinately inhibit the induction of COX-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression. Such therapy could be used potentially to treat diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer. We thank Dr. Richard Kolesnick for helpful suggestions."

These functions involve the interaction of two conserved domains, C2A and C2B, with effector proteins. The C2B domain mediates Ca2+-triggered synaptotagmin oligomerization, binds AP-2 and is important for the interaction of synaptotagmin with Ca2+ channels. Here, we report that these are conserved biochemical properties: Ca2+ promoted the hetero-oligomerization of synaptotagmin I with synaptotagmins III and IV, and all three synaptotagmin isoforms bound the synprint region of the α1B subunit of N-type Ca2+ channels. Using chimeric and truncated C2 domains, we defined a common region of C2B that mediates oligomerization and AP-2 binding. Within this region, two adjacent lysine residues were identified that were critical for synaptotagmin oligomerization, AP-2, and synprint binding. Competition experiments demonstrated that the synprint fragment was an effective inhibitor of synaptotagmin oligomerization and also blocked binding of synaptotagmin to AP-2. In a model for the structure of C2B, the common effector binding site localized to a putative Ca2+-binding loop and a concave region formed by two β-strands.

Neuronal exocytosis occurs via the fusion of docked synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane (1Südhof T.C.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fusion is triggered by increases in intracellular Ca2+ (4Katz B. The Release of Neurotransmitter Substances.

Neurosci. 1987; 10: 633-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that act via Ca2+-sensing proteins to abruptly open a fusion pore through which neurotransmitters escape into the synaptic cleft (6Lindau M. Almers W. Curr. Biol. 1995; 7: 509-517Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Subsequent dilation of the fusion pore can result in the complete fusion of the synaptic vesicle membrane with the pre-synaptic plasma membrane. After complete fusion, vesicles are endocytosed and recycled for future rounds of release (7Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that endocytosis may also be regulated by Ca2+ ions (8Henkel A.W. Almers W. Curr.

These findings are consistent with the proposed function of synaptotagmin as a Ca2+ sensor for regulated exocytosis (13Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In addition, biochemical studies demonstrated that synaptotagmin is a high affinity receptor for the clathrin adaptor protein complex, AP-2 (15Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegansindicate that loss of synaptotagmin also results in defective synaptic vesicle recycling (16Jorgensen E.M. Hartwieg E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, synaptotagmin is thought to function in both the exo- and endocytotic limbs of the synaptic vesicle cycle.Synaptotagmin is represented by a large gene family that currently contains 12 members (17Südhof T.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14314-14319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Each member spans the vesicle membrane once and has a short C-terminal intravesicular domain and a large cytoplasmic region that contains two C2 domains, designated C2A and C2B (14Perin M. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). C2A is the membrane proximal domain and mediates the Ca2+-dependent interaction of synaptotagmin with anionic phospholipids (20Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane distal C2B domain mediates Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of synaptotagmin, potentially clustering the release machinery into a collar or ring-like structure (22Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Damer C.K. Creutz C.E. J.

These include the above described interaction with AP-2, as well as β-SNAP (25Schiavo G. Gmachl M.J. Stenbeck G. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1996; 328: 733-736Google Scholar), inositol polyphosphates (26Schiavo G. Gu Q.M. Presrwich G.D. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The direct interaction of synaptotagmin with Ca2+channels may contribute to the speed of exocytosis, which occurs with a lag time of 60–200 μs (29Llinas R. Steinberg I.Z. Walton K. Biophys.

These latter interactions are promoted by Ca2+concentrations1 (31Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Syntaxin and SNAP-25 form a complex with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin that is capable of catalyzing membrane fusion in vitro (35Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westerman B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar) and in vivo (36Littleton J.T. Chapman E.R. Kreber R. Garment M.B. Carlson M.B. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 1998; 21: 401-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which synaptotagmin may regulate the fusion complex is not yet known.To elucidate the mechanism by which synaptotagmin functions in exo- and endocytosis, it is essential to determine how synaptotagmin engages effector molecules. These studies will make it possible to address the function of specific interactions using site-directed inhibitory peptides or by genetic analysis based on loss-of-function mutations. Details concerning the molecular mechanisms by which C2A interacts with effector molecules have recently begun to emerge (37Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 38Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25659-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, very little is known concerning the molecular basis for the wide range of C2B target-protein interactions. Here, we have begun to address the structural basis for how the C2B domain of synaptotagmin recognizes and binds different effector proteins. We demonstrate that distinct isoforms of synaptotagmin form hetero-oligomers and bind the synprint region of N-type Ca2+ channels. Using chimeric and truncated C2 domains, we identified a common region of C2B that mediates oligomerization and AP-2 binding. Furthermore, we report point mutations that have graded effects on the ability of the C2B domain to engage effector proteins. Finally, we demonstrate that synprint can competitively inhibit the oligomerization of synaptotagmin and the binding of AP-2. These findings provide the means to selectively disrupt synaptotagmin-effector interactions for functional studies.RESULTSThe C2B domain of synaptotagmin I mediates Ca2+-triggered homo-oligomerization (22Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the first series of experiments, we determined whether oligomerization is a conserved property among distinct isoforms of synaptotagmin. To address this question, the cytoplasmic domains of synaptotagmins I, III, and IV were immobilized as GST fusion proteins and incubated with rat brain detergent extracts in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA. The binding of native synaptotagmin I to the immobilized fusion proteins was monitored by immunoblotting with an anti-synaptotagmin I-specific luminal domain monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, native synaptotagmin I efficiently bound to recombinant synaptotagmin I, III, and IV in a Ca2+-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that Ca2+ not only triggers the self-association of synaptotagmin I but also promotes hetero-oligomerization of distinct synaptotagmin isoforms. These interactions are specific; immunoblotting with an anti-synaptophysin antibody demonstrated that other abundant synaptic vesicle antigens did not associate with the immobilized synaptotagmins. Consistent with previous results, oligomerization was mediated solely by the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I (22Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As an additional control, we compared the anionic lipid binding properties of the immobilized synaptotagmin isoforms (Fig. 1). In agreement with previous reports (39Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), synaptotagmin I and III but not IV bound liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Thus, whereas synaptotagmin IV cannot bind liposomes in a Ca2+-dependent manner via its C2A domain, this isoform is able to engage in Ca2+-dependent hetero-oligomerization.We next tested the ability of recombinant synprint, which comprises the II-III loop of the α1B subunit of N-type Ca2+ channels (40Sheng Z. Rettig J. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), to bind synaptotagmins I, III, and IV. Purified synprint was incubated with immobilized synaptotagmins I, III, and IV, and binding was detected by immunoblot analysis. Consistent with previous reports, synprint bound to the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin I in a Ca2+-independent manner (27Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Synprint also efficiently bound to synaptotagmin III and IV in a Ca2+-independent manner, demonstrating that the interaction with Ca2+ channels is a conserved property among distinct synaptotagmin isoforms. We next examined the interaction of synprint with the isolated C2 domains of synaptotagmin I. As reported previously, in the absence of Ca2+, synprint bound to C2B but not to C2A (27Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, addition of 1 mm free Ca2+ resulted in dramatic binding of synprint to C2A and modestly promoted synprint binding to C2B (Fig. 1). This effect was observed in four independent experiments. These findings demonstrate that the interaction of synaptotagmin with the synprint region from the α1B subunit of N-type Ca2+ channels, unlike oligomerization (22Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or binding to AP-2 (15Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), is not perfectly preserved within an isolated C2 domain. For this reason, α1B-synprint binding will not be included in the domain mapping studies described below. The C2B domain of synaptotagmin has also been reported to mediate synaptotagmin binding to SV2 (41Schivell A.E. Batchelor R.H. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27770-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and β-SNAP (25Schiavo G. Gmachl M.J. Stenbeck G. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1996; 328: 733-736Google Scholar). We found that the C2B-SV2 interaction is disrupted by physiological concentrations of Mg2+ (1 mm), 3E. R. Chapman and M. Wolowick, unpublished observations. and although we observe an interaction between GST-synaptotagmin and His6-β-SNAP, we cannot detect binding between the native proteins under our experimental conditions. 4E. R. Chapman and R. C. Desai, unpublished observations. Therefore, the analysis of the C2B-effector recognition site, described below, is focused on the self-association of synaptotagmin I and the binding of synaptotagmin to AP-2.The major goal of this study was to delineate the region(s) of the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I (hereafter referred to as synaptotagmin) that interacts with effector proteins. To address this issue, we first opted to map effector binding sites using chimeric C2 domains composed of C2A and C2B. The rationale for this approach was based on two observations. First, C2A does not mediate oligomerization and also fails to bind AP-2. Second, C2 domains are eight-stranded β-sandwich structures in which the strands are connected in a complex manner (Refs. 42Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R.

Thus, linear truncations would be expected to have drastic effects on the overall conformation of the domain. The most notable structural difference among C2 domains studied thus far lies in the two different connectivity patterns for a β-strand that results in two distinct topologies. The C2B domain of synaptotagmin is predicted to conform to the same type I topology as the C2A domain (45Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Thus, it should be possible to generate correctly folded chimeras.Figure 7Molecular models depicting the regions of the C2 domains of synaptotagmin that mediate effector interactions. A, structure of C2A. B, model of C2B. The crystal structure of C2A was rendered as described (37Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) according to a description file modified from Sutton et al. (42Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M.

The residues of C2A that interact with lipids (amino acids 198, 205, 206, 233, and 234 in loops 2 and 3) are shown in shading (37Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25659-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The structure of C2B is not known and was modeled with a Silicon Graphics Indigo computer and Look 2.0/SYBYL 6.3 software using the crystal structure of C2A, in conjunction with alignments of C2A and C2B, as a template. Residues 296–328, which confer C2B-specific effector interactions (corresponding to the C2A/B/A chimera in Fig. 1) are shaded. Lysines 326 and 327, critical for oligomerization, AP-2 binding, and synprint binding, are rendered in black.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the minimal region of C2B that confers oligomerization and AP-2 binding we “swapped” regions of C2B and C2A as shown in Fig. 2. To further ensure that the chimeras were properly folded, chimeric junctions were selected that corresponded to perfectly conserved regions within the β-strands. Chimeras were immobilized as GST fusion proteins and incubated with rat brain detergent extracts in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+. Binding of native synaptotagmin and AP-2 was assayed by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, Ca2+-dependent binding of synaptotagmin and Ca2+-independent binding of AP-2 were mediated by the C2B domain of synaptotagmin; C2A failed to bind in both the presence and absence of Ca2+. Binding of both synaptotagmin and AP-2 was preserved in a chimera (C2B/A) in which the N-terminal half of C2B was fused to the C-terminal half of C2A. Neither synaptotagmin nor AP-2 bound to the reciprocal chimeric C2 domain (C2A/B) that contained the N-terminal half of C2A and the C-terminal half of C2B. To further localize the region of C2B that confers effector binding, we subdivided the N-terminal half of C2B and generated chimeras in which either the first (C2B/A/A) or second quarter (C2A/B/A) of the chimeric sequence corresponded to C2B, with the balance of the C2 domain composed of C2A sequence. Synaptotagmin and AP-2 bound the chimera that contained the second quarter of C2B (C2A/B/A) but did not bind the chimera that contained the first quarter of C2B (C2B/A/A). We further divided C2A/B/A into C2A/B/A/A and C2A/A/B/A and observed trace levels synaptotagmin and AP-2 binding to the C2A/A/B/A chimera and no binding to the C2A/B/A/A chimera. In summary, the replacement of residues 165–195 of C2A with homologous residues 296–328 from C2B, resulted in a C2 domain (C2A/B/A) with C2B character, i.e. a chimera that interacted with the C2B-specific targets AP-2 and native synaptotagmin. Interestingly, the C2A/B/A chimera also exhibited Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding activity (Fig. 2). Thus, it is possible to engineer gain-of-function C2 domains. It should be noted that fluorescence (37Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and NMR (53Chae Y.K. Abildgaard F. Chapman E.R. Markley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25659-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) studies indicate that loop 2 and Ca2+-binding loop 3 of C2A contain the major determinants for mediating C2 domain-lipid interactions. These loops are preserved in the C2A/B/A chimera (see Fig. 7) and may account for the dual ability of this chimera to engage both C2A- and C2B-specific effectors.Figure 2Chimeric C2 domains reveal the region of the C2B domain of synaptotagmin that confers AP-2 binding and synaptotagmin self-association. Left panel, the C2A and C2B domains of synaptotagmin I, as well as a series of chimeric C2 domains were prepared, purified, and immobilized as GST fusion proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the diagrammatic representations, C2B is shaded, and C2A is depicted byopen rectangles. Dashed lines correspond to the chimeric junctions. Binding of native synaptotagmin I and AP-2 to the immobilized fusion proteins was assayed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. 4 μg of detergent extract (total) and 11% of the bound material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using an anti-synaptotagmin I luminal domain antibody. To assay for AP-2 binding, 3 μg of the extract (total) and 30% of the bound material was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-α-adaptin mouse monoclonal antibodies. Right panel, a chimeric C2 domain mediates both C2A- and C2B-specific effector interactions. GST, GST-C2A, GST-C2B, and the GST-C2A/B/A chimera, which bound to AP-2 and mediated Ca2+-dependent binding of native synaptotagmin I, were assayed for Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next sought to determine whether residues 296–328 of C2B were sufficient for binding native synaptotagmin. A fragment comprised of amino acids 293–328 was fused to GST and used as an affinity matrix. As shown in Fig. 3, this isolated region did not bind native synaptotagmin in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Failure to bind could arise from a number of causes including an inability to adopt an active conformation, the loss of flanking contact sites and/or steric hindrance due to GST. To better define the minimal requirements for C2B-effector interactions, we carried out a systematic truncation analysis of C2B and analyzed the truncation mutants for native synaptotagmin binding activity. C-terminal truncations, which removed essentially the C-terminal half of C2B, were tolerated; a fragment comprised of residues 248–328 was able to mediate Ca2+-dependent oligomerization. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using a truncation approach to map the C2B-effector binding domain. Analysis of additional truncation mutants demonstrated that further C-terminal truncation to amino acid 325 abolished binding. Thus, amino acids 326–328 are essential for oligomerization. Significant N-terminal truncations were also tolerated because binding was preserved in a fragment encoding 321–421. Further N-terminal truncation to residue 329 resulted in the complete loss of binding. In summary, C-terminal truncation from 328 to 325 or N-terminal truncation from 321 to 329 results in the loss of binding activity. Thus, residues 321–328 comprise an important region for mediating oligomerization. Within this region, amino acids 326–328 appear to be essential. These data are consistent with the chimera studies, described above, in which we delineated 296–328 as the region that confers C2B-specific effector protein interactions. It is notable that residues 326–328 (amino acids KKT) lie in the region of C2B which exhibits a breakdown in its alignment with C2A. This region is shown at the bottom of Fig. 3 and corresponds to the only segment in which the alignment requires a two-amino acid gap in the sequence of C2A. Thus, this region appears to have significantly diverged during evolution, further supporting our findings that this region accounts for the distinct effector interactions exhibited by C2B.Figure 3Truncation analysis of the synaptotagmin self-association domain. 10–20 μg of C2A, C2B, and truncated versions of C2B were immobilized on 60 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The sequences of the truncated C2B domains are represented schematically with the domain corresponding to residues 296–328, as described in the legend to Fig. 2, indicated with dashed lines. Binding of native synaptotagmin I was assayed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. 8 μg of the extract (total) and 18% of the bound material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using the anti-synaptotagmin I luminal domain antibody (604.4) and enhanced chemiluminescence. C-terminal truncation from residues 328 to 326 (ΔKKT) or N-terminal truncation from residues 321 to 329 (ΔKRLKKKKT) abolished synaptotagmin self-association. This region is shown in the bottom panel where the critical residues, 326–328, are underlined and in bold. Note that the alignment of C2A and C2B breaks down between β-strands 3 and 4, necessitating the introduction of a gap in the sequence of C2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The domain encoded by residues 293–328 also failed to bind AP-2 (Fig. 4). We therefore used the truncation mutants that corresponded to the borders of the oligomerization domain to determine whether AP-2 bound to a similar site on C2B, as suggested by the chimeric C2 domain analysis described above. Consistent with those results, AP-2 bound to 248–328 but failed to bind the 248–325 truncation mutant. Binding was also observed using 321–421 of C2B. Like oligomerization, AP-2 binding activity was lost by further t"

Two possible mechanisms of kinase action have been proposed: 1) direct phosphorylation of the channel and 2) indirect via PKG-dependent activation of a phosphatase. To scrutinize the first possibility, at the molecular level, we used the human pore-forming α-subunit of the Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel, Hslo, and the α-isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I. In cell-attached patches of oocytes co-expressing the Hslo channel and the kinase, 8-Br-cGMP significantly increased the macroscopic currents. This increase in current was due to an increase in the channel voltage sensitivity by ∼20 mV and was reversed by alkaline phosphatase treatment after patch excision. In inside-out patches, however, the effect of purified kinase was negative in 12 of 13 patches. In contrast, and consistent with the intact cell experiments, purified kinase applied to the cytoplasmic side of reconstituted channels increased their open probability. This stimulatory effect was absent when heat-denatured kinase was used. Biochemical experiments show that the purified kinase incorporates γ-33P into the immunopurified Hslo band of ∼125 kDa. Furthermore, in vivo phosphorylation largely attenuates this labeling in back-phosphorylation experiments. These results demonstrate that the α-subunit of large conductance Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels is substrate for G-Iα kinase in vivo and support direct phosphorylation as a mechanism for PKG-Iα-induced activation of maxi-K channels.

Part of the response to these agents is antagonized by inhibitors of maxi-K channels, suggesting a key role of these channels in mediating their biological effects (12Bialecki R.A. Stinson-Fisher C.

In agreement, maxi-K channels are activated by nitrocompounds (16Williams Jr., D.L. Katz G.M. Roy-Contancin L. Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9360-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), probably through a PKG-dependent phosphorylation mechanism (14Taniguchi J. Furukawa K.-I. Shigekawa M.

Two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain the activation of native maxi-K channels by PKG. One mechanism suggests that PKG activates maxi-K channels through a direct phosphorylation of the channel protein or a regulatory subunit (17Robertson B.E. Schubert R. Hescheler J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1993; 265: C299-C303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Archer S.L. Huang J.M.C. Hampl V. Nelson D.P. Shultz P.J. Weir E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L1057-L1063PubMed Google Scholar); this process can be reversed by phosphatase 2A (22Sansom S.C. Stockand J.D. Hall D. Williams B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9902-9906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, the second mechanism proposes that PKG activates maxi-K channels indirectly via a PKG-dependent activation of protein phosphatase 2A (23White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,24Zhou X.-B. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Korth M. J. Biol.

Alternatively, protein phosphatase 2A may exert its effect indirectly. Recent biochemical experiments performed with purified channels (25Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. McManus O.B. Giangiacomo K.M.

Huggins J.P. Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L1057-L1063PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the view that maxi-K channels can be direct targets of PKG-dependent phosphorylation, sequence analysis of the pore-forming α-subunit shows one strong consensus sequence for PKG phosphorylation. This possible PKG phosphorylation site is conserved in all mammalian maxi-K (slo) channels and is localized within its C-terminal region (27Toro L. Meera P. Wallner M. Tanaka Y. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117PubMed Google Scholar). However, purified PKG has failed to activate cloned maxi-K channels in excised inside-out membrane patches (28Vogalis F. Vincent T. Qureshi I. Schmalz F. Ward M.W. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G629-G639PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that the α-subunit of maxi-K channels (Hslo) when coexpressed with PKG-Iα is activated by a permeant analog of cGMP and that this activation is reversed by alkaline phosphatase treatment. Recombinant PKG-Iα activates Hslo channels after reconstitution into lipid bilayers. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivophosphorylation assays show that the α-subunit of maxi-K channels is a direct target of PKG-Iα. Recombinant PKG-Iα was prepared as described previously (29Feil R. Muller S. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PKG-Iα/PKG-Iβ polyclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); alkaline phosphatase was from Boehringer Mannheim; [γ-33P]ATP (4000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; l-[35S]methionine (>1300 Ci/mmol) was from ICN; lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids; 8-pCPT-cGMP and c-Myc peptide were from Calbiochem; and okadaic acid was from RBI. Other materials were from Sigma. GenBankTMaccession numbers were U11058 for Hslo and Y08961 for PKG-Iα. c-Myc-tagged Hslo (HF1) is as described by Meera et al.(30Meera P. Wallner M. Song M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes expressing PKG-Iα and/or Hslo channel were used. The pipette and bath solutions contained 110 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, pCa 5.3, pH 7.0, but the bath solution was without MgCl2. A Ca2+ electrode was used to measure pCa (World Precision Instruments). In some batches of oocytes, control cell-attached currents showed a substantial current increase (∼5–10-fold) with time (1–5 min); thus, cell-attached experiments were performed only in oocytes where currents were stable for ∼10 min. To avoid misinterpretations due to possible uncontrolled Ca2+ increases near the channels in the cell-attached mode that could appear as 8-Br-cGMP-induced up-regulation, both control and 8-Br-cGMP-treated patches were excised and current half-activation potentials (V 12) were determined at constant Ca2+. Drugs were applied in the same patch or in patches from the same oocyte to circumvent the large variation in V uaxas2 (at fixed Ca2+) of maxi-K currents in different oocytes (S.D. of ∼20 mV, n = 61) (31Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar). Patches from the same oocyte, injected with Hslo or Hslo plus PKG-Iα, have significantly less variation in V 12 (S.D. of ∼4 mV, n = 9). PKG-Iα stock solution (16 μm) contained 10 mm TES, pH 7.1, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm μg/μl leupeptin, and 50% (v/v) glycerol.

Normalized voltage activation curves of macroscopic currents were calculated as described previously (31Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar). After checking expression, 30–50 oocytes were solubilized in cold lysis buffer (35Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) supplemented with: 1 mm iodoacetamide, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin. The solubilized fractions were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with 1 μl of anti-c-Myc antibody and overnight with 20 μl of 50% prewashed Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in washing buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mmTris, pH 8, supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer plus 1% Triton X-100 and once with washing buffer alone. The immunoprecipitated samples were eluted with 25 μl of Laemmli buffer (3×) containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and separated on SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained, destained, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C. Immunoprecipitated HF1 channels were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized with 2m Tris. The channel fraction was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 nm okadaic acid, 10 μm cGMP, and 20 μm [γ-33P]ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was started by adding 80–120 nm PKG-Iα for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding Laemmli buffer (3×) containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol (36Gromada J. Dissing S. Kofod H. Frokjær-Jensen J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, stained, destained, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C. Equal number of oocytes coexpressing HF1 channels and PKG-Iα were divided in two groups and pretreated with 300 nm okadaic acid for 30 min. One group was stimulated with 0.1–0.5 mm 8 pCPT-cGMP to induce in vivophosphorylation, and both were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The channel proteins were immunoprecipitated in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (300 nm okadaic acid, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na-HPO3). The Hslo channels attached to the antibody·protein-A·bead complex were phosphorylated in vitro (back-phosphorylation) in the presence of 100 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP as indicated above. The reaction was terminated by washing three times with the washing buffer containing 1 mm cold MgATP. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted (see below). After washing for >8 h, the membrane was autoradiographed. Phosphorylation and protein content were quantitated by densitometric analysis (GS-670 Imaging Densitometer; Bio-Rad). PKG-Iα and HF1 were immunoblotted according to the manufacturer's instructions or as described previously (26Knaus H.-G. Eberhart A. Koch R.O.A. Munujos P. Schmalhofer W.A. Warmke J.W.

First antibodies (1:2000) were anti-PKG raised against CDEPPPDDNSGWDIDF or anti-Hslo raised against VNDTNVQFLDQDDD in the C terminus (26Knaus H.-G. Eberhart A. Koch R.O.A. Munujos P. Schmalhofer W.A. Warmke J.W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22434-22439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated (1:4000). The immunoreactive bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Data are expressed as mean values ± S.D. A two-tailed Student'st test for paired data was used. Results were considered significantly different with a p < 0.05. To address the possible functional coupling between Hslo channels and PKG-Iα, we first tested if Xenopus oocytes express any “endogenous PKG” using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the antibody raised against the mammalian PKG-Iα/PKG-Iβ only labels a band (∼70 kDa) in oocytes injected with mammalian PKG-Iα cRNA (lane 1), but not in oocytes expressing c-Myc-tagged Hslo (HF1,see Fig. 5) alone (lane 2). These results indicate that in Xenopus oocytes PKG content is below the detection limit and/or its primary sequence differs from that in mammalian isoforms. Therefore, to study PKG modulation of human maxi-K channels at the molecular level, we coexpressed both Hslo and PKG-Iα cRNAs. Currents from oocytes expressing Hslo with or without PKG-Iα had similar voltage activation curves when measured in inside-out patches with 5 μm[Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, B and C) or in the cell-attached mode (∼100 nm[Ca2+]i) (Fig. 1 C). The lack of a significant effect on the half-activation potential (or apparent Ca2+ sensitivity) by the sole expression of PKG-Iα suggests that a constitutive activity of PKG affecting Hslo channels in oocytes does not occur and that PKG needs to be stimulated to affect channel activity.Figure 5Immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged Hslo channels. A, scheme of c-Myc-tagged Hslo channels (HF1) and expressed HF1 currents in oocytes. Current traces are from −100 to 86 mV every 6 mV. Vh = 0 mV. B, immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Myc antibody of metabolically radiolabeled proteins. Oocytes were injected with mixtures (1:1) ofl-[35S]methionine and cRNA encoding HF1 (lane 1), Hslo lacking c-Myc tag (lane 2), or H20 (lane 3). Anti-c-Myc antibody specifically immunoprecipitated a ∼125-kDa band (c-Myc-tagged Hslo) with a purity > 90%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if PKG-Iα modulates Hslo channel activity, we stimulated expressed PKG-Iα with 8-Br-cGMP in the pipette. Control experiments (without 8-Br-cGMP) show that currents elicited by depolarizing pulses (−50 to 195 mV) were practically the same at time 0 (upon patch attainment) and after 10 min in the cell-attached configuration (Fig. 2 A) (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this example, currents are slightly faster after 10 min; this small change in kinetics could be due to a small change in Ca2+ near the vicinity of the channels in the cell-attached patch. After excision of the patch in 5 μmCa2+, the half-activation potential (V 12) was 34 mV (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Fig. 2 C shows that in another cell-attached patch of the same oocyte as in Fig. 2 A, but with 1 mm8-Br-cGMP in the pipette, macroscopic cell-attached currents underwent an ∼3-fold increase in their amplitudes after 10 min of drug treatment. To determine if the 8-Br-cGMP-induced Hslo activation was due to an increase in the voltage sensitivity of the channels and not to a large spontaneous increase in intracellular Ca2+, we excised the patch in the same 5 μm Ca2+solution as in Fig. 2 B and constructed a voltage activation curve (Fig. 2 D). The half-activation potential shifted to negative potentials to a value of −4 mV. In six out of eight similar paired experiments, V 12 significantly changed from 17 ± 20 mV in untreated oocytes to −4 ± 17 mV after 8-Br-cGMP or 8-pCPT-cGMP treatment (p = 0.007). These results show that 8-Br-cGMP treatment induces an increase in Hslo voltage sensitivity of about ∼20 mV (21 ± 12 mV) at constant Ca2+. To investigate if the 8-Br-cGMP-induced activation of Hslo (coexpressed with PKG-Iα) involves a phosphorylation mechanism, we determined if phosphatase treatment could reverse this effect. Fig. 3 A shows control currents in an excised patch at 5 μm Ca2+ that was previously held for 10 min in the cell-attached mode under nonstimulating conditions (no 8-Br-cGMP in the pipette). In this patch, the Hslo normalized voltage activation curve had aV 12 of 4 mV (Fig. 3 D, ▵). As expected, 8-Br-cGMP treatment of another cell-attached patch on the same oocyte caused a leftward shift of the channel voltage activation curve as measured after excision in 5 μm Ca2+(V 12 = −22 mV; Fig. 3, B and D, ▴). This is reflected by larger inward currents at negative potentials and faster activation kinetics in Fig. 3 B. Treatment of the same excised patch with alkaline phosphatase (100 units/ml) for ∼10 min induced a clear reduction in steady-state inward currents and activation kinetics (Fig. 3 C) when compared with traces in Fig. 3 B. The latter supports a change in open probability of the channels rather than a diminution of the number of channels in the patch due to “rundown.” Indeed, the voltage activation curves normalized to the maximum conductance at each condition showed that treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 3 D, ■) shifts the curve back to control values (V 12 = 1 mV). In three such paired experiments, stimulation by 8-Br-cGMP caused a leftward shift of 20 ± 5 mV (p = 0.03) from control values; subsequent phosphatase treatment reversed this action and caused a slight rightward shift (∼9 mV) above control values in two experiments. This shift above control values may be explained by phosphorylation of Hslo channels by endogenous kinases (but not by expressed PKG-Iα; see Fig. 1), since in three out of seven control inside-out patches expressing Hslo and PKG-Iα, alkaline phosphatase induced a 14 ± 4 mV (p < 0.05) rightward shift of the channel voltage activation curve. However, in the other four control patches phosphatase treatment did not significantly change the channel voltage sensitivity (shift was 1 ± 3 mV,p = 0.6). Taken together, these results show that alkaline phosphatase can reverse the stimulatory effect induced by 8-Br-cGMP, and thus, the activation of Hslo induced by 8-Br-cGMP in cell-attached patches is probably due to a phosphorylation mechanism. To test the hypothesis that the activation of Hslo induced by 8-Br-cGMP involves phosphorylation of Hslo channels, we directly tested the effect of purified PKG-Iα on Hslo channels expressed alone using inside-out patches. Control records were taken after perfusing PKG-Iα buffer and MgATP plus cGMP. These compounds had negligible effects on channel activity as measured by voltage activation curves. PKG-Iα buffer (at the final concentration used in the experiments) produced a mean leftward shift of 1 ± 4 mV (n = 12), and MgATP plus cGMP (0.1–0.5 mm) induced a leftward shift of 3 ± 6 mV (n = 13). In only one out of 13 experiments did further perfusion of PKG-Iα (plus MgATP, cGMP, 0.01% bovine serum albumin) produce a stimulatory effect (10 mV leftward shift of the voltage activation curve). To rule out the possibility that PKG-Iα-induced channel activation was masked by endogenous phosphorylation or by an associated phosphatase, patches were treated with alkaline phosphatase or with okadaic acid. Pretreatment with 100 units/ml alkaline phosphatase (n= 7) or the addition of 3 μm okadaic acid after PKG-Iα (n = 2) did not lead to stimulation of channel activity by the purified kinase. Alkaline phosphatase had varied effects on Hslo activity. From 18 patches, alkaline phosphatase produced no significant effect in nine cases (change of 0.8 ± 3 mV; p = 0.5), a rightward shift of 16 ± 4 mV in 7 cases (p < 0.001), and a mean leftward shift of −16 mV in two experiments. Nevertheless, as stated above, none of the predephosphorylated channels were activated by purified PKG-Iα. In contrast to experiments in inside-out patches, Hslo channels reconstituted into lipid bilayers could be consistently activated by treatment with purified PKG-Iα (10 out of 12 experiments). Purified PKG-Iα, cGMP, and ATP were added directly to the cytoplasmic side of the channels together with 0.01% bovine serum albumin. In most experiments, okadaic acid (100 nm) was present to prevent a possible dephosphorylation mechanism. Fig. 4,A and B, show typical examples of channel activation after treatment with PKG-Iα. In Fig. 4 A, PKG-Iα was tested at constant voltage (−30 mV). Representative traces are illustrated above the P o versus time plots. In this experiment, okadaic acid (100 nm) added prior to PKG-Iα treatment caused no significant variation in channel activity (n = 3). In contrast, the addition of 80 nm PKG-Iα significantly increased channel activity from a mean P o of 0.02 to 0.1. In most cases, the effect of the kinase was observed within 5–10 min after PKG-Iα application and produced a 3 ± 1.8-fold increase (n = 10) in channel activity. Note that neither channel amplitude nor number of channels were affected by PKG-Iα treatment, but open probability was affected. Fig. 4 B shows the effect of PKG-Iα at different voltages obtained from ramp experiments. PKG-Iα treatment caused a 15 mV leftward shift in the voltage activation curve of Hslo channels, V 12, changed from +11 mV to −4 mV. The mean leftward shift induced by PKG-Iα for three experiments was 15 ± 0.7 mV. This modulatory effect of PKG-Iα on the open probability of Hslo channels accounts for the increase in their macroscopic current amplitudes and is similar to the shift of the activation curves recorded in intact cells (Fig. 2). The specificity of PKG-Iα action was tested using boiled kinase (Fig. 4 C). In four out of four experiments, boiled PKG-Iα had no effect in channel activity. In two experiments where active PKG-Iα was further tested, the active enzyme was able to induce a 2- and 8-fold increase in channel activity. Furthermore, in one case washout of active PKG-Iα in the continuous presence of okadaic acid failed to reverse channel activation. Taken together, these results indicate that Hslo channels or a closely associated protein are targets of PKG-Iα-induced phosphorylation. To determine if Hslo channels are indeed directly phosphorylated by PKG-Iα, we examined 1) the incorporation of γ-33P into immunoprecipitated channels and 2) the degree of back-phosphorylation in intact cells stimulated with 8-pCPT-cGMP a specific and potent activator of PKG-Iα (37Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For efficient immunoprecipitation, we used an Hslo construct tagged with the c-Myc epitope at its amino terminus (flag in Fig. 5 A), with a calculated molecular mass of 126.9 kDa. We have previously shown that this expressed c-Myc-tagged Hslo channel (HF1) has properties indistinguishable from the wild type channels (traces in Fig. 5 A) (30Meera P. Wallner M. Song M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A protein of the expected molecular mass (∼125 kDa) can be immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody from oocytes injected with [35S]methionine and c-Myc-tagged Hslo cRNA (Fig. 5 B; HF1, lane 1) but not when the c-Myc tag is absent (Hslo,lane 2) or from oocytes injected with H2O (lane 3). For in vitro phosphorylation, HF1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes was immunoprecipitated and incubated with [γ-33P]ATP in the presence of PKG-Iα (Fig. 6 A). Phosphorylation labeled the expected band at ∼125 kDa (lane 1), corresponding to the tagged Hslo (HF1). In contrast, in the absence of PKG-Iα (lane 2), using heat-denatured kinase (h.d.; lane 3) or using uninjected oocytes (lane 4), no band at 125 kDa was detected. Note that in lanes 1 and 4, where active PKG-Iα was added to the phosphorylating mixture, another band at ∼150 kDa was detected. This band corresponds to the dimeric form of the autophosphorylated PKG-Iα (37Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in four experiments.

Interestingly, TRAIL-induced JNK activation occurs in a cell type-specific manner. In HeLa cells, TRAIL-induced JNK activation can be completely blocked with the cysteine protease inhibitor zVAD-fmk, whereas the same inhibitor has no, or even a stimulatory, effect on JNK activation in Kym-1 cells. Hence, TRAIL can engage at least two independent pathways leading to JNK activation, one that is cysteine protease-dependent and one that is cysteine protease-independent. To investigate whether the cysteine protease-dependent signaling of TRAIL leading to JNK activation is related to the apoptotic pathway engaged by this ligand, we investigated HeLa cells stably overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of FADD (Fas-associating protein with death domain) (GFP(green fluorescent protein)ΔFADD). In these cells, TRAIL-induced cell death and activation of the apoptosis executioner caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH) and caspase-3 (YAMA, CPP-32, Apopain), that belong to caspase subfamily of cysteine proteases, were abrogated, whereas JNK activation remained unaffected and was still sensitive toward z-VAD-fmk. Similar data were found in HeLa cells overexpressing Apo1/Fas and GFPΔFADD upon stimulation with agonistic antibodies. These data suggest that cross-linking of the TRAIL receptors and Apo1/Fas, respectively, engages a FADD-dependent pathway leading to the activation of apoptotic caspases and, in parallel, a FADD-independent pathway leading to the stimulation of one or more cysteine proteases capable to activate JNK but not sufficient for the induction of cell death.

This suggests that activation of the apoptotic caspase cascade by these death domain-containing receptors requires recruitment of the adaptor molecule FADD into the respective receptor signaling complexes.

In the case of TNF-R1, the activation of NF-κB occurs via recruitment of RIP and TRAF2 into the receptor signaling complex through association with TRADD and subsequent activation of the TRAF-associated kinase, NF-κB-inducing kinase. Subsequently, NF-κB-inducing kinase phosphorylates the IκB kinases α and β (IKKα and IKKβ), leading to activation of NF-κB (46Maniatis T.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms involved in activation of NF-κB by other death domain-containing receptors remain to be elucidated. The most recently identified death domain-containing receptors DR4/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2/TRICK/KILLER are receptors for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL/Apo2L (48Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J.

In this report, we demonstrate the capability of TRAIL/Apo2L to induce JNK by a cysteine protease-dependent and by a cysteine protease-independent pathway. Moreover, using a dominant negative mutant of FADD as well as the cysteine protease inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, we are able to show that, in contrast to induction of apoptosis, the cysteine protease-dependent mode of JNK activation is FADD-independent. Hence, TRAIL/Apo2L has the capability to engage at least three different pathways: two independent pathways with distinct cysteine protease requirements leading to cell death or JNK activation and, in addition, a cysteine protease-independent pathway also linked to JNK activation. The HeLa cells stably transfected with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a GFP-tagged dominant negative mutant of FADD, respectively, have been described elsewhere (53Wajant H. Johannes F.-J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For analysis of GFP a FACStar+ (Becton and Dickinsion, San Jose, Ca) has been used. Purified recombinant FLAG-tagged human TRAIL was used as complex with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak International Biotechnologies) as described (53Wajant H. Johannes F.-J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). HeLa and Kym-1 cells were grown in Clicks RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (HeLa) and 10% (Kym-1) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa and Kym-1 cells (10 × 106) with the RNA INSTAPURE kit (Eurogentech, Seraing, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The presence of transcripts of caspase-8, FasL, Fas, FADD, DR3, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, TRAIL-R3, TRAIL TNF-R1, TRADD, and RIP as well as the internal controls L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were analyzed using the hApo-3c Multi-Probe template set (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany). Probe synthesis, hybridization, and RNase treatment were performed with the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase Protection Assay System (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Finally, samples were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (5%) and analyzed by phosphorimaging. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the First Strand Synthesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) and oligo(dT) as a primer according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of 1 μl of cDNA were used as template in a final volume of 50 μl in a standard High Fidelity PCR (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) reaction. Samples were overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil and amplified as followed: 1) station: 94 °C, 2 min; 1 cycle; 2) station: 94 °C, 15 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 90 s; 10 cycles; 3) station: 94 °C, 15 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 90 s; time increase 20 s per cycle; 10–20 cycles (as indicated). For the PCR reaction 0.25 μg of each of the following primers comprising the intracellular domains of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R4 as well as the extracellular domain of TRAIL-R3, respectively, was used: TRAIL-R1: F-NcoI, 5′-CAG CAC CCA TGG GTT GTG GAG GGG ACC CCA AGT GCA TGG AC-3′; R-NotI, 5′-GTG CTG GCG GCC GCT CAC TCC AAG GAC ACG GCA GAG CCT GT-3′; TRAIL-R2: F-NcoI, 5′-CAG CAC CCA TGG TTG TTT GCA AGT CTT TAC TGT GGA AG-3′; R-NotI, 5′-GTG CTG GCG GCC GCT GAA GAG AAT CAC ACT TAG GAC ATG GC-3′; TRAIL-R3: F, 5′-GAG ATG CAA GGG GTG AAG GAG CGC TTC-3′; R, 5′-CCA CAG TGC AGT CTT TCA AAC AAA CAC-3′; TRAIL-R4: F-BspHI, 5′-CAG CAC TCA TGA GTC GGA AGA AAT TCA TTT CTT ACC TCA AA-3′; R-NotI, 5′-GTG CTG GCG GCC GCT TTC CTG AAG AGA TTC TTT CAC AGG CA-3′. Please obey that the primers for TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R4 contain restriction sites for NotI,BspHI, and NcoI for cloning purposes not relevant for this study. Control reactions without or with 1 μg of genomic DNA as template was performed in each experiment. HeLa cells (1.5 × 104/well) were cultivated in 96-well microtiter plates overnight. Next day TRAIL-M2 complex was titrated and 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide were added. After 18 h culture supernatants were discarded, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline followed by crystal violet staining (20% methanol, 0.5% crystal violet) for 15 min. The wells were washed with H2O and air-dried. The dye was resolved with methanol for 15 min, and optical density at 550 nm was determined with a R5000 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Dynatech, Guernsey, Great Britain). Kym-1 cells (1 × 104/well) were cultivated in 96-well microtiter plates overnight. Next day TRAIL-M2 complex was titrated and after additional 18 h of culture metabolic activity was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method. Following stimulation, cells (2–3 × 106) were lysed in 1 ml of kinase lysis buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmNaF) for 20 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. JNK was immunoprecipitated with 0.5 μg of a rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with kinase lysis buffer and twice in assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After the last wash, beads were left in a 1:1 suspension, and kinase reactions were carried out at room temperature for 20 min after addition of 0.5 μg GST-Jun(1–79) and ATP (100 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding 25 μl of 6-fold concentrated Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed using a PhosphoImager. It has been shown that JNK activity is induced upon cross-linking of non-death domain-containing receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily, e.g. CD40 (54Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R.

The enzyme is not regulated by the small GTP-binding protein Ras. The C2 domain of the enzyme bound anionic phospholipids such as PI and phosphatidylserine in vitro, but did not co-operatively bind Ca2+ and phospholipids. Deletion of the C2 domain increased the lipid kinase activity suggesting that it functions as a negative regulator of the catalytic domain.

Although presently it is not known whether PI 3-kinase C2β is regulated by Ca2+ in vivo, our results suggest a novel role for Ca2+ ions in phosphate transfer reactions. phosphoinositide 3-kinase high pressure liquid chromatography homology region glutathione S-transferase phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate 4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate 4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatidylserine polymerase chain reaction Src homology 2 and 3, respectively polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline. The cell, through diverse surface receptors with unique binding specificities, can sense bound signal molecules and transduce responses that regulate its physiology. It seems clear that most cell surface receptors activate a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)1 as part of the signal transduction cascade leading to the formation of phosphoinositides with 3′-phosphate groups (1Kapeller R.

The diversity of physiological events associated with increased PI 3-kinase activity is evident from reports of enzyme activation in: processes such as cell proliferation and transformation (3Cantley L.C.

The activation of PI 3-kinase in this array of receptor-triggered processes suggests that 3′-phosphoinositides have a role as second messengers. At least three 3′-phosphoinositides are produced in cells: PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3. Receptor-triggered signals have been shown to activate PI 3-kinases and generate PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (12Stephens L.R. Hughes K. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 13Hawkins P.T. Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 157-159Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). PI(3)P can also be detected in cells but its production is not regulated by external signals (12Stephens L.R. Hughes K. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 13Hawkins P.T. Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 157-159Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2 can also be generated from PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 through the action of phosphoinositide phosphatases which could be regulated by distinct mechanisms to those of the phosphoinositide kinases (14Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Through many studies involving the purification and molecular characterization of PI 3-kinases, a family of enzymes has been defined, which can be divided into three classes, whose members have diverse substrate specificity and distinct control mechanisms (15Zvelebil M.J. MacDougall L.K. Leevers S. Volinia S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages P. Koga H. Salim K. Linacre J. Das P. Panaretou C. Wetzker R. Waterfield M.D. Philos. Trans. R.

Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The Class I PI 3-kinases, which can be subdivided into IA and IB, are known to be activated by receptors. Although they can phosphorylate PI, PI(4)P, and PI(4,5)P2 in vitro, these enzymes utilize mainly PI(4,5)P2 as a substrate in vivo(12Stephens L.R. Hughes K. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 13Hawkins P.T. Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 157-159Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The Class IA enzymes are heterodimers that are recruited to, and activated by receptors linked to tyrosine kinases through their p85 subunits. At least three distinct p110 subunits that have kinase activity are associated with p85 subunits: these are p110α, p110β, and p110δ (17Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R.

The p85 subunits serve as adaptors and regulators (20Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M.J. Ruiz-Larrea F. Panayotou G. Thompson A. Dhand R. Hsuan J. Totty N. Smith A.D. Morgan S.J. Courtneidge S.A.

The nature of any receptor-linked activation pathway for these enzymes remains unclear. Studies of the Drosophila (26MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr.

Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) show that their in vitrosubstrate specificity is restricted to PI and PI(4)P, and that they cannot utilize PI(4,5)P2. The role of the C2 domain is not understood, although studies of the Drosophila enzyme suggest that it mediates calcium-independent phospholipid binding (26MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1404-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This feature is similar to that of the C2B domain of synaptotagmin, which binds to the clathrin-AP2 complex in a Ca2+-independent manner (30Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The synaptotagmin C2B domain can also homodimerize in a Ca2+-dependent manner (31Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The diversity in biochemical function which can be mediated by C2 domains is evident from studies which show that C2 domains of synaptotagmin, protein kinase C, and phospholipase C can bind a variety of ligands, including Ca2+, phopholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and intracellular proteins (32Ponting C.P. Parker P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The third class of PI 3-kinases contains phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases that are specific for PI. Only one enzyme has yet been found in each of several species examined. In yeast, the enzyme is the product of the vesicle protein sorting mutant gene Vps34 (34Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Both Vps34p and its human homologue PtdIns 3-kinase (35Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) associate with a serine/threonine kinase, Vps15p in yeast (36Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and p150 in man (37Panaretou C. Domin J. Cockcroft S. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2477-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The biochemical function of the PI(3)P generated by these enzymes has been elusive, although recent reports of alterations in PI(3,5)P2 levels in yeast and mammalian cells after osmotic shock suggest that PI(3)P may serve as a substrate for an as yet unknown PI(3)P 5-kinase (38Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and that PI(3,5)P2 may mediate vesicular trafficking. Several other proteins (Tor1 and 2, RAFT, ATM, and DNA-dependent protein kinase), which have regions homologous to the PI 3-kinase HRI kinase domain, have been described (39Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These proteins seem to be involved in cell cycle regulation and, although in some cases they have protein kinase activity, it remains unclear if they function as PI 3-kinases. In this article, we describe the cloning, expression, and enzymology of a human Class II PI 3-kinase with an amino acid sequence that is virtually identical to that of the PI 3-kinase HsC2, which was recently described by Brown et al. (40Brown R.A. Ho L.K.F. Weber-Hall S.J. Shipley J.M. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we show that PI 3-kinase C2β has a substrate specificity restricted to PI and PI(4)P, similar to that of the Drosophila, human, and murine Class II enzymes previously examined. The cofactor studies described here, however, show that the enzyme is unique in being able to use Ca-ATP for its lipid kinase activity in vitro. The role of the C2 domain in calcium binding, enzyme activity, and membrane association has been investigated, and the results show that the C2 domain may function mainly as a modulator of catalytic function. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and passaged every 2–3 days using Versene (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in IPL-41 (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with yeast extract ultrafiltrate (Sigma) and lipid concentrate (Sigma) and passaged every 3 days. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on a U937 cDNA library, using degenerate primers corresponding to the conserved peptides GDDLRQD and FHIDFG, and screening was performed as described previously in Refs. 35Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar and 41Volinia S. Hiles I.D. Ormondroyd E. Nizetic D. Antonacci R. Rocchi M. Waterfield M.D. Genomics. 1994; 24: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. Sequencing of the cDNA clones was carried out using the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator Cycle Sequencing system (ABI) and an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 373). Rapid amplifiction of cDNA ends PCR was performed using U937 λ-ligated cDNA as a template and nested sense λ primers and PI 3-kinase C2β specific antisense primers.Taq DNA polymerase (Cetus) was used in two consecutive 50-μl PCR reactions (first PCR: ATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG (T3 promoter) sense primer; ACTGAATTCTCAACCCACGTCCACATTCCTCAGG (+1170), antisense primer, 94 °C for 2 min denaturation followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 56 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 2 min; second PCR: TGCAGGAATTCGGCACGA (cloning site) sense primer, ACTGAATTCTCAAGTAGTCTTGGATGTCAGAGC (+971) nested antisense primer, 96 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 96 °C for 40 s, 56 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 2 min). Approximately 500 ng of cDNA ligation mixture was used in the first PCR, then 1 μl from the first PCR reaction was amplified in the second reaction. The PCR reaction products were digested with EcoRI and ligated into pBluescript (Stratagene). Fifty clones were sequenced and oligonucleotides were designed in order to introduce anEcoRI site 5′ to the most NH2-terminal ATG codon. Reverse transcriptase-PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was performed using U937 cDNA as a template. The resulting 5′ cDNA was digested with EcoRI and EcoRV, sequenced to check sequence fidelity and ligated in front of the remainder of the cDNA to produce the complete open reading frame. The cDNA encoding PI 3-kinase C2β was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using theEcoRI and XhoI sites. NH2-terminal Glu- (MEFMPME) or Myc- (MEQKLISEEDL) epitope tags were introduced into the cDNA in-frame by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase. AnEcoRI site was added to the 5′ of the tag sequences to facilitate subcloning. The PCR products encoding the tagged NH2 termini were fused to the cDNA of PI 3-kinase C2β using a unique BstUI site at +169 and recloned into pcDNA3 using EcoRI and XhoI. The sequence of these constructs was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequencing. In order to generate a deletion of the C2 domain of PI 3-kinase C2β, the cDNA encoding the NH2-terminal Myc-tagged version of the enzyme cloned in pcDNA3 was digested at position +4419 withApaI. After dephosphorylization of the linearized DNA with calf intestinal phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), annealed 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides (sense TGAAGTACTCAATTGGGCC, antisense CAATTGAGTACTTCAGGCC) were ligated to the cDNA to introduce a TGA in-frame at codon +1474. The construct was analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing of the 3′ end. HEK293 cells were grown to 50–60% confluence on 150-mm dishes and transfected with cDNA constructs in pcDNA3 using calcium-phosphate, exactly as described (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for gene expression. The cDNA construct encoding Glu-tagged PI 3-kinase C2β was subcloned into pBluescript SK usingEcoRI and XhoI sites and this construct digested with EcoRI and KpnI. The resulting cDNA insert was then subcloned into the pAcSG2 baculovirus transfer vector (PharMingen). Sf9 insect cells were co-transfected with the recombinant transfer vector encoding PI 3-kinase C2β and BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA (PharMingen), using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculoviruses were harvested 7 days post-transfection, amplified, and screened for induction of protein expression. Positive viruses were plaque-purified, re-amplified, and used for production of recombinant enzyme. Sf9 cells were grown to 50–60% confluency and infected with recombinant plaque-purified baculoviruses for 60 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and washed once in ice-cold PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant PI 3-kinase C2β was purified from the Triton X-100 soluble fraction by immunoprecipitation with purified monoclonal anti-Glu-tag antibodies and Protein G-Sepharose, as described below. Cells grown on 150-mm dishes were placed on ice, washed once in ice-cold PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.), and lysed for 20 min on ice in 2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmbenzamidine, 7 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mm N α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 20 μm leupeptin, 18 μmpepstatin, 21 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were then scraped from the dishes, transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation with the relevant antibody. Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia, 10 μl of beads per sample) were then added and the incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The immunoprecipitates were washed once in lysis buffer, once in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m LiCl and once in TBS (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl). The enzyme preparations were stored at −30 °C in TBS containing 50% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. In the case of the C2 deletion mutant, the washing and storage buffers were supplemented with 100 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, since the enzyme lost activity much more rapidly than the wild-type, possibly because of an increased susceptibility to proteolysis. SDS-PAGE was performed using buffer systems according to previous methods (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels (7.5% acrylamide) were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman Sciences) using a semi-dry blotter (Pharmacia, 3 h at 300 mÅ). The membranes were then blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 3% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, 0.1% (w/v) PEG 20000. The relevant primary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (PBS/Tween) and incubated with the membranes for 2 h. After extensive washing in PBS/Tween, the blots were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Dako) at 1:2000 dilution. The membranes were then washed in PBS/Tween and the bands detected using ECL (Amersham). A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1 to 331 obtained by PCR was subcloned into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) using the EcoRI 5′ of the start codon and anEcoRI site introduced by PCR at the 3′ end. Expression of this construct in Escherichia coli strain BL21/DE3 was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were then harvested, snap-frozen, and lysed by sonication in ice-cold extraction buffer (EB, 10 mm TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, the cleared lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The beads were then washed three times in EB, once in TBS, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm CaCl2. Thrombin was added (4 μg/mg of recombinant protein) for 20 min at room temperature on a wheel. The supernatant containing the recombinant NH2-terminal fragment was treated withp-aminobenzamidine-agarose (Sigma), concentrated to 1 mg/ml using a Centriplus 10 concentrator (Amicon), and stored at −70 °C. The purified recombinant NH2-terminal fragment was used to immunize 2 rabbits (Eurogentec, Seraing-Belgium). The animals were injected 3 times over 35 days with 100 μg of antigen in Freund's adjuvant and the serum was collected after 42 days. The rabbits were then boosted every month and serum was collected 10 days after each injection. A cDNA fragment starting at codon 1440 and encoding the C2 domain was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T using two EcoRI sites introduced at both the 5′ and 3′ ends during PCR. The orientation of the construct was checked by restriction digestions and sequencing. E. coli strain BL21/DE3 was transformed with the construct and protein expression induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant protein was purified from the Triton X-100 soluble fraction as above, and eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B as a GST-fusion using 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm reduced glutathione. Buffer exchange to TBS was performed on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia). The purified GST-C2 domain was concentrated to 1 mg/ml using a Centriplus 10 concentrator (Amicon) and stored at −70 °C. The same protocol was used to prepare recombinant synaptotagmin C2A and C2B domains as GST fusions. The binding of purified recombinant GST-C2 domains to phospholipid vesicles was studied using a sedimentation assay, essentially as described in Ref. 44Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar. Phospholipids in CHCl3 (Sigma, 160 μg/assay) were dried, sonicated in 50 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at room temperature. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and added to 50 μl of TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml purified recombinant GST-C2 domains and EGTA (2 mm final concentration) or CaCl2 (1 mm final concentration). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid and the protein pellets washed 3 times with acetone at −20 °C and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The pellets were extracted with acetone for 30 min at −20 °C, centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at room temperature, and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of the pellet and the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The gels were scanned using a flatbed densitometer (Epson) and the data analyzed using the program Aida 1.20 beta. To analyze binding of 45Ca2+ to the recombinant GST-C2 domains, phospholipids and proteins were prepared as above and 10 μCi of 45CaCl2 (Amersham, 2.2 mCi/ml) added to each sample in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled CaCl2. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose were added and the samples incubated with constant rotation for 30 min. The beads were then centrifuged for 20 s at 1000 × g and washed twice in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl. The radioactivity bound to the beads was quantified by scintillation counting. PI 3-kinase activity of the immunoprecipitates was assayed by resuspending them in 25 μl of 2 × kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Phospholipids (PI, PI(4)P, and PI(4,5)P2, Sigma) stored in CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) (v/v) were dried, sonicated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and added at 0.2 mg/ml final concentration to the samples. The reactions (50 μl final volume) were started by the addition of 40 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and 3.5 mm of the relevant divalent cations. In order to determine the kinetic parameters of the enzyme for ATP salts, the immunoprecipitates and the phospholipids were incubated in a 40-μl reaction volume, and various concentrations of Mg-ATP, Ca-ATP, or Na2-ATP (all from Sigma) containing [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 μCi/nmol) added in 10 μl. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, 100 μl of 1 n HCl and 200 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) (v/v) were added. The organic phase was collected, re-extracted with 40 μl of MeOH, 1 nHCl (1:1) (v/v) and radioactivity measured by Cerenkov counting. The samples were then dried, resuspended in 30 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) (v/v) and spotted onto channelled Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Whatman), which had been pretreated in 1% (w/v) oxalic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 40% MeOH (v/v) and baked for 15 min at 110 °C. The plates were developed in propanol, 2m acetic acid (65:35) (v/v) and the radiolabeled spots quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). These analyses were performed as described in Ref. 45Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar. Radioactive spots corresponding to specific phospholipids were scraped from the TLC plates and incubated with methylamine (33% (w/w) in EtOH) for 1 h at 53 °C. The samples were dried in a SpeedVac and the silica gel extracted three times with 0.25 ml of H2O. After centrifugation, the supernatant was extracted twice with an equal volume of butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl formate (20:4:1, v/v/v). The aqueous phase containing the deacylated phospholipids was then analyzed on a Partisphere SAX HPLC column (Whatman). A gradient of 0 to 25% B over 60 min followed by 25 to 70% B over 30 min (A: H2O, B: 1 m (NH4)2HPO4 pH 3.8) was used. Radioactive peaks were monitored using a continuous flow scintillation counter (Reeve Analytical, Glasgow, United Kingdom). The retention time of the samples was compared with that of a glycero-PI(3)P standard produced in an in vitro PI kinase assay using purified recombinant bovine p110α and of a glycero-PI(4)P standard produced by an in vitro PI kinase assay using purified membrane preparations of A431 cells in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. The alignment of the C2 domain of PI 3-kinase C2β with other C2 domains was initially obtained using Multalign (46Barton G.J. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol"

We demonstrate that high level gelatinase A expression is mediated by a unique interaction of two developmentally regulated transcription factors, AP2 and YB-1, within a discrete 40-base pair enhancer element (RE-1) located in the 5′-flanking region of the gelatinase A gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies and immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed a direct interaction of AP2 with this binding sequence in the form of AP2·YB-1 heteromeric complexes. Binding of AP2·YB-1 complexes to the RE-1 sequence results in the formation of extended single-stranded DNA regions and may stabilize DNA conformational changes. Overexpression of YB-1 and AP2 proteins by gelatinase A synthesizing hepatoma HepG2 cells induced a synergistic increase in the RE-1-mediated transcription of nearly 160-fold.

Cellular migration and invasion are fundamental aspects of many critical biological processes including development, angiogenesis, wound repair, and tumor metastasis. Whereas several distinctive proteolytic systems have been implicated in these processes, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 gene family, which currently includes 19 members, has been the focus of intense investigational scrutiny. As a group, these enzymes are characterized by activity in the extra- (or peri-) cellular space, secretion as latent zymogens, dependence on zinc for catalytic activity, and inhibition by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (1Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). Individual members of the MMP family exhibit distinctive patterns of proteolytic activity against extracellular matrix proteins, thereby permitting a highly regulated mechanism for matrix turnover.The 72-kDa gelatinase A (also denoted MMP-2) displays a number of features that distinguish it from other members of the MMP gene family. Although secreted as a soluble proenzyme, gelatinase A has been recently shown to bind to the αvβ3vitronectin receptor on the surfaces of invasive cells (2Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). This surface localization is presumably a major determinant of the ability of gelatinase A to act as a growth and differentiation factor for cellsin vitro (3Turck J. Pollock A.S. Lee L.K. Marti H.-P. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15074-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition to the unique pattern of surface expression and action as a growth and differentiation factor, the transcriptional regulation of gelatinase A is noteworthy. In contrast to other MMPs, the 5′-flanking region of this gene lacks TATA or CAAT boxes or functional AP-1- or NF-κB-binding sites (4Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both the human and rat genes lack functional AP-1 or NF-κB elements, exposure of glomerular mesangial cells to phorbol ester, prostaglandin E2, or cAMP analogs resulted in enhanced gelatinase A transcription and synthesis, suggesting that a functional AP2 element may regulate the responses to these stimulatory factors (6Marti H.-P. McNeil L. Martin J. Davies M. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Zahner G. Harendza S. Muller E. Wolf G. Thaiss F. Stahl R.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1116-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Recent studies from our laboratory, using the glomerular mesangial cell as a model cell capable of high level gelatinase A synthesis, have defined a potent 40-bp cis-acting response element (gelatinase A RE-1) in the near 5′-flanking region of the rat gelatinase A gene which, in conjunction with the proximal promoter, confers cell-specific transcriptional regulation (4Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To identify transacting factors, which may regulate gelatinase A transcription, we used the RE-1 as a probe in expression screening and identified the transcription factor YB-1 as a specific nuclear protein component that regulates RE-1 activity (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). YB-1 is a member of a family of highly conserved DNA-binding proteins that has been shown to regulate the transcription of several central growth or differentiation genes (9Ladomey M. Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 87: 9028-9032Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and its association with the transcriptional control of the growth regulatory enzyme, gelatinase A, is consistent with a postulated role for YB-1 as a key developmental transcription factor (9Ladomey M. Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Although our transfection data indicated that YB-1 did mediate, through the RE-1, gelatinase A transactivation, further analysis of nuclear gel shift experiments suggested that additional transcriptional elements were involved. In this study we demonstrate that a second, differentiation-dependent transcription factor, AP2, can directly interact with YB-1 to induce a synergistic activation of RE-1 transcriptional activity. These effects of AP2/YB-1 are associated with DNA structural alteration, including induction of single-stranded DNA, which may provide a structural template for additional partner protein binding.DISCUSSIONThe studies outlined in this report extend our previous observations on the transcriptional control of the gelatinase A gene and the critical role of the 40-bp RE-1 enhancer element in this process. An expression screening strategy using this element as a probe yielded the transcriptional regulatory protein, YB-1, which is a major determinant of the transcriptional activities of several growth-related genes (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The strong preference of YB-1 for binding to single-stranded, as opposed to double-stranded, DNA, coupled with the complex patterns observed with nuclear extract gel shift analyses, strongly suggested that additional transcriptional factors associate with the RE-1. Given the fact that treatment of glomerular mesangial cells with phorbol ester, prostaglandin E2, or cAMP analogs induces gelatinase A transcription and synthesis (6Marti H.-P. McNeil L. Martin J. Davies M. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Zahner G. Harendza S. Muller E. Wolf G. Thaiss F. Stahl R.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1116-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we considered that AP2 was a likely candidate for this role. Inspection of the RE-1 sequence revealed the sequence, GCCTGCTGGG, which is homologous to the AP2 consensus sequence, GCCCN3GGC (16Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar).The ability of recombinant AP2 protein to bind to the RE-1 sequence was demonstrated by gel shift analyses and shown by DNA footprinting methodology to occur within the putative partial consensus sequence. Interestingly, this partial consensus sequence is contiguous with the incomplete Y box sequence which interacts with recombinant YB-1 protein (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whereas YB-1 alone has little affinity for the RE-1 element in the double-stranded form (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), addition of YB-1 to the AP2/oligonucleotide incubation mixture led to extensive complex formation consisting of AP2·YB-1 heteromeric complexes. These studies suggested that AP2, by interaction with the RE-1 element in the double-stranded form, facilitates subsequent YB-1 binding and heteromer formation. Experiments with an AP2 consensus sequence oligonucleotide lacking a Y box confirmed this impression. Whereas recombinant YB-1 protein had no detectable binding activity for this sequence in the double-stranded form, inclusion of AP2 resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of shifted oligonucleotide as compared with AP2 alone. Not only was complex formation facilitated, there was a dramatic increase in the half-life (i.e. stability) of these complexes. The physiological significance of these interactions was confirmed by the transfection experiments with the mutated AP2 consensus-binding site and by the increase in RE-1 transactivating function following exposure of mesangial cells to prostaglandin E2.The immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the interaction of AP2 with YB-1 is not dependent upon the presence of an appropriate oligonucleotide template, as we were able to recover AP2·YB-1 complexes from solution phase. That AP2 and YB-1 proteins are associated in the in vivo context was demonstrated by the sequential decreases in RE-1 electrophoretic mobility following sequential addition of anti-AP2 and YB-1 antibodies. Several recent reports have also demonstrated interactions of YB-1 with different partner proteins, including YY1, Pur-α, NF-κB/relA subunit, DNA-binding protein A, and cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (18Chen N.N. Chang C.-F. Gallia G.L. Kerr D.A. Johnson E.M. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S. Frisque R. Bollag B. Khalili K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 793-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most of these studies, YB-1 partnering was demonstrated by differences in binding affinities for the respective regulatory elements in gel shift analysis; a successful co-immunoprecipitation has only been reported for the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (23Zou Y. Evans S. Chen J. Kuo H.-C. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 793-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).DMS protection footprinting analyses of the RE-1 element probed with both YB-1 and AP2 were informative in that AP2 binding to the partial consensus sequence overlapped the YB-1-binding sites within the partial Y box sequence. Composite and competitive binding of AP2 and other transcription factors has been described for several promoters, including prothymosin-α, ornithine decarboxylase, and theAP2α genes (24Bauer R. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Kopp H. Moser M. Seegers S. Kerscher M. Tainsky M.A. Hofstaedter F. Buettner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Moser M.

Such a placement of transcriptional binding sites can facilitate either cooperative or competitive interactions and permit a finer level of transcriptional control than that achieved by binding of single factors to promoter elements (26Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 246: 1266-1272Crossref Scopus (1066) Google Scholar).The footprinting analysis of the AP2/YB-1 combination also revealed a more extensive protection of guanines at the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide sequence as compared with footprinting with AP2 alone. These studies suggest that following the AP2-facilitated binding of YB-1 to the RE-1 sequence, there may be assemblage of YB-1 multimers along the length of the element. The ability of high concentrations of YB-1 to form multimeric complexes on the single-stranded components of the RE-1 has been recently demonstrated (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).AP2/YB-1 binding to the RE-1 element induced pronounced changes in DNA structure. Single-stranded DNA was formed immediately distal to the AP2-binding site and extended to nearly the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide probe. It is conceivable that similar changes are of importance when cruciform DNA extrusions with intrastrand base pairing occur as they have been described for the cAMP response element of the human enkephalin gene promoter and the N4 virion RNA polymerase promoter (27Glucksmann-Kuis M.A. Dai X. Markiewicz P. Rothman-Denes L.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Glucksmann-Kuis M.A. Markiewicz P. Malone C. Rothman-Denes L.B.

A. 1991; 88: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 3′ sequence of the RE-1 contains an inverted repeat sequence that may also participate in intrastrand base pairing. These major changes in DNA structure induced by the combination of AP2/YB-1 may help to explain the synergistic effects of the combination on the levels of RE-1-dependent transcription rates observed with HepG2 cells.The number of identified single strand-specific DNA-binding proteins involved in the regulation of transcription is steadily increasing and includes, among others, the far upstream element-binding proteins of the c-myc gene (31Davis-Smyth T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4875-4881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Major questions remain as to how these proteins, with specific single-stranded DNA recognition motifs, locate their cognate target sequences and how DNA melting and strand separation is mediated to permit access. In the current study, we propose a model whereby AP2 binding to the double strand RE-1 element permits subsequent attachment of the lower affinity YB-1 protein, which then mediates DNA helical separation. These effects could permit the recruitment of additional transactivating single strand binding factors to this region and thus converge the structural and functional data obtained in this study. In support of this concept, initial studies using Southwestern blot analysis and oligonucleotide affinity techniques have revealed a 17-kDa RE-1 single strand-specific DNA-binding protein in HepG2 nuclear extracts. 2P. R. Mertens and D. H. Lovett, unpublished observations. Our present studies with the rat gelatinase A promoter region and the identification of YB-1 and AP2 as important regulatory proteins represent a convergence with the analyses of the human gelatinase A promoter by Frisch and colleagues (34Frisch S.M. Morisaki J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6524-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Somasundaram K. Jayaraman G. Williams T. Moran E. Frisch S. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These workers identified, within the context of the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line, a strong enhancer element (denoted r2) located approximately 1650 bp from the transcriptional start site, a location not dissimilar to the rat RE-1 found at−1322 bp. Gel shift analyses and DNA footprinting, as well as complex formation with the adenovirus E1A protein, all indicated a specific interaction of the r2 sequence with the AP2 protein. Alignments of the two respective elements demonstrate a significant degree of homology within the region of the partial AP2 consensus sequences, and gel shift analyses with recombinant YB-1 and the r2 element indicate that binding, particularly to the single-stranded component, does occur. 3P. R. Mertens, D. H. Lovett, and A. Jaume, unpublished observations. We conclude that the rat gelatinase A RE-1 element is the structural homolog of the human gelatinase A r2 enhancer element, and we propose that a common feature of these elements is the initial binding of AP2 to the double-stranded components, recruitment of YB-1 with DNA helical unwinding, and subsequent potential binding of additional single strand-specific transcription factors. The identification and molecular characterization of these additional single strand-specific transcription factors may be expected to provide further insights into the regulation of this element, which appears to play such a central role in the control of gelatinase A gene transcription. Cellular migration and invasion are fundamental aspects of many critical biological processes including development, angiogenesis, wound repair, and tumor metastasis. Whereas several distinctive proteolytic systems have been implicated in these processes, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 gene family, which currently includes 19 members, has been the focus of intense investigational scrutiny.

The 72-kDa gelatinase A (also denoted MMP-2) displays a number of features that distinguish it from other members of the MMP gene family.

This surface localization is presumably a major determinant of the ability of gelatinase A to act as a growth and differentiation factor for cellsin vitro (3Turck J. Pollock A.S. Lee L.K. Marti H.-P. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15074-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition to the unique pattern of surface expression and action as a growth and differentiation factor, the transcriptional regulation of gelatinase A is noteworthy. In contrast to other MMPs, the 5′-flanking region of this gene lacks TATA or CAAT boxes or functional AP-1- or NF-κB-binding sites (4Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol.

Although both the human and rat genes lack functional AP-1 or NF-κB elements, exposure of glomerular mesangial cells to phorbol ester, prostaglandin E2, or cAMP analogs resulted in enhanced gelatinase A transcription and synthesis, suggesting that a functional AP2 element may regulate the responses to these stimulatory factors (6Marti H.-P.

Recent studies from our laboratory, using the glomerular mesangial cell as a model cell capable of high level gelatinase A synthesis, have defined a potent 40-bp cis-acting response element (gelatinase A RE-1) in the near 5′-flanking region of the rat gelatinase A gene which, in conjunction with the proximal promoter, confers cell-specific transcriptional regulation (4Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To identify transacting factors, which may regulate gelatinase A transcription, we used the RE-1 as a probe in expression screening and identified the transcription factor YB-1 as a specific nuclear protein component that regulates RE-1 activity (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). YB-1 is a member of a family of highly conserved DNA-binding proteins that has been shown to regulate the transcription of several central growth or differentiation genes (9Ladomey M. Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 87: 9028-9032Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and its association with the transcriptional control of the growth regulatory enzyme, gelatinase A, is consistent with a postulated role for YB-1 as a key developmental transcription factor (9Ladomey M. Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although our transfection data indicated that YB-1 did mediate, through the RE-1, gelatinase A transactivation, further analysis of nuclear gel shift experiments suggested that additional transcriptional elements were involved. In this study we demonstrate that a second, differentiation-dependent transcription factor, AP2, can directly interact with YB-1 to induce a synergistic activation of RE-1 transcriptional activity. These effects of AP2/YB-1 are associated with DNA structural alteration, including induction of single-stranded DNA, which may provide a structural template for additional partner protein binding. DISCUSSIONThe studies outlined in this report extend our previous observations on the transcriptional control of the gelatinase A gene and the critical role of the 40-bp RE-1 enhancer element in this process. An expression screening strategy using this element as a probe yielded the transcriptional regulatory protein, YB-1, which is a major determinant of the transcriptional activities of several growth-related genes (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The strong preference of YB-1 for binding to single-stranded, as opposed to double-stranded, DNA, coupled with the complex patterns observed with nuclear extract gel shift analyses, strongly suggested that additional transcriptional factors associate with the RE-1. Given the fact that treatment of glomerular mesangial cells with phorbol ester, prostaglandin E2, or cAMP analogs induces gelatinase A transcription and synthesis (6Marti H.-P. McNeil L. Martin J. Davies M. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Zahner G. Harendza S. Muller E. Wolf G. Thaiss F. Stahl R.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1116-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we considered that AP2 was a likely candidate for this role. Inspection of the RE-1 sequence revealed the sequence, GCCTGCTGGG, which is homologous to the AP2 consensus sequence, GCCCN3GGC (16Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar).The ability of recombinant AP2 protein to bind to the RE-1 sequence was demonstrated by gel shift analyses and shown by DNA footprinting methodology to occur within the putative partial consensus sequence. Interestingly, this partial consensus sequence is contiguous with the incomplete Y box sequence which interacts with recombinant YB-1 protein (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whereas YB-1 alone has little affinity for the RE-1 element in the double-stranded form (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), addition of YB-1 to the AP2/oligonucleotide incubation mixture led to extensive complex formation consisting of AP2·YB-1 heteromeric complexes. These studies suggested that AP2, by interaction with the RE-1 element in the double-stranded form, facilitates subsequent YB-1 binding and heteromer formation. Experiments with an AP2 consensus sequence oligonucleotide lacking a Y box confirmed this impression. Whereas recombinant YB-1 protein had no detectable binding activity for this sequence in the double-stranded form, inclusion of AP2 resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of shifted oligonucleotide as compared with AP2 alone. Not only was complex formation facilitated, there was a dramatic increase in the half-life (i.e. stability) of these complexes. The physiological significance of these interactions was confirmed by the transfection experiments with the mutated AP2 consensus-binding site and by the increase in RE-1 transactivating function following exposure of mesangial cells to prostaglandin E2.The immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the interaction of AP2 with YB-1 is not dependent upon the presence of an appropriate oligonucleotide template, as we were able to recover AP2·YB-1 complexes from solution phase. That AP2 and YB-1 proteins are associated in the in vivo context was demonstrated by the sequential decreases in RE-1 electrophoretic mobility following sequential addition of anti-AP2 and YB-1 antibodies. Several recent reports have also demonstrated interactions of YB-1 with different partner proteins, including YY1, Pur-α, NF-κB/relA subunit, DNA-binding protein A, and cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (18Chen N.N.

Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 793-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most of these studies, YB-1 partnering was demonstrated by differences in binding affinities for the respective regulatory elements in gel shift analysis; a successful co-immunoprecipitation has only been reported for the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (23Zou Y. Evans S. Chen J. Kuo H.-C. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 793-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).DMS protection footprinting analyses of the RE-1 element probed with both YB-1 and AP2 were informative in that AP2 binding to the partial consensus sequence overlapped the YB-1-binding sites within the partial Y box sequence. Composite and competitive binding of AP2 and other transcription factors has been described for several promoters, including prothymosin-α, ornithine decarboxylase, and theAP2α genes (24Bauer R. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Kopp H. Moser M. Seegers S. Kerscher M. Tainsky M.A. Hofstaedter F. Buettner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Moser M.

Such a placement of transcriptional binding sites can facilitate either cooperative or competitive interactions and permit a finer level of transcriptional control than that achieved by binding of single factors to promoter elements (26Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 246: 1266-1272Crossref Scopus (1066) Google Scholar).The footprinting analysis of the AP2/YB-1 combination also revealed a more extensive protection of guanines at the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide sequence as compared with footprinting with AP2 alone. These studies suggest that following the AP2-facilitated binding of YB-1 to the RE-1 sequence, there may be assemblage of YB-1 multimers along the length of the element. The ability of high concentrations of YB-1 to form multimeric complexes on the single-stranded components of the RE-1 has been recently demonstrated (8Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).AP2/YB-1 binding to the RE-1 element induced pronounced changes in DNA structure. Single-stranded DNA was formed immediately distal to the AP2-binding site and extended to nearly the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide probe. It is conceivable that similar changes are of importance when cruciform DNA extrusions with intrastrand base pairing occur as they have been described for the cAMP response element of the human enkephalin gene promoter and the N4 virion RNA polymerase promoter (27Glucksmann-Kuis M.A. Dai X.

A. 1991; 88: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 3′ sequence of the RE-1 contains an inverted repeat sequence that may also participate in intrastrand base pairing. These major changes in DNA structure induced by the combination of AP2/YB-1 may help to explain the synergistic effects of the combination on the levels of RE-1-dependent transcription rates observed with HepG2 cells.The number of identified single strand-specific DNA-binding proteins involved in the regulation of transcription is steadily increasing and includes, among others, the far upstream element-binding proteins of the c-myc gene (31Davis-Smyth T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4875-4881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Major questions remain as to how these proteins, with specific single-stranded DNA recognition motifs, locate their cognate target sequences and how DNA melting and strand separation is mediated to permit access. In the current study, we propose a model whereby AP2 binding to the double strand RE-1 element permits subsequent attachment of the lower affinity YB-1 protein, which then mediates DNA helical separation. These effects could permit the recruitment of additional transactivating single strand binding factors to this region and thus converge the structural and functional data obtained in this study. In support of this concept, initial studies using Southwestern blot analysis and oligonucleotide affinity techniques have revealed a 17-kDa RE-1 single strand-specific DNA-binding protein in HepG2 nuclear extracts. 2P. R. Mertens and D. H. Lovett, unpublished observations. Our present studies with the rat gelatinase A promoter region and the identification of YB-1 and AP2 as important regulatory proteins represent a convergence with the analyses of the human gelatinase A promoter by Frisch and colleagues (34Frisch S.M.

These workers identified, within the context of the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line, a strong enhancer element (denoted r2) located approximately 1650 bp from the transcriptional start site, a location not dissimilar to the rat RE-1 found at−1322 bp. Gel shift analyses and DNA footprinting, as well as complex formation with the adenovirus E1A protein, all indicated a specific interaction of the r2 sequence with the AP2 protein. Alignments of the two respective elements demonstrate a significant degree of homology within the region of the partial AP2 consensus sequences, and gel shift analyses with recombinant YB-1 and the r2 element indicate that binding, particularly to the single-stranded component, does occur. 3P. R. Mertens, D. H. Lovett, and A. Jaume, unpublished observations. We conclude that the rat gelatinase A RE-1 element is the structural homolog of the human gelatinase A r2 enhancer element, and we propose that a common feature of these elements is the initial binding of AP2 to the double-stranded components, recruitment of YB-1 with DNA helical unwinding, and subsequent potential binding of additional single strand-specific transcription factors.

This intermediate is the product of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis, such that reciprocal regulation of synthesis and degradation is effected in liver. Malonyl-CoA is also the major physiological inhibitor of CPT-I in non-hepatic and non-lipogenic tissues, including heart (4Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J.

Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 8Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The major CPT-I enzymes encoded by these two genes have different kinetic properties, such that the differing relative expression levels among tissues are reflected in different tissue enzyme kinetic properties (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar,2McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We have recently described the coexpression of two novel CPT-Iβ mRNA splicing forms in human (8Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and rat (9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) tissues. These forms constitute only 5–25% of total tissue CPT-I mRNA, but encode enzymes that have altered malonyl-CoA regulatory domains. Thus, changes in fatty acid oxidation rates attributable to CPT-I could result from changes in the following: 1) substrate concentrations, 2) inhibitor (malonyl-CoA) concentration, 3) total α and/or β enzyme mass, 4) relative proportions of α and β enzymes, and 5) relative levels of malonyl-CoA-sensitive and -insensitive enzymes, and therefore through regulation at allosteric, transcriptional, or pre-mRNA splicing levels.There is a rapid increase in fatty acid oxidation in all tissues in the perinatal period, coincident with initiation of suckling (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 10Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol.

There is also regulation of this pathway in the adult animal, including profound up-regulation during catabolic conditions, when elevated circulating free fatty acid levels result from peripheral lipolysis (1McGarry J.D.

Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Regulation at a transcriptional level is suggested by parallel increases in fatty acid oxidative enzyme mRNAs in these circumstances (12Thumelin S. Esser V. Charvy D. Kolodziej M. Zammit V.A.

We show the existence of alternative human CPT-Iβ transcripts that arise from two closely approximated promoters that have tissue-specific or -preferred activities, each of which is alternatively spliced to generate the three previously identified isoforms β1, β2, and β3 (8Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Acis-acting element that confers fatty acid regulation of both transcripts is identified that binds and is activated by PPAR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers. Together with our previous findings, these results indicate that there is enzyme substrate-responsive regulated expression of alternative CPT-Iβ transcripts and alternative pre-mRNA splicing variants in tissues.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the human CPT-Iβ gene has two transcripts that generate mRNAs with differing 5′-untranslated regions. These transcripts show tissue-enriched or -specific expression, and each is alternatively spliced within the coding region. One transcript is present in heart and muscle (M), whereas the other is ubiquitously (U) expressed in tissues with high fatty acid oxidation rates. Fatty acids regulate production of both transcripts through activation of PPARα, which binds as a heterodimer with RXR on a FARE located in the proximal U promoter region. The physiological significance of this regulation is reflected in a robust increase in CPT-Iβ mRNA levels in rat tissues under catabolic conditions, when elevated circulating free fatty acids are presented as fuel and are available to activate gene expression.Both the CPT-Iβ U and M promoters are TATA-less. This is somewhat surprising, as this feature is more typical of “housekeeping” genes and those whose products are required early in development (37Nothias J.-Y. Majumder S. Kaneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22077-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The M promoter does have two proximal GC boxes that may facilitate transcription factor IID binding and RNA polymerase II activity (37Nothias J.-Y. Majumder S. Kaneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22077-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,38Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5814-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The location of the major U transcript TSS at −702 differs from that previously reported by Yamazaki et al. (39Yamazaki N. Ymamaka Y. Hashimoto Y. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), who suggested that it was located at −745 based on 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Although we saw no band consistent with this start site using primer extension, RPA did confirm this and other secondary start sites between −702 and −745. Alternative U transcript start sites are of interest because additional functional regulatory elements overlap or are contained within the −702 to −745 region. 4Y.-C. Lu, G.-S. Yu, and T. Gulick, submitted for publication. Furthermore, the FARE is located a mere 18–30 bases upstream of the −745 TSS, where it would be expected to interfere with the binding of polymerase II components. The existence of numerous proximal U promoter regulatory elements in the absence of a TATA box suggests that regulated activities of cognate factors may influence the precise locus of polymerase II binding as well as its activity.Although the U and M TSSs are closely approximated, the existence of mutually exclusive first exons, as well as preferential utilization among tissues, indicates that these are bona fidealternative promoters. Vigorous M promoter activity in muscle and heart, but not in liver and nonmuscle tissues, has two mechanistic explanations. First, muscle-specific factors may transactivatecis-acting elements that selectively control the M promoter. Alternatively, factors in nonmuscle cells may transrepress to eliminate M promoter activity. Candidate elements include GC boxes in the proximal M promoter, which may regulate gene expression through Sp1/Sp3 competition, for example (37Nothias J.-Y. Majumder S. Kaneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22077-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 40Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 6438-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, regardless of mechanism, the distinction of M and U promoters does not dictate that element(s) that specifically regulate M expression are necessarily located only in the region between the two TSSs. Pertinent to this is the existence of a conserved E box and a consensus myocyte enhancer factor-2 site in the proximal U promoter region of human and rat genes.4 The activity of the FARE indicates that that the converse also applies: a cis-acting element within the U promoter is capable of controlling both promoters. Differential regulation of CPT-Iβ M and U promoters by various transcription factors, functioning alone or through cooperative interactions, may ramify in altered CPT-I enzyme kinetics through preferential transcript splicing patterns (see below).We have recently described alternative mRNA splicing within the coding region of CPT-Iβ (8Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). β2 and β3 mRNAs are produced by cryptic splice donor utilization and/or exon skipping and encode enzymes that are deleted for a transmembrane domain or an adjacent region that is necessary for physiological allosteric regulation of CPT-I by malonyl-CoA (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 42Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).3 Because of precedent for differential splicing patterns of alternative transcripts (28Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), we investigated this possibility for this gene. Although we demonstrate that both the M and U transcripts are alternatively spliced, we cannot exclude the possibility that coding region alternative splicing is co-regulated with alternative promoter utilization or activity. However, even if this is true, the relative abundance of mRNAs containing M versus U exons and of β1 versusβ2 versus β3 mRNAs in heart, muscle, and liver (8Yu G.-S. Lu Y.-C. Gulick T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicates that alternative splicing is also independently regulated.During the preparation of this manuscript, Mascaro et al.(43Mascaro C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8560-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) reported regulation of the CPT-Iβ promoter by PPARα and PPARγ isoforms and cognate activators in cotransfected CV1 cells. These investigators mapped the identical FARE, but found less vigorous PPAR effects (3–4-fold) than we report here, possibly due to the different transfected cell type. Regulation of the alternative promoters was not addressed, and PPAR isoform-specific activators were evaluated rather than the ordinary dietary and endogenous fatty acids of our study. Although much recent attention has focused on high affinity isoform-specific PPAR ligands (19Yu K. Bayonna W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P. Ravera C.P. McMahon G. Brown M. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar), activities of oleate and palmitate at concentrations that are routinely achieved in the circulation suggest that the physiologically relevant activators of PPARα are these common fatty acids, regardless of the higher affinity of rare metabolites, as we have previously suggested (15Gulick T.

This point is underscored by the demonstrated efficacy of decanoic acid in activating PPARα on this FARE. Since medium-chain fatty acids make up a major component of milk, this implies a role for this factor in the observed up-regulation of CPT-I and other genes encoding fatty acid oxidative enzymes during suckling (12Thumelin S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar), and although the 5′-half-site (antisense AGGGAA) deviates from the consensus sequence, its flanking region is A/T-rich, consistent with the structure of other PPAR response elements (45Palmer C.N.

There are unique features of this element with respect to RXR and retinoid activities compared with other DR1 and complex elements, as exemplified by those of the ACO (35Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) and MCAD (15Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), both PPAR and RXR are cognate ligand-responsive, and the receptors function cooperatively. In the case of the CPT-Iβ FARE, despite cooperative binding of the receptors, overexpression of RXR attenuates PPAR and fatty acid responsiveness. Furthermore, the FARE is not activated by the RXR-specific ligand LG69 (36Boehm M.F. McClurg M.R. Pathirana C. Mangelsdorf D. White S.K. Hebert J. Winn D. Goldman M.E. Heyman R.A. J. Med.

Alternatively, overexpression of RXR may enable recruitment of a heterodimer partner that represses either constitutively or in the absence of cognate ligand (32Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Nature. 1995; 377: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Regardless of mechanism, our findings indicate that RXR may act in cells and in vivo as a ligand-independent repressor on the CPT-Iβ FARE, providing a mechanism to discriminate fatty acid- and retinoid-responsive expression of this gene.COUP transcription factors are widely expressed in tissues, where they compete with various nuclear receptors to modulate constitutive and hormone-regulated gene expression (25Carter M.E.

Our finding that COUPα represses transcription from the CPT-Iβ FARE is not surprising, as the DR1-type element is the preferred COUP homodimer-binding site and functional element (32Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar, 33Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This and other nuclear receptors that regulate DR1 elements (32Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar), each with differential and regulated tissue expression, are candidate influences on CPT-Iβ gene expression, and each has the potential to modulate the vitality of promoter activation in response to fatty acids. In particular, this may be reflected in COUP-mediated inhibition in developing tissues and undifferentiated cells or in pathophysiological states associated with retrogression in gene expression programs (33Tsai S.Y.

This also is true in liver, where our clear demonstration of regulated expression of CPT-Iβ contrasts with previous reports of exclusive CPT-Iα expression (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Of particular note, hepatic induction of CPT-Iβ2 mRNA with fasting may explain the recognized decrease in hepatic CPT-I sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition in catabolic states as well as the increase in V max (1McGarry J.D.

The derived amino acid sequence is unique and therefore represents a new regulator of Hsp70.

Environmental stresses such as elevated temperature are a physiological signal to the cell that increases the amount of a protein called Hsp70.1 This is a universal response that occurs in all eukaryotic cells and tissues studied to date (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular levels of Hsp70 help the cell survive stresses by binding to partially denatured proteins and assisting to refold these proteins into more stable native structures. Hsp70 is an ATP-binding protein and has ATPase activity. The ATP-bound form of the protein has a low affinity for substrate, whereas the ADP-bound form can bind substrate. Therefore regulation of the ATPase activity can affect the ability of Hsp70 to bind to and refold proteins. Studies have shown that there are other proteins that regulate Hsp70 activity, and therefore this system is more complex than initially described (2Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). One of these proteins, Hsp40, stimulates the ATPase of Hsp70 and therefore results in production of the ADP form of Hsp70 and facilitates binding to substrate (3Cry D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 4Silver P.A. Way J.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Another protein, Hip, prevents the dissociation of ADP from Hsp70 and thereby stabilizes binding to the substrate (5Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The protein named Hop acts as a modulator protein by binding to both Hsp70 and Hsp90 (6Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and both Hop and Hsp90 stimulate Hsp70-mediated refolding of a denatured protein. Other regulators of Hsp70 that inhibit Hsp70-mediated refolding include RAP/HAP46 which inhibits binding of misfolded proteins to Hsp70 (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and BAG-1 (8Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) which causes the release of ADP from Hsp70 (9Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Another potential regulator is a 16-kDa protein (p16) that is a member of the Nm23/nucleoside diphosphate kinase family (10Leung S.-M. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2607-2614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This protein monomerized Hsc70 (a protein closely related to Hsp70) and released Hsc70 from bound substrate. Finally, the cysteine string protein, which is a secretory vesicle protein (11Braun J.E.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), can both activate Hsc70 ATPase activity. The results presented in this paper identify and characterize a new Hsp70-binding protein called HspBP1 isolated from a heart cDNA library. This protein has a unique amino acid sequence and therefore does not show homology to other known sequences. HspBP1 inhibits binding of ATP to Hsp70 and Hsp40 activated Hsp70 ATPase resulting in an inhibition of this system to renature a denatured substrate. The two-hybrid system was used to screen for Hsp70-interacting proteins (14Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 15Bartel P.L. Chein C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartely D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). A portion of the cDNA for human Hsp70 (kindly provided by R. Morimoto, Northwestern University) coding for amino acids 1–351 was inserted into the yeast vector pAS2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and used as the “bait plasmid” for the two-hybrid screening procedures. The yeast transfected with this plasmid expressed human Hsp70 as determined by Western blot analysis. These yeasts would not grow on plates lacking histidine and were negative for β-galactosidase activity, indicating that Hsp70 alone cannot activate the reporter genes and therefore will not result in false positives. A human heart cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) containing 3 × 106 independent clones was screened. This library was made in the pGAD10 cloning vector that had cDNAs fused to the activation domain of the GAL4transcription activator. Methods for screening of the library were according to the manual provided by CLONTECH. Clones that lacked the DNA-binding domain/target plasmid but retained the activation domain/library plasmid were isolated using cycloheximide selection (Matchmaker Supplement Kit, CLONTECH). The candidate Leu+, Trp− clones were then mated to Y187 (MATα) yeast strains carrying different test plasmids. Diploids from the mating were selected (Trp+, Leu+, and His+) and screened for the ability to produce β-galactosidase. Lung adenocarcinoma cells (number 3263) were kindly provided by the University of Arizona Cancer Center Cell Culture Core Facility. A cell pellet (approximately 100 μl) was frozen and thawed, suspended in an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was used for further analysis. Plasmids were sequenced in both directions by the Laboratory of Molecular Systematics and Evolution at the University of Arizona. Oligonucleotides for sequencing were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). A Northern blot of human tissue mRNAs was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and probed according to the procedure supplied by CLONTECH using ExpressHyb hybridization solution. HspBP1 from nucleotides 457–1000, Hsp70 (16Hunt C. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) from nucleotides 841–1765, and Hsp40 (17Raabe T. Manley J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) from nucleotides 582–1043 were labeled and used as probes. The cDNA for the ATP-binding domain of Hsp70 (amino acids 1–351) was inserted into the expression vector pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) minus the His-tag and expressed in bacteria. The protein was purified by solubilizing inclusion bodies in 6 m guanidine HCl in binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) followed by dialysis against binding buffer. The cDNA for HspBP1 was inserted into pET28a and expressed as a fusion protein containing the His-tag. Mutagenesis by polymerase chain reaction was performed in pAS2 to create an NdeI site at the translation initiation region. The mutagenized fragment was subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Next, the original HspBP1 insert was removed from pAS2 by cutting with EcoRI and subcloning into the EcoRI site of pET28a. This was cut with NdeI and KpnI, and this region was removed and replaced by the mutated fragment removed by digestion withNdeI and KpnI from the TA vector. The protein was purified over a His·Bind affinity resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's procedure with the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 to all buffers except the elution buffer. To insert HspBP1 cDNA into the proper vector for coupled transcription/translation, the cDNA for HspBP1 was subcloned into pET5a using the NdeI and EcoRI sites, and coupled transcription/translation was done using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HspBP1 was prepared as described above and further purified by separation on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the band was removed by electroelution. This preparation was used for antibody production. Antibodies were produced in rabbits by Animal Pharm Services, Inc. (Healdsburg, CA). Specific antibodies were purified from serum by initial affinity purification of IgG using a protein A column followed by an HspBP1 affinity column to purify specific antibodies. SDS sample buffer was added to the lung adenocarcinoma cell lysate and the transcription/translation product. All samples were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed on a 12.5% SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The blot was blocked by incubation with Tris/saline (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 5% nonfat milk. Blots were then incubated with anti-HspBP1 antibody or preimmune IgG (0.1 μg/ml) overnight. Detection of antibody binding was performed using SuperSignal ULTRA (Pierce). The ATP-binding domain of Hsp70 (amino acids 1–351) was inserted into the expression vector pET28a (minus the His-tag), expressed in bacteria, and purified by isolation of inclusion bodies. The truncated Hsp70 was incubated with or without the His-tagged HspBP1. These solutions were then incubated with a Ni2+ affinity resin that binds the His-tagged HspBP1 and any associated proteins. HspBP1 alone or Hsp70-(1–351) alone were also incubated with the resin. The resin was centrifuged and washed several times with wash buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 1m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, and analyzed by Western blotting with both anti-His6 antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and anti-Hsp70 antibody (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Binding to proteins in a total homogenate was done by first binding His-tagged HspBP1 to the Ni2+ affinity resin. A crude homogenate of bovine heart was prepared and incubated with the resin for 15 min at 30 °C. The resin was centrifuged, and the pellets were saved. The resin was then rinsed several times with wash buffer, and proteins were eluted by incubation with 1 m imidazole buffer as above. The eluted proteins were analyzed by separation on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and stained with Coomassie Blue or Western blotted and probed with both anti-Hsp70 antibody and anti-His6 antibody. ATPase assays were performed in 20 μm α-35S-ATP (0.631 mCi/μm), 4 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm KCl, 0.45 mm magnesium acetate, and 80 μm dithiothreitol. Human recombinant Hsp70 (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), HspBP1, and Hsp40 (kindly provided by Dr. E. Vierling, University of Arizona) were added at the indicated amounts. Assays were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots (1 μl) were removed at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min, spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose paper (J. T. Baker, Inc.), and developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl to separate ATP and ADP. Radioactivity was quantitated on a Packard Instant Imager (Meriden, CT). ATP binding was determined after 10 min; samples were removed (10 μl), and unbound nucleotides were removed using spin columns (ProbeQuant G-50, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound nucleotides were processed as described above to separate ATP from ADP. Assays to measure the renaturation of luciferase in rabbit reticulocyte were done following the procedure of Schumacher et al. (18Schumaker R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Luciferase (Sigma) at 100 nm was dissolved in 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% Triton X-100. The protein was denatured by heating at 40 °C for 15 min and then placed on ice. The enzyme was then diluted 10-fold by addition to rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares, Oregon, WI) containing an ATP regeneration system and incubated at 25 °C for 90 min. Samples (5 μl) were removed and assayed for luciferase activity by addition to 120 μl of 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 8 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μmd-luciferin, 240 μm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm ATP. Light production was measured in a Turner luminometer for 15 s. Renaturation of recombinant firefly luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a defined system was performed following the procedure of Johnsonet al. (6Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Luciferase was diluted to 100 nminto the above buffer and denatured by heating at 40 °C for 8 min and then placed on ice. The enzyme was then diluted 10-fold into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol containing 800 nm human recombinant hsp70, 140 nm human recombinant Hsp90α (StressGen, Victoria, BC), 160 nmHsp40, and an ATP-regenerating system and incubated at 25 °C for 4 h. Samples were assayed as above.

Isoelectric point and molecular weight determinations were done using the ExPASy molecular biology server at the Geneva University Hospital and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer Zhang Z.Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 3389-3402Crossref Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). A human heart cDNA library was screened, and three colonies were isolated that grew on the trp−, leu−, and his− (triple minus) plates and were positive for β-galactosidase activity. Yeasts containing the isolated library plasmids were mated to yeast containing the cDNA for the truncated Hsp70, and once again these colonies grew on the triple minus plates and were positive for β-galactosidase activity. Mating of yeast containing the library plasmids with other controls (plasmid with no insert, plasmid with an insert other than Hsp70) did not produce colonies when grown on triple minus plates, indicating that the interaction is specific for Hsp70 and the library plasmids. The cDNA insert sizes were 1.5, 1.6, and 1.6 kilobases. Nucleotide sequencing revealed open reading frames that code for proteins of approximately 40 kDa. Two of the clones were identical (HspBP2), and the third (HspBP1) differed in the coding region by having codons for 6 consecutive glycines, whereas HspBP2 had codons for 9 glycines. HspBP2 also had two polyadenylation signals, whereas HspBP1 had only the first polyadenylation signal. All results reported in this paper were done with HspBP1 (Fig. 1). The sequence 5′ to the initiation codon did not contain a termination codon; therefore, it was possible the coding region was not complete. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify products from the plasmid library using a primer for a sequence 3′ to the codons for the glycines and a primer in the flanking pGAD10 vectors. These experiments extended the sequence 53 bases to the 5′-end (underlined sequence in Fig. 1). This sequence lacked initiation codons in any reading frame but did contain a stop codon in the same reading frame as the open reading frame for the protein. Therefore, the first ATG after the stop codon has been assigned as the initiation codon. The calculated pI for the protein is 5.13, and the calculated molecular weight is 39,302. Both the nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences were used to search GenBankTM, and no matches to known genes or proteins were found. However, when searching the GenBankTM EST data base with the programs blast (19Karlin S. Altschul S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 3389-3402Crossref Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), a number of significant matches were found in human, mouse, and rat sequences. None of these sequences were for known proteins. The protein sequence was also analyzed for domain characteristics using a number of different programs, and no similarities were found. A polyclonal antibody against HspBP1 was prepared and used to detect HspBP1 in cell homogenates by Western blots (Fig. 2). The cDNA for HspBP1 was transcribed and translated in vitro, and this protein product was compared with the protein detected in cells. The recombinant HspBP1 has a slightly higher molecular weight due to additional amino acids including the His tag (not shown). The in vitro transcribed and translated product (lane 2) is the same size as the protein found in the cells (lane 1) confirming that the cDNA contains the entire protein coding region. A fragment of Hsp70 (amino acids 1–351) identical to the ATPase domain that was used in screening the yeast library was expressed in bacteria and purified. The fragment bound to a Ni2+ affinity column in the presence of His-tagged HspBP1 (Fig. 3, lane 3) providing further evidence for an interaction between HspBP1 and the ATPase domain of Hsp70. The fragment was not retained on the column in the absence of HspBP1 (Fig. 3, lane 2). In a second set of experiments, His-tagged HspBP1 was first bound to the Ni2+ affinity resin, and binding to proteins in a homogenate of bovine heart was determined. Western blotting revealed a strong immunoreactive band for Hsp70 that was eluted from the resin when HspBP1 was first bound (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). This band was absent if HspBP1 was not bound to the resin first (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). Further analysis on a lower percentage gel resolved the Hsp70 into two bands (not shown), which is consistent with both Hsp70 and Hsc70 binding to HspBP1. An additional immunoreactive band larger than Hsp70 is eluted in the presence or absence of HspBP1. This protein binds to the resin nonspecifically and reacts with the anti-Hsp70 antibody and could not be detected by protein staining (Fig. 4 A). Protein staining revealed both the eluted HspBP1 (Fig. 4 A, lower arrow) and Hsp70 (upper arrow). Additional bands are present above Hsp70 and below HspBP1 and are eluted in the presence or absence of HspBP1.Figure 4HspBP1 binding to Hsp70 in a tissue homogenate. His-tagged HspBP1 was first bound to Ni2+affinity resin. A crude homogenate of bovine heart was prepared and incubated with the resin for 15 min at 30 °C. The resin was centrifuged, and the supernatants were saved. The resin was then rinsed several times with buffer, and proteins were eluted by incubation with 1 m imidazole buffer. The eluted proteins were analyzed by separation on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and stained with Coomassie Blue (A) or Western blotted and probed with both anti-Hsp70 antibody and anti-His6 antibody (B).Lane 1 contains proteins eluted from resin without HspBP1 bound, and lane 2 contains proteins eluted from resin with HspBP1 bound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A Northern blot of human tissues (Fig. 5) was probed with a region of HspBP1 cDNA (Fig. 5 A), Hsp70 cDNA (Fig. 5 B), and Hsp40 cDNA (Fig. 5 C). Heart and skeletal muscle contain the highest amounts of HspBP1 mRNA. These two tissues also exhibit relatively high levels of Hsp70 and Hsp40 mRNAs. However, there is not a consistent correlation between the amount of HspBP1, Hsp70, and Hsp40 mRNAs in the other tissues. These results suggest that there is a tissue-specific expression of HspBP1, and this expression is not dependent on the amount of Hsp70 or Hsp40 mRNA. In all tissues the size of the HspBP1 mRNA is approximately 1.7 kilobase pairs. The next series of experiments was conducted to determine the effect of HspBP1 on Hsp70 enzymatic activity. HspBP1 had a slight stimulatory effect on the Hsp70 ATPase activity in the absence of Hsp40 (Fig. 6 A), but this is due to the low ATPase activity found in the HspBP1 preparations (Fig. 6 B). This is most likely a contaminant that varies in different preparations. The Hsp70 ATPase could be stimulated by Hsp40 (Fig. 6, A and B), and this increase in activity was inhibited by HspBP1 (Fig. 6 B). The ATPase activities for Hsp70 and HspBP1 alone were subtracted from the activity of Hsp70 + Hsp40 + HspBP1 to determine the effect on the Hsp40-stimulated activity (Fig. 6 C). These data clearly indicate that HspBP1 inhibits the Hsp40 stimulation of Hsp70 activity. The effect of HspBP1 on nucleotide binding to Hsp70 under steady-state conditions was next examined to explore the mechanism by which HspBP1 inhibits Hsp70 ATPase. In the absence of Hsp40, the majority of nucleotide bound to Hsp70 is in the form of ATP which is consistent with an unstimulated ATPase activity (Fig. 7). HspBP1 inhibited nucleotide binding by approximately 30%, and this was due to a decrease in ATP binding. In the presence of Hsp40, the total amount of nucleotide binding doubles, and the ratio of ADP to ATP increases, consistent with a stimulation of ATPase activity, the production of ADP, and ATP turnover. In the presence of HspBP1 and Hsp40, the amount of total nucleotide bound decreased to half the amount, and this is due to a decrease in both ATP and ADP bound. These results are consistent with a decrease in ATP binding which would decrease the amount of nucleotide available for hydrolysis and therefore result in a decrease in ADP bound. We conclude from these experiments that the inhibition in Hsp70 ATPase activity by HspBP1 is due to a decrease in ATP binding. The ADP form of Hsp70 binds substrate whereas the ATP form cannot; therefore, a decrease in ATP binding and an inhibition of Hsp40-stimulated ATPase suggest that HspBP1 could inhibit the ability of Hsp70 to renature a substrate. Reticulocyte lysate contains the necessary components including Hsp70 for renaturation of denatured firefly luciferase (18Schumaker R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The effect of HspBP1 on Hsp70-dependent protein renaturation was analyzed using this system. Experiments were done with varying concentrations of HspBP1 and measuring the amount of luciferase renatured after 90 min (Fig. 8 A). HspBP1 inhibited renaturation of luciferase with a half-maximal inhibition at 2 μm. The reticulocyte lysate is an undefined system containing many unknown proteins; therefore, similar refolding experiments were done in a defined system as described by Johnsonet al. (6Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the defined system HspBP1 again inhibited renaturation of luciferase is a dose-dependent manner with a similar half-maximal inhibition concentration (Fig. 8 B). Maximum inhibition was approximately 50%, whereas in the reticulocyte lysate inhibition was over 90%. These experiments were done with different sources of luciferase, and this may explain the difference. These data indicate a relatively tight interaction of HspBP1 with Hsp70. As a comparison, the dissociation constant for auxilin (an activator of Hsc70 ATPase activity) with Hsc70 was determined to be 0.6 μm (13Jiang R.-F. Greener T. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, numerous proteins have been identified as regulators of Hsp70-mediated renaturation of misfolded proteins indicating that this is a complex system that is far from clearly defined. The findings reported in this paper increase this complexity by the addition of another protein (HspBP1) that may have potential in vivoregulatory properties of Hsp70. Proper functioning of Hsp70 as a protein chaperone is dependent on its bound nucleotide state. The ATP form of the protein binds substrate very poorly and therefore must be converted to the ADP form before the misfolded protein can bind. This conversion is catalyzed by another heat stress protein named Hsp40. As reported here, HspBP1 inhibits the Hsp40-stimulated Hsp70 ATPase by inhibiting ATP binding, therefore blocking the production of ADP. The end result is the inhibition of Hsp70-mediated refolding as seen in the HspBP1 inhibition of renaturation of denatured luciferase in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in a defined system. Other regulators of Hsp70 activity affect ADP binding. Hip stimulates the renaturation of a denatured substrate by decreasing the release of ADP, whereas BAG-1 inhibits Hsp70 activity by increasing the release of ADP (5Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 9Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The Northern blot analysis indicates that heart and skeletal muscle contain the highest amounts of HspBP1 mRNA. It is not known if this reflects the relative amounts of the protein in these tissues. A high amount in heart muscle does pose some interesting speculation as to the function in this tissue. Recent studies in Xenopus have reported that the heart is the most thermal-sensitive of the organs examined with respect to activation of heat shock transcription factor binding and an increase in Hsp70 mRNA and protein levels (23Ali A. Fernando A.A. Smith P. Ovsenek W.L. Lepock N. Heikkila J.J Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HspBP1 may bind to the endogenous Hsp70 rendering it inactive and thereby causing a feedback mechanism whereby the cell senses a lower amount of active Hsp70 and results in an increased Hsp70 expression. Through this mechanism the heart would have lower levels of active Hsp70, and therefore a lower amount of stress would be required to activate synthesis of more Hsp70. The experiments reported here indicate that HspBP1 may regulate Hsp70-mediated refolding of denatured proteins; however, it remains to be seen if this is the in vivo function. It is possible that HspBP1 may be involved in other Hsp70-regulated activities such as apoptosis via the stress-activated protein kinase pathway. For instance, cell death caused by tumor necrosis factor can be prevented by overproduction of Hsp70 (24Jaatela M. Wissing D. Bauer P.A. Li G.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3507-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Recently, Gabai et al. (25Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Rits S. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18033-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that Hsp70 can inhibit the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase and thereby inhibit phosphorylation of c-JUN by JNK, resulting in an inhibition of apoptosis via this pathway. Further down this pathway, Hsp70 has been shown to inhibit the processing of caspase-3 from the inactive pro-caspase (26Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bouget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) and thereby inhibit the proteolytic activity of this enzyme and cell death. These, then, are potential parts of the pathway that may be regulated by HspBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2065425035,It is shown that lagged correlations for and cross-correlations between observed hemispheric-mean temperature data differ markedly from those for unforced (control-run) climate model simulations. The differences can be explained adequately by assuming that the observed data contain a significant externally forced component involving both natural (solar) and anthropogenic influences and that the global climate sensitivity is in the commonly accepted range. Solar forcing alone cannot reconcile the differences in autocorrelation structure between observations and model control-run data.

P., and Malbon C. C. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 25305–25308). In the present work, the counter-regulatory action of insulin on catecholamine action is shown to stimulate enhanced sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptors in either DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing β2-adrenergic receptors. Both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulate internalization of β-adrenergic receptors, contributing to the counter-regulatory effects of these growth factors on catecholamine action. In combination with β-adrenergic agonists, insulin stimulates internalization of 50–60% of the complement of β-adrenergic receptors. Insulin administration in vitroand in vivo stimulates phosphorylation of Tyr-350 of the β-adrenergic receptor, creating an Src homology 2 domain available for binding of the adaptor molecule Grb2. The association of Grb2 with β-adrenergic receptors was established using antibodies to Grb2 as well as a Grb2-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Insulin treatment of cells provokes binding of Grb2 to β2-adrenergic receptors. Insulin also stimulates association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and dynamin, via the Src homology 3 domain of Grb2. Both these interactions as well as internalization of the β-adrenergic receptor are shown to be enhanced by insulin, β-agonist, or both. The Tyr-350 → Phe mutant form of the β2-adrenergic receptor, lacking the site for tyrosine phosphorylation, fails to bind Grb2 in response to insulin, fails to display internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor in response to insulin, and is no longer subject to the counter-regulatory effects of insulin on cyclic AMP accumulation. These data are the first to demonstrate the ability of a growth factor insulin to counter-regulate G-protein-linked receptor, the β-adrenergic receptor, via a new mechanism, i.e. internalization. G-protein-linked receptors, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor, are substrates for growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Karoor, V., Baltensperger, K., Paul, H., Czech, M.

For the insulin pathway, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase binds the IRS-1 via SH2 domain(s), activating the catalytic p110 subunit, which phosphorylates various phosphoinositides at the 3′-position of the inositol ring (12Backer J.

We explored to what extent, if any, does internalization of β2ARs represent a counter-regulatory effect of insulin.

Cell Signalling. 1998; 10: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we investigated if insulin treatment alters the level of β2AR sequestration from the cell membrane as does β-adrenergic agonist (2Hausdorff W.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of DDT1MF-2 hamster smooth muscle cells in culture with isoproterenol promotes an ∼40% decline in the amount of receptor accessible by the hydrophilic [3H]CGP-12177 radioligand. Notably, treatment with insulin promoted a significant, but lesser internalization of the β2ARs (Fig. 1). IGF-1, which also counter-regulates β2AR-mediated response (3Hadcock J.R. Port J.D.

In the presence of either insulin or IGF-1, the internalization of β2AR in response to isoproterenol was increased. Stimulation by insulin and isoproterenol in combination promoted internalization of more than 55% of the β2ARs. These observations derived from studies with DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells were explored in CHO cells stably transfected to express wild-type β2ARs (Fig. 1). The data from multiple experiments from both the DDT1MF-2 cells and CHO β2AR-expressing cells were in good agreement, demonstrating that this growth factor-stimulated internalization of β2ARs is not unique to the smooth muscle cells. The functional read-out of insulin action on cyclic AMP accumulation in response to stimulation by β-adrenergic agonist was measured in the DDT1MF-2 cells challenged with isoproterenol in the absence and presence of insulin (Fig. 2). The time course for isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation was rapid, peaking at ∼3 min. As noted earlier (3Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Thus, insulin both counter-regulated β-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation (Fig. 2) and stimulated internalization of the β2ARs (Fig. 1). Upon tyrosine kinase receptor-catalyzed phosphorylation (3Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Tyr-350 residue located in the cytoplasmic, C-terminal tail of the β2AR creates an SH2 recognition domain capable of binding the adaptor protein Grb2 (4Karoor V.

The similarity of theM r of Grb2 to that of the light chains of the IgG precluded detection of Grb2 by immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates of whole-cell extracts performed with antibodies to β2ARs. As an alternative strategy to probing the possible direct association of Grb2 to β2ARs in the counter-regulatory actions of insulin, whole-cell extracts were subjected to immuneprecipitations with anti-Grb2 antibodies first or treated with insoluble beads to which a GST fusion protein (GST-Grb2) was immobilized. Immunoprecipitations performed with anti-Grb2 antibodies were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotting with antibodies specific for β2AR (Fig. 3). A time course of insulin action on Grb2 binding to β2ARs was established. Shown in Fig. 3are representative examples of blots from two time courses in which immunoprecipitates with anti-Grb2 antibodies were performed with extracts of cells challenged with insulin for 1–40 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained subsequently with antibodies to β2ARs. Both trials reveal Grb2 binding to β2ARs in the whole-cell extracts from untreated, control cells. Insulin treatment of the cells leads to an increase in the amount of β2ARs associated with Grb2, peaking at ∼5 min after challenge with insulin and declining thereafter. Association of β2ARs with Grb2 was probed further using a complementary approach, i.e. challenging cells with either insulin or agonist (or both) and treating extracts prepared from these cells with a GST-Grb2 fusion protein immobilized to insoluble beads. Binding of β2ARs to the Grb2 was detected in immunoblots of the proteins bound to the immobilized Grb2 stained with anti-β2AR antibodies (Fig. 4); these data are in good agreement with the data obtained with immunoprecipitates performed with anti-Grb2 antibodies (Fig. 3). The amount of β2AR associated with the GST-Grb2 fusion protein was quantified from several separate experiments and, as displayed in Fig. 4, was found to increase by more than 2-fold in extracts from those cells challenged with insulin. Isoproterenol, in contrast, stimulates only a small and variable increase in the amount of β2AR-Grb2 binding. Challenge with isoproterenol and insulin, in combination, provokes an increase in the amount of β2ARs associating with GST-Grb2 similar to that obtained with insulin alone. These data extend earlier studies on the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of β2ARs in insulin action (3Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

T-lymphocyte activation requires the coordination of a large complex of proteins collectively termed the T-cell receptor (TCR)1. Within the TCR, activation of p56lck, a lymphocyte-specific member of the Src family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, is necessary for initiation of signal transduction. By binding to the cytosolic domains of CD4 and CD8α, p56lck is placed in close proximity to its downstream substrates, CD3, TCR ζ chain, and Zap70. They, in turn, activate subsequent signaling events (6Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Given the strongly reducing environment in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between CD4 and p56lck is unlikely (11Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Treatment of cell lysates with iodoacetamide, a reagent that alkylates free cysteines, prevents binding of p56lck to the cytosolic domain of CD4. This finding suggests that the cysteines involved in association remain reduced in the CD4·p56lckcomplex and raises the possibility of a metal ion stabilizing the complex (10Shaw A.S. Chalupny J.

Harrison S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18729-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) co-expressed in Escherichia coli a fusion protein consisting of maltose-binding protein fused to the CD4 cytoplasmic domain and a portion of the N terminus of p56lck; the resulting 1:1 molar complex contained one atom of zinc and formation of the complex required cysteine residues both in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain and the N terminus of p56lck.Here, we show that Zn2+ is essential for CD4·p56lck complex formation, both in cell-free binding assays and in live cells. In addition, we present evidence showing that formation of a CD8α·p56lck complex is similarly dependent on Zn2+.RESULTSFig. 1 A shows the results of an in vitro binding reaction, demonstrating that indeed Zn2+ mediates the association of the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 and p56lck in a concentration-dependent manner. Recombinant GST fused to the cytoplasmic domain of murine CD4 was produced and purified fromEscherichia coli followed by immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose. As detected by immunoblotting with an anti-p56lck antibody, association of purified bovine p56lck with GST-CD4 depends upon the presence of 100 μm ZnCl2. At this ZnCl2 concentration, almost 100% of the introduced p56lck becomes bound to GST-CD4. The detected p56lck band is not a contaminant of the GST-CD4 preparation as no binding is seen in the absence of p56lck, and GST alone does not bind p56lck. Furthermore, other metals tested at 100 μm, including Ca2+, Ni2+, Cu+, Cu2+, and Fe2+, do not support complex formation (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that association of CD4 with p56lck specifically requires zinc.Consistent with previous findings, our in vitro binding reaction recapitulates the critical role in association played by the four conserved cysteines. In particular, Fig. 2 A shows that immobilized GST-CD4 binds murine p56lck expressed in lysates of transfected COS cells, but fails to interact with a mutant p56lck in which the two essential cysteines, implicated in binding to CD4 and CD8α, were mutated to serine. Additionally, mutants of the CD4 cytoplasmic domain in which either one or both conserved cysteines were changed to alanine lose significant binding to p56lck (Fig. 2 B). Nevertheless, all mutants exhibited some residual binding. Furthermore, the presence of 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the binding reaction had no effect on formation of a CD4·p56lck complex (data not shown), consistent with the notion that the cysteines necessary for association are reduced within the formed complex.Figure 2Association of p56 lck with GST-CD4 requires two conserved cysteine residues in the cytosolic domain of CD4 and two in the amino terminus of p56 lck . A, interaction of p56lck expressed in COS-7 cells with GST-CD4. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either murine p56lck in pXM-139 or p56lck (C20/23S) in pcDNA3.1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed; in the indicated sample, 5 mm1,10-O-phenanthroline was added. After centrifugation at 4 °C, the cleared lysates were incubated with 15 μg of immobilized GST-CD4 overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed and assayed for bound p56lck. B, interaction of p56lck with cysteine mutants of GST-CD4. In 500 μl of TBS-GT containing 100 μm ZnCl2, 1 μg of p56lck was incubated with 15 μg of GST, GST-CD4, GST-CD4 (C418A, C420A), GST-CD4 (418A), or GST-CD4 (C420A) for 8 h at 4 °C. Samples were processed and assayed for bound p56lck as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Moreover, the presence of Zn2+ chelators both prevents complex formation as well as disrupts preformed ones. As shown in Fig. 2 A, GST-CD4·p56lck complex formation is blocked by addition of the zinc chelator 1,10-O-phenanthroline to COS cell lysates expressing wild-type p56lck. Furthermore, preformed CD4·p56lck complexes are disassociated by similar treatment. In the study in Fig. 3 A, GST-CD4·p56lck complexes were formed and then treated with the zinc chelators 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid or 1,10-O-phenanthroline or a nonchelating analog, 1,7-phenanthroline. Only 1,10-O-phenanthroline and 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid disassociated preformed CD4·p56lck dimers. These findings suggest that removal of Zn2+ disrupts CD4·p56lck complexes; disruption cannot be attributed to nonchelating properties of 1,10-O-phenanthroline such as its hydrophobicity, a characteristic shared with 1,7-phenanthroline (17Auld D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus Zn2+ is required for CD4·p56lckinteraction, and its removal from the complex results in their dissociation.Figure 3Interaction of CD4 and p56 lck is disrupted by zinc chelators. A, zinc chelators disrupt preformed GST-CD4·p56lck complexes. As described in Fig. 1 A, GST-CD4·p56lck complexes were formed at 100 μm ZnCl2. After washing three times with TBS-GT, bound complexes were resuspended in 500 μl of TBS-GT alone, with 5 mm 1,7-phenanthroline, with 5 mm 1,10-O-phenanthroline, or with 5 mm 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. After a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, samples were washed three times with TBS-GT and once with TBS. Samples were washed and assayed for bound p56lck as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, membrane-permeable zinc chelators disrupt p56lck·CD4 complexes in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 alone or with either 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmTPEN, 5 mm 1,7-phenanthroline, or 5 mm1,10-O-phenanthroline. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, recovered by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and recovered once more prior to lysis. Of the cleared lysates, 200 μl was immunoprecipitated with an anti-human p56lckpolyclonal antibody, and the remaining 800 μl was immunoprecipitated with an anti-human CD4 polyclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitations and subsequent anti-p56lck immunoblotting were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3 B shows that, in signaling lymphoid cells, CD4·p56lck complexes are disrupted by addition of the membrane-permeable zinc chelators TPEN and 1,10-O-phenanthroline. Importantly, 1,7-phenanthroline, a nonchelating analog, or EDTA, a membrane-impermeable chelator, has no effect on CD4·p56lck complexes. Specifically, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation with CD4, treatment of live Jurkat cells with TPEN or 1,10-O-phenanthroline eliminated binding of p56lck to CD4. However, 1,7-phenanthroline or EDTA exhibited no such effect. The total amount of p56lck in the cell was unaffected by any of the treatments, as shown by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-p56lck antibodies. We have obtained the same results with murine p56lck and CD4 co-transfected in COS cells (data not shown). Thus, both in vitro and in live cells, zinc chelators disrupt association of CD4 with p56lck, presumably by chelating an essential Zn2+ ion present in the complex.The cytosolic domains of the T-cell CD8α and CD4 co-receptors possess a homologous pair of cysteine residues, suggesting that they dimerize with p56lck in a similar manner. Indeed, in COS cells transiently transfected with CD8α and p56lck, p56lck binds to CD8α, and this interaction is disrupted by 1,10-O-phenanthroline, but not 1,7-phenanthroline (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, CD8α does not associate with the mutant p56lck (C20/23S) lacking the two cysteines essential for interaction with CD4 (Fig. 4 A). This control also establishes that CD8α·p56lck interactions cannot be attributed to nonspecific aggregations that are often associated with protein overexpression.Figure 4CD8α·p56 lck interaction is zinc-dependent. A, treatment of COS cells co-expressing CD8a and p56lck with 1,10-O-phenanthroline disrupts their association. COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with CD8α (Lyt2a) in pcDNA3.1 and either murine p56lck in pXM-139 (A. Veillette, R. L. Lin, C. Rodriguez, and H. F. Lodish, unpublished data) or murine p56lck(C20/23S) in pCDNA3.1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone or with either 5 mm 1,7-phenanthroline or 5 mm1,10-O-phenanthroline for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed once in PBS and lysed. Half of the lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-mouse CD8α polyclonal antibody (14Sarmiento M. Glasebrook A.L. Fitch F.W. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2665-2672PubMed Google Scholar) and half with an anti-human p56lck polyclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, association in vitro of GST-CD8α with p56lck requires zinc. GST-CD8α and GST were produced and isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding was performed in the same fashion as with GST-CD4 with the exception that at 1 mm ZnCl2, we readjusted the pH of the buffer with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Theright most lane is a control containing 1 μg p56lck. Samples were processed and assayed for bound p56lck as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As with that of CD4, the cytosolic domain of CD8α also associates with p56lck in vitro but requires a 10-fold higher ZnCl2 concentration to support binding, 1 mm versus 100 μm (Fig. 4 B). At the same concentration, other metals such as Cu2+, Ca2+, and Co2+ do not support binding (data not shown).DISCUSSIONOur work builds on previous studies implicating a role for Zn2+ or another metal ion in mediating an interaction between the short cytoplasmic domains of CD4 and CD8α with p56lck. First, the cytoplasmic domains of CD4 and CD8α and the N-terminal region of p56lckeach contain a pair of cysteines that are essential for CD4·p56lck and CD8α·p56lck interactions (1Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 2Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl.

Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Second, alkylating agents that inactivate free cysteine sulfhydryl groups destroy CD4·p56lck interactions (10Shaw A.S. Chalupny J. Whitney J.A. Hammond C. Amrein K.E. Kavathas P. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Third, Huse et al. (5Huse M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18729-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) identified a 1:1 molar complex of the CD4 cytoplasmic domain and a portion of the N terminus of p56lck when these were co-expressed in E. coli. Complex formation required cysteine residues both in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain and the N terminus of p56lck, and each protein complex contained one atom of zinc. However, Huseet al. (5Huse M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18729-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were unable to assemble the CD4·p56lck complex in vitro and thus were unable to determine whether zinc or another metal is required for complex formation. 3S. Harrison, personal communication. Here, we show that formation of a complex—presumably a dimer—of the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 and the complete p56lck protein specifically requires the presence of zinc. We first developed an in vitro binding assay which recapitulates the critical role in association played by the two cysteines in CD4 and two at the N terminus of p56lck. Only Zn2+, and none of the other metals tested, Ca2+, Ni2+, Cu+, Cu2+, and Fe2+, supported CD4·p56lck association. Moreover, Zn2+ chelators both prevent association as well as disrupt preexisting CD4·p56lck complexes. Likewise, in live signaling cells, membrane-permeable zinc chelators dissociate CD4·p56lck complexes, presumably by removing zinc. In conjunction with Huse et al. (5Huse M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18729-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), our data firmly establish a role for Zn2+ in mediating CD4·p56lck association through the coordination of two cysteines in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain and two in the N terminus of p56lck.The N terminus of p56lck contains a strikingly high density of acidic, negatively charged residues, whereas the cytoplasmic domains of both CD4 and CD8α contain a high density of basic residues. This charge complementarity (18Vega M.A. Kuo M.C. Carrera A.C. Strominger J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Bramson H.N. Casnellie J.E. Nachod H. Regan L.M. Sommers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16219-16225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may stabilize the interactions of p56lck with CD4 and CD8α and may explain the weak but specific interactions we detected in vitro between p56lck and mutants of CD4 in which one or both of the essential cysteines were changed to alanine. The elevated concentrations of both GST-CD4 and p56lck used in these binding assays could favor formation of such complexes.The relatively high zinc concentrations required for binding of p56lck to GST-CD4 (10–100 μmZn2+) or GST-CD8α (100 μm to 1 mm Zn2+) are comparable with that required for HIV Tat homodimerization—100 μm Zn2+; this is the only other intracellular protein-protein interaction thus far characterized that requires zinc as a bridge for dimerization (24Frankel A.D. Bredt D.S. Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 240: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 25Frankel A.D. Chen L. Cotter R.J. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6297-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, we found (data not shown) that glutathioneS-transferase alone can bind zinc. Thus, the actual concentrations of free Zn2+ in our GST-CD4·p56lck and CD8α·p56lck binding assays may be lower than the added Zn2+ concentrations. Nevertheless, these high concentrations may reflect differences in association that occurin vitro versus in live cells. In live cells, factors such as myristoylation of p56lck and its consequent insertion into the plasma membrane may contribute to the stability of the complex, as could association of p56lck with the TCR ζ chain. More intriguingly, Vallee and co-workers (20Maret W. Larsen K.S. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2233-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Maret W. Vallee B.L.

A. 1998; 95: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 23Jacob C. Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3489-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) showed that, under oxidizing conditions similar to those in the endoplasmic reticulum, zinc can be transferred from its binding site in metallothioneins to those of lower affinity in other zinc proteins. Hence, inside the cell where the concentrations of free zinc are in the picomolar range, metallothioneins may play a role in transferring zinc to proteins during their biosynthesis.Furthermore, we show that CD8α interacts with p56lck in an analogous zinc-dependent manner to CD4. In vitro, association of GST-CD8α with p56lckspecifically requires zinc; other metals tested do not support binding. In living cells, CD8α·p56lck complexes are disrupted by membrane-permeable zinc chelators. The higher zinc concentration required for formation of the CD8α·p56lck than the CD4·p56lck complex leads us to speculate that, under limiting zinc concentrations, p56lckbinding to CD8α would be of lower affinity than that to CD4. This is supported by studies showing that a greater proportion of total cellular p56lck associates with CD4 than with CD8α (50–90% versus 10–25% for CD4 and CD8α, respectively) (1Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 2Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5190-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only the mutation of both conserved cysteines in CD8α entirely abolishes p56lckassociation (3Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the nature of zinc binding in the CD8α·p56lck complexes may not be identical to that in CD4·p56lck.Finally, our studies show that membrane-permeable Zn2+chelators rapidly and completely disrupt CD4·p56lck complexes in lymphoid cells. Thus, TPEN and 1,10-O-phenanthroline may serve as useful tools for dissecting TCR signaling in the absence of CD4-mediated p56lck activation.The CD4·p56lck and CD8α·p56lck dimers are, to our knowledge, the first examples of intracellular protein heterodimers bridged by zinc. CD4·p56lck complexes form in the endoplasmic reticulum within 10 min of CD4 biosynthesis (4Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E. Hammond C. Stern D.F. Sefton B.M. Rose J.K. Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As yet we do not know what role, if any, zinc might play in folding of CD4, CD8α, and p56lck, nor do we know the stage of biosynthesis where zinc links the two proteins together. Structural studies are needed to elucidate the details of the Zn2+-containing interface between p56lck and either CD4 or CD8α; the HIV Tat protein may serve as an informative model with which to begin such structural studies. In the presence of 100 μmZnCl2, Tat forms a homodimer in vitro bridged by four Zn2+ ions (24Frankel A.D. Bredt D.S. Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 240: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 25Frankel A.D. Chen L. Cotter R.J. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6297-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Biophysical measurements indicate that little change in secondary structure occurs upon complex formation, suggesting that metal binding does not significantly alter global protein folding. With respect to association of p56lck with CD4 or CD8α, it is possible that zinc may likewise simply serve as a molecular “adhesive” by which to bridge two proteins. T-lymphocyte activation requires the coordination of a large complex of proteins collectively termed the T-cell receptor (TCR)1. Within the TCR, activation of p56lck, a lymphocyte-specific member of the Src family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, is necessary for initiation of signal transduction. By binding to the cytosolic domains of CD4 and CD8α, p56lck is placed in close proximity to its downstream substrates, CD3, TCR ζ chain, and Zap70. They, in turn, activate subsequent signaling events (6Weil R. Veillette A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Association of p56lck with CD4 requires two conserved cysteine residues in the cytosolic domain of CD4 and two in the amino terminus of p56lck (1Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 2Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1989; 59: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these four cysteines results in failure to form a CD4·p56lck complex (4Shaw A.S. Amrein K.E.

These cysteines and their spacing within each domain are highly conserved, yet mutation of adjacent residues has no effect on CD4·p56lck association (3Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D.

Amino acid sequence analysis provided a nearly complete primary structure. which was subsequently verified and completed by cDNA cloning using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction/rapid amplification of cDNA end techniques. The inhibitor, called LCI (leechcarboxypeptidase inhibitor), is a cysteine-rich polypeptide composed of 66 amino acid residues. It does not show sequence similarity to any other protein except at its C-terminal end. In this region, the inhibitor shares the amino acid sequence -Thr-Cys-X-Pro-Tyr-Val-X withSolanacea carboxypeptidase inhibitors, suggesting a similar mechanism of inhibition where the C-terminal tail of the inhibitor interacts with the active center of metallocarboxypeptidases in a substrate-like manner. This hypothesis is supported by the hydrolytic release of the C-terminal glutamic acid residue of LCI after binding to the enzyme. Heterologous overexpression of LCI in Escherichia coli, either into the medium or as an intracellular thioredoxin fusion protein, yields a protein with full inhibitory activity.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the role of proteases in various biological processes such as peptide processing, defense mechanisms, fertilization, carcinogenesis, trauma, inflammation, and coagulation/fibrinolysis, among others (1Fritz, H., Schmidt, I., and Turk, V. (eds) (1990) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 371Google Scholar, 2Avilés F.X. Innovations in Proteases and Their Inhibitors. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1993Google Scholar, 3Hooper N.M. Zinc Metalloproteases in Health and Disease. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London1996Crossref Google Scholar). The biological actions of most proteases is controlled by the interaction with specific proteinaceous inhibitors. In contrast to the wide variety of structurally diverse inhibitors regulating the activity of endoproteinases (4Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), only a few specific inhibitors that form tight complexes with carboxypeptidases have been identified (5Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Guasch A. Coll M. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The only metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitors described so far are the 38–39-residue proteins from Solanacea (potato and tomato) (6Hass G.M. Ryan C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 778-791Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a 65-residue protein from Ascaris suum (7Homandberg G.A. Litwiller R.D. Peanasky R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and, more recently, a 223-residue protein from rat brain (8Normant E. Martres M.P. Schwartz J.C. Gros C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12225-12229Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proteins fromSolanacea and Ascaris inhibit carboxypeptidases by a common mechanism where their C-terminal tail interacts with the target enzymes in a substrate-like manner. The C terminus of the mammalian inhibitor from rat brain, however, does not seem to be a suitable substrate for carboxypeptidases (8Normant E. Martres M.P. Schwartz J.C. Gros C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12225-12229Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); this protein is thought to interact with carboxypeptidases by a small region that shows sequence similarity to the inhibitory loop in the propeptides of these enzymes. This inhibitor region may bind in a fashion similar to the long (94–96 residues) N-terminal propeptides of the carboxypeptidase zymogens (9Coll M. Guasch A. Avilés F.X. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Guasch A. Coll M. Avilés F.X. Huber R. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6906-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which fold as independent globular domains and position their inhibitory loop on top of the active site cleft of the enzymes. Several proteinaceous inhibitors of serine proteases have been isolated from leeches (12Ascenzi P. Amiconi G. Bode W. Bolognesi M. Coietta M. Menegatti E. Mol. Aspects Med. 1995; 16: 215-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Leech-derived inhibitors include anticoagulants such as the thrombin-specific hirudins and the factor Xa-specific antistasin (13Tuszynsky G.P. Gasic T.B. Gasic G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9718-9723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and other serine protease inhibitors with a biological function not fully understood. We have now isolated, sequenced, cloned, expressed, and characterized a novel carboxypeptidase inhibitor from the medical leech Hirudo medicinalis. The newly characterized protein, named LCI1 (for leechcarboxypeptidase inhibitor), the first carboxypeptidase inhibitor found in leeches. LCI does not show similarity in sequence with any other carboxypeptidase inhibitor except at its C-terminal end, suggesting a mechanism of inhibition similar to that of the inhibitors from Solanacea and Ascaris. Pharmaceutical extracts from the medical leechH. medicinalis were a gift from G.E.N. Therapeutica (Bad Zwischenahn, Germany). Bovine CPA was from Boehringer Mannheim; porcine CPB and human CPA2 were prepared following described procedures (14Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Méndez E. Avilés F.X. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4092-4099Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar,15Reverter D. Ventura S. Villegas V. Vendrell J. Avilés F.X. J. Biol.

The synthetic carboxypeptidase substrates benzoyl-glycyl-l-phenylalanine, benzoyl-glycyl-l-arginine, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-l-tryptophan, furyl-acryloyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine, and furyl-acryloyl-l-alanyl-l-lysine were from Sigma and Bachem. Restriction enzymes, ligases and nucleases were from Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, and Invitrogen. Lyophilized leech extract (∼0.5 g) was dissolved in 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0) buffer, and the insoluble residues were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. After pH equilibration, the supernatant was loaded onto a preparative anion-exchange column (TSK-DEAE 5PW, 2.5 × 15 cm; Toyo-Soda) connected to a FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and elution was performed with a linear gradient from 0% to 100% 0.8 m ammonium acetate in 20 mm Tris acetate at a flow rate of 4 ml/min for 80 min. Fractions were collected and analyzed by CPA inhibition tests. Inhibitor-containing fractions were lyophilized and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC (Vydac C4 column) using a linear gradient from 20% to 42% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 60 min. The purity of the isolated inhibitor was checked by SDS-Tricine gel electrophoresis (16Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 166: 369-376Google Scholar) and N-terminal sequence analysis. The molecular masses of the natural and recombinant forms of the inhibitor were analyzed using the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technique. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker Biflex spectrometer equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm), in linear or reflectron, positive ion mode, and using a 19-kV acceleration voltage. Synapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) or α-cyano-4-hydroxicinnamic acid were used as matrix for the analysis of intact proteins or isolated peptide fragments, respectively. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of a saturated solution of the matrix in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile 2:1 and a peptide solution of a concentration (range, 1–10 μm). From this mixture, 1 μl was spotted on the sample slide and allowed to evaporate to dryness. LCI in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) was denatured and reduced by addition of 5 m guanidinium HCl and 5 mmdithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C. Carboxymethylation of cysteines was achieved by addition of 10 mm iodoacetic acid for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The solution was diluted five times with 0.15 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate (pH 8.0) and treated with trypsin (Worthington) or with V8 endoproteinase (Glu-C endoproteinase from Staphylococcus aureus) for 14 h at 37 °C and at 20:1 ratio (w/w). The reactions were stopped by adding the same volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Peptide fragments resulting from the enzymatic digestions were purified on a Waters HPLC system using a Vydac C18 column eluted with a linear gradient from 15% to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80 min (1 ml/min). The carboxymethylated inhibitor and the isolated peptide fragments were analyzed by automated amino acid sequencing on a Beckman LF3000 Protein Sequencer and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Gene-specific degenerated oligonucleotides designed based on the N-terminal and internal amino acid sequence of purified LCI, oligonucleotides for cDNA synthesis, and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany): N1, 5′-GACGAATCNTTYYTNTGYTAYCA-3′ with N = A, C, G, or T and Y = C or T (deduced from amino acids 5–12 of LCI); N2, 5′-TGTGCTAYCARCCNGAYCARGT-3′ with R = A or G (from amino acids 9–16); N3, 5′-CCAGACCARGTNTGYTGYTTYAT-3′ (from amino acids 13–20); C1, 5′-CCTGTGSWRTANGGNACCCA-3′ with S = G or C and W = A or T (from amino acids 55–49); YXT, 5′-CGAGGGGGATGGTCGACGGAAGCGACCT18-3′ (modified from Ref.17Fritz J.D. Greaser M.L. Wolff J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 37-47Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar); Y, 5′-CGAGGGGGATGGTCGACGG-3′ (representing a part of YXT); X, 5′-GATGGTCGACGGAAGCGACC-3′ (representing a part of YXT). Total RNA was isolated from frozen leeches using the guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was purified by oligo(dT) affinity separation (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). First-strand cDNA synthesis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out with the oligonucleotide YXT as primer. “Nested” PCR was performed to amplify an internal cDNA fragment and for 3′-RACE; in a first round of PCR, leech cDNA was amplified using the gene-specific primers N1, N2, and N3 in all combinations with the gene-specific primer C1 or the adaptor primers X and Y. PCR mixtures were diluted 20-fold, and re-amplified using all combinations of appropriate nested primers. PCR amplifications were performed with 25 pmol of both primers and the Goldstar polymerase (Eurogentec, Belgium), using 30 cycles each with 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 53 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose/Tris acetate gels. Prominent PCR products generated by amplifications with the primer pairs N3/C1 and N3/X were eluted from the gel, subcloned using the pGEM-T AT-cloning system (Promega) and used to transformEscherichia coli strain JM109 by electroporation to generate the clones pGEM-LCI-N3/C1 and pGEM-LCI-N3/X. Subsequently, the 5′ end of the LCI-cDNA was obtained by a 5′-RACE approach using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, after second strand cDNA synthesis and adapter ligation “semi-nested” PCR was performed with the Marathon adaptor primer AP1 and the gene-specific primers 5′-TAGTCAAGAAGAGAAATGCCCT-3′ and 5′-TTAGCCTCGCATCAGTGACACACG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 361–340 and 300–277 of the complete cDNA; see Fig. 3) in the first and second round of PCR, respectively. PCR products were analyzed and subcloned as described above. A two-step PCR strategy was used to append the 5′ bases, which code for the N-terminal amino acids of mature LCI, to the partial LCI-cDNA obtained by 3′-RACE. Three oligonucleotides were designed using E. coli codon usage and synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech: A, 5′-GAAAGCTTCCTGTGCTATCAGCCAGACCAGGTGTGCTGTTTC-3′; B, 5′-ATCCCATACCCCGGATGAAAGCTTCCTGTGCTATCAGC-3′; C, 5′-ATTGGATCCTTACTACTCGACATATGGGATGC-3′. PCR was first performed using primers A–C and the plasmid pGEM-LCI-N3/X as template. Subsequently, the product was used as template for a second PCR with primers B and C. Amplifications were performed using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and 30 cycles each with 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were analyzed by 3% methaphor agarose/Tris acetate gel. The final product of the two-step PCR was digested with BamHI prior to ligation with the expression vectors. For heterologous expression of LCI, the vectors pIN-III-OmpA3 (19Ghrayeb J. Kimura H. Takahora M. Hsiang H. Masui Y. Inouye M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and pET-32b (Promega) were used. pIN-III-OmpA3 was cleaved withEcoRI, blunt-ended with Mung bean nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim), and digested with BamHI. This linearized vector, having a blunt and a BamHI end, was ligated with the final product of the two-step PCR (see above) to generate the plasmid pIN-III-OmpA3-LCI, which was used to transform E. colistrain MC1061. Similarily, pET-32b was cleaved with EcoRV and BamHI to generate a linearized vector with a blunt end and a BamHI end, and ligated with the PCR product to generate pET-32b-LCI. This plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain ADA494, a thioredoxin reductase (trxB) mutant that allows the formation of disulfide bonds in the E. coli cytoplasm. For the production of recombinant LCI, 5 ml of MC1061/pIN-III-OmpA3-LCI inoculum were grown overnight at 37 °C in M9CAS (containing 0.3% glycerol) and used to inoculate 0.5 liter of the same medium. After growth for 2 h, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. At 24 h after induction, the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was applied to a Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridge (Waters, Millipore). The bound material was eluted with 40 ml of 30% 2-propanol and concentrated in a Roto-Vapor to remove the organic solvent. Subsequently, recombinant LCI was purified essentially as described above for LCI from leech extracts. 5 ml of ADA494/pET-32b-LCI were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and used to inoculate 0.5 liter of the same medium. When the optical density of the culture reached values of 0.4–0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. At 3 h after induction, recombinant LCI produced intracellularly as a thioredoxin fusion protein was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. After sonication of cells in binding buffer (5 mm imidazol, 0.5 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.9) the supernatant was loaded onto a Hi-trap Ni2+ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The LCI-thioredoxin fusion protein bound to the column via its histidine tag was eluted with 1 m imidazol, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9. Subsequently, the fusion protein was cleaved with enterokinase (Sigma), and the recombinant LCI purified as described above. The general assay for carboxypeptidase inhibition was carried out by preincubation of 10-μl samples with 5 μl of bovine CPA1 (0.1 mg/ml in 50 mmTris/HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5) for 5 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1 ml of the substrate furyl-acryloyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine (0.2 mm) and measurement of the absorbance change at 330 nm. In specific assays for different carboxypeptidases, the following substrates were used: benzoyl-glycyl-l-phenylalanine for bovine CPA1, benzoyl-glycyl-l-arginine for porcine CPB, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-l-tryptophan for human CPA2, and furyl-acryloyl-l-alanyl-l-lysine for plasma CPB; substrate hydrolysis was monitored at 254 nm (for CPA1 and CPB) or 300–304 nm (CPA2). Equilibrium dissociation constants (K i) for the complexes of LCI and rLCI with the different carboxypeptidases were determined essentially as described (20Henderson P.J.F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 21Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (497) Google Scholar) for tightly binding inhibitors. Experimental details were identical to those described for potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor analysis (22Molina M.A. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Molina M.A. Marino C. Avilés F.X. Querol E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21467-21472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after preincubation of constant concentrations of an enzyme with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor (It) and measuring the residual enzymatic activities (vo to vi), linear plots of It /(1 −vi /vo) againstvo /vi were obtained at five or more different substrate concentrations. The derived slopes were plotted as function of the substrate concentration, the intersection with the y axis giving theK i value. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis were carried out in a Jasco J-715 spectrometer, at 15 μm rLCI concentration in 15 mmphosphate buffer, at different pH values and temperatures. Reduction and/or denaturing conditions were achieved by treating LCI with 5 mm dithiothreitol during 24 h or dissolving rLCI in 8m urea. NMR spectra were obtained in a 400-MHz Bruker AMX spectrometer, with rLCI at 1 mg/ml in 15 mm phosphate buffer, at different pH values and temperatures; spectra were obtained both in normal and deuterated (99.9%) water after dissolution of freeze-dried samples. The purification of LCI from leech extract is summarized in Fig. 1. Using anion-exchange chromatography to fractionate the pharmaceutical leech extracts, carboxypeptidase inhibitory activity was detected in two fractions eluting at ∼64 min and ∼69 min (Fig. 1 A). After desalting and acidification, these fractions were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively), where proteins with inhibitory activity eluted at retention times of ∼38 and ∼34 min, respectively. Both protein species inhibit carboxypeptidases similarly, with aK i-value of ∼0.4 nm for bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A1 (at pH 7.5). The two inhibitor species were analyzed by automated Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In both cases, the sequence NH2-SHTPDESFLCYQPDQVCCFICRGAAPLP was obtained for the N-terminal 28 residues, suggesting that both inhibitor species comprise very similar or identical proteins. However, mass spectrometry revealed different molecular masses of 7326 and 7197 Da for the earlier and latter HPLC-eluting inhibitor species, respectively (Fig. 1 D). After reduction and carboxymethylation, both inhibitor species were fragmented with trypsin and V8-protease and peptide maps were obtained by reverse-phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Nearly identical peptide maps were generated, suggesting identity in sequence along most of the molecules. This was confirmed by separation of peptides using reverse-phase HPLC, followed by the determination of their masses and amino acid sequences. The resulting overlapping peptides (Fig. 2) cover the entire sequence of LCI. The entire sequence was subsequently confirmed by cDNA cloning (see below). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was also performed after treatment of oxidized and reduced LCI with the carboxymethylating agent iodoacetic acid, and showed an incorporation of zero and of eight carboxymethyl groups, respectively. Thus, all eight cysteine residues of LCI appear to be involved in disulfide bond formation. Molecular cloning of the LCI cDNA was accomplished by amplification of an internal fragment combined with RACE (17Fritz J.D. Greaser M.L. Wolff J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 37-47Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar, 25Chenchik A. Diachenko L. Moqadam F. Tarabykin V. Lukyanov S. Siebert P.D. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Gene-specific external (N1, N2, and N3) and internal (C1) degenerated primers were designed based on the N terminus and an internal peptide sequence of LCI, respectively. First strand cDNA, synthesized from H. medicinalispoly(A)+ RNA primed with the oligonucleotide YXT, was used as template for a first PCR with the gene-specific primers N1, N2, and N3 in combinations with the specific primer C1 or the 3′-RACE primers X and Y (which represent parts of the oligonucleotide YXT); no bands were visualized on agarose gels from this PCR. The amplification mixtures were used as templates for a second round of PCR with all combinations of nested primers. Prominent PCR products of about 120 and 380 base pairs were generated in several reactions by amplification with the primer combinations N3/C1 and N3/X, respectively, purified, and subcloned. Sequence analysis of the plasmids showed the presence of an internal and a 3′-cDNA fragment, respectively (i.e.nucleotides 103–230 and 103–465 of the complete cDNA; see Fig. 3). This partial cDNA sequence was used to design several primers for 5′-RACE. A ∼350-base pair fragment was amplified by seminested PCR and subcloned. Five clones were sequenced, which contain fragments representing nucleotides 1–300 of the complete cDNA of LCI; they consistently differ from the 3′-RACE clones by the three non-coding base pair exchanges G111A, G114T, and C240T. The LCI mRNA, as deduced from the overlapping cDNA clones (Fig. 3), contains an uninterrupted open reading frame of 243 nucleotides, which is preceded by a 21-nucleotide 5′-untranslated sequence and followed by a 182-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region. A hexanucleotide AATAAA consensus signal for polyadenylation is found 15 nucleotides before the poly(A)+ tail. The size of this LCI mRNA is consistent with that of a single ∼500-nucleotide transcript detected by Northern blot analysis of total leech RNA (data not shown). Preliminary results from Southern blot analysis of leech DNA suggest that the leech genome contains a single copy of the LCI gene (Fig. 4). Translation of the open reading frame of the LCI mRNA generates an 81-amino acid sequence containing a 15-residue hydrophobic signal peptide, which precedes the N-terminal Ser of the mature protein. Computer search analysis with the entire LCI did not show any sequence similarity with other known proteins. The deduced 66-residue sequence of mature LCI is in complete agreement with that of the protein purified from leech extracts. The molecular mass predicted for mature LCI, assuming the formation of four S-S bonds, is 7322 Da and coincides with the value determined for one of the two inhibitor species purified from leech extracts. Furthermore, sequence and mass spectrometry data suggest that the accompanying 7197-Da species corresponds to a C-terminally truncated LCI (i.e. des-Glu66-LCI, see below). This would also explain its different behavior in anion exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. The truncation most likely is the consequence of proteolytic processing by carboxypeptidase action (see below). A two-step PCR strategy was designed to generate the 5′-bases that are missing in the partial LCI cDNA obtained by 3′-RACE and code for the 12 N-terminal amino acid residues of mature LCI. The resulting cDNA was subsequently ligated into the expression vectors pIN-III-OmpA3 and pET-32b (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The expression plasmid pIN-III-OmpA3-LCI was used to transform E. coli MC1061 (26Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a strain previously utilized for the recombinant production of the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (22Molina M.A. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initial expression assays were performed in shaker flasks, and the culture medium as well as the periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed for the presence of the recombinant inhibitor (rLCI). rLCI was found almost exclusively in the culture medium, suggesting that the OmpA signal peptide directed the immature protein through the plasma membrane into the periplasmic space with concomitant removal of the signal peptide, and subsequent release of mature rLCI through the outer membrane into the culture medium. For optimization of rLCI production, different culture conditions were examined. pIN-III-OmpA3-LCI was grown in M9CAS medium supplemented with different amounts of glycerol (0.3, 0.6, and 1%), and 0.5 or 1 mm IPTG was used for induction; rLCI in culture supernatants was quantified by measurements of CPA inhibition. Highest expression yields were obtained in cultures with 0.3% glycerol and 0.5 mm IPTG, suggesting that an excess of glycerol in the medium inhibits the expression of rLCI. This result is in agreement with previous findings using similar expression systems (22Molina M.A. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Approximately 3.4 mg of rLCI per liter of supernatant were produced in shaker flasks, yielding a 60% recovery after purification. Recombinant LCI was purified essentially as described for LCI from leech extracts. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (GSHTPDE …) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (7383 Da) verified that rLCI is correctly processed and contains a construction-added glycine residue as the N-terminal residue. Larger quantities of rLCI were obtained using the pET-32b-LCI/E. coli ADA494 expression system (27LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) to produce an intracellular fusion protein of thioredoxin covalently linked to the N terminus of LCI. The fusion protein was rapidly and efficiently purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, yielding 20–40 mg of thioredoxin-LCI/liter of E. coli medium. A rLCI species with four additional amino acid residues at the N-terminal end (NH2-A-M-A-I-LCI) and inhibitory properties virtually identical to those of the naturally occurring inhibitor was released by digestion of the fusion protein with enterokinase. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K i) for the complexes of rLCI with different metallocarboxypeptidases were determined at pH 7.5. rLCI is a tightly binding, competitive inhibitor of pancreatic carboxypeptidases with different specificities, i.e. the A1, A2, and B mammalian pancreatic forms and of human plasma carboxypeptidase B, withK i values each in the subnanomolar range (0.2–0.4 nm) (see Table I). Preincubation of the inhibitor with the enzymes for various periods of time did not affect its inhibitory activity, suggesting that rLCI is a fast binding and stable inhibitor.Table IInhibition constants of LCI measured for different types of carboxypeptidasesCarboxypeptidase typeInhibition constant (K i)nmBovine CPA10.25–0.48Bovine CPA1 (des-Glu66-LCI)0.1–0.3Porcine CPB0.27–0.51Human CPA20.17–0.78Human plasma CPB0.1–0.2 Open table in a new tab The effect of metallocarboxypeptidases on rLCI was studied by incubation of equimolar amounts of rLCI and bovine carboxypeptidase A1, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Nitric oxide and N-acetylcysteine have been used to determine if oxidative stress influenced the effects of angiotensin II on the cardiac fibroblast. Angiotensin II activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases designated extracellular signal-regulated kinases within 5 min by interacting with the AT1 receptor. This activation was completely independent of protein kinase C and was inhibited when farnesylation was blocked, implicating Ras involvement. Pretreatment of cardiac fibroblasts with eitherN-acetylcysteine for 8 h or nitric oxide for 10 min suppressed this activation by angiotensin II in a dose-dependent manner. However, when both agents were added, inhibition was essentially complete. This combined effect of N-acetylcysteine and nitric oxide to block ERKs activation also was found if the activity was stimulated by either another growth factor (platelet-derived growth factor) or by the addition of phorbol ester, suggesting the effect was not limited to the receptor site alone.

The ERKs are well studied and generally activated by growth factors and mitogenic stimuli via a Ras/Raf1/MEK1 signaling cascade leading to activation of transcription factors such as Elk1 and c-Fos, whereas JNKs and p38 MAPK exhibit substantial sequence homology and respond primarily to various cellular stress conditions such as proinflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation, although it is not clear whether this occurs via common or parallel upstream kinases (8Force T.

Several recent studies have suggested that the balance of the oxidative and reductive potentials within the cell (cellular redox state) may substantially influence this pathway (11Powis G.

In the presence of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion or hydroxyl radical, or by the addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an agent that is thought to influence intracellular glutathione and the redox state of the cell, the response of cells to mitogens or cytokines can be impaired, presumably by changing the conditions for thiol oxidation or reduction (13Lander H.M.

Nitric oxide (NO), a redox-active molecule, has been identified as an important potential regulator of certain signaling events. NO acts by stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to enhanced production of intracellular cyclic GMP, an intracellular second messenger that can activate cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (16Schmidt H.H.H.W. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). NO also is capable of reacting with oxygen radicals such as superoxide anion (17Akaike T. Suga M. Maeda H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as well as directly modulating the activity of signaling molecules (18Kim H. Shim J. Han P.L.

The interaction with superoxide anion was suggested to be important in mechanisms where NO was implicated in modulating cytotoxic mechanisms, presumably by influencing oxidative stress (19Lander H.M.

The cardiac fibroblast, which is the cell type known to proliferate during cardiac fibrosis and produce the excess matrix proteins characteristic of that condition, is a target cell for Ang II. Ang II has been shown to cause proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts in culture (20Shorb W. Booz G.W. Dotal D.E. Conrad K.M. Chang K.C. Baker K.M. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that nitric oxide can modulate this proliferative effect (21Takizawa T. Gu M. Chobanian A.V. Brecher P.

To better understand the role that NO might have in influencing Ang II action in cardiac fibroblasts, we have characterized the activation of ERKs in these cells by Ang II and have examined the effects of N-acetylcysteine and NO on this pathway. We have found novel effects of both NAC and NO on Ang II-induced ERKs activation, suggesting that both NO and oxidative stress, which accompany the development of cardiac fibrosis, could modulate the effects of Ang II on the cardiac fibroblasts.DISCUSSIONThis study shows that NO inhibited the activation of ERKs by Ang II in rat cardiac fibroblasts, providing a molecular model for the known counterregulatory roles that Ang II and NO have in diverse tissues. The inhibitory effect of NO was enhanced when cells were pretreated with NAC, which by itself also inhibited the response, albeit to a lesser extent than when combined with NO treatment. The combination of NAC pretreatment and the addition of SNAP almost completely inhibited ERK activation by pathways both dependent on and independent of protein kinase C and also inhibited ERK activation initiated by PDGF and PMA, suggesting the effect was not localized to the hormone receptor alone.We characterized the response to Ang II using agents that implicated the AT1 receptor (losartan), tyrosine kinase activity (genistein), Ras activation (farnesyltransferase inhibitor-3), and the requirement for MEK1 activation (PD98059). The activation of ERKs through such a signaling pathway has been implicated in other studies using cardiac fibroblasts and is consistent with recent studies showing that divergent pathways were involved in Ang II action, which conventionally had been thought to work solely through G protein-mediated activation of phospholipase C (4Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Singer H.A Baker K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1308-C1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of a role for protein kinase C in our study is in agreement with recent findings showing that protein kinase C was not involved in Ang II activation of ERKs using cultured neonatal cardiac fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (26Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Aikawa R. Zhu W. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Cir. Res. 1998; 82: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Liao D.F. Duff J.L. Daum G. Pelech S.L. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but differs from other studies where protein kinase C was involved in Ang II action both in cardiac myocytes and aortic smooth muscle cells (28Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33592-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Malarkey K. McLees A. Paul A. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We inactivated protein kinase C using both down-regulation by PMA pretreatment for 24 h and by using specific inhibitors (GF109203X and Gö6983) that only required brief pretreatment. Since it is known that many isoforms of protein kinase C exist, some being independent of PMA down-regulation, it is difficult to absolutely rule out any involvement of protein kinase C, although the inhibitors we used are thought to also act on the PMA-independent forms of protein kinase C (30Kiss Z. Phillips H. Anderson W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A recent study (31Liao D-F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) has shown that Ang II activates ERKs in vascular smooth muscle cells through a mechanism involving protein kinase C-ζ. This kinase is calcium-independent and not activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters.Studies with the agent that inhibited farnesyltransferase implicated Ras activation in the signaling pathway. Ras is known to be involved in mediating the effects of Ang II in several cell types, although a recent study has reported that Ras was not activated by Ang II in cultured cardiac myocytes (28Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Aikawa R. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33592-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to our studies is the report showing that Ras can be directly nitrosated and activated by NO (19Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and studies showing that basal activity of ERKs and other MAP kinases were increased following the addition of NO (32Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Those studies, conducted in the Jurkat human T-cell line, clearly differ from our own, since we repeatedly found no effect of SNAP addition on basal activity, either under our standard assay conditions or if assays were performed between 30 s and 30 min following the SNAP addition (data not shown).Cysteine increased the ability of the NO donor SNAP to inhibit ERK activity. Cysteine was shown to enhance the effect of theS-nitrosothiol SNAP, which commonly is used as an NO donor in in vitro experiments with intact cultured cells. It was suggested (33Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18596-18603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) that cysteine could act by promoting transnitrosation from SNAP to S-nitrosocysteine, which would be more susceptible to intracellular decomposition, leading to more effective storage or transport of NO within the cell. Reduced GSH would presumably be the major intracellular mediator of NO storage and transport, implicating a transnitrosation from the original NO donor (SNAP) to a labile intermediate carrier S-nitrosocysteine and ultimately to intracellular GSH.The reported effects of NAC pretreatment on several cell types include increased levels of reduced glutathione (34Yim C-Y. Hibbs Jr., J.B. McGregor J.R. Galinsky R.E. Samlowski W.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5796-5805PubMed Google Scholar) and action as a reducing agent (35Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a potential contributory factor in the intracellular storage and transport of NO (36Muller B. Kleschyov A.L. Stoclet J.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and a free radical scavenger (37Brunet J. Boily M.J. Cordeau S. Des Rosiers C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). NAC has been shown to both increase survival and inhibit the proliferation of PC12 cells by mechanisms that are independent of intracellular glutathione levels and do not appear to be dependent on its antioxidant/radical scavenging properties (15Kamata H. Tanaka C. Yagisawa H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Hirata H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33018-33025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Yan C.Y.I. Ferrari G. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In one study (38Yan C.Y.I. Ferrari G. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the effect of NAC was suggested to be dependent on its ability to act as a reducing agent or on the transcription activation of as yet unidentified genes. Our findings with NAC required prolonged pretreatment (about 8 h) of the cardiac fibroblasts to partially inhibit the acute activation of ERKs in response to Ang II or to further enhance the inhibitory effect of SNAP. We also found that glutathione monoethylester, an agent that also increases intracellular level of glutathione, does not share with NAC the capability to inhibit Ang II-induced ERK activation. Although we have shown that changes in the absolute amount of glutathione do not account solely for the inhibitory effects of NAC on the activation of ERKs, it is possible that changes in the concentration of reduced glutathione combined with an increased ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) might account for the effect of NAC. It has been proposed that the GSH/GSSG ratio, by controlling the reduction state of critical sulfhydryl groups, may reflect the redox state of the cell and regulate enzyme activity (39Navarro J. Obrador E. Pellicer J.A. Aseni M. Vina J. Estrela J.M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recently, the effect of NAC on cell redox environment has been studied in endothelial cells (40Faruqi R.M. Poptic E.J. Faruqi T.R. De La Motte C. DiCorleto P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H817-H826PubMed Google Scholar), where NAC caused a dramatic increase in GSH/GSSG ratio from 200 to more than 400, which has been suggested as one possible mechanism through which NAC exerts its inhibitory effect.A role for reactive oxygen species influencing the MAP kinase pathway has been suggested, with the data available implicating superoxide anion as a positive effector of MAP kinase activation (41Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Ang II, by virtue of activating the NADPH oxidase system, produces the superoxide anion, which triggers the kinase cascade and promotes cell proliferation (25Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). If true, scavengers of free radicals such as the superoxide anion would inhibit activation. NAC has been suggested as a direct scavenger of free radicals in studies where it reduced the activation of MAP kinase phosphorylation in response to PDGF (42Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) and where it lowered MAP kinase activity and Ras activation in response to lactosylceramide (43Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Data have shown an interaction between NAC and reactive oxygen species (37Brunet J. Boily M.J. Cordeau S. Des Rosiers C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although the reaction may not be rapid at physiological conditions. Nonetheless, the inhibition of ERK activation by Ang II (and by PDGF and PMA) could be mediated by the ability of NAC to scavenge requisite free radicals.One possible mechanism for the NO action on the ERKs could be the redox reaction of NO with critical thiol group(s) of the enzymes, leading to its S-nitrosation. Nitrosation of thiol groups has been shown to modulate the activity of certain enzymes (16Schmidt H.H.H.W. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Direct evidence of the redox regulation of Ras has been presented (19Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), where NO binds to a cysteine residue on the surface of the activated Ras molecule, leading to activation of the downstream MAP kinase cascade. This apparently does not happen in our system, since no activation of ERKs in the basal state was observed when SNAP was added to the cardiac fibroblasts. However, NO could react with superoxide anion, giving rise to the formation of peroxynitrite, a reactive substance that could lead to modification of cellular thiols (17Akaike T. Suga M. Maeda H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).We found that MEK1 was activated by Ang II and inhibited by both NAC and SNAP, suggesting that it could be a potential site of action for these drugs, although any site upstream of MEK1 also could be implicated. Evidence suggesting that MEK1 is not the sole site of action for these drugs comes from our observations that both JNKs and p38 MAPK activation also were inhibited by NAC and SNAP, and these pathways are generally believed to be independent of MEK1.In our studies, NAC facilitated the effects of NO on the inhibition of an essential signaling system. This is a novel finding that contrasts with recent studies in other cell types where NAC pretreatment reduced heme oxygenase activity induced by NO (44Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and in another study where the inhibitory effect of NO on the respiration of digitonin-treated ascites hepatoma cells was suppressed by NAC (45Gow A.J. Thom S.R. Ischiropoulos H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L112-L118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interrelationship between NO and the superoxide anion has been intensely studied in recent years, and an emerging hypothesis is that such interactions have an important physiological role in modulating the biological activities of both NO and the superoxide anion (46Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Kim S.Y. Vodovotz Y. Pacelli R. Krishna M.C. Russo A. Mitchell J.B. Jourd'heuil D. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11147-11151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is plausible that the Ang II signaling pathway consists of redox-sensitive steps and that NAC pretreatment could modulate the redox state of the cell in an as yet undetermined manner that would lead to NO being either stabilized or transported intracellularly in a more effective manner so that it would either interact more readily with superoxide anion or could act directly on redox-sensitive target proteins by nitrosation reactions. Angiotensin II (Ang II)1has pleiotrophic effects on several cell types, leading to diverse responses including the regulation of cell growth, programmed cell death, cell migration, and modification of the extracellular matrix (1Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 2Kajstura J. Cigola E. Malhotra A. Li P. Cheng W. Meggs L.G. Anversa P. J. Mol. Cell.

Ang II has been shown to activate many signaling pathways through its Gq-linked AT1 receptor. In cultured cardiac cells, both the activation of the AT1 receptor, leading to the activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C (4Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Singer H.A Baker K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1308-C1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Eskildsen-Helmond Y.E. Bezstarosti K. Dekkers D.H. Heugten H.A. Lamers J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2545-2559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and cross-talk between AT1 receptor with other growth factor receptors having intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been documented (6Du J. Sperling L.S. Marrero M.B. Phillips L. Delafontaine P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases are a family of serine-threonine kinases, which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs/stress-activated protein kinases), and p38 MAPK. The ERKs are well studied and generally activated by growth factors and mitogenic stimuli via a Ras/Raf1/MEK1 signaling cascade leading to activation of transcription factors such as Elk1 and c-Fos, whereas JNKs and p38 MAPK exhibit substantial sequence homology and respond primarily to various cellular stress conditions such as proinflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation, although it is not clear whether this occurs via common or parallel upstream kinases (8Force T. Bonventre J.V. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schorb W. Conrad K.M. Singer H.A. Dostal D.E. Baker K.M. J. Mol. Cell.

Res. 1995; 30: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The signaling system leading to the activation of MAP kinases is subject to diverse and complex regulation. Several recent studies have suggested that the balance of the oxidative and reductive potentials within the cell (cellular redox state) may substantially influence this pathway (11Powis G. Gasdaska J.R. Baker A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 329-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In the presence of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion or hydroxyl radical, or by the addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an agent that is thought to influence intracellular glutathione and the redox state of the cell, the response of cells to mitogens or cytokines can be impaired, presumably by changing the conditions for thiol oxidation or reduction (13Lander H.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33018-33025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (NO), a redox-active molecule, has been identified as an important potential regulator of certain signaling events. NO acts by stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to enhanced production of intracellular cyclic GMP, an intracellular second messenger that can activate cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (16Schmidt H.H.H.W. Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). NO also is capable of reacting with oxygen radicals such as superoxide anion (17Akaike T. Suga M. Maeda H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as well as directly modulating the activity of signaling molecules (18Kim H. Shim J. Han P.L. Choi E.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13677-13681Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The interaction with superoxide anion was suggested to be important in mechanisms where NO was implicated in modulating cytotoxic mechanisms, presumably by influencing oxidative stress (19Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress, the term used to encompass changes in the cellular redox state, has been implicated in inflammatory processes such as fibrosis. The cardiac fibroblast, which is the cell type known to proliferate during cardiac fibrosis and produce the excess matrix proteins characteristic of that condition, is a target cell for Ang II. Ang II has been shown to cause proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts in culture (20Shorb W. Booz G.W. Dotal D.E. Conrad K.M. Chang K.C. Baker K.M. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that nitric oxide can modulate this proliferative effect (21Takizawa T. Gu M. Chobanian A.V. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), consistent with the known ability of NO to antagonize the actions of Ang II in many cell types.

Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 is a multisubunit enzyme that exists as core enzyme (α2 ββ′) or holoenzyme (α2 ββ′ς) (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Transcription initiation begins with the specific binding of the holoenzyme to promoter DNA. Although core RNAP has the enzymatic activity necessary for transcription, it lacks the ability to specifically bind promoter DNA (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that the function of ς subunit was to confer specific promoter recognition to RNAP (2Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Fed. Proc. 1970; 29: 1164-1169PubMed Google Scholar). There is a variety of E. coli ς transcription factors that are expressed in response to different growth conditions and environmental stresses and that regulate the expression of genes accordingly (3Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The primary ς70 factor is responsible for expression of most genes in E. coli (4Ishihama A. Adv. Biophys. 1990; 26: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is the focus of these studies. The role of ς70 as the specificity subunit was confirmed by genetic studies that identified two conserved regions of the protein, regions 2.4 and 4.2, as likely candidates for specific protein-DNA interactions with −10 and −35 promoter DNA sequences, respectively (5Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, physical interaction between promoter DNA and free ς70 could not be shown (8Wellman A. Meares C.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This paradox was resolved by the finding that the N-terminal sequences in ς70 inhibit specific ς70-promoter DNA interactions (9Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In these studies, it was shown that the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing fragments of ς lacking the N-terminal sequences (corresponding to conserved region 1) were able to specifically bind DNA fragments containing −10 and/or −35 sequences. In contrast, the glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing full-length ς70 or glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing deletion mutants of ς in which only a part of conserved region 1 was removed did not bind promoter DNA. Further extensions of these studies showed that polypeptide fragments containing region 1 of ς70, when used in trans, could inhibit specific DNA binding of polypeptide fragments containing region 4 of ς70, whereas the activity of fragments containing region 2 was unaffected (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, a model of ς70-DNA binding modulation by core enzyme was proposed (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this model, in free ς70, the N-terminal region 1.1 occludes region 4, preventing its specific protein-DNA interaction with the −35 region of promoter DNA. It was further suggested that binding of ς70 to core RNAP induced an allosteric conformational change in ς70, such that the N-terminal portion of the protein shifted to expose region 4, which could now contact bases in the −35 region of promoter DNA. Additionally, it was suggested that DNA binding activity of region 2 was also regulated by N-terminal sequences, but most likely not by a simple occlusion mechanism because region 2 DNA binding activity was inhibited by region 1 only in cis, not in trans (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, an interaction between residues from region 1 and region 2 has been proposed (11Gopal V. Ma H.W. Kumaran M.K. Chatterji D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The self-inhibition of DNA binding activity of ς subunits may be a common mechanism for other ς factors evolutionary related to ς70 (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this report, we directly test the model in which ς70promoter DNA binding activity is regulated by the core RNAP through a core binding-induced conformational changes in ς70affecting DNA binding domains of the protein (regions 2.4 and 4.2). In our studies we used full-length ς70 protein. Our approach was to engineer, using site-directed mutagenesis, cysteine residues at specific locations in regions 1, 2.4, and 4.2. The chemical reactivity of these residues was then used as an indicator of conformational change in both the free ς70 and ς70 in the holoenzyme. The results obtained showed that core polymerase induced conformational changes in ς70that affected both DNA binding domains and the auto-inhibition domain of the protein. [3H]-N-Ethylmaleimide was purchased as a pentane solution from NEN Life Science Products, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (12Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20881) Google Scholar) was from Sigma.N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1.3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANDB amide) and acrylodan were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cy5 monosuccinimidyl ester (13Mujumdar R.B. Ernst L.A. Mujumdar S.R. Lewis C.J. Waggoner A.S. Bioconjugate Chem. 1993; 4: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The succinimidyl ester of Cy5 was converted to maleimide by reaction with the excess of ethylenediamine followed by reaction with maleimidylpropionic acid succinimidyl ester (Sigma). 5 mg of succinimidyl ester of Cy5 was dissolved in 250 μl of N, N-dimethylformamide, and 60 μl of 1m ethylenediamine dissolved in water (pH 7.0) was added. The mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature, and another 25 μl of 1 m ethylenediamine was added. After additional 1 h incubation at room temperature, the mixture was diluted to ∼6 ml with 25 mm triethylammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0 (Buffer A), containing 2% acetonitrile. The mixture was loaded onto a 10-ml Source 15RPC reverse phase FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 100 ml of 0–50% Buffer B gradient (Buffer B: Buffer A + 95% acetonitrile) was applied at 3 ml/min. Fractions eluting at ∼26% Buffer B containing amine derivative of CY5 were collected and lyophilized. Dried fractions were dissolved in 500 μl of N, N-dimethylformamide and 10 mg of maleimidylpropionic acid succinimidyl ester dissolved in 250 μl of N, N-dimethylformamide was added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, was diluted to ∼8 ml with Buffer A, and was run on a FPLC reverse phase column as described above. Fractions eluting at ∼27% Buffer B containing the maleimide derivative of CY5 were collected and lyophilized. CY5 maleimide was stored dry at −70 °C until used. E. coli K12 cell paste was obtained from University of Alabama Fermentation Facility. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. All mutants were generated using the CLONTECH Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that single-stranded DNA, isolated using phage M13K07 with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin selection, was used as the starting material. All sequencing primers and mutagenic oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) or from Ransom Hill Bioscience, Inc. (Ramona, CA). The plasmid containing the rpoD gene encoding ς70under the control of T7 polymerase promoter (pGEMD) was a gift from Dr. A. Ishihama (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). The identity of all mutants was confirmed using dideoxy DNA sequencing method (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs were introduced into the BL21 (DE3) strain (Novagen, Madison, WI). Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (15Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared 1 mm DTT was added to all steps of purification. Concentrations of the ς70 proteins were estimated using calculated molar extinction coefficients of 39,040m−1 cm−1 at 278 nm for each single cysteine ς70 mutant (16Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Core RNAP was purified from E. coli K12 cells using the method of Burgess and Jendrisak (17Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) utilizing chromatography on DNA-cellulose, Sephacryl 300 HR, and Bio-Rex 70 anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). Core RNAP was further purified on a 1-ml MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the method of Hager et al. (18Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Peak fractions containing core protein were pooled and concentrated using Microcon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). This additional purification step utilizing chromatography on a 1-ml MonoQ HR 5/5 was necessary to obtain core RNAP preparations free from impurities of wild type (wt) ς70or other proteins of similar size detectable after reaction of core RNAP with Cy5 maleimide or [3H]-N-ethylmaleimide. The concentration of core RNAP was estimated spectroscopically by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 0.55 ml/mg (2Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Fed. Proc. 1970; 29: 1164-1169PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of ς70 mutants was determined after reconstitution with an excess of purified core RNAP using a run-off transcription assay (19Busby S. Kolb A. Minchin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 397-411PubMed Google Scholar), with the fluorescent base analog UTP-γ-ANS (20Yarbrough L.R. Schlageck J.G. Baughman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12069-12073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) replacing the radioactive UTP as described previously (15Callaci S. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The reactivity (solvent accessibility) of cysteine residue in each single cysteine mutant of ς70was determined by measuring the rate of incorporation of Cy5 maleimide (see Fig. 2 A) to ς70 mutants. Mutant proteins stored in the storage buffer with 1 mm DTT were run on an FPLC Superdex 200 column to remove DTT and protein aggregates formed upon storage. Typically, 100 μl of 50–150 nmς70 mutants in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.25m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol were added to an Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 nmol of dry Cy5 maleimide to start the reaction. The concentration of Cy5 maleimide in the reaction mixture was thus 5 μm. At different times, 10-μl samples of the reaction mixture were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by the addition 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (36% glycerol, 12% SDS, 150 mm Tris, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue). Samples were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and were run until the dye front (and the excess of unreacted Cy5 maleimide) ran out of the gel. Wet gels were imaged with STORM (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using red fluorescence mode, and the amount of Cy5 incorporated to ς70 was determined from digital images of the gels using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). The pseudo-first order rate constants for Cy5 maleimide incorporation to ς70 were determined by nonlinear regression using the SCIENTIST program (Micromath, Salt Lake City, UT). Single cysteine mutants of ς70purified on Superdex 200 column were diluted to 50 nm in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.25 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol. To prepare holoenzyme samples, a 1.25 molar excess of the core RNA polymerase was added. The reaction with Cy5 maleimide was started by the addition of 20 μl of ς70 or the holoenzyme to an Eppendorf tube containing 0.1 nmol of Cy5 maleimide (5 μm Cy5 maleimide in the reaction mixture). The reaction, depending on the ς70 mutant used, was allowed to proceed for 30 s to 3 min. The time of the reaction for each mutant was selected based on results of rate of Cy5 maleimide incorporation experiments described above, such that at the selected time, no more than ∼50% reaction progress was achieved. Thus, both an increase and a decrease in cysteine reactivity in the presence of core RNAP could be recorded. The core RNAP contains 30 cysteine residues, 7 of which were reported to be accessible for chemical modification in the native core RNAP (21Selyutchenko O.A. Tchertov O.U. Lipkin V.M. Bioorg. Chim. 1985; 11: 480-491Google Scholar). Thus, it can be calculated that at the core RNAP concentration used in the cysteine reactivity measurements, less than 10% of the Cy5 maleimide present in solution could be used up by its incorporation into the core RNAP. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Reaction mixtures were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and the amount of Cy5 incorporated into ς70 was determined by scanning wet gels using STORM and by quantifying with ImageQuant as described above. 200-μl aliquots of single cysteine mutants of ς70 in storage buffer were run on a Superdex-200 FPLC sizing column equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.25m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, to remove DTT and protein aggregates formed upon storage. 500-μl peak fractions containing monomeric ς70 were treated for 1–2 h with 1 mm IANDB. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm DTT, and labeled proteins were purified on Superdex-200 FPLC sizing column equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.25 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA buffer. The extent of labeling was determined from the absorption spectrum of the protein using 25,000 m−1 cm−1 for the absorption coefficient of IANBD at 495 nm and 39,040m−1 cm−1 for the absorption coefficient of ς70 at 278 nm. The extent of labeling for different single cysteine mutants of ς70 was between 0.4 and 1.0 mol of IANBD/mol of ς70. Fluorescence emission spectra of IANBD-labeled ς70 samples were recorded with a SLM 500C fluorometer in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.25m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA buffer containing 5% glycerol. The excitation was at 495 nm. Spectra were corrected for buffer background, dilution, and instrumental factors. Core RNAP, when present, was at a 1.25 molar excess over ς70. In our approach, we used the reactivity of cysteine residues engineered into specific domains of the protein as indicators of a conformational response of these domains to ς70-core RNAP complex formation. The first step of this approach was to prepare single cysteine mutants of ς70 using site-directed mutagenesis. wt ς70 contains three cysteine residues at positions 132, 291, 295 and no disulfide bonds (22Narayanan C.S. Krakow J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2701-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Burgess R.R. Gross C. Engbaek F. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 390-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, a ς70 mutant ([Δcys]ς70) was constructed in which all endogenous cysteine residues were replaced with structurally similar serine residues. The mutant protein was expressed, purified, and found to exhibit ∼150% activity of the wt ς70 in an in vitro transcription assay (TableI). We therefore concluded that a replacement of all ς70 cysteine residues with serine residues had no negative effect on the function of the protein, as has also been observed recently by others (24Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Also, because transcriptional activity of ς70 involves numerous unique stereospecific interactions (ς70-core, ς70-duplex DNA, and ς70-single-stranded nontemplate DNA), the preservation of transcriptional activity in [Δcys]ς70 suggests that the conformation of the mutant protein was also not significantly affected by the Cys to Ser change. The increased activity of [Δcys]ς70 compared with the wt ς70 protein may be due to the resistance of the mutant to inactivation due to chemical modifications of cysteine (cross-linking, binding of heavy metals, etc.).Table ITranscriptional activities of single cysteine mutants of ς70ProteinActivity (% of wt ς70 activity)Activity (% of [Δcys] ς70 activity)[1C]ς70163109[A59C]ς7012583[S366C]ς709664[S438C]ς705637[T440C]ς708959[S442C]ς7014295[T583C]ς709463[R588C]ς709060[R596C]ς70151100Transcriptional activity was measured using holoenzymes reconstituted with mutant ς70 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Transcriptional activity was measured using holoenzymes reconstituted with mutant ς70 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the next step, single cysteine residues were introduced into [Δcys]ς70. Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of the primary structure of ς70, in which the positions of introduced cysteine residues are indicated. The logic behind selecting particular sites for introducing cysteines into region 2.4 and 4.2 was as follows. In each region, we selected one residue implicated by previous mutagenesis studies to be directly involved in the function of the particular region. Although incorporating cysteine into these positions could potentially affect DNA binding or transcriptional activity due to the replacement of a residue making a direct contact with promoter DNA, we reasoned that even if this would occur, the cysteine would still be able to report a change in conformation at the critical sites in response to binding core RNAP. Additionally, two sites in each region were chosen that were close to these residues but for which no direct interaction with DNA has been proposed so far. We reasoned that we could use these additional single cysteine mutants to monitor conformational changes in region 2 and region 4 without affecting DNA binding activity. Using this logic, mutants representing region 2.4 include [A438C]ς70, [T440C]ς70, and [S442C]ς70. Threonine at position 440 was suggested to contact position −12 of promoter DNA (7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Residues 438 and 442 are also on the same α-helix (26Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of residue 438 resulted in no change of promoter recognition activity of ς70 (7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), although this residue is located near residue 437, which was suggested to also be involved in recognition of position −12 of the promoter (5Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutations at position 442 have not been described previously. Region 4.2 single cysteine mutants include [T583C]ς70, [R588C]ς70, and [R596C]ς70. Arginine at position 588 is located within the second helix of the proposed helix-turn-helix motif of region 4.2 and was presumed to contact the −33 base of promoter DNA (6Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Threonine at position 583 is the last residue in the turn of the proposed helix-turn-helix of region 4.2 and is one residue away from Arg584, which was suggested to contact position −31 of promoter DNA (7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Arg596 is located outside of the second helix of the region 4.2 helix-turn-helix motif. Point mutations at this position, previously constructed by Siegele et al. (7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), were found to have no observable effects on promoter recognition. Information regarding the possible function of specific residues in region 1 is very limited. Our two mutants in this region are [1C]ς70, in which cysteine was inserted between the initiation Met residue and the second residue of ς70, and [A59C]ς70, located within region 1.1. The residue at position 59 was selected because alanine containing no side chain was unlikely to be involved in any critical interactions, and this residue is close to residue 55, which was previously suggested to be involved in interacting with Trp433 of region 2.4 in free ς70 (11Gopal V. Ma H.W. Kumaran M.K. Chatterji D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Gopal V. Chatterji D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, a mutant at position 366 ([S366C]ς70) was prepared. This position is in a nonconserved region of ς70 (Fig. 1), within a portion of ς70 determined to be necessary for efficient core binding (28Lesley S.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7728-7734Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We used the reactivity of a cysteine at this position as an indicator of conformation outside conserved regions 1, 2, and 4. Each of the single cysteine mutants of ς70 was expressed and purified to near-homogeneity. One striking observation made was that the mobility in SDS-PAGE of [R588C]ς70 was different from all other mutant ς70 and wt ς70 (not shown). The calculated molecular mass of ς70 is 70,263 Da, but it is known to migrate as a band of apparent molecular mass of around 90 kDa (29Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Replacement of arginine with cysteine at position 588 produced a protein that migrated in SDS-PAGE as ∼70-kDa band (not shown). The changes in SDS-PAGE mobility of ς70 in response to a single amino acid replacement has been observed previously (11Gopal V. Ma H.W. Kumaran M.K. Chatterji D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Gopal V. Chatterji D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Analysis of [R588C]ς70 mutant on Superdex-200 sizing column indicated that this protein was smaller than wt ς70, and Western blot analysis using a C-terminal antibody as a probe suggested that the C terminus of [R588C]ς70 was missing (not shown). It is thus possible that [R588C]ς70 was proteolytically more unstable resulting in purification of a truncated protein. Therefore, this protein was not used for further studies. The activity of each single cysteine mutant was compared with the activity of wt ς70 using reconstituted RNAP in anin vitro run-off transcription assay (19Busby S. Kolb A. Minchin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 397-411PubMed Google Scholar). All single cysteine mutants prepared were found to be active (Table I), and the activity varied between 37 and 109% of the [Δcys]ς70 (56 and 163% of the wt ς70). The lowest activity was exhibited by [S438C]ς70 (37% of [Δcys]ς70, 56% of wt ς70). This residue was not previously indicated as a DNA contact residue of ς70 but is one residue away from residue 437, for which such a role was suggested before (5Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues at positions 1, 442, and 596 had no effect on the activity of the protein, whereas cysteines at positions 59, 366, 440, 583, and 588 resulted in a moderate decrease in the activity of the protein (>50% of [Δcys]ς70 activity remaining). Among the positions showing moderate decrease in the activity were positions 440 and 588, which were previously indicated as direct DNA contact residues (6Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The decrease in activity, rather than complete inactivation, of mutants at these positions is not surprising because original mutations at position 440 and 588 were identified as altered specificity mutants with no effect on the activity of the wt promoter (6Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The overall design of our experiments was to use the rate of incorporation of thiol-specific reagent Cy5 maleimide (Fig. 2 A) to single cysteine mutants of ς70 as a measure of reactivity of unique cysteine residues of these mutants. We used Cy5 maleimide because it can be detected in STORM fluoroimager with femtomolar sensitivity, allowing the use of nanomolar protein concentrations in cysteine reactivity experiments. Because ς70 can be easily separated from the remaining RNAP subunits on SDS-PAGE, both reactivity of cysteines in free ς70 and in core-bound ς70 could be measured. The assumption in this experimental design is that the rate of incorporation of maleimide label into ς70 band in SDS-PAGE does indeed correspond to the reactivity of a single cysteine residue of a particular mutant (maleimide can also react with low efficiency with histidine and the α-amino group of amino acids (30Gregory J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 3922-3930Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar)). Thus, two control experiments were performed to validate this assumption. In the first experiment (Fig. 2 B), we showed that under our experimental conditions, maleimide incorporation was entirely due to reaction with cysteines. This conclusion is based upon observation that no maleimide incorporation was observed in the case of [Δcys]ς70, free or core-bound (Fig. 2 B), whereas efficient maleimide incorporation under the same conditions was observed in the case of wt protein (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3). In the second experiment (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4–6), we showed that the preparation of the core RNAP used to prepare holoenzymes with single cyst"

To investigate whether versican plays a role in cell differentiation, we studied its role in mesenchymal condensation and chondrogenesis. Here we report that a mini-versican gene product inhibits mesenchymal chondrogenesis but not condensation. The mini-versican-treated mesenchymal cultures form fewer, smaller cartilaginous nodules and produced lower levels of link protein and type II collagen. The versican G3 domain alone, but not G1, was sufficient to inhibit mesenchymal chondrogenesis. Deletion of two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motifs in the G3 domain abolished the effect of versican. The G3 domain of aggrecan, which does not contain an EGF-like motif, did not inhibit mesenchymal chondrogenesis. We also generated a chimera construct containing the two EGF-like motifs of versican and the G3 domain of aggrecan, and we observed that this chimera construct inhibited chondrogenesis to a lesser extent than did the full-length versican G3 construct. Direct transfection of mesenchymal cells with different constructs produced similar results. Furthermore, treatment with versican antisense oligonucleotides and transfection with a versican antisense construct promoted chondrogenesis. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that versican inhibits mesenchymal chondrogenesis via its EGF-like motifs. Versican is a highly expressed proteoglycan in zones of developing tissues.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which also includes aggrecan, neurocan, and brevican. All contain G1 domains at their amino termini and G3 domains at their carboxyl termini. A varying number of chondroitin sulfate side chains are attached to a central chondroitin sulfate bearing sequence; in versican, 12–15 chondroitin sulfate side chains are covalently attached to this sequence (1Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 11Krusius T. Gehlsen K.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13120-13125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This central sequence contains two alternatively spliced domains, glycosaminoglycan-α and glycosaminoglycan-β (12Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmermann D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32992-32998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Naso M.F. Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1995; 29: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The functions of these proteoglycans remain elusive. Different domains may be involved in different cellular processes. The G1 domain of versican, as well as that of other members of that family, binds hyaluronan and may participate in matrix assembly and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The G3 domain, consisting of lectin-like (also called carbohydrate regulatory domain), epidermal growth factor-like (EGF1-like), and complement binding protein motifs, is structurally similar to the selectin family (15Springer T.A. Lasky L.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). But whereas selectins play a role in mediating cell adhesion, no such function has been identified for the G3 domain of versican. It is possible that the EGF-like and lectin-like motifs are involved in intercellular signaling or cell recognition processes. The chondroitin sulfate chains of versican are reported to inhibit cell adhesion (16Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yamagata M. Saga S. Kato M. Bernfield M. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 55-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Thus, versican is suspected to play a role in cellular attachment, migration, and proliferation by interacting with cell surfaces and extracellular matrix molecules (1Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 3Shinomura T. Jensen K.L. Yamagata M. Kimata K. Solursh M. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been reported that versican interferes with the attachment of cells to various extracellular matrix components such as type I collagen, fibronectin, and laminin (16Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acts to inhibit cell adhesion (17Yamagata M. Saga S. Kato M. Bernfield M. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 55-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yamagata M. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It may also play a role in the formation of tissues that act as barriers to migratory neural crest cells and outgrowing axons during embryonic development (19Landolt R.M. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. Development. 1995; 121: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of versican appears to be developmentally regulated in some cases. For example, during hair development, versican is not expressed until the hair follicle starts to grow (20du Cros D.L. LeBaron R.G. Couchman J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 426-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Versican expression intensifies with follicle maturation, reaches a maximum at the height of the growth phase, diminishes at the end of the phase, and disappears as the follicle enters the next hair cycle. Thus, versican expression is turned on and off in each cycle, and it appears that its expression correlates with cell differentiation. Furthermore, versican is transiently expressed during mesenchymal condensation. Versican is highly expressed in condensing mesenchyme, but during the transition from mesenchyme to cartilage, the expression of versican is down-regulated and finally is restricted to the periphery of the newly formed cartilage.To study the role of versican in tissue development, we introduced a mini-versican gene product into an in vitro mesenchymal condensation and chondrogenesis model, and we observed that it inhibited mesenchymal differentiation. This was further confirmed using antisense and transfection studies. Studies using versican constructs lacking the EGF-like motif indicated that this motif is responsible for the inhibiting effect.DISCUSSIONVersican is found in significant concentrations in tissues where the cells are actively proliferating, for example, embryonic tissues and the epidermal proliferative zone (3Shinomura T. Jensen K.L. Yamagata M. Kimata K. Solursh M. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Landolt R.M. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. Development. 1995; 121: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that versican may be involved in cell growth, and our previous work has indeed confirmed that versican stimulates cell proliferation (21Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Since cell growth and differentiation are usually antagonistic, we hypothesized that versican would affect cell differentiation. In this study, we report that versican does inhibit mesenchymal chondrogenesis but not condensation. The inhibition is apparently mediated, at least in part, by the G3 domain of versican and specifically by the EGF-like motifs.To determine the effects of versican, we devised an in vitroassay system using chick mesenchymal cells in culture. Our findings show that such assays are sensitive and require careful calibration of mesenchymal age and cell plating density to detect the effects of versican. After extensive experimentation, we determined that limb buds harvested in stages 22–24 were optimal for our work.In the in vitro assay, cell differentiation was monitored using three separate methods. Morphological changes provided one measure of cell differentiation: as cultures differentiate, they produce characteristic “swirls” (high densities of cells and matrix) which later develop into cartilaginous nodules and increase in size over time. The second method of assessing differentiation involved histochemical techniques. Two major products of chondrocytes are aggrecan and link protein (32Stirpe N.S. Argraves W.S. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Alcian blue, a dye that nonspecifically stains glycosaminoglycan chains, easily detects aggrecan that possesses 100–150 chondroitin sulfate and keratin sulfate side chains. Thus, staining cultures with Alcian blue allowed detection of chondrogenesis even at early stages. Third, although aggrecan is a poor choice for monitoring the onset of chondrogenesis by immunoblot analysis as it appears on SDS-PAGE as a large smear over 500 kDa, link protein is a convenient marker for chondrogenesis. Anti-link protein antibody recognizes a discrete 52-kDa protein on an immunoblot, and although link protein appears in most tissues, it is found at high concentrations only in mature cartilage (33Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We did not detect link protein in areas of cell condensation. Since type II collagen is also a major component of cartilage, we have confirmed our results by collagen staining. Results obtained using the above techniques (morphologic analysis, Alcian blue staining, and expression of link protein) were all consistent with the inhibition of chondrogenesis by the mini-versican.In our first studies of the effects of versican on chondrogenesis, we used versican gene product, manufactured by transfected COS-7 or NIH3T3 cells and secreted into their growth media (21Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By using this system, however, we could not exclude the possibility that inhibitory effects of versican on differentiation were indirect. The gene product may have interacted with other proteins to produce unidentified factors that may have been secreted into the medium, causing the observed effects. To investigate if versican acts directly, we purified the mini-versican product and demonstrated that the purified product also inhibited chondrogenesis. We used a Ni-NTA affinity column to purify the mini-versican. With extensive washing, we were always able to obtain purified products with undetectable contamination stained by silver. However, the purified products were always diluted during dialysis. The products were not concentrated in order to maintain the products in its active forms. What is important in our assay is that the purified mini-versican, although at a much lower concentration compared with those expressed by COS-7 and mesenchymal cells, inhibited mesenchymal chondrogenesis. We also used transfection and antisense approaches. Results obtained from mesenchymal cell cultures transfected with versican constructs confirmed our hypothesis that the mini-versican itself inhibits differentiation. Moreover, all versican antisense oligonucleotides and versican antisense constructs also inhibited the effect of versican on chondrogenesis. We hypothesize that at the concentration of oligonucleotides used or in the presence of antisense construct, translation of versican mRNA was inhibited.Before cells can differentiate, they must first undergo condensation. The question that arises is whether versican interferes with the differentiation process by preventing condensation. To monitor condensation, PNA, which binds to the extracellular aggregates in condensed mesenchymal cultures (27Aulthouse A.L. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was used. Treatment with versican or versican antisense oligonucleotides had no obvious effect on the number of PNA-stained foci observed during early stages of treatment. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that mesenchymal cells isolated from stage 22–24 embryos already contain endogenous condensation signals nor that condensation was an automatic response to high culture density. Neither exogenous addition of versican gene product nor versican antisense oligonucleotides affected condensation; however, whereas the gene product also inhibited subsequent differentiation in the culture, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides and antisense construct actually seemed to enhance chondrogenesis. Given that versican stimulates cell proliferation, and versican expression must be down-regulated before chondrogenesis can proceed, it may be that exposure to the versican gene product prevented the initiation of chondrogenesis, whereas blocking expression of versican with antisense oligonucleotides actually triggered a differentiation pathway.Given, then, that versican does not function by blocking events prerequisite to differentiation, such as condensation, but seems to inhibit the differentiation process itself, we were interested in characterizing the mechanism of its activity. By treating mesenchymal cultures with the gene products of constructs expressing various domains of the versican molecule, we found in the present study that the G3 domain of versican alone can inhibit differentiation. This domain comprises three separate sections as follows: a set of epidermal growth factor-like motifs, a carbohydrate recognition sequence, and a complement-binding protein-like sequence. When cells were treated with the products of a mini-versican construct lacking the EGF-like motifs or with aggrecan G3 domain (which does not contain EGF-like motif), the culture underwent chondrogenesis, implying that the EGF-like motifs were involved in the inhibition. These results were confirmed by direct transfection of mesenchymal cells with the above constructs. Consistent with our results, a protein containing EGF-like repeats has also been reported to prevent differentiation in adipocyte precursors (29Smas C., M. Sui H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Nor is this inhibition directly related to the ability of EGF to stimulate proliferation: EGF's inhibition of differentiation appears to operate via a separate mechanism (34Serrero G. Lepak N. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20 (compare): 58-64PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments too, the inhibitory effects of versican are distinct and not directly related to its stimulatory effects, since the amount of versican gene product required to prevent differentiation was less than the amount required to stimulate mesenchymal proliferation (data not shown). It should be mentioned that the EGF-like motifs of versican are necessary for the inhibition of chondrogenesis but are by themselves not sufficient for this function since a chimeric construct containing the EGF-like motifs of versican and the G3 domain of aggrecan only partially inhibited chondrogenesis as compared with the vG3 domain construct. These results suggest that other motifs in the G3 domain are involved in the effect of versican on chondrogenesis. We are currently studying the roles of other motifs.Evidence from this study and from other studies suggests that the proteoglycan versican may play an important and complex role in cell growth and differentiation. It simulates cell proliferation, both directly, through its G1 and EGF-like subdomains, and indirectly; and it inhibits cell differentiation, an effect mediated by its EGF-like subdomains. The physiological significance of these findings remains to be determined. Versican is expressed in a variety of tissues. High concentrations are found in embryonic tissues, such as human embryonic lung (1Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the mesenchymal cell condensation area of limb buds (2Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M. Uritani M. Suzuki S.

Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In adult tissues, versican is detected in the loose connective tissue of various organs including most smooth muscles, the central and peripheral nervous systems, the luminal surface of glandular epithelia (5Bode-Lesniewska B.

By treating mesenchymal cultures with the gene products of constructs expressing various domains of the versican molecule, we found in the present study that the G3 domain of versican alone can inhibit differentiation. This domain comprises three separate sections as follows: a set of epidermal growth factor-like motifs, a carbohydrate recognition sequence, and a complement-binding protein-like sequence. When cells were treated with the products of a mini-versican construct lacking the EGF-like motifs or with aggrecan G3 domain (which does not contain EGF-like motif), the culture underwent chondrogenesis, implying that the EGF-like motifs were involved in the inhibition. These results were confirmed by direct transfection of mesenchymal cells with the above constructs. Consistent with our results, a protein containing EGF-like repeats has also been reported to prevent differentiation in adipocyte precursors (29Smas C., M. Sui H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Nor is this inhibition directly related to the ability of EGF to stimulate proliferation: EGF's inhibition of differentiation appears to operate via a separate mechanism (34Serrero G. Lepak N. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20 (compare): 58-64PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments too, the inhibitory effects of versican are distinct and not directly related to its stimulatory effects, since the amount of versican gene product required to prevent differentiation was less than the amount required to stimulate mesenchymal proliferation (data not shown). It should be mentioned that the EGF-like motifs of versican are necessary for the inhibition of chondrogenesis but are by themselves not sufficient for this function since a chimeric construct containing the EGF-like motifs of versican and the G3 domain of aggrecan only partially inhibited chondrogenesis as compared with the vG3 domain construct. These results suggest that other motifs in the G3 domain are involved in the effect of versican on chondrogenesis. We are currently studying the roles of other motifs.Evidence from this study and from other studies suggests that the proteoglycan versican may play an important and complex role in cell growth and differentiation. It simulates cell proliferation, both directly, through its G1 and EGF-like subdomains, and indirectly; and it inhibits cell differentiation, an effect mediated by its EGF-like subdomains. The physiological significance of these findings remains to be determined. Versican is found in significant concentrations in tissues where the cells are actively proliferating, for example, embryonic tissues and the epidermal proliferative zone (3Shinomura T. Jensen K.L. Yamagata M. Kimata K. Solursh M. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J.

This indicates that versican may be involved in cell growth, and our previous work has indeed confirmed that versican stimulates cell proliferation (21Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Since cell growth and differentiation are usually antagonistic, we hypothesized that versican would affect cell differentiation. In this study, we report that versican does inhibit mesenchymal chondrogenesis but not condensation. The inhibition is apparently mediated, at least in part, by the G3 domain of versican and specifically by the EGF-like motifs. To determine the effects of versican, we devised an in vitroassay system using chick mesenchymal cells in culture. Our findings show that such assays are sensitive and require careful calibration of mesenchymal age and cell plating density to detect the effects of versican. After extensive experimentation, we determined that limb buds harvested in stages 22–24 were optimal for our work. In the in vitro assay, cell differentiation was monitored using three separate methods. Morphological changes provided one measure of cell differentiation: as cultures differentiate, they produce characteristic “swirls” (high densities of cells and matrix) which later develop into cartilaginous nodules and increase in size over time. The second method of assessing differentiation involved histochemical techniques. Two major products of chondrocytes are aggrecan and link protein (32Stirpe N.S. Argraves W.S. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Alcian blue, a dye that nonspecifically stains glycosaminoglycan chains, easily detects aggrecan that possesses 100–150 chondroitin sulfate and keratin sulfate side chains. Thus, staining cultures with Alcian blue allowed detection of chondrogenesis even at early stages. Third, although aggrecan is a poor choice for monitoring the onset of chondrogenesis by immunoblot analysis as it appears on SDS-PAGE as a large smear over 500 kDa, link protein is a convenient marker for chondrogenesis. Anti-link protein antibody recognizes a discrete 52-kDa protein on an immunoblot, and although link protein appears in most tissues, it is found at high concentrations only in mature cartilage (33Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We did not detect link protein in areas of cell condensation. Since type II collagen is also a major component of cartilage, we have confirmed our results by collagen staining. Results obtained using the above techniques (morphologic analysis, Alcian blue staining, and expression of link protein) were all consistent with the inhibition of chondrogenesis by the mini-versican. In our first studies of the effects of versican on chondrogenesis, we used versican gene product, manufactured by transfected COS-7 or NIH3T3 cells and secreted into their growth media (21Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By using this system, however, we could not exclude the possibility that inhibitory effects of versican on differentiation were indirect. The gene product may have interacted with other proteins to produce unidentified factors that may have been secreted into the medium, causing the observed effects. To investigate if versican acts directly, we purified the mini-versican product and demonstrated that the purified product also inhibited chondrogenesis. We used a Ni-NTA affinity column to purify the mini-versican. With extensive washing, we were always able to obtain purified products with undetectable contamination stained by silver. However, the purified products were always diluted during dialysis. The products were not concentrated in order to maintain the products in its active forms. What is important in our assay is that the purified mini-versican, although at a much lower concentration compared with those expressed by COS-7 and mesenchymal cells, inhibited mesenchymal chondrogenesis. We also used transfection and antisense approaches. Results obtained from mesenchymal cell cultures transfected with versican constructs confirmed our hypothesis that the mini-versican itself inhibits differentiation. Moreover, all versican antisense oligonucleotides and versican antisense constructs also inhibited the effect of versican on chondrogenesis. We hypothesize that at the concentration of oligonucleotides used or in the presence of antisense construct, translation of versican mRNA was inhibited. Before cells can differentiate, they must first undergo condensation. The question that arises is whether versican interferes with the differentiation process by preventing condensation. To monitor condensation, PNA, which binds to the extracellular aggregates in condensed mesenchymal cultures (27Aulthouse A.L. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was used. Treatment with versican or versican antisense oligonucleotides had no obvious effect on the number of PNA-stained foci observed during early stages of treatment. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that mesenchymal cells isolated from stage 22–24 embryos already contain endogenous condensation signals nor that condensation was an automatic response to high culture density. Neither exogenous addition of versican gene product nor versican antisense oligonucleotides affected condensation; however, whereas the gene product also inhibited subsequent differentiation in the culture, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides and antisense construct actually seemed to enhance chondrogenesis. Given that versican stimulates cell proliferation, and versican expression must be down-regulated before chondrogenesis can proceed, it may be that exposure to the versican gene product prevented the initiation of chondrogenesis, whereas blocking expression of versican with antisense oligonucleotides actually triggered a differentiation pathway.

The mutants were then expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using a His-tag. Even though the mutants bind to the flap DNA to different degrees, most of the mutants lost flap nuclease activity with the exception of an E160D mutant. This mutant retained wild type-like binding ability, specificity, and partial catalytic activity. Detailed steady state and pre-steady state kinetic analysis revealed that the functional deficiency of this mutant was due to retardation of the endonucleolytic cleavage. When the mutant enzyme E160D was expressed in yeast, it partially complements the biological functions of the homologous yeast gene, RAD27, and reverses the hyper-temperature lethality and hypersensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate, in a manner corresponding to the in vitro activity."

Antibodies specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on serines 63 or 73 were obtained from New England BioLabs; antibodies to AP1 (c-Jun) were from Transduction Laboratories; antibodies specific for JNK phosphorylated on the threonine and tyrosine residues within the TPY motif were from Promega; and antibodies to JNK1 (C-17), JunD, or JunB were from Santa Cruz. A GST-c-Jun(1–89) fusion protein was obtained from New England BioLabs, and GST-c-Jun(1–79) was from Stratagene. The purified active dually phosphorylated form of JNK1α was supplied by T. Osterfield at New England BioLabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase and the double-stranded oligonucleotides AP1 and SP1 were from Promega. Poly(dI-dC):poly(dI-dC) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and precast polyacrylamide minigels (10–20%) were from Novex or Daiichi. Normal human fibroblasts (MRC5CV1) and AT fibroblasts (AT5BIVA, AT4BIVA, and AT3BIVA) were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 15% (normal cells) or 20% (AT cells) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Hydrocortisone (5 μg/ml) was also included for AT cells. All of the cell lines used in this study were immortalized with simian virus 40 (40Jung M. Lee S.A. Zhang Y. Dritschilo A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1997; 37: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and were checked for mycoplasma contamination every 6 months. Before exposure of cells to ionizing radiation or UV-C light, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium for 24 h. Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a JL Shepherd Mark I Radiator with a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 3.83 Gy/min. UV-C light was delivered at a rate of 60 J/m2 using the UV Stratalinker. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping from the culture dishes into ice-cold equilibrium buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) (41Lee S.A. Karaszkiewicz J.W. Anderson W.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3750-3759PubMed Google Scholar), and disrupted by 100 strokes (pestle B) with a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclear fraction was isolated by centrifugation of the total cell homogenate at 800 × g for 5 min, resuspension of the resulting pellet in equilibrium buffer, and centrifugation of the resulting suspension at 600 × g for 15 min. The resulting nuclear pellet was washed two times and then solubilized with 1% CHAPS detergent on ice overnight. The cytosolic fraction was isolated by centrifugation of the 10,000 × gsupernatant at 25,000 × g for 2 h. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford protein assay (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Subcellular fractions were denatured by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10–20% gels, after which the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After transfer, the membrane was incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and then with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immune complex kinase assays, nuclear or cytosolic proteins were incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibodies to JNK1 (C-17) and then for an additional 2 h in the presence of UltraLink Protein A/G Plus (Pierce). Immune complexes were washed four times with IgG binding buffer (Pierce), twice with equilibrium buffer, and once with kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The complexes were then incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), 50 μm ATP, and 2 μg of GST-c-Jun(1–79). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 × SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10–20% gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal loading, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. Alternatively, JNK activity was determined by incubation of nuclear proteins for 20 min at 30 °C with 4 μg of GST-c-Jun(1–89) in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP. Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun or endogenous c-Jun was detected by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on serine 73. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) specific for AP1 binding was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, poly(dI-dC):poly(dI-dC) (0.025 mg/ml), 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 4% glycerol) in a final volume of 11.5 μl and then for an additional 10 min at 4 °C to allow AP1 dimerization. After the addition of 1 μl of 32P-labeled AP1 oligonucleotide (∼35,000 cpm, 0.035 pmol), the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature and then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 5% gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Electrophoresis was continued until the dye front had migrated over 75% of the gel. A 50-fold excess of either unlabeled AP1 oligonucleotide or a control nonspecific oligonucleotide (SP1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) or antibodies to c-Jun, to JunD, or to JunB were added to the dimerization reaction for determination of specific binding or “supershift” analysis, respectively. Regulation of the transcription factor AP1 is achieved by changes in the expression of members of the Jun and Fos families of proteins (43Vogt P.K. Bos T.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 55: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 44Curran T. Abate C. Baker S. Kerppola T. Xanthoudakis S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 28: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar) and by their post-translational modifications by phosphorylation (45Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). We first investigated the effects of ionizing radiation on c-Jun expression. MRC5CV1 (control), and AT5BIVA fibroblasts were exposed to various doses of ionizing radiation and harvested 2 h later. Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were then isolated and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to c-Jun. Expression of c-Jun was detected predominantly in the nuclear fractions of both cell types (Fig. 1). However, whereas ionizing radiation increased the amount of nuclear c-Jun in MRC5CV1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximal effect apparent at 20 Gy, it had no such effect on AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 1). The time course of the effect of ionizing radiation on c-Jun expression was then examined in MRC5CV1 cells and in AT fibroblasts (AT5BIVA, AT4BIVA, and AT3BIVA) derived from different patients (Fig. 2). The amount of c-Jun in the nucleus was increased within 30 min and reached a maximum within 2–4 h in MRC5CV1 cells, whereas no induction was observed in AT5BIVA or AT3BIVA cells. The amount of nuclear c-Jun in AT4BIVA cells was increased at 30 min and further increased at 1–2 h, although the extent of induction was much less than that apparent in MRC5CV1 cells.Figure 2Effects of ionizing radiation and UV-C light on the expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun in normal human fibroblasts and AT cells. MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells (A) and AT4BIVA and AT3BIVA cells (B) were exposed to 20 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) and harvested at the indicated times thereafter. Nuclear proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for total c-Jun (both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms; designated as c-Jun), for c-Jun phosphorylated on serine 63, and for c-Jun phosphorylated on serine 73.C, MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells were exposed to 60 J/m2 of UV-C light and harvested 1 h later, after which nuclear proteins were isolated and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on serine 73 or antibodies specific for JNKs phosphorylated on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined the phosphorylation status of these serine residues after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation by performing immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on either serine 63 or serine 73 (Fig. 2). In MRC5CV1 cells, ionizing radiation induced the phosphorylation of nuclear c-Jun on both serines 63 and 73 in a time-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of c-Jun on each of the two serine residues was apparent within 30 min and maximal within 2–4 h. In contrast, ionizing radiation did not induce phosphorylation of c-Jun in any of the AT cell lines. UV-C irradiation induced phosphorylation of c-Jun on both serine residues in both normal and AT cells (Fig. 2 C), consistent with previous reports (6Shafman T.D. Saleem A. Kyriakis J. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3242-3245PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the impaired c-Jun phosphorylation in AT cells was due to a defect in JNK expression, we examined the effect of ionizing radiation on JNK abundance in nuclei and cytosol by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies that recognize the COOH terminus of the p46 isoform of JNK1 (Fig. 3). Substantial amounts of p46 JNK isoforms were present in both nuclei and cytosol of both MRC5CV1 and AT cells, and ionizing radiation did not further increase JNK expression. Similar results were obtained by immunoblot analysis with antibody (New England Biolabs) to the full-length p55 isoform of JNK1 (data not shown). The sequence of the peptide used for generation of the antibodies to the p46 isoform of JNK1 is 70, 59, 41, 82, and 53% identical to the corresponding sequences of p55 JNK1, p46 JNK2, p55 JNK2, p46 JNK3, and p55 JNK3, respectively (46Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that p46 JNK1, which is a major JNK1 isoform (31Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar), was preferentially detected in our immunoblot analysis with these antibodies. The p55 isoform of JNK2 has been shown to exhibit a higher kinase activity and binding affinity for c-Jun than does p46 JNK1 (26Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, JNK2 protein expression was not detected in the cells used in the present study (data not shown). The activation of JNKs is mediated by phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within the TPY motif (27Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 28Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. David R.J.

A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the phosphorylation patterns of JNKs in MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the active form of dually phosphorylated JNKs (Fig. 4). The p46 isoforms of dually phosphorylated JNKs were constitutively expressed in the nuclei but not in the cytosol of both MRC5CV1 and AT5BIVA cells. The levels of constitutively phosphorylated nuclear JNKs in the AT cells were greater than that in the control cells. Ionizing radiation did not change the abundance of dually phosphorylated JNKs in either cell type. Phosphorylated p55 JNK isoforms were not detected in control or AT cells exposed to ionizing radiation. The fact that they were detected in cells stimulated by CdCl2 (data not shown) suggests that this observation was not the result of preferential selectivity of the antibodies for phosphorylated p46 isoforms. The subcellular localization and phosphorylation states of JNKs appear normal in AT cells. To examine directly the effect of ionizing radiation on JNK activity, we performed immune complex kinase assays using antibodies to JNK1 and GST-c-Jun(1–79) as the substrate. A 3-fold increase in nuclear JNK activity was observed 1 h following irradiation in MRC5CV1 cells but not in AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 5 A). Whereas immune complexes derived from 10 μg of nuclear proteins from control cells were sufficient to demonstrate this increase in JNK activity, kinase activity was not detectable in immune complexes prepared from up to 100 μg of cytosolic proteins from irradiated MRC5CV1 cells (Fig. 5 A). To exclude the possibility that the increase in nuclear JNK activity was due to the translocation of activated JNKs from the cytosol to the nucleus, we also measured kinase activities in extracts of cells prepared 30 min after irradiation. Again, no increases in cytosolic JNK activity were detected (data not shown). The phosphorylation of c-Jun on serines 63 and 73 in vitrois catalyzed by all known JNK isoforms. However, different subsets of JNKs are thought to be selectively activated in cells depending on the signaling pathways triggered by a given stimulus (21Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Because of the sequence homologies among JNK isoforms, antibodies are not strictly specific to a particular isoform. JNK activity following ionizing radiation in intact cells may represent isoform overlap. Furthermore, demonstration of phosphorylation of c-Jun on serines 63 and 73 by a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-inducible 67-kDa protein indicates the existence of kinases other than JNKs that phosphorylate the NH2-terminal region of c-Jun (47Alder V. Polotskaya A. Wagner F. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17001-17005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Alder V. Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We next examined the effect of ionizing radiation on total c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity using kinase reactions containing nuclear proteins and GST-c-Jun(1–89). The phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was detected by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for c-Jun phosphorylated on serine 73 (Fig. 5 B). Induction of nuclear c-Jun kinase activity was apparent within 30 min of irradiation of MRC5CV1 cells, reached a maximum within 1 h, and remained increased after 2 and 4 h. In contrast, ionizing radiation had no effect on nuclear c-Jun kinase activity in any of the three AT cell lines. Similar results were obtained with a solid phase kinase assay in which GST-c-Jun(1–89) was immobilized on GSH-Sepharose bea"

The results of this study provide further important insight into the mechanism of the topoisomerase II site-directed alkylation of DNA by psorospermin and its subsequent effects on the topoisomerase II-induced DNA cleavage. First, we demonstrate that the topoisomerase II-induced alkylation of DNA by psorospermin occurs at a time preceding the topoisomerase II-mediated strand cleavage event, because it occurs in the absence of Mg2+. We confirm that the alkylation of DNA by psorospermin takes place at N-7 of guanine in the presence of topoisomerase II, because substitution of the target guanine by 7-deazaguanine prevents alkylation. Because the stimulation of the topoisomerase II-induced DNA cleavage by psorospermin can be slowly reversed by the addition of excess salt, this indicates that alkylation of DNA by psorospermin traps a reversible topoisomerase II-DNA complex. Both the DNA alkylation by psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II and the enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage elevated by psorospermin are more enhanced at acidic pH values, in accordance with the increased stability of the topoisomerase II-DNA complex at acidic pH values. Finally, our results suggest that it is the psorospermin-DNA adducts, not the abasic sites resulting from depurination, that are responsible for the stimulation of the topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage. Because the precise location of the psorospermin within the topoisomerase II cleavage site is known, together with the covalent DNA linkage chemistry and the conformation of the psorospermin-DNA adduct, this structural insight provides an excellent opportunity for the design and synthesis of new, more effective topoisomerase II poisons.

It is active against drug-resistant human leukemia lines and AIDS-related lymphoma. 1Drug Development Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health, personal communication to J. Cassady. In the initial mechanistic studies using recovered SV40 DNA from psorospermin-treated cells, it was found that numerous abasic sites were generated on the DNA. The extensive loss of DNA bases was proposed to lead to DNA strand breaks and protein-DNA cross-links, which might be responsible for the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of this compound (5Permana P.A. Ho D.K. Cassady J.M. Snapka R.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3191-3195PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, although topoisomerase I and II can form cross-links to DNA in the presence of psorospermin, it was suggested that these cross-links are not specific (5Permana P.A. Ho D.K. Cassady J.M. Snapka R.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3191-3195PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated that psorospermin alkylation at specific sites on DNA was greatly enhanced in the presence of topoisomerase II, 2Kwok, Y., Zeng, Q., and Hurley, L. H. (1998)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. indicating that the antitumor activity of psorospermin might be related to its specific interaction with the topoisomerase II-DNA complex. Type II topoisomerases are essential nuclear enzymes that regulate the topological status of DNA (7Wang J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase II catalytic cycle consists of several discrete steps. First, topoisomerase II forms a noncovalent complex with duplex DNA. In the presence of Mg2+, a double-stranded DNA cleavage and re-ligation equilibrium is then established at the prestrand passage stage, with a topoisomerase II tyrosine residue attached to the 5′-phosphate of the broken DNA. Next, after the binding of ATP, an intact DNA duplex is passed through the transient double-stranded break site (or “gate site”). A poststrand passage equilibrium involving DNA breakage and re-ligation is then established. Finally, after the re-ligation, ATP is hydrolyzed to facilitate enzyme turnover and the initiation of a subsequent cycle (8Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A number of clinically important anticancer drugs have been shown to kill tumor cells by targeting topoisomerase II (11Osheroff N. Corbett A.H. Robinson M.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents.

On the basis of their mechanism of action, the topoisomerase II inhibitors are classified into two groups: topoisomerase II poisons, which interfere with the breakage-rejoining reaction of the enzyme by trapping the covalent reaction intermediate, the cleaved complex; and topoisomerase II suppressors, or catalytic inhibitors, which prevent the cleaved complex formation (12Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, the mechanism of topoisomerase II-mediated site-directed alkylation of DNA by psorospermin and the effect of the psorospermin-DNA adduct on topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are investigated. Our results show that the enhanced DNA alkylation by psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II is dependent on pH but is independent of Mg2+ or ATP. This suggests that topoisomerase II-mediated psorospermin alkylation occurs in the initial noncovalent binding step in the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle. We also demonstrate that N-7 of guanine is still the alkylation site for psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II. Furthermore, the topoisomerase II-DNA complex trapped by psorospermin is slowly reversible with the addition of excess salt. Last, the psorospermin-DNA adducts, rather than abasic sites from depurination, seem to contribute to the topoisomerase II poison effect. Psorospermin was a generous gift from Dr. John M. Cassady (The Ohio State University). Electrophoretic reagents (acrylamide,N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, and ammonium persulfate) were from J. T. Baker, Inc., and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine was from Fisher Scientific. T4 polynucleotide kinase, Drosophilatopoisomerase II, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The 60- and 80-base oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Expedite 8900 nucleic acid synthesis system (PerSeptive Biosystems) using the phosphoramidite method. The oligonucleotides were eluted out of the column by aqueous ammonia and deprotected by heating at 75 °C for 1 h, followed by 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel purification. Because the DNA synthesizer is incapable of placing N-7-deazaguanine >15 bases relative to the 5′ end, two 60-base oligomers were synthesized, one with a normal guanine (Fig. 2, bottom strand of oligo II) and the other with a N-7-deazaguanine (Fig. 2, bottom strand of oligoIII) at the +4′ position at cleavage site B. They were then annealed with the 80-base top strand to form partial duplexes. The 5′ end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides were obtained by incubating the DNA with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 1 h. The labeled strands were then annealed with the complementary strands and purified on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. The 5′ 32P-labeled DNA was incubated with Drosophila topoisomerase II in 20 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0 or 7.0) or 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm ATP or App(NH)p3) at 30 °C for 10 min before 10 μm (final concentration) psorospermin was added to the mixture. The reaction was continued for an additional 5 min and then terminated by adding 5 μg of calf thymus DNA followed by heating with piperidine at 95 °C for 15 min. Heating with piperidine produces strand breakage at the drug modification site (3Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The samples were then subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The 5′32P-labeled DNA was incubated with Drosophilatopoisomerase II (10–20 units) in 20 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0 or pH 7.0) or 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm ATP) at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of various amounts of psorospermin. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS to 1% of the final concentration, and topoisomerase II was removed by proteinase K digestion (100 μg/ml) at 42 °C for 1 h followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The 5′ 32P-labeled DNA was incubated withDrosophila topoisomerase II in 20 μl of a reaction buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm ATP) at 30 °C for 10 min before 10 μm (final concentration) psorospermin was added to the mixture. The reaction was continued for 5, 30, and 60 min and was then terminated by adding 5 μg of calf thymus DNA followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. All of the samples were loaded onto a 12% denaturing sequencing gel. The dried gels were exposed on both x-ray film and phosphor screen. Imaging and quantification were performed by a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 4.1 software (Molecular Dynamics). In our previous study, we demonstrated that the alkylation reactivity of psorospermin at the +4′ position (see Fig. 2 for the nomenclature of the position relative to the gate) within the cleavage gate at site B (Fig. 2, oligo I) was enhanced more than 25-fold in the presence of topoisomerase II.2 It was proposed that a topoisomerase II-mediated structural distortion in DNA creates the high-affinity DNA binding site for psorospermin.2 However, it was not determined at which stage during the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle this proposed distortion takes place. The roles of Mg2+ and the high-energy cofactor ATP in the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle have been previously determined (14Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6402-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ ion is required for the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage but not for the DNA binding (15Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6402-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ATP, or its nonhydrolyzable analog App(NH)p, can induce DNA strand passage, but only hydrolyzable ATP can support the enzyme turnover (14Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, by excluding Mg2+ or ATP one at a time, or by substituting App(NH)p for ATP in the reaction buffer, the different steps in the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II can be studied. Using this method, the step (or steps) at which the site-directed DNA alkylation by psorospermin takes place can be determined. The DNA substrate used in this study (Fig. 2, oligo I) contains two topoisomerase II cleavage sites, sites A and B in the enlarged region. In the absence of drug, the intensity of the DNA cleavage induced by topoisomerase II is much less at site B than at site A (see below).2 To examine the psorospermin alkylation in the presence of topoisomerase II, a strand breakage assay was used in which the 5′ end-labeled DNA was incubated withDrosophila topoisomerase II to form the topoisomerase II-DNA complex. Psorospermin was then added to the reaction mixture followed by piperidine-heat treatment to generate the strand breakage products from the psorospermin-(N-7-guanine) DNA adduct (3Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Psorospermin alkylation of the guanine at the +4′ position within cleavage site B (Fig. 2, oligo I) was enhanced dramatically in the presence of topoisomerase II (Fig. 3, comparelanes 4 and 8; the guanine with enhanced alkylation is indicated by an asterisk), as described elsewhere.2 This enhancement was not affected if either ATP alone (Fig. 3, lane 6) or Mg2+ and ATP (Fig. 3,lane 5) were omitted in the reaction buffer. In addition, substituting ATP with App(NH)p (Fig. 3, lane 7) has no effect on the site-directed alkylation of DNA by psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II. These results demonstrate that the enhanced alkylation of DNA by psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II is independent of the divalent cation Mg2+or the high energy cofactor ATP, suggesting that the DNA conformational change that creates a favorable alkylation site for psorospermin is induced by topoisomerase II before the strand cleavage event. Finally, the effect of order of addition of topoisomerase II and psorospermin on the topoisomerase II site-directed psorospermin alkylation was determined. In Fig. 3, a comparison of lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 9 and 10 shows that there was no difference when topoisomerase II was allowed to incubate with DNA for 5 min before the addition of psorospermin (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8), compared with when psorospermin was incubated with DNA for 5 min before the addition of topoisomerase II (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10). This result suggests that in the absence of topoisomerase II, psorospermin interacts with DNA predominantly in a noncovalent binding mode, which is reversible, whereas in the presence of topoisomerase II, the DNA distortion produced by the enzyme accelerates the forward psorospermin alkylation reaction by creating a favorable binding and subsequent bonding site for the drug. The topoisomerase II-mediated site-directed DNA alkylation by psorospermin was determined by strand breakage assay (3Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Because N-3 and N-7 alkylation of guanine by psorospermin would both produce the DNA strand breakage that is observed, we set out to determine whether psorospermin still alkylates N-7 of guanine in the presence of topoisomerase II, as it does with DNA alone (3Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Oligomers containing either guanine (Fig. 2, oligo II) or N-7-deazaguanine (Fig. 2, oligo III) at the +4′ position of the cleavage gate B were designed. Strand breakage assays were performed on oligos II and III in the absence (Fig. 4, lane 3) and in the presence (Fig. 4, lane 4) of topoisomerase II. Whereas partial duplex oligo II behaves the same as duplex oligoI, in which psorospermin alkylation was greatly enhanced in the presence of topoisomerase II (Fig. 4 A, comparelanes 3 and 4), the partial duplex oligoIII containing N-7-deazaguanine was unreactive in both the absence and presence of topoisomerase II (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes 3 and 4). These results confirm that N-7 of guanine is also the alkylation site for psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II. The enhanced DNA alkylation by psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II was previously observed at pH 6. To determine the pH effect on the topoisomerase II site-directed alkylation by psorospermin, strand breakage assays were performed at pH 6, 7, and 8. The magnitude of enhancement of psorospermin alkylation in the presence of topoisomerase II at pH 6 is near 30-fold (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 3), whereas the enhancement at pH 7 (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6) and pH 8 (Fig. 5,lanes 7 and 8) is ∼16- and 4-fold, respectively. However, in the absence of topoisomerase II, there is no significant difference in psorospermin alkylation between different pH values (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3, 5, and 7), showing that pH does not affect the reactivity of psorospermin on DNA alone. In contrast, these results demonstrate that a more acidic pH level greatly enhances the topoisomerase II site-directed alkylation of DNA by psorospermin. It has been demonstrated that psorospermin enhances topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage at site B but reduces it at site A, suggesting that the alkylation of DNA by psorospermin at the cleavage site traps the topoisomerase II-DNA complex.2 Because the magnitude of this enhancement is pH-dependent, experiments were designed to determine the effect of pH on the psorospermin-stimulated DNA cleavage produced by topoisomerase II. In the absence of drug, the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage is much less at site B than at site A, regardless of the pH that was used (Fig. 6, lanes 2(pH 6), 8 (pH 7), and 14 (pH 8)). As the concentration of psorospermin was increased, the topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage at site A was decreased at all the tested pHs (see the quantitation in Fig. 6 B; the gel in Fig. 6 Awas overexposed to detect the small amount of cleavage at pH 8), whereas the cleavage at site B was enhanced at pH 6 and 7 (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3–7 and 9–13). At pH 6 and 7 (Fig. 6 B), psorospermin (100 μm) enhanced the topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage at site B by 3- and 2-fold, respectively. However, at pH 8 (Fig. 6 B), the enhancement was insignificant. This result, together with the experiment described before, demonstrates that both the enhancement of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage stimulated by psorospermin at site B and the topoisomerase II-directed DNA alkylation by psorospermin at site B are pH-dependent, suggesting that there is a linkage between these two events. Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage induced by many topoisomerase II poisons is reversible either by addition of excess NaCl or at elevated temperatures (17Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hsiang Y.-H. Liu L.F. J. Biol.

Raising the ion strength or temperature affects the topoisomerase II-DNA dissociation by shifting the equilibrium to the direction of re-ligation. The reversibility of the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage stimulated by psorospermin was examined by the addition of 0.5 m NaCl to the topoisomerase II cleavage reaction (Fig. 7). In the presence of psorospermin (Fig. 7, lane 2), the DNA cleavage produced by topoisomerase II at site B was enhanced (Fig. 7, comparelanes 2 and 1), as shown in the previous experiments. Addition of 0.5 m NaCl to the reaction mixture led to a time-dependent reversal of the DNA cleavage at sites A and B (Fig. 7, lanes 3–5). The reversal of the cleavage at site B was close to completion after a 60-min incubation (Fig. 7, lane 5), although the rate of reversal at site B appeared slower than at site A. This result indicates that psorospermin alkylation at site B slows the re-ligation process of the enzyme; however, it does not produce an irreversible topoisomerase II-DNA-cleavable complex. Abasic sites have been shown to stimulate DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II when the lesions are located within the 4-base cleavage overhang (20Kingma P.S. Corbett A.H. Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21441-21444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Kingma K.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the case of psorospermin, both psorospermin-DNA adducts and the abasic sites resulting from depurination could contribute to the enhanced topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the psorospermin-DNA adduct was separated from unmodified DNA and DNA with abasic sites resulting from depurination of psorospermin-(N-7-guanine) DNA adducts using denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 8). Because the molecular weight of the psorospermin-DNA adduct is greater than that of free DNA, and the molecular weight of unmodified DNA is greater than that of DNA with abasic sites, the psorospermin-(N-7-guanine) DNA adduct should migrate the slowest, and the DNA with abasic sites should migrate the fastest. Using this denaturing gel retardation assay, it should be possible to determine whether there is any depurination during the 60-min period, which is the normal length of time required to produce the topoisomerase II cleavage. In Fig. 8, compared with lanes 1and 2, which do not contain psorospermin, a 5-min incubation with psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II results in a band shift to a higher position (lane 3), which indicates the formation of a DNA-psorospermin adduct. The 30- and 60-min incubations resulted in an incremental decrease of unmodified DNA and increase of psorospermin-(N-7-guanine) DNA adduct formation (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 5) but no apparent occurrence of the abasic sites, which should migrate below the unmodified DNA. Therefore, formation of the psorospermin-DNA adducts rather than the subsequent production of the abasic sites is the most likely cause of the topoisomerase II poisoning at site B. In a previous study, we demonstrated that psorospermin alkylation is greatly enhanced at the +4′ position within the cleavage site in the presence of topoisomerase II.2 In this contribution, we further delineate the mechanism of this topoisomerase II-mediated site-directed psorospermin alkylation and its effect on topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. The present results show that topoisomerase II site-directed DNA alkylation by psorospermin is independent of Mg2+, providing evidence that this event takes place at the noncovalent binding step in the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle. Our results also demonstrate that N-7 of guanine is the alkylation site for psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II. In addition, both the enhancement of DNA alkylation by psorospermin at the topoisomerase II cleavage site and its stimulation of the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are more pronounced at acidic pH values. Last, psorospermin traps the topoisomerase II-DNA complex in a reversible manner, and it is likely that the psorospermin-(N-7-guanine) DNA adduct, rather than abasic sites resulting from depurination, is responsible for this poison effect. Although Mg2+ is essential to the topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage reaction and the ATPase reaction, it is not required for the binding of the enzyme to DNA (15Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6402-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, excluding Mg2+ and ATP in the reaction buffer should trap the topoisomerase II-DNA complex in its initial noncovalent complex form. Our results demonstrate that the enhanced psorospermin alkylation at the topoisomerase II cleavage site is independent of Mg2+ and ATP. This strongly suggests that the DNA conformational change produced by topoisomerase II that is required for the enhanced psorospermin alkylation takes place at the noncovalent topoisomerase II-DNA complex formation step that occurs before the strand cleavage event. It is therefore the helix distortion induced by the binding of topoisomerase II to DNA that creates the favorable covalent bonding site for psorospermin. This is not the first case showing that topoisomerase II-induced DNA cleavage is not required for the binding of drugs to the topoisomerase II-DNA complex. A recent study on gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase II, has demonstrated that the quinolone drugs can still bind to a mutant gyrase-DNA complex when the active site tyrosine in the A subunit of gyrase is replaced by phenylalanine or serine (23Critchlow S.E. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7387-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These mutant enzymes can form a complex with DNA but cannot carry out the strand cleavage. In addition, the structural perturbation produced by topoisomerase IV, the other type II bacterial topoisomerase, was observed with both wild-type and mutant topoisomerase IV (which lacks the strand cleavage activity) and was exacerbated by binding of the quinolones (24Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Together with our results, these data suggest that type II topoisomerases produce a DNA distortion at the initial noncovalent binding stage, creating high affinity binding sites for drugs. Because this distortion for psorospermin is inferred to be an unwinding of duplex DNA within the gate site, it is likely that this is also the case for the quinolones. This is in accord with a 2:2 quinolone:Mg2+ model that we have proposed for the quinolones based on the interaction of the related quinobenzoxazines with topoisomerase II (29Fan J.-Y. Sun D., Yu, H. Kerwin S. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 408-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 4Y. Kwok, Q. Zeng, and L. H. Hurley, submitted for publication. Several topoisomerase poisons with potential alkylating moieties have been shown to irreversibly trap the enzyme-DNA covalent complexes (25Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.H. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19287-19295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage stimulated by an alkylating camptothecin derivative is unable to reseal in the presence of high salt or proteinase K at 50 °C (25Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn K.H. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that camptothecin interferes with the re-ligation step of the enzyme (28Hertzberg R.P. Busby R.W. Caranfa M.J. Holden K.G. Johnson R.K. Hecht S.M. Kingsbury W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19287-19295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, an alkylating camptothecin derivative that cannot dissociate from the enzyme-DNA complex may irreversibly trap the topoisomerase I-DNA complex. In contrast to camptothecin, and despite its alkylating nature, psorospermin slows the re-ligation step of topoisomerase II without completely shutting down the process, suggesting that it traps a reversible topoisomerase II-DNA complex. It has been demonstrated by DNase I footprinting experiments that there is a stronger binding of Drosophila topoisomerase II to DNA at lower pH (31Robinson M.J. Martin B.A. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Moynihan M. Sutcliffe J.A. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14585-14592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At pH 6, the relative intensity of the protection byDrosophila topoisomerase II against DNase I is more than 2 times greater than that at pH 8.2 Therefore, we propose that the stronger binding of topoisomerase II to DNA at pH 6 is probably responsible for the enhanced alkylation of DNA by neutral or alkaline pHs. Presumably the tighter binding of topoisomerase II to DNA extends the duration of complex formation, which in turn increases the opportunity for psorospermin alkylation. In accordance with the instability of (N-7-guanine) DNA adducts (30Warpehoski M.A. Hurley L.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1988; 1: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), psorospermin-DNA adducts can undergo a slow depurination over several days at room temperature and neutral pH (3Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Because it has been demonstrated that apurinic sites can stimulate topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage when the lesions are located within the 4-base cleavage sites (21Kingma K.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the enhanced topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage by psorospermin at cleavage site B could be produced either directly by the psorospermin-DNA adducts or indirectly by the depurination products, or both. However, under the experimental conditions normally required for the topoisomerase cleavage reaction, we have demonstrated that depurination is unlikely to occur. Therefore, our results suggest that psorospermin-DNA adduct formation is most likely the cause of the topoisomerase II poisoning at cleavage site B, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that depurination can occur in vivo. Psorospermin is not the first example of a DNA alkylating agent that can enhance the cleaved complex formation by topoisomerase II. Additionally, some of the chrysophanol derivatives with DNA alkylating potential have been shown to induce the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and have more potent anticancer activity in vitro(26Kong X.-G. Rubin L. Chen L.-I. Ciszewska G. Watanabe K.A. Tong W.P. Sirotnak F.M. Chou T.-C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 237-244PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been reported that covalent attachment of ethidium bromide to DNA converts ethidium bromide from a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II, which prevents the formation of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, into a topoisomerase II poison, which enhances the cleaved complex formation (4Marx G. Zhou H. Graves D.E. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15884-15891Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in previous studies, neither the positions of drug alkylation on DNA nor the conformations of the drug-DNA adduct were determined (4Marx G. Zhou H. Graves D.E. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15884-15891Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Kong X.-G. Rubin L. Chen L.-I. Ciszewska G. Watanabe K.A. Tong W.P. Sirotnak F.M. Chou T.-C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 237-244PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to our knowledge psorospermin is the first example of a DNA-alkylating topoisomerase II poison for which the precise location of the drug within the topoisomerase II cleavage site, the chemistry of alkylation, and the conformation of drug-DNA adduct have been determined (3Hansen M. Lee S.-J. Cassady J.M. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5553-5561Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar).2 This structural insight provides an excellent opportunity for the design and synthesis of new, perhaps more effective, topoisomerase II poisons for cancer chemotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W2085145057,"Epstein-Barr viral nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) is required for the stable replication of plasmids that containoriP, the origin of DNA synthesis used during the latent phase of the Epstein-Barr virus life cycle. EBNA-1 acts post-synthetically through unknown mechanisms to facilitate the continued synthesis of oriP plasmids in ensuing S phases. In contrast to viral replicons such as that of SV40, DNA synthesis of oriP is restricted to a single round during each cell cycle. Large T-antigen of SV40 is a DNA helicase and activates the synthesis of SV40 DNA by recruiting cellular proteins required for DNA synthesis to the origin of SV40. Using fusion proteins of EBNA-1 and large T-antigen, we tested whether tethering large T-antigen tooriP is sufficient to initiate multiple rounds of DNA synthesis from oriP during each cell cycle. We report here that, although these fusion proteins retain the biological activities of both EBNA-1 and large T-antigen, their constituent proteins do not confer the properties of one on the other. Thus, it is not possible to subvert the cellular controls that restrict DNA synthesis fromoriP to a single round per cell cycle.

Mutations in the human NBAT gene have been found in several type I cystinurics. In kidney, NBAT is associated with a second, smaller protein (approximately 45 kDa), and this heterodimer has been proposed to be the minimal functional unit of the renal cystine transporter (Wang, Y., and Tate, S.

To delineate regions minimally required for functional expression in oocytes, we constructed a series of C-terminal truncated mutants of rat kidney NBAT (wild-type (WT), 683 amino acids). Expression of these mutants in oocytes yielded an unusual bimodal pattern for the induction of amino acid transport activity. Thus, initial C-terminal truncations aborted elicitation of transport activity. The next mutant in the series, Δ588–683, exhibited most of the transport-inducing potential inherent in the WT/NBAT. Further deletions again attenuated transport activity. Although both the WT/NBAT and the truncated mutant, Δ588–683, induce qualitatively similar transport systems, the two forms of the protein exhibit contrasting sensitivities toward a point mutation in which the cysteine residue at position 111 was mutated to serine. This mutation did not greatly affect induction of transport by the WT/NBAT; however, the Δ588–683 mutant was inactivated by this mutation.

These proteins induce transport of basic and certain neutral amino acids when their cRNAs are injected intoXenopus oocytes and are predicted to contain only 1–4 MSDs. For this reason, it has been suggested that NBAT and 4F2hc may not function as transporters themselves but may, in fact, be regulatory/modulatory subunits of larger transporter complexes (2Palacin M. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 123-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). There is, however, no direct evidence that the transport mediated by these proteins involves such complexes; but it is noteworthy that NBAT in the renal and intestinal brush border membranes (BBMs), its primary sites of localization (14Pickel V.M.

An equivalent complex is detected in oocytes injected with NBAT cRNA, and such a heterodimer has been proposed to constitute the minimal functional unit of NBAT-mediated transport (16Wang Y. Tate S.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, 4F2hc is also found as part of a heterodimeric complex, 4F2, in which it is disulfide-linked to a smaller subunit (18Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J.

Although both NBAT and 4F2hc elicit amino acid transport activity in Xenopus oocytes, their precise functions in mammalian cells have still not been defined, although accumulating data indicate that NBAT is involved in renal and intestinal cystine transport. Thus, several mutations in the human NBAT gene have been found in a substantial number of patients with cystinuria (21Calonge M.J. Gasparini P. Chillarón J. Chillon M. Gallucci M. Rousaud F.

Recent studies indicate that mutations in NBAT occur only in type I cystinurics but not in Types II and III (28Calonge M.J. Volpini V. Bisceglia L. Rousaud F. de Sanctis L. Beccia E. Zelante L.

We have speculated that one of these might be the protein complexed to NBAT in renal and intestinal membranes (16Wang Y. Tate S.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The transport systems induced in oocytes by NBAT and 4F2hc exhibit some similarities and certain significant differences. For example, NBAT induces a high-affinity, largely Na+-independent uptake system for basic amino acids, cystine, and certain neutral amino acids, a system similar to b0,+, a Na+-independent system first detected in mouse blastocysts (31Van Winkle L.J. Campione A.L. Gorman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3150-3163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4F2hc, in contrast, induces a transport system resembling system y+L, i.e., Na+-independent uptake of basic amino acids and largely Na+-dependent uptake of neutral amino acids (9Wells R.G. Lee W.-S. Kanai Y. Leiden J.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15285-15288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bertran J. Maganin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X.

J. 1998; 330: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The similarities between the transport induced by the two proteins could be a reflection of the fact that alignment of their sequences reveals a significant degree of identity and similarity (12Yao S.Y.M. Muzyka W.R. Elliott J.F. Cheeseman C.I. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a report recently appeared claiming that a truncated form of human NBAT, in which 175 residues from the C-terminal tail were deleted, induced amino acid transport in oocytes that was qualitatively similar to that elicited by 4F2hc, i.e., system y+l-like (32Miyamoto K.

To define more closely the structural boundaries at which this switch in specificity occurs and also to elucidate the domains essential for its functional expression, we generated mutants of rat kidney NBAT containing progressive C-terminal deletions. A striking outcome of our studies is that the expression of the truncated mutants in oocytes shows a bimodal pattern for the induction of amino acid transport activity. A preliminary account of this work has appeared as an abstract (48Deora A.B. Tate S.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 1394Google Scholar). 3H-labeled amino acids were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oocyte-positive Xenopus laevis females were from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). The Riboprobe RNA transcription kit and T7 RNA polymerase were from Promega, and the RNaid kit for the purification of cRNA was from Bio 101, Inc. Restriction enzymes used in this study were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. and Promega. Cloning of rat kidney NBAT/cDNA has been described previously (4Tate S.S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The cDNA (cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pSPORT1 (pSPORT/NBAT)) contains a 2049-base pair open reading frame (683 amino acids) within a 2259-base pair sequence. For cRNA synthesis, the plasmid was linearized with NotI and transcribedin vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the GpppG cap, using the protocol supplied with the Riboprobe transcription kit. The RNA transcripts were purified using the RNaid kit. Production and properties of the anti-peptide antibodies directed against NBAT have been described previously (33Mosckovitz R. Udenfriend S. Felix A. Heimer E. Tate S.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the immunoglobulin fractions from antisera directed against NBAT sequences 357–375 (Ab357) and 527–539 (Ab527) (see Fig. 1). Details of the SDS-PAGE and the ECL Western blotting (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) procedures have been described (16Wang Y. Tate S.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 schematically depicts the proposed 4 MSD topological model for NBAT and the sites of C-terminal truncations (labeled T1 through T5). The truncations were effected by single base changes in pSPORT/NBAT which converted codons for selected amino acid residues to stop codons. The mutations were introduced using reagents and protocol supplied with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene and pairs of custom-synthesized complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides (from GeneLink, Thornwood, NY). The deletions (Δ) effected, along with the amino acid residues, codons for which were mutated to stop codons, were as follows: Δ658–683, K658X; Δ615–683, K615X; Δ588–683, K588X; Δ566–683, W566X; and Δ508–683, W508X. Fragments from the mutant cDNAs between the restriction sites for XhoI (base 1393 of the cDNA) and NotI (downstream of cDNA) were purified by agar-gel electrophoresis and ligated into the wild-type (WT) pSPORT/NBAT from which the XhoI/NotI fragment had been deleted. Mutations were confirmed by complete sequencing of the XhoI/NotI cassettes. The C111S (Cys-111 to Ser-111) mutant of the WT/NBAT (NBAT/C111S) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR overlapping extension procedure with primers containing the desired mutation (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6849) Google Scholar,35Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The Cys to Ser substitution was used because this substitution is conservative and not likely in and of itself to distort the conformational structure of the protein (36Falke J.J. Dernburg A.F. Sternberg D.A. Zalkin N. Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14850-14858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Flitsch S.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7800-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers were 5′-CCAAAAT[C]CCTTGACTGGTGG-3′ and its reverse complement (the mutated nucleotide is shown within square brackets). The mutation was carried out in two steps. In the first step, the fragment to be overlapped was amplified in separate reactions in which the sense mutated primer was paired with a downstream unmutated antisense primer (5′-GTCCAGCTTCTCTTGGATACC-3′, complementary to bases 459–479 in NBAT cDNA), and the antisense mutated primer was paired with an upstream vector sequence (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, T7 promoter primer). In both reactions, 660 ng of pSPORT/NBAT served as a template. In the second step, a small amount of each product from the first reactions (purified by agarose-gel electrophoresis), together with the T7 promoter primer and the downstream wild-type antisense primer, was used for the PCR reaction (using a GeneAmp PCR kit from Perkin Elmer). The PCR product was purified by agar-gel electrophoresis, digested withSalI/BglII, and ligated by T4 DNA ligase into the pSPORT/NBAT from which the SalI/BglII fragment had been deleted (BglII restricts NBAT cDNA at nucleotide 402,i.e. downstream of Cys-111). The mutation was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. The C111S mutant of the Δ588–683 truncated form of NBAT (Δ588–683/C111S) was made as follows: the fragment obtained by treatment of the Δ588–683 mutant with BglII and NotI was purified and ligated into NBAT/C111S plasmid from which the BglII/NotI cassette had been deleted. DNA sequencing was performed either by the Protein/DNA Technology Center of the Rockefeller University, New York, NY or by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the BioResearch Center of Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. Isolation and maintenance of oocytes and amino acid uptake measurements have been described previously (4Tate S.S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected with 45 nl of the desired cRNA solution. The rate of uptake of amino acids was measured at 20 °C in a medium containing 0.015 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and either 0.1 m NaCl (for transport in presence of Na+) or 0.2 msucrose (for transport in absence of Na+), and 50 μm (unless otherwise stated) of the3H-labeled amino acid (l-arginine, as a representative of the basic amino acid substrates, and eitherl-leucine or l-phenylalanine as a neutral amino acid substrate). Note that previous studies have shown that transport of l-cystine into NBAT cRNA-injected oocytes displays characteristics similar to those seen for either Arg, Leu, or Phe (6Bertran J. Werner A. Chillarón J. Nunes A. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Estivill X. Murer H. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14842-14849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Sabbag R.V. Mohandas T.K. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Generally, six oocytes were incubated in 1 ml of the transport medium. The uptake is expressed as picomoles of amino acid transported into each oocyte (after subtraction of uptake into uninjected oocytes as controls; we have found that amino acid uptake rates with uninjected oocytes were similar to those obtained with water-injected oocytes) and is presented as the average of individual measurements on five to six oocytes ± S.E. Oocyte membranes were isolated as described previously (16Wang Y. Tate S.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The membrane pellet (from two to four oocytes) was suspended either in 25 μl of 0.125 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 4% SDS (Tris-SDS) (nonreducing conditions) or in 25 μl of the Tris-SDS buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (MSH) (reducing conditions) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The SDS extracts were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10 or 12% gels) followed by Western analyses. NBAT and its mutants, blotted onto the nitrocellulose membranes, were detected using anti-NBAT antibodies, Ab357 and Ab527, either used individually or in combination, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, followed by the ECL Western blot detection procedure as described in the protocol supplied by them. Three days after the injection of cRNA, 4–6 oocytes were suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 3.3% paraformaldehyde and incubated at 20 °C for 15 min. Uninjected oocytes were similarly treated and served as controls. Oocytes were extensively rinsed with PBS and kept overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of PBS containing 2% non-fat dry milk. The oocytes were then washed and incubated at 20 °C for 1 h in 2 ml of PBS containing 0.5% dry milk and Ab357 (1:1,000, final dilution). After thorough washings, the oocytes were incubated in 2 ml of PBS containing rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (from Pierce; 1:400, final dilution) to label the surface-bound anti-NBAT antibodies. The labeled oocyte was then placed on a 1-cm2glass slide. Sequential focal planes of the fluorescence-labeled oocyte were imaged with an MRC600 laser scanning confocal unit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. The oocyte was oriented such that its vegetal (white) hemisphere faced the light source. The oocyte was excited with the 514-nm line from a 25-mW Argon ion laser, and standard rhodamine optics were employed. A ×10 objective with a 0.25 numerical aperture was used to obtain an optical section every 20 μm. (See Ref. 38Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for details regarding confocal microscopy.) The proposed four MSD topological model for NBAT is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 (adapted from Ref. 33Mosckovitz R. Udenfriend S. Felix A. Heimer E. Tate S.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sites at which the truncations were effected are labeled T1 through T5. Fig. 2 is a representative Western blot of an SDS gel, run under reducing conditions, showing the monomers of the WT/NBAT and its truncated forms in membranes of oocytes injected with the appropriate cRNA (10 ng/oocyte). Blot A was probed with Ab357 directed against an epitope preserved in all of the truncated forms of NBAT. Blot B was probed with Ab527 which is directed against an epitope deleted from the mutant Δ508–683. Therefore, the band corresponding to this mutant is not seen (lane 2), whereas the other mutants are readily observed. Ab527 also reacts with an approximately 62-kDa protein in uninjected as well as the injected oocytes. This protein, thus, appears to be an endogenous oocyte membrane protein whose identity is as yet unknown. As noted previously (39Mosckovitz R. Yan N. Heimer E. Felix A. Tate S.S. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4022-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the WT/NBAT monomers migrate as two closely spaced bands (approximately 80 and 83 kDa, respectively) (lane 1 in each of the two blots), shown to be because of differential glycosylation. The monomeric species of the truncated forms exhibit the approximate expected mass, Δ508–683, the smallest of the mutants being approximately 58 kDa (this form lacks two of the five potential N-glycosylation sites of WT/NBAT). Noticeable also is a progressive decrease in the amount of expressed protein with longer truncations. Fig. 3 shows the induced Arg uptake activity in oocytes at 3 and 5 days after injection of the cRNAs. A surprising bimodal pattern for the induction of transport activity is revealed. Deletion of as few as 25 C-terminal amino acids virtually abolished the ability of the resultant truncated form (Δ658–683 mutant) to induce amino acid transport. The next in the series of truncated mutants (Δ615–683) was also devoid of transport activity. However, further deletion of 27 amino acids (Δ588–683) restored the ability of the mutant to induce transport (to about 75% of that elicited by the WT/NBAT). Note that in this truncated form, the fourth putative MSD has been deleted. Further truncations resulting in the Δ566–683 and Δ508–683 forms again abrogate the ability to induce transport. It is noteworthy that the mutation to a stop codon that generates the Δ566–683 form also disrupts the third heptad repeat in the leucine zipper motif (residues 545 to 572 in the WT/NBAT), an α-helical coiled-coil structure shown to be involved in oligomerization of a wide variety of proteins (see Ref. 40Hu J.C. Newell N.E. Tidor B. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1072-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and references contained therein). A parallel bimodal pattern of expression of transport activity was also seen when either Phe or Leu was used as a transport substrate instead of Arg (data not shown). A more detailed investigation of the transport induced in oocytes by NBAT has shown that this transport is in fact an exchange transport in which uptake of a cationic amino acid is enhanced by the outward flux of neutral amino acids and uptake of a neutral amino acid is stimulated by counter-transport of a cationic substrate (41Coady M.J. Jalal F. Chen X. Lemay G. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Chillarón J. Estévez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F.

It was, therefore, essential to determine whether the bimodal pattern of expression also applies to the exchange transport activity. cRNA-injected oocytes were pre-loaded with either [3H]Arg or [3H]Leu. Stimulation of the Arg and Leu efflux by addition of unlabeled Leu and Arg, respectively, to the extracellular medium was then determined (Fig. 4). With both substrates, the stimulated efflux from oocytes expressing the truncated mutant, Δ588–683, was about 70% of that seen with the oocytes expressing the WT/NBAT. No difference in the rates of efflux of either Arg or Leu were seen between the uninjected oocytes and the oocytes expressing the inactive truncated mutants; also, no significant stimulation of efflux was observed upon addition of an extracellular amino acid to these oocytes (Fig. 4, solid circles). The efflux rates observed in these oocytes were about 1/7th–1/6th of the stimulated rates seen with either the WT/NBAT or the Δ588–683 mutant expressing oocytes. Thus, the bimodal pattern of functional expression of the C-terminal truncated forms also applies to the exchange transport. Fig. 5 shows that both the WT/NBAT and its Δ588–683 mutant induce the same transport phenotype in oocytes (system b0,+-like). Thus, a large fraction of the induced uptake of both Arg and Phe (as well as of Leu) with both forms of this protein is Na+-independent. As also noted in several previous studies (4Tate S.S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Ogura Y. Haga H. Morita K. Katai K. Tatsumi S. Nii T. Taketani Y.

Whether this is a consequence of induction in oocytes of more than one amino acid transport system by NBAT is not clear at present. It is pertinent, however, that the transport activities induced by the Δ588–683 mutant are also similarly affected by Na+. With both forms of the protein, the uptake of Arg is inhibited by either Phe or Leu, and the uptake of Phe is inhibited by Arg. No significant difference was found in the K m values for Arg (K m values, 20 to 30 μm) and Leu (K m values, 30 to 40 μm) between the WT/NBAT and its Δ588–683 mutant. However, the transportV max for the truncated form with either Arg, Leu, or Phe was consistently about 75% of that observed for the WT/NBAT. In separate experiments (data not shown), we showed that the rate of induced transport in oocytes by the WT/NBAT cRNA reaches a maximum value between 2.5 and 5 ng of cRNA per oocyte although the amount of prote"

Metal cofactors (Mg2+ and Mn2+) modulate both specific DNA binding and strand cleavage in the TaqI endonuclease (Cao, W., Mayer, A. N., and Barany, F. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 2276–2283).

TaqI endonuclease recognizes and cleaves a short palindromic double-stranded DNA sequence, T↓CGA, with exquisite specificity. Its recognition mechanism has been probed with base analogues (major groove modifications) and thiomethyl-modified phosphates (1Zebala J.A. Choi J. Trainor G.L. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8106-8116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mayer A.N. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29067-29076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Major groove contacts, as identified at N7 of Gly and N6 and N7 of Ala, appear to contribute to transition state stabilization (1Zebala J.A. Choi J. Trainor G.L. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8106-8116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphate contacts direct the initial DNA-protein interactions atpTpCpGA for formation of the ground state complex, as well as mediating transition state interactions by providing a controlling point at GpA (2Mayer A.N. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29067-29076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Roles of metal cofactors (Mg2+ and Mn2+) in modulating substrate specificity have been investigated using both steady-state and single turnover kinetics analysis (3Cao W. Mayer A.N. Barany F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When Mg2+ serves as the metal cofactor, TaqI exhibits high affinity for its cognate sequence but fails to form specificTaqI-DNA-Mg2+ complex with DNA sequences that differ from its cognate sequence by even one base pair (star sequence), thereby precluding any further catalytic interactions. Mn2+, the alternative metal cofactor, enablesTaqI to form three distinctive tertiary complexes: the highly active TaqI-TCGA-Mn2+, partially activeTaqI-TCAA-Mn2+ (TCAA represents a star sequence), and nonspecific inactiveTaqI-TGCA-Mn2+ (TGCA represents a nonspecific DNA sequence). As a result, TaqI complexed with Mn2+ is able not only to cleave its cognate sequence with a high single turnover rate but also to cleave its star sequences at significantly reduced rates. Much progress has been made in identifying DNA elements involved in substrate recognition and elucidating the roles of the metal cofactors in specific DNA-protein interactions. The structural basis of TaqI protein that governs substrate binding and catalysis has not been clearly defined. In the absence of a high resolution three-dimensional structure, alternative approaches are needed. Hydroxyl radicals generated from metal oxidation are able to attack both phosphate and peptide backbones, resulting in chain breakage (4Ermacora M.R. Delfino J.M. Cuenoud B. Schepartz A. Fox R.O.

Fe2+-mediated cleavage has been used to determine the metal and metal-substrate sites in pig heart NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (5Soundar S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fe2+, in place of Mg2+, has been coupled with tetracycline to map the binding sites of the drug on its repressor protein (6Ettner N. Hillen W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2546-2548Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the repressor was specific and occurred in the immediately proximity of Fe2+ binding, suggesting that this method may be broadly applied in identifying specific interactions between metal and its coordinating sites on the protein (7Ettner N. Metzger J.W. Lederer T. Hulmes J.D. Kisker C. Hinrichs W. Ellestad G.A. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specific cleavage of calmodulin and staphylococcal nuclease have also been reported (4Ermacora M.R. Delfino J.M. Cuenoud B. Schepartz A. Fox R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the common features among these enzymes is that two or more carboxylates of Asp or Glu are involved in coordinating the metal cofactor in the active site. TaqI enzyme requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ as the metal cofactor for its activity (20Barany F. Gene. 1988; 63: 149-165Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, replacement of the metal cofactor with a redox-active metal ion could lead to specific cleavage at the proximity of the active site. This study reports Fe2+-mediated cleavage of TaqI protein and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of 11 amino acid residues. The resulting TaqI mutants were grouped into four categories based on their binding and catalysis properties. The active site of TaqI was compared with that of other known type II endonucleases. PCR1amplification and dideoxy terminator sequencing kits were obtained from Perkin-Elmer. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). MgCl2·6H2O and CaCl2·2H2O were purchased from Fisher Scientific; MnCl2·4H2O was from Alfa Products (Danvers, MA); methanol was from J. T. Baker (Philipsburg, NJ); and FeCl2·4H2O, sodium ascorbate, CAPS, HEPES, and other chemicals were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PVDF membrane was purchased from Bio-Rad. TaqI endonuclease was purified as described previously (21Barany F. Gene. 1988; 63: 167-177Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Kinase-ligase buffer consisted of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 384 DNA synthesizer and purified on denaturing sequencing gel (7 m urea/10% polyacrylamide) (22Applied Biosystems Inc The Complete Guide: Evaluating and Isolating Synthetic Oligonucleotides. Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA1992Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2×) consisted of 0.12m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 20% glycerol; 2% SDS; 0.01% bromphenol blue; 2% β-mercaptoethanol. SDS-PAGE running buffer (1×) consisted of 0.025 m Tris-HCl, 0.192 m glycine, 0.1% SDS. Gel shift electrophoresis running buffer consisted of 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 10 mmCaCl2. MS buffer (1×) consisted of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 60 °C; 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 50 mm NaCl; and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Glycinate agarose gel running buffer (1×) consisted of 200 mmglycine, 12.5 mm NaOH, 0.1 mm EDTA. TaqI protein (6–150 μg) was incubated at room temperature with 2 mmFeCl2, 25 mm sodium ascorbate, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) in a final volume of 50 μl for 2 h. The caps of the 0.5-ml reaction tubes were pierced by a 25 ½ gauge needle to allow oxygen flow. The reaction tubes were placed in a low speed vortex to ensure proper mixing. In the case in which a DNA substrate was included in the cleavage reaction, 5 μm of annealed duplex oligonucleotide substrate (AMC201/202, see below for sequence) containing a singleTaqI recognition site was incorporated into the reaction mixture along with other reagents. The cleavage reaction was terminated by addition of 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer supplemented with 20 mm EDTA. A 0.1% SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel was prerun at 25 V for 1 h in a Bio-Rad Protean II apparatus filled with 1× SDS-PAGE running buffer. Sodium thioglycolate (approximately 4 mg) was incorporated in the upper gel buffer solution to quench reactive compounds in the gel. The cleavage samples were heated at 37 °C in a water bath for 15 min prior to loading to the gel. Electrophoresis was conducted at 50 V overnight. The PVDF membrane and the polyacrylamide gel were pretreated and assembled in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell apparatus according to the manufacturer's instruction manual. The transfer buffer contained 10 mm CAPS (pH 11), 10% methanol chilled in a cold room prior to use. After transferring at 30 V for 8 h on ice, the PVDF membrane was rinsed with deionized water, stained in 0.025% Coomassie Blue R-250 solution containing 40% methanol for 5 min, destained with 50% methanol solution for 15 min, and air dried until peptide bands became distinct. Each individual peptide band was excised from the membrane with a clean razor blade and stored at −70 °C until micropeptide sequencing was performed. N-terminal sequencing was performed on cleavage fragments blotted to the PVDF membrane using a Applied Biosystems protein sequencer (23Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the cases of faint bands, two slices of identical cleavage fragments were subjected to the sequencing run. An overlap extension PCR procedure was used for site-directed mutagenesis (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Partially degenerate internal primers were designed to generated multiple mutations at a particular site. PCR products digested with a pair of restriction enzymes, either HindIII and MluI orMluI and PstI, were ligated to cloning vector pFBT69 treated with the same pair of restriction endonucleases (see Ref. 21Barany F. Gene. 1988; 63: 167-177Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ligated vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli strain AK53 (mrrB−, MM294). Plasmids containing inserts were reisolated and sequenced on a Applied Biosystems sequencer using dye-dideoxy terminator chemistry to identify the mutated sequence and ensure that the constructs were free of PCR or ligation error. Mutant proteins were expressed and partially purified as described previously (25Cao W. Lu J. Welch S.G. Williams R.A.D. Barany F. Biochem. J. 1997; 333: 425-431Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide AMC 201, with the single TaqI recognition site underlined, was 5′-end labeled as described previously (3Cao W. Mayer A.N. Barany F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and annealed with a 5-fold excess of AMC202 to form a duplex DNA substrate for the binding experiment as follows. AMC201 5′­ACTCACCAATCG¯A¯TTTACCGGGTGGCAGCCTGGCATGCCT­3′ AMC202 3′­TGAGTGGTTAGC¯T¯AAATGGCCCACCGTCGGACCGTA­5′ The excess amount of AMC202 did not interfere with our assay (26Zebala J. Choi J. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8097-8105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type TaqI and mutant proteins (0.3 nm) were incubated with above duplex DNA substrate (10 pm) in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 60 °C), 10 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% bromphenol blue at 60 °C for 15 min. The free and bound duplex oligonucleotides were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (30:0.8) containing 89 mmTris-borate and 10 mm CaCl2 by electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad Protean II apparatus at 100 V for 1.5 h (27Taylor J.D. Ackroyd A.J. Halford S.E. Kneale G.G. Methods in Molecular Biology. 30. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 263-279Google Scholar). The intensity of 32P-labeled DNA bands was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Results were reported as the averages of three independent experiments. A plasmid substrate containing a single TaqI recognition site (pFB76, 20 nm) was digested with 2 nm of partially purified wild-type or mutant enzymes in the 1× MS buffer at 60 °C. The reaction mixture (10 μl) was incubated for 5 min with 10m MgCl2 as the metal cofactor or 30 min with 2 mm MnCl2 as the metal cofactor. After quenching the reaction with 5 μl of 4× agarose gel loading buffer, samples were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The substrate and product bands were visualized by incorporating ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) into the agarose gel and glycinate running buffer. Quantification was performed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) after scanning the gel photographs. Results were reported as the averages of three independent experiments. Successful application of Fe2+-mediated cleavage depends on specific interactions between the metal ion and TaqI protein. Previously, we have established by kinetic analysis that Mn2+ metal ion may interact with TaqI protein specifically in a DNA-independent fashion (3Cao W. Mayer A.N. Barany F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether a redox-active metal such as Fe2+ can serve as a metal cofactor, we testedTaqI activity with Fe2+ along with other divalent metal ions. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the only alkaline metal that supported TaqI cleavage was Mg2+. Marginal activity was observed with Ca2+ after extended incubation at 60 °C for 1 h. For the fourth period transition metals, Fe2+ showed significant activity, suggesting that it could interact with TaqI protein specifically to form both ground state and transition state complexes (Fig. 1 B). From Mn2+ to Zn2+, the cleavage activity generally followed a descending order. We first determined the optimal time required for the cleavage of TaqI protein. A time course of TaqI protein cleavage was conducted with 2 mm Fe2+ and 25 mm sodium ascorbate (Fig. 2 A). Primary cleavage fragments appeared at the earliest time point (30 min) and accumulated to its maximum after about 2 h of incubation. At later time points, the reaction kinetics is dominated by concurrent cleavage of both intact protein and secondary degradation of primary cleavage products. To demonstrate the specificity of Fe2+-mediated cleavage of TaqI protein, we denatured the protein by incubating with 0.1% SDS for 20 min or heating at 95 °C for 15 min (Fig. 2 B). Upon denaturation with SDS, discrete cleavage bands were no longer formed, although cleavage of intact TaqI protein appeared to be significant. This result suggests that whenTaqI protein is denatured and linearized by SDS treatment, the cleavage reaction becomes essentially nonspecific. In the case of thermal denaturation, TaqI protein remained largely uncleaved. This result indicates that the protein may have undergone unfolding and refolded into a random coil-like state that disorganizes the metal binding site(s) and becomes more resistant to cleavage. By and large, the data demonstrate that the cleavage pattern shown in Fig. 2 A is dependent on the proper tertiary or even quarternary structure of TaqI native protein. To obtain enough fragmented peptides for N-terminal sequencing, the cleavage reaction was scaled up by using 75 μg of pure TaqI protein. As shown in Fig. 3, eight cleavage fragments were generated in the absence of DNA substrate. A few low yield fragments (F2, F4, F5, and F8) were accumulated in sufficient quantity for N-terminal sequencing. Two new minor bands (F4a and F5a) were generated when 5 nm oligonucleotide substrate containing a single TaqI recognition site was incorporated into the Fe2+ cleavage mixture; these could result from conformational changes induced by the substrate. In addition to smaller molecular mass cleavage products, peptide bands with molecular masses greater than that of the intact TaqI monomer (33 kDa) were generated as well (Fig. 3). A similar observation was reported in the course of cleaving tetracycline repressor protein and was taken as an indication of cross-linking of hydroxyl radical generated cleavage peptides to the uncleaved TetR (7Ettner N. Metzger J.W. Lederer T. Hulmes J.D. Kisker C. Hinrichs W. Ellestad G.A. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An identical cleavage mechanism may have occurred with TaqI protein, which results in accumulation of high molecular mass cross-linked products after primary cleavage events. These fragments were electroblotted onto PVDF membrane, and each individual band was excised out for N-terminal sequencing. For some faint bands, two identical fragments were loaded to a protein sequencer. Sequence data were obtained from at least five cycles, and in some cases eight cycles. Three fragments (F2, F3, and F8) corresponded to the original N terminus of TaqI protein, which had a seven-amino acid PhoA signal sequence (MKQSGGN) fused onto the gene (Table I). F4a and F5a uniquely generated from substrate-induced cleavage also corresponded to the original N-terminal sequences, from which little information about cleavage sites can be extracted. Internal cleavage sequences were obtained from minor amino acid residues in fragments F1, F4, F5, and F7 and from major amino acid residues in fragment F6 (Table I). Some fragments with single internal sequence data available (F1, F4, and F6) were readily mapped to the correct TaqI sequence. For fragments with several internal amino acid residues identified in each cycle, all the possible combinations with a match of sequence more than four amino acids were selected (Fig. 4). Seven cleavage sites were mapped to TaqI sequence: Asp47↓Leu48, Ile112↓Trp113, Glu135↓Leu136, Ala138↓Gln139, Gly140↓Ile141, Ile156↓Lys157, and Arg173↓Lys174. These cleavage sites, from Asp47 to Lys174, span a 127-amino acid stretch that is highly conserved among TaqI and its three isoschizomers (TthHB8I, TfiTok6A1I, and Tsp32IR), except that Lys174 in some cases is replaced by arginine (28Barany F.

Open table in a new tab The cleavage sites originated from Fe2+-mediated cleavage could point to regions that play an important role in coordinating metal binding and organizing the active site in TaqI protein. We selected 11 amino acid residues (Asp48, Trp113, Glu135, Asp137, Gln139, Gly140, Asp142, Lys157, Lys158, Arg173, and Lys174) for site-directed mutagenesis study based on the following two guidelines. First, they are located at or nearby the cleavage sites. Second, they are likely to play a functional role in TaqI enzyme activity, for example, negatively charged amino acids (Asp and Glu) were chosen for their potential roles in coordinating metal cofactors, positively charged amino acids (Lys and Arg) were chosen for their potential roles in interacting with phosphate backbone or making specific base contacts. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based overlap extension procedure (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Three to five mutations were isolated at each individual site by using partially degenerate internal mutagenesis primers. These mutations included both highly conservative substitutions (i.e. K158R) and more general alterations (i.e. K158S, K158C, and K158G). A genetic system established in E. coli allows forTaqI endonuclease expression even in the absence of the corresponding methylase, which protects the endogenousThermus host genome by methylating the TaqI recognition sites (30Barany F. Gene. 1987; 56: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Under our growth conditions (32–37 °C), the thermophilic TaqI may generate a single-strand nick that could be repaired by E. coli DNA ligase. Thus, an E. coli cell hosting a TaqI endonuclease gene becomes viable at permissive temperature. We employed this system in our site-directed mutagenesis study so that mutants without enzyme activity or with partial activity would have a higher expression level, as they are less damaging to the E. coli cells. Three expression levels were observed among the forty-three mutants. Level 1, wild-type level: mutants had a similar low level of expression as the wild-type, indicating that these mutants were as active as the wt TaqI enzyme. This group includes three Gln139 mutants, as shown in Fig. 5 A, mutants at Asp48, Trp113, Glu135, and Arg173, and some mutants at Lys174. Level 2, partially overexpressed: mutants had significantly higher level of expression than the wild-type, indicating moderate effects on binding or catalysis. This group includes mutants at Gly140 (Fig. 5 A), Lys157, Arg173, and some mutants at Lys174 (K174I and K174M). Level 3, completely overexpressed: mutants had a severalfold higher level of expression than the partially overexpressed group, indicating drastic effects on binding or catalysis. This group includes all the mutants at Asp137, Asp142, and Lys158positions. It is noteworthy that three of the mutants (D142A, D142V, and D142G) migrated slightly faster than D142E, which migrated at a position identical to that of the wt TaqI in 12.5% SDS-PAGE (data not shown). This result suggested that elimination of a negative charge at Asp142 may be responsible for a more complete unfolding of the TaqI protein, which was found to migrate with a higher apparent molecular weight than expected in the presence of 0.1% SDS in 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (21Barany F. Gene. 1988; 63: 167-177Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In general, the level of protein expression is inversely proportional to catalytic activity. To characterize the binding affinity of the forty-three mutants to the TaqI recognition site (TCGA), we adopted a Ca2+ gel shift binding assay procedure previously described for EcoRV (31Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and NaeI (32Holtz J.K. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27286-27290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+, in place of the normal metal cofactor Mg2+, is able to support specific binding but not catalysis of EcoRV to its cognate site, GATATC (31Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our results shown in Fig. 1 A demonstrated that Ca2+is also unable to support significant catalytic activity (>10%) withTaqI. This technique is particularly useful in characterizing wild-type and mutant binding because bothEcoRV and TaqI require Mg2+ for binding and catalysis. To evaluate the binding property of these mutants, we used a binding condition in which wt enzyme achieved less than 100% binding to the oligonucleotide. Relative binding affinity was quantified by taking the intensity ratio of each bound mutant enzyme over bound wt enzyme. The mutants can be classified into three categories (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W2142747686,"We have isolated and characterized the chicken GATA-2 (cGATA-2) gene. We show that, as in the case of some other members of the GATA gene family, the gene is expressed from alternative first exons. One of the resulting mRNAs represents only a minor form of the GATA-2 mRNA in the cells and tissues we analyzed; the other is ubiquitously expressed. We have defined the minimal promoter that controls expression of this most abundant mRNA and that is necessary for full activity in hematopoietic progenitor cells. The activity of this promoter in transient assays is consistent with developmental differences of expression levels in these cells. We identify within the promoter a previously unrecognized extended CCAAT motif essential for its activity. The organization of the cGATA-2 gene, with alternative first exons and a CCAAT box in the proximal promoter, is similar to that recently described for mouse GATA-2, and the proximal promoter also resembles the only promoter so far described in Xenopus. Nonetheless, the roles of the promoters in development and tissue-specific expression are quite different in these organisms, most strikingly in the mouse, which assigns developmental roles to its proximal and distal promoters that are quite different from those in the chicken. We suggest that although the overall organization may remain the same, the role assigned to each promoter varies among organisms. We identify distant upstream regulatory elements in the cGATA-2 gene that modulate expression from the proximal promoter and that may be responsible for this variation."
