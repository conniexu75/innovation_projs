https://openalex.org/W2147072925,"Delphi technique is a structured process commonly used to developed healthcare quality indicators, but there is a little recommendation for researchers who wish to use it. This study aimed 1) to describe reporting of the Delphi method to develop quality indicators, 2) to discuss specific methodological skills for quality indicators selection 3) to give guidance about this practice.Three electronic data bases were searched over a 30 years period (1978-2009). All articles that used the Delphi method to select quality indicators were identified. A standardized data extraction form was developed. Four domains (questionnaire preparation, expert panel, progress of the survey and Delphi results) were assessed. Of 80 included studies, quality of reporting varied significantly between items (9% for year's number of experience of the experts to 98% for the type of Delphi used). Reporting of methodological aspects needed to evaluate the reliability of the survey was insufficient: only 39% (31/80) of studies reported response rates for all rounds, 60% (48/80) that feedback was given between rounds, 77% (62/80) the method used to achieve consensus and 57% (48/80) listed quality indicators selected at the end of the survey. A modified Delphi procedure was used in 49/78 (63%) with a physical meeting of the panel members, usually between Delphi rounds. Median number of panel members was 17(Q1:11; Q3:31). In 40/70 (57%) studies, the panel included multiple stakeholders, who were healthcare professionals in 95% (38/40) of cases. Among 75 studies describing criteria to select quality indicators, 28 (37%) used validity and 17(23%) feasibility.The use and reporting of the Delphi method for quality indicators selection need to be improved. We provide some guidance to the investigators to improve the using and reporting of the method in future surveys."

To more thoroughly investigate the human milk microbiome, we utilized microbial identification techniques based on pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Specifically, we characterized the bacterial communities present in milk samples collected from 16 women at three time-points over four weeks. Results indicated that milk bacterial communities were generally complex; several genera represented greater than 5% of the relative community abundance, and the community was often, yet not always, stable over time within an individual. These results support the conclusion that human milk, which is recommended as the optimal nutrition source for almost all healthy infants, contains a collection of bacteria more diverse than previously reported. This finding begs the question as to what role this community plays in colonization of the infant gastrointestinal tract and maintaining mammary health."
https://openalex.org/W1999967032,"Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise for the treatment of difficult diseases. As MSCs represent a rare cell population, ex vivo expansion of MSCs is indispensable to obtain sufficient amounts of cells for therapies and tissue engineering. However, spontaneous differentiation and aging of MSCs occur during expansion and the molecular mechanisms involved have been poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Human MSCs in early and late passages were examined for their expression of genes involved in osteogenesis to determine their spontaneous differentiation towards osteoblasts in vitro, and of genes involved in self-renewal and proliferation for multipotent differentiation potential. In parallel, promoter DNA methylation and hostone H3 acetylation levels were determined. We found that MSCs underwent aging and spontaneous osteogenic differentiation upon regular culture expansion, with progressive downregulation of TERT and upregulation of osteogenic genes such as Runx2 and ALP. Meanwhile, the expression of genes associated with stem cell self-renewal such as Oct4 and Sox2 declined markedly. Notably, the altered expression of these genes were closely associated with epigenetic dysregulation of histone H3 acetylation in K9 and K14, but not with methylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions of most of these genes. bFGF promoted MSC proliferation and suppressed its spontaneous osteogenic differentiation, with corresponding changes in histone H3 acetylation in TERT, Oct4, Sox2, Runx2 and ALP genes. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that histone H3 acetylation, which can be modulated by extrinsic signals, plays a key role in regulating MSC aging and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1994319184,"Circadian clocks provide an adaptive advantage through anticipation of daily and seasonal environmental changes. In plants, the central clock oscillator is regulated by several interlocking feedback loops. It was shown that a substantial proportion of the Arabidopsis genome cycles with phases of peak expression covering the entire day. Synchronized transcriptome cycling is driven through an extensive network of diurnal and clock-regulated transcription factors and their target cis-regulatory elements. Study of the cycling transcriptome in other plant species could thus help elucidate the similarities and differences and identify hubs of regulation common to monocot and dicot plants.Using a combination of oligonucleotide microarrays and data mining pipelines, we examined daily rhythms in gene expression in one monocotyledonous and one dicotyledonous plant, rice and poplar, respectively. Cycling transcriptomes were interrogated under different diurnal (driven) and circadian (free running) light and temperature conditions. Collectively, photocycles and thermocycles regulated about 60% of the expressed nuclear genes in rice and poplar. Depending on the condition tested, up to one third of oscillating Arabidopsis-poplar-rice orthologs were phased within three hours of each other suggesting a high degree of conservation in terms of rhythmic gene expression. We identified clusters of rhythmically co-expressed genes and searched their promoter sequences to identify phase-specific cis-elements, including elements that were conserved in the promoters of Arabidopsis, poplar, and rice.Our results show that the cycling patterns of many circadian clock genes are highly conserved across poplar, rice, and Arabidopsis. The expression of many orthologous genes in key metabolic and regulatory pathways is diurnal and/or circadian regulated and phased to similar times of day. Our results confirm previous findings in Arabidopsis of three major classes of cis-regulatory modules within the plant circadian network: the morning (ME, GBOX), evening (EE, GATA), and midnight (PBX/TBX/SBX) modules. Identification of identical overrepresented motifs in the promoters of cycling genes from different species suggests that the core diurnal/circadian cis-regulatory network is deeply conserved between mono- and dicotyledonous species."
https://openalex.org/W1982360877,"Interactions of planktonic bacteria with primary producers such as diatoms have great impact on plankton population dynamics. Several studies described the detrimental effect of certain bacteria on diatoms but the biochemical nature and the regulation mechanism involved in the production of the active compounds remained often elusive. Here, we investigated the interactions of the algicidal bacterium Kordia algicida with the marine diatoms Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Chaetoceros didymus. Algicidal activity was only observed towards the first three of the tested diatom species while C. didymus proved to be not susceptible. The cell free filtrate and the >30 kDa fraction of stationary K. algicida cultures is fully active, suggesting a secreted algicidal principle. The active supernatant from bacterial cultures exhibited high protease activity and inhibition experiments proved that these enzymes are involved in the observed algicidal action of the bacteria. Protease mediated interactions are not controlled by the presence of the alga but dependent on the cell density of the K. algicida culture. We show that protease release is triggered by cell free bacterial filtrates suggesting a quorum sensing dependent excretion mechanism of the algicidal protein. The K. algicida / algae interactions in the plankton are thus host specific and under the control of previously unidentified factors."
https://openalex.org/W2093086801,"Changes in miRNA expression are a common feature in colon cancer. Those changes occurring in the transition from normal to adenoma and from adenoma to carcinoma, however, have not been well defined. Additionally, miRNA changes among tumor subgroups of colon cancer have also not been adequately evaluated. In this study, we examined the global miRNA expression in 315 samples that included 52 normal colonic mucosa, 41 tubulovillous adenomas, 158 adenocarcinomas with proficient DNA mismatch repair (pMMR) selected for stage and age of onset, and 64 adenocarcinomas with defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) selected for sporadic (n = 53) and inherited colon cancer (n = 11). Sporadic dMMR tumors all had MLH1 inactivation due to promoter hypermethylation. Unsupervised PCA and cluster analysis demonstrated that normal colon tissue, adenomas, pMMR carcinomas and dMMR carcinomas were all clearly discernable. The majority of miRNAs that were differentially expressed between normal and polyp were also differentially expressed with a similar magnitude in the comparison of normal to both the pMMR and dMMR tumor groups, suggesting a stepwise progression for transformation from normal colon to carcinoma. Among the miRNAs demonstrating the largest fold up- or down-regulated changes (≥4), four novel (miR-31, miR-1, miR-9 and miR-99a) and two previously reported (miR-137 and miR-135b) miRNAs were identified in the normal/adenoma comparison. All but one of these (miR-99a) demonstrated similar expression differences in the two normal/carcinoma comparisons, suggesting that these early tumor changes are important in both the pMMR- and dMMR-derived cancers. The comparison between pMMR and dMMR tumors identified four miRNAs (miR-31, miR-552, miR-592 and miR-224) with statistically significant expression differences (≥2-fold change)."
https://openalex.org/W2060182156,"Intestinal inflammation induces alterations of the gut microbiota and promotes overgrowth of the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica by largely unknown mechanisms. Here, we identified a host factor involved in this process. Specifically, the C-type lectin RegIIIβ is strongly upregulated during mucosal infection and released into the gut lumen. In vitro, RegIIIβ kills diverse commensal gut bacteria but not Salmonella enterica subspecies I serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). Protection of the pathogen was attributable to its specific cell envelope structure. Co-infection experiments with an avirulent S. Typhimurium mutant and a RegIIIβ-sensitive commensal E. coli strain demonstrated that feeding of RegIIIβ was sufficient for suppressing commensals in the absence of all other changes inflicted by mucosal disease. These data suggest that RegIIIβ production by the host can promote S. Typhimurium infection by eliminating inhibitory gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2021256613,"In mammals, rostrocaudal columns of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) regulate diverse behavioral and physiological functions, including sexual and fight-or-flight behavior, but homologous columns have not been identified in non-mammalian species. In contrast to mammals, in which the PAG lies ventral to the superior colliculus and surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, birds exhibit a hypertrophied tectum that is displaced laterally, and thus the midbrain central gray (CG) extends mediolaterally rather than dorsoventrally as in mammals. We therefore hypothesized that the avian CG is organized much like a folded open PAG. To address this hypothesis, we conducted immunohistochemical comparisons of the midbrains of mice and finches, as well as Fos studies of aggressive dominance, subordinance, non-social defense and sexual behavior in territorial and gregarious finch species. We obtained excellent support for our predictions based on the folded open model of the PAG and further showed that birds possess functional and anatomical zones that form longitudinal columns similar to those in mammals. However, distinguishing characteristics of the dorsal/dorsolateral PAG, such as a dense peptidergic innervation, a longitudinal column of neuronal nitric oxide synthase neurons, and aggression-induced Fos responses, do not lie within the classical avian CG, but in the laterally adjacent intercollicular nucleus (ICo), suggesting that much of the ICo is homologous to the dorsal PAG."
https://openalex.org/W2113237775,"Sex disparities in inflammation have been reported, but the cellular and molecular basis for these discrepancies is unknown. Monocytes are central effector cells in immunity and possess high capacities to produce proinflammatory leukotrienes (LTs). Here, we investigated sex differences in the activation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), the key enzyme in LT biosynthesis, in human peripheral monocytes. In cells from females, 5-LO product formation was 1.8-fold higher than in cells from males, as evaluated by HPLC. When female monocytes were resuspended in plasma from males, 5-LO products were significantly lower than in female plasma. Interestingly, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT, 10 nM) repressed LT synthesis in female cells down to the levels observed in males, while estradiol (100 nM) was without effect, and progesterone (100 nM) caused only a slight inhibition. 5α-DHT (10 nM) caused ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD), as evaluated by Western blot and measurement of PLD activity via radioenzymatic diacylglyceride (DAG) and nonradioactive choline assays. Accordingly, PLD activity and DAG formation were 1.4- to 1.8-fold lower in male vs. female monocytes connected to increased ERK phosphorylation. Our data indicate that ERK activation by androgens in monocytes represses PLD activity, resulting in impaired 5-LO product formation due to lack of activating DAGs."
https://openalex.org/W1992942444,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a neurotropic fungal pathogen, which provokes the onset of devastating meningoencephalitis. We used human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) as the in vitro model to investigate how C. neoformans traverses across the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we present several lines of evidence indicating that C. neoformans invasion is mediated through the endocytic pathway via lipid rafts. Human CD44 molecules from lipid rafts can directly interact with hyaluronic acid, the C. neoformans ligand. Bikunin, which perturbs CD44 function in the lipid raft, can block C. neoformans adhesion and invasion of HBMEC. The lipid raft marker, ganglioside GM1, co-localizes with CD44 on the plasma membrane, and C. neoformans cells can adhere to the host cell in areas where GM1 is enriched. These findings suggest that C. neoformans entry takes place on the lipid rafts. Upon C. neoformans engagement, GM1 is internalized through vesicular structures to the nuclear membrane. This endocytic redistribution process is abolished by cytochalasin D, nocodazole, or anti-DYRK3 (dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3) siRNA. Concomitantly, the knockdown of DYRK3 significantly reduces C. neoformans invasion across the HBMEC monolayer in vitro. Our data demonstrate that the lipid raft-dependent endocytosis process mediates C. neoformans internalization into HBMEC and that the CD44 protein of the hosts, cytoskeleton, and intracellular kinase-DYRK3 are involved in this process.

https://openalex.org/W2098731796,"We develop a novel nanohybrid showing a strong antibacterial activity on all of the tested pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus auerus and silver-resistant E. coli. The nanohybrid consists of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) supported on 1 nm-thick silicate platelets (NSPs). The AgNP/NSP nanohybrid enables to encapsulate bacteria and triggers death signals from the cell membrane. The geographic shape of the NSPs concentrates AgNPs but impedes their penetration into attached cells, mitigating the detrimental effect of silver ion deposition in applied tissues. Moreover, the tightly tethered AgNPs on NSP surface achieve a stronger biocidal effect than silver nitrate, but bypassing Ag(+) mechanism, on silver-resistant bacteria. This nanohybrid presents an effective and safe antimicrobial agent in a new perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2071985117,"Increased vascular permeability is an inciting event in many vascular complications including diabetic retinopathy. We have previously reported that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is able to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis through a novel γ-secretase-dependent pathway. In this study, we asked whether inhibition of VEGF-induced permeability by PEDF is also γ-secretase-mediated and to dissect the potential mechanisms involved. Vascular permeability was assessed in vitro by measuring transendothelial resistance and paracellular permeability to dextran and in vivo by following leakage of intravenous FITC-labelled albumin into the retina in the presence or absence of VEGF and PEDF in varying combinations. Experiments were undertaken in the presence or absence of a γ-secretase inhibitor. To assess junctional integrity immunohistochemistry for the adherens junction (AJ) proteins, VE-cadherin and β-catenin, and the tight junction (TJ) protein, claudin-5 was undertaken using cultured cells and flat mount retinas. Protein expression and the association between AJ proteins, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and γ-secretase constituents were determined by immunoprecipitation and Western Blot analysis. In selected experiments the effect of hypoxia on junctional integrity was also assessed. PEDF inhibition of VEGF-induced permeability, both in cultured microvascular endothelial cell monolayers and in vivo in the mouse retinal vasculature, is mediated by γ-secretase. PEDF acted by a) preventing dissociation of AJ and TJ proteins and b) regulating both the association of VEGF receptors with AJ proteins and the subsequent phosphorylation of the AJ proteins, VE-cadherin and β-catenin. Association of γ-secretase with AJ proteins appears to be critical in the regulation of vascular permeability. Although hypoxia increased VEGFR expression there was a significant dissociation of VEGFR from AJ proteins. In conclusion, PEDF regulates VEGF-induced vascular permeability via a novel γ-secretase dependent pathway and targeting downstream effectors of PEDF action may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing or ameliorating increased vascular permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2024111969,"Alternative splicing involves differential exon selection of a gene transcript to generate mRNA and protein isoforms with structural and functional diversity. Abnormal alternative splicing has been shown to be associated with malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, such as chemo-resistance and invasive activity. Screening small molecules and drugs for modulating RNA splicing in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7, we discovered that amiloride, distinct from four pH-affecting amiloride analogues, could “normalize” the splicing of BCL-X, HIPK3 and RON/MISTR1 transcripts. Our proteomic analyses of amiloride-treated cells detected hypo-phosphorylation of splicing factor SF2/ASF, and decreased levels of SRp20 and two un-identified SR proteins. We further observed decreased phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and PP1, and increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, suggesting that amiloride treatment down-regulates kinases and up-regulates phosphatases in the signal pathways known to affect splicing factor protein phosphorylation. These amiloride effects of “normalized” oncogenic RNA splicing and splicing factor hypo-phosphorylation were both abrogated by pre-treatment with a PP1 inhibitor. Global exon array of amiloride-treated Huh-7 cells detected splicing pattern changes involving 584 exons in 551 gene transcripts, many of which encode proteins playing key roles in ion transport, cellular matrix formation, cytoskeleton remodeling, and genome maintenance. Cellular functional analyses revealed subsequent invasion and migration defects, cell cycle disruption, cytokinesis impairment, and lethal DNA degradation in amiloride-treated Huh-7 cells. Other human solid tumor and leukemic cells, but not a few normal cells, showed similar amiloride-altered RNA splicing with devitalized consequence. This study thus provides mechanistic underpinnings for exploiting small molecule modulation of RNA splicing for cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2026618407,"Most terpenoids have been isolated from plants and fungi and only a few from bacteria. However, an increasing number of genome sequences indicate that bacteria possess a variety of terpenoid cyclase genes. We characterized a sesquiterpene cyclase gene (SGR2079, named gcoA) found in Streptomyces griseus. When expressed in Streptomyces lividans, gcoA directed production of a sesquiterpene, isolated and determined to be (+)-caryolan-1-ol using spectroscopic analyses. (+)-Caryolan-1-ol was also detected in the crude cell lysate of wild-type S. griseus but not in a gcoA knockout mutant, indicating that GcoA is a genuine (+)-caryolan-1-ol synthase. Enzymatic properties were characterized using N-terminally histidine-tagged GcoA, produced in Escherichia coli. As expected, incubation of the recombinant GcoA protein with farnesyl diphosphate yielded (+)-caryolan-1-ol. However, a small amount of another sesquiterpene was also detected. This was identified as the bicyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (+)-β-caryophyllene by comparison with an authentic sample using GC-MS. Incorporation of a deuterium atom into the C-9 methylene of (+)-caryolan-1-ol in an in vitro GcoA reaction in deuterium oxide indicated that (+)-caryolan-1-ol was synthesized by a proton attack on the C-8/C-9 double bond of (+)-β-caryophyllene. Several β-caryophyllene synthases have been identified from plants, but these cannot synthesize caryolan-1-ol.

https://openalex.org/W1975815570,"Activated cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) signaling has been implicated in the development of phenotypes associated with fatty liver, insulin resistance, and impaired suppression of hepatic glucose output. Endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated liver-specific transcription factor CREBH is emerging as a critical player in various hepatic metabolic pathways and regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis in diet-induced obese settings. In this study, we elucidated the critical role of CREBH in mediating CB1R signaling to regulate glucose homeostasis in primary rat and human hepatocytes. mRNA and protein levels and glucose production were analyzed in primary rat and human hepatocytes. ChIP assays were performed together with various transcriptional analyses using standard techniques. CB1R activation by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) specifically induced CREBH gene expression via phosphorylation of the JNK signaling pathway and c-Jun binding to the AP-1 binding site in the CREBH gene promoter. 2-AG treatment significantly induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production in primary hepatocytes, and we demonstrated that the CREBH binding site mutant significantly attenuated 2-AG-mediated activation of the gluconeogenic gene promoter. Endogenous knockdown of CREBH led to ablation of 2-AG-induced gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production, and the CB1R antagonist AM251 or insulin exhibited repression of CREBH gene induction and subsequently inhibited gluconeogenesis in both rat and human primary hepatocytes. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of activated CB1R signaling to induce hepatic gluconeogenesis via direct activation of CREBH, thereby contributing to a better understanding of the endocannabinoid signaling mechanism involved in regulating the hepatic glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2080429010,"Proteins that fail to fold or assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are destroyed by cytoplasmic proteasomes through a process known as ER-associated degradation. Substrates of this pathway are initially sequestered within the ER lumen and must therefore be dislocated across the ER membrane to be degraded. It has been proposed that generation of bicellar structures during lipid droplet formation may provide an ""escape hatch"" through which misfolded proteins, toxins, and viruses can exit the ER. We have directly tested this hypothesis by exploiting yeast strains defective in lipid droplet formation. Our data demonstrate that lipid droplet formation is dispensable for the dislocation of a plant toxin and the degradation of both soluble and integral membrane glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2003112798,"Background HLA class I and class II alleles have been shown to be associated with the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in different populations. However, the majority of studies have been based on limited numbers of patients. In this study we aimed to investigate the HLA-class I and class II alleles that are positively and negatively associated with the development of DSS in a cohort of patients with DHF and also the alleles associated with development of DHF during primary dengue infections in a Sri Lankan population. Methodology/Principal Findings The allele frequencies of HLA class I and class II alleles were compared in 110 patients with DHF and 119 individuals from the population who had never reported a symptomatic dengue infection at the time of recruitment. We found that HLA-A*31 (corrected P = 0.01) and DRB1*08 (corrected P = 0.009) were associated with susceptibility to DSS when infected with the dengue virus, during secondary dengue infection. The frequency of DRB1*08 allele was 28.7 times higher than in the normal population in patients with DSS. HLA-A*31 allele was increased 16.6 fold in DHF who developed shock when compared to those who did not develop shock. A*24 (corrected P = 0.03) and DRB1*12 (corrected P = 0.041) were strongly associated with the development of DHF during primary dengue infection. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that certain HLA alleles confer susceptibility/protection to severe dengue infections. As T cell epitope recognition depend on the HLA type of an individual, it would be now important to investigate how epitope specific T cells associate with primary and secondary dengue infections and in severe dengue infections."
https://openalex.org/W2005576388,"Here, we use pattern-classification to investigate diagnostic information for multiple sclerosis (MS; relapsing-remitting type) in lesioned areas, areas of normal-appearing grey matter (NAGM), and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) as measured by standard MR techniques.A lesion mapping was carried out by an experienced neurologist for Turbo Inversion Recovery Magnitude (TIRM) images of individual subjects. Combining this mapping with templates from a neuroanatomic atlas, the TIRM images were segmented into three areas of homogenous tissue types (Lesions, NAGM, and NAWM) after spatial standardization. For each area, a linear Support Vector Machine algorithm was used in multiple local classification analyses to determine the diagnostic accuracy in separating MS patients from healthy controls based on voxel tissue intensity patterns extracted from small spherical subregions of these larger areas. To control for covariates, we also excluded group-specific biases in deformation fields as a potential source of information.Among regions containing lesions a posterior parietal WM area was maximally informative about the clinical status (96% accuracy, p<10(-13)). Cerebellar regions were maximally informative among NAGM areas (84% accuracy, p<10(-7)). A posterior brain region was maximally informative among NAWM areas (91% accuracy, p<10(-10)).We identified regions indicating MS in lesioned, but also NAGM, and NAWM areas. This complements the current perception that standard MR techniques mainly capture macroscopic tissue variations due to focal lesion processes. Compared to current diagnostic guidelines for MS that define areas of diagnostic information with moderate spatial specificity, we identified hotspots of MS associated tissue alterations with high specificity defined on a millimeter scale."
https://openalex.org/W2010748740,"One of the challenging problems in the etiology of diseases is to explore the relationships between initiation and progression of diseases and abnormalities in local regions of metabolic pathways. To gain insight into such relationships, we applied the ""k-clique"" subpathway identification method to all disease-related gene sets. For each disease, the disease risk regions of metabolic pathways were then identified and considered as subpathways associated with the disease. We finally built a disease-metabolic subpathway network (DMSPN). Through analyses based on network biology, we found that a few subpathways, such as that of cytochrome P450, were highly connected with many diseases, and most belonged to fundamental metabolisms, suggesting that abnormalities of fundamental metabolic processes tend to cause more types of diseases. According to the categories of diseases and subpathways, we tested the clustering phenomenon of diseases and metabolic subpathways in the DMSPN. The results showed that both disease nodes and subpathway nodes displayed slight clustering phenomenon. We also tested correlations between network topology and genes within disease-related metabolic subpathways, and found that within a disease-related subpathway in the DMSPN, the ratio of disease genes and the ratio of tissue-specific genes significantly increased as the number of diseases caused by the subpathway increased. Surprisingly, the ratio of essential genes significantly decreased and the ratio of housekeeping genes remained relatively unchanged. Furthermore, the coexpression levels between disease genes and other types of genes were calculated for each subpathway in the DMSPN. The results indicated that those genes intensely influenced by disease genes, including essential genes and tissue-specific genes, might be significantly associated with the disease diversity of subpathways, suggesting that different kinds of genes within a disease-related subpathway may play significantly differential roles on the diversity of diseases caused by the corresponding subpathway."
https://openalex.org/W2017241520,"Quantification of microvascular network structure is important in a myriad of emerging research fields including microvessel remodeling in response to ischemia and drug therapy, tumor angiogenesis, and retinopathy. To mitigate analyst-specific variation in measurements and to ensure that measurements represent actual changes in vessel network structure and morphology, a reliable and automatic tool for quantifying microvascular network architecture is needed. Moreover, an analysis tool capable of acquiring and processing large data sets will facilitate advanced computational analysis and simulation of microvascular growth and remodeling processes and enable more high throughput discovery. To this end, we have produced an automatic and rapid vessel detection and quantification system using a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) that vastly reduces time spent on analysis and greatly increases repeatability. Analysis yields numerical measures of vessel volume fraction, vessel length density, fractal dimension (a measure of tortuosity), and radii of murine vascular networks. Because our GUI is open sourced to all, it can be easily modified to measure parameters such as percent coverage of non-endothelial cells, number of loops in a vascular bed, amount of perfusion and two-dimensional branch angle. Importantly, the GUI is compatible with standard fluorescent staining and imaging protocols, but also has utility analyzing brightfield vascular images, obtained, for example, in dorsal skinfold chambers. A manually measured image can be typically completed in 20 minutes to 1 hour. In stark comparison, using our GUI, image analysis time is reduced to around 1 minute. This drastic reduction in analysis time coupled with increased repeatability makes this tool valuable for all vessel research especially those requiring rapid and reproducible results, such as anti-angiogenic drug screening."

Examination of the endolysin (lysA) DNA sequence revealed the existence of an embedded gene (lysA(241)) encoded in the same reading frame and preceded by a consensus ribosome-binding site. In the present work we show that, even though lysA is essential for Ms6 viability, phage mutants that express only the longer (Lysin(384)) or the shorter (Lysin(241)) endolysin are viable, but defective in the normal timing, progression and completion of host cell lysis. In addition, both endolysins have peptidoglycan hydrolase activity and demonstrated broad growth inhibition activity against various gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1986410103,"α1-Antichymotrypsin (α1-ACT) is a specific inhibitor of leukocyte-derived chymotrypsin-like proteases with largely unknown functions in tissue repair. By examining human and murine skin wounds, we showed that following mechanical injury the physiological repair response is associated with an acute phase response of α1-ACT and the mouse homologue Spi-2, respectively. In both species, attenuated α1-ACT/Spi-2 activity and gene expression at the local wound site was associated with severe wound healing defects. Topical application of recombinant α1-ACT to wounds of diabetic mice rescued the impaired healing phenotype. LC-MS analysis of α1-ACT cleavage fragments identified a novel cleavage site within the reactive center loop and showed that neutrophil elastase was the predominant protease involved in unusual α1-ACT cleavage and inactivation in nonhealing human wounds. These results reveal critical functions for locally acting α1-ACT in the acute phase response following skin injury, provide mechanistic insight into its function during the repair response, and raise novel perspectives for its potential therapeutic value in inflammation-mediated tissue damage. α1-Antichymotrypsin (α1-ACT) is a specific inhibitor of leukocyte-derived chymotrypsin-like proteases with largely unknown functions in tissue repair.

These results reveal critical functions for locally acting α1-ACT in the acute phase response following skin injury, provide mechanistic insight into its function during the repair response, and raise novel perspectives for its potential therapeutic value in inflammation-mediated tissue damage. Skin injury induces a complex cellular response, involving up-regulation/activation of various growth factors, their receptors, extracellular matrix molecules, and diverse classes of proteases, with the primary goal to rapidly restore the skin barrier function and to re-establish tissue homeostasis. Restoration of the epidermis is achieved by epithelialization, and repair of the mesenchymal tissue involves formation of granulation tissue, which includes inflammation, angiogenesis, myofibroblast differentiation, and matrix deposition (1Gurtner G.C. Werner S. Barrandon Y. Longaker M.T. Nature. 2008; 453: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (3817) Google Scholar). These events are highly dynamic and tightly controlled in time and space. Indeed, failure to resolve the inflammatory response leads to abrogation of the repair process and nonhealing states with severe medical and economic impact (2Nathan C. Ding A. Cell. 2010; 140: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Substantial experimental and clinical evidence highlights the fundamental importance of a tightly regulated balance among different classes of proteases and their inhibitors during the wound healing process (3Zabel B.A. Zuniga L.

Biochem. 2009; 108: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Perturbations of the protease-inhibitor equilibrium with subsequent uncontrolled destruction of a variety of structural and functional proteins are considered the primary molecular mechanism underlying impaired healing in chronic skin ulcers associated with vascular disease (venous/arterial), diabetes mellitus, and aging (5Herrick S. Ashcroft G. Ireland G. Horan M. McCollum C. Ferguson M. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 281-288PubMed Google Scholar, 6Buchstein N. Hoffmann D. Smola H. Lang S. Paulsson M. Niemann C. Krieg T. Eming S.A. Am.

However, detailed knowledge on the disregulation of specific protease/inhibitor systems and direct functional consequences for the tissue repair response is scarce. In physiological skin repair a network of different classes of proteases and inhibitors, derived not only from blood plasma but also from diverse resident and nonresident skin cells, orchestrates the protease/inhibitor balance at the wound site. In chronic nonhealing skin ulcers, the prolonged and persistent leukocyte infiltrate is an important source of unrestrained protease activity (5Herrick S. Ashcroft G. Ireland G. Horan M. McCollum C.

Dermatol. 2005; 152: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), are likely to be of particular importance for the excessive pathological tissue destruction seen under these conditions. Protease inhibitors neutralizing these potent serine proteases are induced at the wound site in resident skin cells after injury, for example, epithelium-derived antiproteinase (SKALP/elafin) or secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (10van Bergen B.H.

Direct evidence for the importance of epithelium-derived secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in skin repair is provided by the severely impaired healing response of gene-modified mice deficient in secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (12Ashcroft G.S.

However, direct evidence for the role of blood plasma-derived protease inhibitors controlling leukocyte-derived proteases at the cutaneous wound site is currently lacking. The serpin family member α1-antichymotrypsin (α1-ACT, 2The abbreviations used are: α1-ACTα1-antichymotrypsinBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolα-SMAα-smooth muscle actinrα1-ACTrecombinant α1-ACT. serpin A3) represents one of the most abundant and potent plasma inhibitors for leukocyte-derived proteases and would likely contribute to reducing tissue damage by proteases that are released at the site of skin injury. Although its biological role is still uncertain, α1-ACT appears to be physiologically indispensable, because no homozygous α1-ACT-deficient individuals have been reported (14Gooptu B. Lomas D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 147-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The biological importance of α1-ACT in the extravascular compartment for tissue homeostasis is clearly shown in a variety of heterozygotic degenerative diseases (serpinopathies) that affect its structure and/or secretion and thereby reduce its activity and contribute to severe leukocyte protease-mediated tissue damage (14Gooptu B. Lomas D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 147-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The best studied diseases include emphysema (15Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. N. Engl. J.

Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). α1-ACT, like most inhibitory serpins, forms enzymatically inactive and irreversible stoichiometric complexes with its classical chymotrypsin-like target proteinases, including neutrophil cathepsin G, mast cell chymase, or pancreatic chymotrypsin. Binding of the substrate to the reactive center loop of α1-ACT leads to irreversible protease inhibition and a cleaved C-terminal fragment of α1-ACT (post-complex fragment) (19Egelund R.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the function of α1-ACT in skin injury and repair and its potential role in impaired healing conditions. A number of documented functions of α1-ACT in vitro suggest a potential role in the protection from inflammation-mediated tissue damage and in the promotion of tissue-regenerative processes. In addition to its antiprotease properties (22Pham C.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 23Kilpatrick L. Johnson J.L. Nickbarg E.B. Wang Z.M.

Dermatol. 2008; 128: 2334-2342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified several members of the serpin protein family, particularly α1-ACT, in a differential proteomic analysis that distinguished tissue repair biomarker signatures among healing and nonhealing human skin wounds (26Eming S.A. Koch M. Krieger A. Brachvogel B. Kreft S. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Krieg T. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4758-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, when viewed in the context of degenerative nonhealing skin wounds, α1-ACT is a potential candidate for protecting the tissue against proteolytic attack and for enhancing the healing response. The results presented in this study provide functional evidence for such a crucial function of α1-ACT in the wound healing process and identify this protein as a novel target for the treatment of recalcitrant nonhealing skin ulcers. C57BLKS/J-m+/+Leprdb/wt mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were mated; mice homogenous for the leptin receptor mutation developed diabetes (db/db), and mice lacking the mutation (WT) were used as control animals. Genotyping of mice was performed as described previously (27Roth D. Piekarek M. Paulsson M. Christ H. Bloch W. Krieg T. Davidson J.M. Eming S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 670-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mice (male, 10–12 weeks of age) were caged individually under standard pathogen-free conditions in the animal care facility of the Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany. Two independent wound healing experiments were performed. In total, three mice per time point and condition (in total 12 experimental mice and 6 control mice) were analyzed. Mice were anesthetized under Ketanest/Rompun (Ketanest S, Park Davies GmbH, Karlsruhe, and 2% Rompun, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). The backs of the animals were shaved, and four full-thickness punch-biopsy wounds were created. Immediately after wounding and then for the following 6 days, treatment of wounds was performed by either applying 50 μl of rα1-ACT solution at two different concentrations (0.4 or 2.0 mg/ml) (08ACT04-04, Bayer Schering Pharma, Wuppertal, Germany) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl solution) (control) onto the wound bed. Solution was allowed to adsorb for at least 1 h before the animal was placed back into its cage. Wound closure was determined through digital processing of photographs taken daily during the time of healing using the Imaging Software Lucia G 4.80 (Dental Eye, Olympus, Japan; Imaging Software Lucia G 4.80, Laboratory Imaging Ltd., Prague, Czech Republic). For histological analysis, animals were sacrificed, and wound tissues were harvested 5 and 10 days after wounding. Wound tissue was excised, and the wound area bisected in a caudocranial direction. The tissue was either fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or embedded in OCT compound (Tissue Tek, Sakura Finetek, NL), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Histological analysis was performed on serial sections (5-μm cryosections) from the central portion of the wound. To process tissue sections for the detection of CD31 (PECAM-1), 5-μm cryosections were fixed in acetone, and endogenous peroxidase was inactivated (0.03% H2O2, 0.15 m NaN3), and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. Sections were incubated with polyclonal rat antisera against murine CD31 (1 h at room temperature, 1:500, Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). Bound primary CD31 antibody was detected using an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rat antibody (1 h, 1:500, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). For staining of α-SMA, cryosections were fixed and blocked as outlined above and incubated with Cy3-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-α-SMA antibody (1 h, room temperature, 1:200, Sigma). For double staining of α1-ACT and CD68 in human wound tissue, cryosections were fixed and blocked as outlined above and incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibody against human α1-ACT (1:50 dilution, 1 h at room temperature; Biotrend GmbH, Cologne, Germany) and monoclonal mouse antibody against human CD68 (1:100 dilution, 1 h at room temperature; BMA Biomedicals). Bound primary antibody was detected using an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse antibody, respectively. α1-ACT staining on mouse wound tissue was performed on paraffin sections using the Dako Envision anti-rabbit HRP kit (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany) with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as substrate. The α1-ACT antibody cross-reacts to 60% with mouse α1-ACT, as indicated by the manufacturer. As a control for specificity, primary antibodies were omitted and replaced by irrelevant isotype-matched antibodies. Mouse cDNA of 5-day-old wounds was subjected to 40 cycles of PCR to generate a fragment of Spi-2 (nucleotides 1036–1334, GenBankTM accession number NM_009252.2). The resultant cDNA fragment was subcloned using a TOPO cloning kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) and was verified by sequencing. Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized with T3 and T7 polymerases, using the digoxigenin RNA labeling mixture from Roche Applied Science according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (28Thorey I.S. Roth J. Regenbogen J. Halle J.P. Bittner M. Vogl T. Kaesler S. Bugnon P. Reitmaier B. Durka S. Graf A. Wöckner M. Rieger N. Konstantinow A. Wolf E. Goppelt A. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35818-35825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Immunofluorescence/immunohistochemical microscopy was conducted at the indicated magnifications (Microscope Eclipse 800E; Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany). Morphometric analysis was performed on digital images using the imaging software Lucia G 4.80 (Laboratory Imaging Ltd., Prague, Czech Republic). The extent of epithelialization and granulation tissue formation was determined on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained paraffin tissue sections. The length of the epithelial tongue was determined as the distance between the epithelial tip and the margin of the wound as defined by the presence of hair follicles in nonwounded skin. This parameter reflects the formation of neo-epithelium. In addition, the width of the gap between the epithelial tips reflects wound closure. The distance between the edges of the panniculus carnosus was determined as a measure of wound contraction. Granulation tissue was defined as the cellular and vascular tissue that formed underneath the neo-epithelium and between the wound margins and above the subcutaneous fat tissue. For quantitative analysis of CD31 or α-SMA expression, the area that stained positive for CD31 or α-SMA within the granulation tissue was calculated. Wound exudate was obtained from patients presenting with nonhealing chronic ulcera crura due to venous insufficiency (n = 15) or from patients with normally healing cutaneous wounds (n = 5; excisional wounds of the lower leg awaiting wound closure by secondary intention). A summary of the clinical features and wounds from patients is provided in supplemental Table 1. To accumulate exudate, the wound was covered with a semipermeable polyurethane film (Hyalofilm, Hartmann, Heidelberg, Germany) for a maximum of 8 h. A maximum of 1 ml of exudate per wound was usually obtained. Following exudate collection, fluids were centrifuged (10 min, 13,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material, and supernatants were frozen at −80 °C until use. Biopsies were taken by consent from patients presenting chronic ulcera crura (n = 8) due to venous insufficiency; for clinical features and wounds from patients see supplemental Table 1. The biopsies (spindle-shaped 1 cm length × 0.3 cm width × 0.5 cm depth) were obtained from the wound edge of chronic wounds. Tissue of normally healing human wounds (n = 4 per time point) was taken by consent from healthy volunteers. Wounds were created by performing a punch biopsy (6 mm diameter × 0.5 cm depth), and at indicated time points following wounding, the wound was excised. Wound tissues were processed for histological analysis as described for murine tissue. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles, and skin biopsies were collected according to a protocol approved by the Ethics committee at the University of Cologne and Technical University of Munich (tissue samples of normal healing wounds used for quantitative RNA analysis); written informed consent from patients was received prior inclusion in the study. Wound tissue was excised at different time points after injury as indicated. For preparation of RNA, the tissue from four mouse wounds or four human wounds per time point was pooled, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used for RNA isolation. After homogenization of biopsies, total RNA was prepared by a modification of the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (58Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63143) Google Scholar). For cDNA synthesis, MultiScribe reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Murine spi-2.2 expression was normalized to gapdh, whereas α1-ACT was quantified relative to cyclophilin. Primers specific for murine gapdh are as follows: forward 5′-ATC AAC GGG AAG CCC ATC A-3′ and reverse 5′-GAC ATA CTC AGC ACC GGC CT-3′. Primers specific for spi-2.2 are as follows: 5′-CTG TCC TCT GCT TCC CAG ATG-3′ and 5′-TCC AGT TGT GTC CCA TTG TCA-3′. Primers specific for human cyclophilin are as follows: forward 5′-GGA ATG GCA AGA CCA GCA AG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGA TAC TGC GAG CAA ATG GG-3′. Primers specific for human aact are as follows: forward 5′-AGG CCT TTG CCA CTG ACT TTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCG AGT CAA GGT CCT TGA TCA-3′. Amplification reactions, each in triplicate, were set up using PowerSYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using the 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The comparative method of relative quantification (2−δδCt) was used to calculate expression level of the target gene normalized to gapdh or cyclophilin. Data are expressed as relative increase of spi-2.2 and aact expression over healthy nonwounded skin. 96-Well plates (Nunc Immuno Plate Maxi Sorp, Sigma) were coated with human cathepsin G protein (1 μg/ml; 100 μl/well) (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, plates were washed four times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. A serial dilution of wound exudate or plasma serum samples was prepared in 1% BSA in PBS (measurements were performed in duplicate). Recombinant human α1-ACT protein (rα1-ACT protein synthesized in Escherichia coli) served as a standard; the sensitivity of the assay was 0.4–43.5 ng/ml; reaction time was 60 min at 37 °C. Bound α1-ACT was detected with a rabbit antibody against human α1-ACT (1:1000 dilution, 60 min at 37 °C; Biotrend GmbH, Cologne, Germany). Bound primary antibody was detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution, 60 min at 37 °C, Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase was reacted with p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma), and the reaction product was quantified using an ELISA plate reader (Nunc Immunoreader NJ 2000, Sigma) at 405 nm. Concentration of active α1-ACT was calculated by four-parameter regression (GraphPad Prism 5). Recombinant human α1-ACT (rα1-ACT) was expressed in E. coli W3110. Expression was performed in Terrific Broth containing 25 mg/liter kanamycin at 25 °C overnight. Cells were lysed in ice-cold 50 mm citrate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 5, 0.25 mg of lysozyme per g cell wet weight, 10 mm MgCl2, 12.5 units/ml benzonase by high pressure homogenization. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatant was applied onto a Capto MMC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8. After washing with equilibration buffer, the product was eluted with a linear gradient to 50 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.3. Fractions containing α1-ACT were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and applied onto a Capto Q column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and the product was eluted with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl in washing buffer. The final product was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, 1% sucrose, 2% glycine, pH 7.5, and lyophilized. Endotoxin content in the final product was 12 endotoxin units/mg, and the purity was >95% as determined by RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE. Identity of the product was confirmed by mass spectrometry and by N-terminal sequencing. Synthesis of α1-[15N]ACT was performed in 800 ml shaking flasks at 25 °C by incubating cells in a minimal medium with [15N]NH4Cl. After cell lysis by high pressure homogenization, the protein was purified as described above for the unlabeled rACT. The final product was stored frozen at −70 °C. Activity of rα1-ACT was shown by inhibition of cathepsin G. ACT was incubated at different concentrations with cathepsin G (AppliChem; final concentration 7.3 μg/ml; 0.25 μm) in a total volume of 300 μl (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The substrate succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide was used to monitor cathepsin G activity, and the reaction rate was detected in microtiter plates at 410 nm for 10 min at room temperature. SDS-PAGE was performed following the protocol of Laemmli (59Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar). To analyze the stability of rα1-ACT in wound fluid, 600 ng of rα1-ACT protein produced in E. coli was incubated at 37 °C with 9 μl of wound fluid and reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). At indicated time points, reactions were terminated by the addition of reducing Laemmli buffer. The reactions were resolved on a 4–12% reducing BisTris SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C-extra, Amersham Biosciences). Integrity of rα1-ACT was determined by detecting immunoreactive products with an anti-human rα1-ACT monoclonal mouse antibody (1:5000, US Biological). Bound primary antibody was detected using an anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000, DAKO A/S, Denmark). Detection was accomplished using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). To assess complex formation of rα1-ACT with its target proteases, rα1-ACT was diluted to a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and cathepsin G (AppliChem) was diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 25 mm NaCH2COOH, pH 5.5, containing 400 mm NaCl. The two components were mixed in different ratios as indicated to give a final volume of 50 μl and were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to allow formation of the complex. The reaction was terminated by addition of 17 μl of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. The samples were separated on a BisTris gel (4–12%) according to the supplier's instruction. Gel staining was performed with the colloidal blue staining kit (Invitrogen). Working solutions of rα1-ACT and the internal standard rα1-[15N]ACT were prepared by dilution of rα1-ACT and rα1-[15N]ACT stock solutions with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. To assess the rα1-ACT degrading activity of the wound exudates, 10 μl of exudate were transferred into 1.5-ml safe-lock tubes, and 10 μl of inhibitor solution was added. After that, 50 μl of rα1-ACT working solution (1.5 mg/ml) were transferred into the sample tubes, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for a defined period. The incubation was stopped by addition of 10 μl 20% phosphoric acid (Merck) or 98–100% formic acid (Merck). Finally, 50 μl of internal standard working solution and 1900 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, were added, and the sample was transferred to LC-MS analysis. The following substances were examined for their potential to inhibit rα1-ACT degradation: SSR 69071 (concentrations as indicated; Tocris Biosciences, Bristol, UK), EDTA disodium dihydrate (5 mm) (Merck), ciclopiroxolamine (1.43 and 14.3 μm), deferoxamine mesylate (0.143 and 1.43 mm), doxycycline hyclate (71.4 and 714 μm), and 1,10-phenanthroline (0.0143, 0.143, 1.43 mm) (all Sigma). Comparative measurements between stabilized and nonstabilized exudate samples were performed. For the stabilized exudate samples, phosphoric or formic acid was added prior to rα1-ACT, so that the processing order was exudate + acid + rα1-ACT → incubation → internal standard + Tris buffer. In contrast, acid was not added until the end of the incubation period for the nonstabilized exudate samples exudate + rα1-ACT → incubation → internal standard + Tris buffer. The chromatograms were visually compared for obvious differences in their peak patterns. The pertaining m/z ratios of conspicuous chromatographic peaks were deconvoluted using ProMass for Xcalibur, version 2.5 SR-1 (Novatia, Monmouth Junction, NJ), and verified with N- and C-terminal rα1-ACT peptide fragments known from literature or calculated by GPMAW32, version 10sr1 (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). Chromatographic separation was performed using gradient elution with water + 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile + 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phases and a YMC-Pack Butyl, 20 nm, S-5 μm; 10 × 2.1-mm column (YMC, Dinslaken, Germany). The samples for the assessment of the rα1-ACT degrading activity of wound exudates were measured with a TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quad mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Positive electrospray ionization was used, and the following m/z ratios of the analyte and the internal standard were monitored in the selected reaction monitoring mode: 1377.0 Thomson (corre"
https://openalex.org/W2157237540,"Visfatin has been proposed as an insulin-mimicking adipocytokine, predominantly secreted from adipose tissue and correlated with obesity. However, recent studies suggest visfatin may act as a proinflammatory cytokine. Our studies sought to determine the significance of this adipocytokine and its potential role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Firstly, we examined the effects of diabetic status on circulating visfatin levels, and several other adipocytokines, demonstrating that diabetic status increased visfatin*, TNF-α*** and IL-6*** compared with non-diabetic subjects (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, respectively). We then assessed the effects of an insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone (RSG), in treatment naïve T2DM subjects, on circulating visfatin levels. Our findings showed that visfatin was reduced post-RSG treatment [vs. pre-treatment (*p<0.05)] accompanied by a reduction in HOMA-IR**, thus implicating a role for insulin in visfatin regulation. Further studies addressed the intracellular mechanisms by which visfatin may be regulated, and may exert pro-inflammatory effects, in human abdominal subcutaneous (Abd Sc) adipocytes. Following insulin (Ins) and RSG treatment, our in vitro findings highlighted that insulin (100 nM), alone, upregulated visfatin protein expression whereas, in combination with RSG (10 nM), it reduced visfatin*, IKKβ** and p-JNK1/2*. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK protein exacted a significant reduction in visfatin expression (**p<0.01), whilst NF-κB blockade increased visfatin (*p<0.05), thus identifying JNK as the more influential factor in visfatin regulation. Additional in vitro analysis on adipokines regulating visfatin showed that only Abd Sc adipocytes treated with recombinant human (rh)IL-6 increased visfatin protein (*p<0.05), whilst rh visfatin treatment, itself, had no influence on TNF-α, IL-6 or resistin secretion from Sc adipocytes. These data highlight visfatin's regulation by insulin and RSG, potentially acting through NF-κB and JNK mechanisms, with only rh IL-6 modestly affecting visfatin regulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that visfatin may represent a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is influenced by insulin/insulin sensitivity via the NF-κB and JNK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2001467114,"Approximately half of known human miRNAs are located in the introns of protein coding genes. Some of these intronic miRNAs are only expressed when their host gene is and, as such, their steady state expression levels are highly correlated with those of the host gene's mRNA. Recently host gene expression levels have been used to predict the targets of intronic miRNAs by identifying other mRNAs that they have consistent negative correlation with. This is a potentially powerful approach because it allows a large number of expression profiling studies to be used but needs refinement because mRNAs can be targeted by multiple miRNAs and not all intronic miRNAs are co-expressed with their host genes. Here we introduce InMiR, a new computational method that uses a linear-Gaussian model to predict the targets of intronic miRNAs based on the expression profiles of their host genes across a large number of datasets. Our method recovers nearly twice as many true positives at the same fixed false positive rate as a comparable method that only considers correlations. Through an analysis of 140 Affymetrix datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus, we build a network of 19,926 interactions among 57 intronic miRNAs and 3,864 targets. InMiR can also predict which host genes have expression profiles that are good surrogates for those of their intronic miRNAs. Host genes that InMiR predicts are bad surrogates contain significantly more miRNA target sites in their 3′ UTRs and are significantly more likely to have predicted Pol II and Pol III promoters in their introns. We provide a dataset of 1,935 predicted mRNA targets for 22 intronic miRNAs. These prediction are supported both by sequence features and expression. By combining our results with previous reports, we distinguish three classes of intronic miRNAs: Those that are tightly regulated with their host gene; those that are likely to be expressed from the same promoter but whose host gene is highly regulated by miRNAs; and those likely to have independent promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2030320360,"Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that is abundant in the sensory neurons which innervate bone. The effects of CGRP on isolated bone cells have been widely studied, and CGRP is currently considered to be an osteoanabolic peptide that has effects on both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. However, relatively little is known about the physiological role of CGRP in-vivo in the skeletal responses to bone loading, particularly fatigue loading.We used the rat ulna end-loading model to induce fatigue damage in the ulna unilaterally during cyclic loading. We postulated that CGRP would influence skeletal responses to cyclic fatigue loading. Rats were fatigue loaded and groups of rats were infused systemically with 0.9% saline, CGRP, or the receptor antagonist, CGRP(8-37), for a 10 day study period. Ten days after fatigue loading, bone and serum CGRP concentrations, serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) concentrations, and fatigue-induced skeletal responses were quantified. We found that cyclic fatigue loading led to increased CGRP concentrations in both loaded and contralateral ulnae. Administration of CGRP(8-37) was associated with increased targeted remodeling in the fatigue-loaded ulna. Administration of CGRP or CGRP(8-37) both increased reparative bone formation over the study period. Plasma concentration of TRAP5b was not significantly influenced by either CGRP or CGRP(8-37) administration.CGRP signaling modulates targeted remodeling of microdamage and reparative new bone formation after bone fatigue, and may be part of a neuronal signaling pathway which has regulatory effects on load-induced repair responses within the skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1975975591,"Our studies demonstrated that Heme oxygenase (HO), in particular, the constitutive HO-2, is critical for a self-resolving inflammatory and repair response in the cornea. Epithelial injury in HO-2 null mice leads to impaired wound closure and chronic inflammation in the cornea. This study was undertaken to examine the possible relationship between HO-2 and the recruitment of neutrophils following a corneal surface injury in wild type (WT) and HO-2 knockout (HO-2−/−) mice treated with Gr-1 monoclonal antibody to deplete peripheral neutrophils. Epithelial injury was performed by removing the entire corneal epithelium. Infiltration of inflammatory cell into the cornea in response to injury was higher in HO-2−/− than in WT. However, the rate of corneal wound closure following neutrophil depletion was markedly inhibited in both WT and HO-2−/− mice by 60% and 85%, respectively. Neutropenia induced HO-1 expression in WT but not in HO-2−/− mice. Moreover, endothelial cells lacking HO-2 expressed higher levels of the Midkine and VE-cadherin and displayed strong adhesion to neutrophils suggesting that perturbation in endothelial cell function caused by HO-2 depletion underlies the increased infiltration of neutrophils into the HO-2−/− cornea. Moreover, the fact that neutropenia worsened epithelial healing of the injured cornea in both WT and HO-2−/− mice suggest that cells other than neutrophils contribute to the exaggerated inflammation and impaired wound healing seen in the HO-2 null cornea."
https://openalex.org/W2019108023,"The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms of IFN induction and viral escape. In order to accomplish the goal we compared our new hepatoma cell line LH86, which has intact TLR3 and RIG-I expression and responds to HCV by inducing IFN, with Huh7.5 cells which lack those features.The initial interaction of LH86 cells, Huh7.5 cells or their transfected counter parts (LH86 siRIG-I, siTLR3 or siTLR7 and Huh7.5 RIG-I, TLR3 or TLR7) after infection with HCV (strain JFH-1) was studied by measuring the expression levels of IFNβ, TRAIL, DR4, DR5 and their correlation to viral replication.HCV replicating RNA induces IFN in LH86 cells. The IFN induction system is functional in LH86, and the expression of the RIG-I and TLR3 in LH86 is comparable to the primary hepatocytes. Both proteins appear to play important roles in suppression of viral replication. We found that innate immunity against HCV is associated with the induction of apoptosis by RIG-I through the TRAIL pathway and the establishment of an antiviral state by TLR3. HCV envelope proteins interfere with the expression of TLR3 and RIG-I.These findings correlate with the lower expression level of PRRs in HCV chronic patients and highlight the importance of the PRRs in the initial interaction of the virus and its host cells. This work represents a novel mechanism of viral pathogenesis for HCV and demonstrates the role of PRRs in viral infection."

However, little is known about whether PDK1 in agouti-related peptide (AGRP) neurons contributes to energy homeostasis. We generated AGRP neuron-specific PDK1 knockout (AGRPPdk1(-/-)) mice and mice with selective expression of transactivation-defective Foxo1 (Δ256Foxo1(AGRP)Pdk1(-/-)). The AGRPPdk1(-/-) mice showed reductions in food intake, body length, and body weight. The Δ256Foxo1(AGRP)Pdk1(-/-) mice showed increased body weight, food intake, and reduced locomotor activity. After four weeks of calorie-restricted feeding, oxygen consumption and locomotor activity were elevated in AGRPPdk1(-/-) mice and reduced in Δ256Foxo1(AGRP)Pdk1(-/-) mice. In vitro, ghrelin-induced changes in [Ca(2+)](i) and inhibition of ghrelin by leptin were significantly attenuated in AGRPPdk1(-/-) neurons compared to control neurons. However, ghrelin-induced [Ca(2+)](i) changes and leptin inhibition were restored in Δ256Foxo1(AGRP)Pdk1(-/-) mice.

Although the covalent modification of proteins by these end products has been well studied, the reactivity of unstable intermediates possessing a hydroperoxy group, such as 4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal (HPNE), with protein has received little attention. We have now established a unique protein modification in which the 4-hydroperoxy group of HPNE is involved in the formation of structurally unusual lysine adducts. In addition, we showed that one of the HPNE-specific lysine adducts constitutes the epitope of a monoclonal antibody raised against the HPNE-modified protein. Upon incubation with bovine serum albumin, HPNE preferentially reacted with the lysine residues. By employing Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine, we detected two major products containing one HPNE molecule per peptide. Based on the chemical and spectroscopic evidence, the products were identified to be the Nα-benzoylglycyl derivatives of Nϵ-4-hydroxynonanoic acid-lysine and Nϵ-4-hydroxy-(2Z)-nonenoyllysine, both of which are suggested to be formed through mechanisms in which the initial HPNE-lysine adducts undergo Baeyer-Villiger-like reactions proceeding through an intramolecular oxidation catalyzed by the hydroperoxy group. On the other hand, using an HPNE-modified protein as the immunogen, we raised a monoclonal antibody against the HPNE-modified protein and identified one of the HPNE-specific lysine adducts, Nϵ-4-hydroxynonanoic acid-lysine, as an intrinsic epitope of the monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the HPNE-specific epitopes were produced not only in the oxidized low density lipoprotein in vitro but also in the atherosclerotic lesions.

These results indicated that HPNE is not just an intermediate but also a reactive molecule that could covalently modify proteins in biological systems. Lipid peroxidation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in drug-associated toxicity, postischemic reoxygenation injury, and aging (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation proceeds by a free radical chain reaction mechanism and yields lipid hydroperoxides as the major initial reaction products. Subsequently, the decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides generates a number of breakdown products that display a wide variety of damaging actions (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Among them are a variety of different aldehydes. The primary products of lipid peroxidation, lipid hydroperoxides, can undergo carbon-carbon bond cleavage via alkoxyl radicals in the presence of transition metals, giving rise to the formation of short-chain, unesterified aldehydes of 3–9 carbons in length and a second class of aldehydes still esterified to the parent lipid (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). The important agents that give rise to the modification of a protein may be represented by reactive aldehydic intermediates, such as 2-alkenals, 4-oxo-2-alkenals, and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 3Stadtman E.R.

These α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are considered important mediators of cell damage due to their ability to covalently modify biomolecules, which can disrupt important cellular functions and can cause mutations (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adduction of aldehydes to the apolipoprotein B in low density lipoproteins (LDL) has been strongly implicated in the mechanism by which LDL is converted to the atherogenic form that is taken up by macrophages, leading to the formation of foam cells (5Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Steinberg D. Lancet. 1995; 346: 36-38Abstract PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Among the variety of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) 2The abbreviations used are: HNE4-hydroxy-2-nonenalCOSYcorrelation spectroscopyESIelectrospray ionizationHMBCheteronuclear multiple bond correlationHMQCheteronuclear multiple quantum correlationHPNE4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenalMDAmalondialdehydeONE4-oxo-2-nonenalSMAα-smooth muscle actinONE4-oxo-2-nonenalDAB3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. is a major product of lipid peroxidation and is believed to be largely responsible for the cytopathological effects observed during oxidative stress (2Esterbauer H.

HNE exerts these effects because of its facile reactivity with biological materials, including proteins (2Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol.

Upon the reaction with protein, HNE specifically reacts with nucleophilic amino acids, such as cysteine, histidine, and lysine, to form their Michael addition adducts possessing a carbonyl functionality. 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal correlation spectroscopy electrospray ionization heteronuclear multiple bond correlation heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation 4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal malondialdehyde 4-oxo-2-nonenal α-smooth muscle actin 4-oxo-2-nonenal 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. It is generally believed that HNE is directly formed through reduction of 4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal (HPNE), the 4-hydroperoxy analog of HNE. HPNE was originally recognized as an enzymatic product of the ω6-polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in plants (8Gardner H.W. Hamberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6971-6977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Brash and colleagues (9Schneider C. Tallman K.A. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20831-20838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) reported that the formation of HPNE is also generated through a Hock rearrangement during homolytic decomposition of the prototypic polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxide, 13-[S-(Z,E)]-9,11-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. Moreover, they established two distinct mechanisms leading to the formation of HNE via HPNE in which the allylic hydrogen abstraction at C-8 of 13S-HPODE leads to a 10,13-dihydroperoxide that undergoes cleavage between C-9 and C-10 to give 4S-HPNE, whereas 9S-HPODE directly cleaves to (3Z)-nonenal as a precursor of the racemic HPNE (9Schneider C.

Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 13Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), a particularly potent lipid hydroperoxide-derived genotoxin that can readily react with nucleophilic biomacromolecules, such as protein and DNA (14Rindgen D. Nakajima M. Wehrli S. Xu K. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, HPNE has been recognized as a direct precursor of the most representative α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, HNE and ONE (Fig. 1). On the other hand, due to the unstable nature of the hydroperoxy group, HPNE has received relatively little attention as the causative agent for modification of nucleophilic biomolecules. In the present study, we characterized the HPNE modification of lysine residues, identified two novel HPNE-specific lysine adducts, and established a unique adduction mechanism, in which the 4-hydroperoxy group of HPNE is involved in the adduction chemistry. In addition, we showed that one of the HPNE-specific lysine adducts constitutes the epitope of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised against the HPNE-modified protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the HPNE-specific epitopes were indeed generated not only in the oxidized low density lipoprotein in vitro but also in the atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. These results indicate that HPNE is not just a precursor of HNE and ONE but also a reactive molecule that could directly modify proteins in biological systems. (3Z)-Nonenol and pyridiniumchlorochromate were obtained from TCI (Tokyo, Japan). Nα-Benzoylglycyl-lysine was obtained from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). The 1H NMR spectra (400 or 600 MHz) and 13C NMR spectra (100 or 150 MHz) were recorded at 27 °C on an AMX 400 (400 MHz) or an AMX 600 (600 MHz) spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). In all cases, tetramethylsilane or the solvent peak served as the internal standard for reporting the chemical shifts, which are expressed as parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane (δ scale). The 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), 1H-detected heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC), and 1H-detected heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiments were carried out using an AMX 400 (400 MHz) or an AMX 600 (600 MHz) instrument. The UPLC-MS analysis was carried out using a Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) coupled to a Waters Acquity TQD tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters) with electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive and negative modes. The high resolution mass spectral data were obtained using a Mariner Biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the positive ESI mode. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted using a JASCO system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). HPNE was prepared by the autoxidation of (3Z)-nonenal (15Tijet N. Schneider C. Muller B.L.

Briefly, to a NaOAc-buffered solution (54 mg, 0.4 mmol) of pyridiniumchlorochromate (231 mg, 2 mmol, 2 eq) in 4 ml of methylene chloride, (3Z)-nonenol (142 mg, 1 mmol) dissolved in 2 ml of methylene chloride was added. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 ml of diethyl ether and immediately filtered through a column of silica gel eluted with methylene chloride to remove the oxidizing agent. The crude product was isolated by open bed column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/EtOAc (90:10) (v/v)). In the autoxidation reaction, (3Z)-nonenal was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of water/acetonitrile and bubbled with oxygen for 18 h at ambient temperature. After extracting with hexane, an aqueous layer was injected on a preparative C18 column (10 × 250 mm; ChromaNik, Osaka, Japan) eluted with a solvent of acetonitrile/water/TFA (53:47:0.1, v/v/v) at the flow rate of 2.5 ml/min and monitored by UV 220 nm. The collected product was evaporated from acetonitrile and then extracted using a 100-mg C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) eluted with acetonitrile. Modification of the protein by HPNE was performed by incubating BSA (1.0 mg/ml) with 0.5–10 mm HPNE in 1.0 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 24 h. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). The protein was stained with Coomassie Blue. An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the protein samples (1.0 mg/ml) incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of HPNE was treated with 10 mm EDTA (10 μl), 1 n NaOH (10 μl), and 100 mm sodium borohydride (10 μl). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, 10 μl of 2 n HCl was added to the mixture to stop the reaction, and the mixture was then incubated for 60 min at room temperature after adding 140 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the proteins were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 2 ml of 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were then dried and dissolved in sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.15. The amino acid analysis was performed using a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 data-analyzing system. The reaction mixture containing 5 mm Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine was incubated with 5 mm HPNE in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After incubation for 0–24 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by a reverse-phase HPLC on a ChromaNik Sunniest RP-AQUA column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; ChromaNik, Osaka, Japan) eluted with a linear gradient of water containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A)-acetonitrile (solvent B) (time = 0 min, 2% B; 40–50 min, 100% B) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 200–650 nm. HPNE (5 mm) was added to a solution of Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine (5 mm) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the mixture was subjected to preparative HPLC on a ChromaNik Sunniest RP-AQUA column (10.0-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; ChromaNik, Osaka, Japan) using a gradient of 10–60% aqueous CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA. The products I–IV were further purified by preparative HPLC on the same column under each of the elution conditions. A secondary purification was conducted using 21% aqueous CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA to give I (1.6%, based on HPNE). 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 8.94 (1H, d, J = 8.4 Hz, H-3), 7.86 (2H, d, J = 7.2 Hz, H-11′, 15′), 7.53 (1H, t, J = 7.2 Hz, H-13′), 7.46 (2H, t, J = 7.2 Hz, H-12′, 14′), 7.24 (1H, dd, J = 6.0, 13.2 Hz, H-1), 5.03 (1H, dd, J = 8.4, 13.2 Hz, H-2), 4.17 (1H, m, H-5′), 3.91 (2H, dd, J = 6.0, 16.2 Hz, H-8′), 2.96 (2H, m, H-1′), 1.71 (1H, m, H-4′), 1.60 (1H, m, H-4′),1.48 (2H, m, H-2′), 1.33 (2H, m, H-3′). 13C NMR (150 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 188.6 (C-3), 173.6 (C-6′), 168.9 (C-7′), 166.6 (C-9′), 157.7 (C-1), 134.1 (C-10′), 131.4 (C-13′), 128.4 (C-12′, 14′), 127.4 (C-11′, 15′), 100.0 (C-2), 52.1 (C-5), 42.7 (C-1′), 42.5 (C-8′), 31.1 (C-4′), 27.2 (C-2′), 22.8 (C-3′). HR-ESI-MS: m/z 362.1684 (calcd for C18H23N3O5 + H: 362.1710).

HR-ESI-MS: m/z 480.2684 (calcd for C24H37N3O7 + H: 480.2704). The authentic sample was synthesized as follows. A solution of 0.8 g (8.8 mmol) of NaClO2 in 7 ml of water was added dropwise to a stirred mixture of 100 mg (0.2 mmol) of the HNE-Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine Michael adduct in 5 ml of 50% aqueous CH3CN and 160 mg of NaH2PO4 in 2 ml of water and 500 ml of 31% H2O2 at room temperature. After 4 h, a small amount (50 mg) of Na2SO3 was added to destroy the unreacted HOCl and H2O2. The reaction product was evaporated from acetonitrile, extracted using a 100-mg C18 Sep-Pak cartridge eluted with acetonitrile. A secondary purification was conducted using 40% aqueous CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA to give III (8.3%, based on HPNE). 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 7.87 (2H, d, J = 7.4 Hz, H-11′, 15′), 7.54 (1H, d, J = 7.4 Hz, H-13′), 7.47 (2H, t, J = 7.4 Hz, H-12′, 14′), 5.86 (1H, dd, J = 7.6, 11.6 Hz, H-3), 5.70 (1H, d, J = 11.6 Hz, H-2), 4.98 (1H, m, H-4), 4.20 (1H, m, H-5′), 3.93 (2H, dd, J = 6.0, 10.4 Hz, H-8′), 3.05 (2H, m, H-1′), 1.71 (1H, m, H-4′), 1.59 (1H, m, H-4′), 1.45–1.18 (12H, m, H-5, 6, 7, 8, 2′, 3′), 0.85 (3H, t, J = 6.8 Hz, H-9). 13C NMR (150 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 173.5 (C-6′), 168.9 (C-7′), 166.4 (C-9′), 165.4 (C-1), 148.1 (C-3), 134.1 (C-10′), 131.3 (C-13′), 128.3 (C-12′, 14′), 127.3 (C-11′, 15′), 121.4 (C-2), 66.3 (C-4), 51.8 (C-5′), 42.2 (C-8′), 38.2 (C-1′), 36.7 (C-5), 31.3 (C-7), 30.9 (C-4′), 28.6 (C-2′), 24.5 (C-6), 22.9 (C-3′), 22.1 (C-8), 13.8 (C-9). HR-ESI-MS: m/z 462.2603 (calcd for C24H35N3O6 + H: 462.2598). A secondary purification was conducted using 40% aqueous CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA to give IV (15.1%, based on HPNE). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): δ 7.60 (1H, dd, J = 1.6, 5.6 Hz, H-3), 6.05 (1H, dd, J = 2.0, 5.6 Hz, H-2), 5.06 (1H, m, H-4), 1.75 (1H, m, H-5), 1.62 (1H, m, H-5), 1.41 (2H, m, H-6), 1.40 (2H, m, H-7), 1.34 (2H, m, H-8), 0.89 (3H, t, J = 6.8 Hz, H-9). 13C-NMR (100 MHz, CD3CN): δ 174.6 (C-1), 159.1 (C-3), 121.8 (C-2), 84.9 (C-4), 34.1 (C-5), 32.6 (C-8), 25.8 (C-6), 23.5 (C-7), 14.6 (C-9). The antigen was prepared by incubating keyhole limpet hemocyanin (1.0 mg/ml) with 1 mm HPNE in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 24 h. Female BALB/c mice were immunized three times with the HPNE-treated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3U1 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxanthine/amethopterin/thymidine selection medium. The cultured supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), employing pairs of wells of microtiter plates on which were absorbed the HPNE-treated BSA as the antigen (500 ng of protein/well). After incubation with 100 μl of the hybridoma supernatants and with intervening washes with PBS, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by a substrate solution containing 0.5 mg/ml 1,2-phenylenediamine. Hybridoma cells corresponding to the supernatants that were positive on the HPNE-modified BSA were then cloned by limiting dilution. After repeated screening, two clones were obtained. Among them, clone PM9 showed the most distinctive recognition of the HPNE-modified BSA. A 100-μl aliquot of the antigen solution was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C. The antigen solution was then removed, and the plate was washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween). Each well was incubated with 200 μl of 4% Blockace (Yukijirushi, Sapporo, Japan) in PBS/Tween for 60 min at 37 °C to block the unsaturated plastic surface. The plate was then washed three times with PBS/Tween. A 100-μl aliquot of the antibody was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with PBS/Tween, 100 μl of a 5 × 103 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS/Tween was added. After 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed three times with PBS/Tween. The enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed by adding 100 μl/well 1,2-phenylenediamine (0.5 mg/ml) in a 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 m sulfuric acid (50 μl/well), and the absorbance at 490 nm was read using a micro-ELISA plate reader. LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared from the plasma of healthy humans by sequential ultracentrifugation and then extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.01% EDTA at 4 °C. The LDL used for the oxidative modification by Cu2+ was dialyzed against a 1000-fold volume of PBS at 4 °C. The oxidation of LDL was performed by incubating 0.5 mg of LDL with CuSO4 (10 μm) in 1 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Informed consent was obtained under the study approved by our institutional review board. The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 1983. Agarose gel electrophoresis of LDL was performed using the Helena TITAN GEL high resolution protein system (Helena Laboratories, Saitama, Japan). The samples were run on two separate gels. One gel was used for staining with Fat Red 7B; the other was transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and treated with the primary antibody (mAb PM9). This procedure was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a goat anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were visualized by exposure of the membranes to autoradiography film. This investigation was carried out on aortic wall samples obtained at autopsy from patients with generalized arteriosclerosis. Autopsies were performed at Tokyo Women's Medical University after the patients' family members granted informed consent in accordance with local ethics guidelines. Each sample was fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stored at room temperature. Multiple 6-μm-thick sections were cut from these paraffin-embedded and frozen materials and used for the histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, quenched for 10 min at 4 °C with 3% hydrogen peroxide for inhibiting the endogenous peroxidase activity, rinsed in PBS, subjected to microwaving (95 °C, 400 W, 30 min) in 1 mm Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) for antigen unmasking, pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with 5% skim milk in PBS, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the mouse monoclonal anti-protein-bound HPNE antibody (Clone PM9) at a dilution of 1:200,000 as well as mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibodies against CD31 (Clone JC/70A) at a dilution of 1:100, CD68 (Clone KP-1) at a dilution of 1:10,000, and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Clone 1A4) at a dilution of 1:2,000. The antibodies to CD31, CD68, and SMA were purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), and they were used as specific markers of vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. Sections processed with omission of the primary antibodies or incubated with 5% skim milk in PBS served as negative reaction controls. The specificity of the anti-protein-bound HPNE antibody was verified by negative staining on sections incubated with the antibody preabsorbed with an excess of the specific antigen (the HNA-lysine adduct) at a concentration of 10 μm or HPNE-modified BSA at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Antibody binding was visualized by the polymer immunocomplex method using the appropriate Envision system (Dako). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) was used as the chromogen, and hematoxylin was used as the counterstain. Moreover, immunohistochemical localization of the HPNE-specific epitopes was strictly identified by the double immunolabeling method. In brief, sections were incubated with the anti-protein-bound HPNE antibody, and immunoreaction product deposits were detected by the polymer immunocomplex method using DAB (brown), and microphotographs of atherosclerotic lesions were taken. After microwaving (95 °C, 400 W, 10 min) in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for removal of the immune complex, the immunostained sections were incubated with the antibody to CD31, CD68, or SMA, and immunoreaction product deposits were detected by the polymer immunocomplex method using NiCl2-DAB (blue). Immunohistochemical observations of protein-bound HPNE were compared with the initially taken microphotographs of CD31, CD68, and SMA on the same regions by light microscopy. To assess the reactivity of HPNE to protein, BSA (1 mg/ml) was exposed to HPNE (0–10 mm) in vitro. Covalent binding of HPNE to the protein was suggested by a slight expansion and mobility shift of the protein bands on the SDS-PAGE and native PAGE analyses (Fig. 2A). In addition, we examined changes in the amino acid composition and observed that the incubation with HPNE resulted in the loss of the lysine and histidine residues (Fig. 2B), suggesting the covalent binding of HPNE to these amino acids. However, at this stage, it was unclear whether this is a direct action by HPNE or its products, such as HNE and ONE. Based on the observation that the lysine residue was found to be the major target of HPNE, we sought to establish an HPNE-lysine adduction chemistry using Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine. The lysine-containing peptide (5 mm) was incubated with an equimolar concentration of HPNE (5 mm) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After incubation at 37 °C for 2–24 h, the reaction mixture was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC monitored at 200–650 nm. As shown in Fig. 3A, besides the peaks corresponding to HNE and ONE, several new peaks (I, II, III, and IV) were detected. Within 2 h of incubation, the products I, II, III, and IV in addition to HPNE were detected. Subsequent incubation resulted in the disappearance of HPNE and concomitant increase of I, II, III, and IV. By 24 h, these products in addition to HNE were the major products. Molecular ion MS information for the products was collected using UPLC-ESI-MS. The mass spectrum of II showed an MH+ at m/z 480, suggesting that the product is composed of one molecule of HPNE and Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine. The mass spectrum of III exhibited an intense MH+ at m/z 462, corresponding to the dehydration from a simple HPNE-Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine monoadduct. The LC-MS analysis of I and IV gave intense MH+ signals at m/z 362 and m/z 155, respectively. The molecular mass of I suggested the addition of a small molecule (Mr 54 kDa) to the original peptide, whereas IV was likely to have originated from HPNE itself. Thus, II and III were suggested to represent the HPNE-lysine adducts. To further characterize the chemical structure of these products, isolation by HPLC on a reverse-phase column was carried out. After purification, II was characterized by mass spectrometry and by NMR (supplemental Figs. S1–S6). The high resolution ESI-MS of II showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 480.26840 (M + H)+ corresponding to the molecular formula of C24H38N3O7, which could be expected from the Michael addition to the central HPNE double bond to give the substituted 4-hydroperoxynonanal. However, neither the signals of the α,β-unsaturated linkage nor the signal of the aldehyde group of HPNE could be detected in the 1H NMR spectrum measured in DMSO-d6 (Table 1), whereas, as compared with the 13C NMR spectra between the Nα-benzoylglycyl-lysine and the product, one signal at 172.9 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl group, newly appeared in the 13C NMR spectrum of the product. The HMBC spectroscopy showed the correlations of"

Here we describe a robust protocol for surface sterilization and retrieval of DNA from fluid inclusions in halite that, unlike previously published methods, guarantees removal of potentially contaminating surface-bound DNA. The protocol involves microscopic visualization of cell structures, deliberate surface contamination followed by surface sterilization with acid and bleach washes, and DNA extraction using Amicon centrifugal filters. Methods were verified on halite crystals of four different ages from Saline Valley, California (modern, 36 ka, 64 ka, and 150 ka), with retrieval of algal and archaeal DNA, and characterization of the algal community using ITS1 sequences. The protocol we developed opens up new avenues for study of ancient microbial ecosystems in fluid inclusions, understanding microbial evolution across geological time, and investigating the antiquity of life on earth and other parts of the solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2095373607,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a clinical consequence of the profound amplification of host pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling that results from staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) exposure. We recently reported that MyD88(-/-) mice were resistant to SEA or SEB toxic shock and displayed reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in their serum. Here we report that SEB stimulation of total mononuclear cells up-regulated MyD88 in monocytes and T cells. Further, MyD88 gene silencing in primary human cells using siRNA prevented SEB or SEB plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) transcriptional activation, suggesting that MyD88-mediated signaling is an essential component of SEB toxicity. We synthesized small molecules that mimic the conserved BB-loop in the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain of MyD88. In primary human cells, these mimetics attenuated SEB-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. SEB stimulation of primary cells with mimetic affected newly synthesized MyD88 and downstream signaling components. Furthermore, LPS-induced MyD88 signaling was likewise inhibited in a cell-based reporter assay. More importantly, administration of mimetic reduced cytokine responses and increased survivability in a murine SEB challenge model. Collectively, these results suggest that MyD88 BB-loop mimetics interfere with SEB-induced pro-inflammatory signaling and toxicity, thus offering a potential approach in the therapy of toxic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2047868774,"Fbxo7 is an unusual F box protein that augments D-type cyclin complex formation with Cdk6, but not Cdk4 or Cdk2, and its over-expression has been demonstrated to transform immortalised fibroblasts in a Cdk6-dependent manner. Here we present new evidence in vitro and in vivo on the oncogenic potential of this regulatory protein in primary haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Increasing Fbxo7 expression in HSPCs suppressed their colony forming ability in vitro, specifically decreasing CD11b (Mac1) expression, and these effects were dependent on an intact p53 pathway. Furthermore, increased Fbxo7 levels enhanced the proliferative capacity of p53 null HSPCs when they were grown in reduced concentrations of stem cell factor. Finally, irradiated mice reconstituted with p53 null, but not wild-type, HSPCs expressing Fbxo7 showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of T cell lymphoma in vivo. These data argue that Fbxo7 negatively regulates the proliferation and differentiation of HSPCs in a p53-dependent manner, and that in the absence of p53, Fbxo7 expression can promote T cell lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056883469,"Social, ecological, and historical processes affect the genetic structure of primate populations, and therefore have key implications for the conservation of endangered species. The northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) is a critically endangered New World monkey and a flagship species for the conservation of the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Yet, like other neotropical primates, little is known about its population history and the genetic structure of remnant populations. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region of 152 northern muriquis, or 17.6% of the 864 northern muriquis from 8 of the 12 known extant populations and found no evidence of phylogeographic partitions or past population shrinkage/expansion. Bayesian and classic analyses show that this finding may be attributed to the joint contribution of female-biased dispersal, demographic stability, and a relatively large historic population size. Past population stability is consistent with a central Atlantic Forest Pleistocene refuge. In addition, the best scenario supported by an Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis, significant fixation indices (Φ(ST) = 0.49, Φ(CT) = 0.24), and population-specific haplotypes, coupled with the extirpation of intermediate populations, are indicative of a recent geographic structuring of genetic diversity during the Holocene. Genetic diversity is higher in populations living in larger areas (>2,000 hectares), but it is remarkably low in the species overall (θ = 0.018). Three populations occurring in protected reserves and one fragmented population inhabiting private lands harbor 22 out of 23 haplotypes, most of which are population-exclusive, and therefore represent patchy repositories of the species' genetic diversity. We suggest that these populations be treated as discrete units for conservation management purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2014249037,"Principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) compute the interaural intensity differences necessary for localizing high-frequency sounds. To perform this computation, the LSO requires precisely tuned, converging excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are driven by the two ears and that are matched for stimulus frequency. In rodents, the inhibitory inputs, which arise from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), undergo extensive functional refinement during the first postnatal week. Similar functional refinement of the ascending excitatory pathway, which arises in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), has been assumed but has not been well studied. Using whole-cell voltage clamp in acute brainstem slices of neonatal rats, we examined developmental changes in input strength and pre- and post-synaptic properties of the VCN-LSO pathway. A key question was whether functional refinement in one of the two major input pathways might precede and then guide refinement in the opposite pathway. We find that elimination and strengthening of VCN inputs to the LSO occurs over a similar period to that seen for the ascending inhibitory (MNTB-LSO) pathway. During this period, the fractional contribution provided by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) declines while the contribution from AMPA receptors (AMPARs) increases. In the NMDAR-mediated response, GluN2B-containing NMDARs predominate in the first postnatal week and decline sharply thereafter. Finally, the progressive decrease in paired-pulse depression between birth and hearing onset allows these synapses to follow progressively higher frequencies. Our data are consistent with a model in which the excitatory and inhibitory projections to LSO are functionally refined in parallel during the first postnatal week, and they further suggest that GluN2B-containing NMDARs may mediate early refinement in the VCN-LSO pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2075293409,"Background Mitochondrial dysfunctions appear strongly implicated in a wide range of pathologies. Therefore, there is a growing need in the determination of the normal and pathological integrated response of oxidative phosphorylation to cellular ATP demand. The present study intends to address this issue by providing a method to investigate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation affinity for ADP in isolated mitochondria. Methodology/Principal Findings The proposed method is based on the simultaneous monitoring of substrate oxidation (determined polarographically) and phosphorylation (determined using the glucose - hexokinase - glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase - NADP+ enzymatic system) rates, coupled to the determination of actual ADP and ATP concentrations by bioluminescent assay. This enzymatic system allows the study of oxidative phosphorylation during true steady states in a wide range of ADP concentrations. We demonstrate how the application of this method allows an accurate determination of mitochondrial affinity for ADP from both oxidation (KmVox) and phosphorylation (KmVp) rates. We also demonstrate that determination of KmVox leads to an important overestimation of the mitochondrial affinity for ADP, indicating that mitochondrial affinity for ADP should be determined using phosphorylation rate. Finally, we show how this method allows the direct and precise determination of the mitochondrial coupling efficiency. Data obtained from rat skeletal muscle and liver mitochondria illustrate the discriminating capabilities of this method. Conclusions/Significance Because the proposed method allows the accurate determination of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation affinity for ADP in isolated mitochondria, it also opens the route to a better understanding of functional consequences of mitochondrial adaptations/dysfunctions arising in various physiological/pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2096072198,"Maintaining a stable genome is one of the most important tasks of every living cell and the mechanisms ensuring it are similar in all of them. The events leading to changes in DNA sequence (mutations) in diploid cells occur one to two orders of magnitude more frequently than in haploid cells. The majority of those events lead to loss of heterozygosity at the mutagenesis marker, thus diploid-specific genome stability mechanisms can be anticipated. In a new global screen for spontaneous loss of function at heterozygous forward mutagenesis marker locus, employing three different mutagenesis markers, we selected genes whose deletion causes genetic instability in diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We have found numerous genes connected with DNA replication and repair, remodeling of chromatin, cell cycle control, stress response, and in particular the structural maintenance of chromosome complexes. We have also identified 59 uncharacterized or dubious ORFs, which show the genome instability phenotype when deleted. For one of the strongest mutators revealed in our screen, ctf18Δ/ctf18Δ the genome instability manifests as a tendency to lose the whole set of chromosomes. We postulate that this phenomenon might diminish the devastating effects of DNA rearrangements, thereby increasing the cell's chances of surviving stressful conditions. We believe that numerous new genes implicated in genome maintenance, together with newly discovered phenomenon of ploidy reduction, will help revealing novel molecular processes involved in the genome stability of diploid cells. They also provide the clues in the quest for new therapeutic targets to cure human genome instability-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1978843262,"In a mouse model of Escherichia coli sepsis characterized by a primary peritoneal infection with 10(4) E. coli and a gradually growing bacterial load, we here show that the early cytokine response and antibacterial defense are dominated by TLR4 via a cooperative action of MyD88 and Trif. Although MyD88(-/-) mice succumbed earlier than WT mice in this E. coli peritonitis model, Trif(-/-) mice displayed a small but significant survival advantage. Despite a large early deficit in antimicrobial defense, TLR4(-/-) mice showed an unaltered survival with normal neutrophil attraction to the peritoneal cavity and normal or even elevated late cytokine release. TLR2 compensated for the lack of TLR4 because TLR2(-/-)/TLR4(-/-) mice did show decreased neutrophil attraction and increased mortality compared with WT mice. Nearly normal early peritoneal TNFα production and lack of early counterregulating systemic levels of the chemoattractant KC were associated with normal peritoneal neutrophil attraction in TLR4(-/-) mice. Late stage increased TNF, IL-1β, IFN-β, and typical IFN-γ production in TLR4(-/-) mice prompted us to evaluate expression of the negative feedback regulator SOCS-1. Lack of early hepatic SOCS-1 expression in TLR4(-/-) mice explained the late innate production of IFN-γ by the liver in TLR4(-/-) mice in this low dose E. coli peritonitis model. In contrast, early TLR4-induced IFN-γ production is described as a hallmark in high dose E. coli peritonitis models. The present study displays how the kinetics of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are regulated by TLRs during peritonitis by a gradually growing E. coli load and how these kinetics may affect outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2008799812,"Genes of the coe (collier/olfactory/early B-cell factor) family encode Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors that are widely conserved in metazoans and involved in many developmental processes, neurogenesis in particular. Whereas their functions during vertebrate neural tube formation have been well documented, very little is known about their expression and role during central nervous system (CNS) development in protostomes. Here we characterized the CNS expression of coe genes in the insect Drosophila melanogaster and the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii, which belong to different subgroups of protostomes and show strikingly different modes of development. In the Drosophila ventral nerve cord, we found that the Collier-expressing cells form a subpopulation of interneurons with diverse molecular identities and neurotransmitter phenotypes. We also demonstrate that collier is required for the proper differentiation of some interneurons belonging to the Eve-Lateral cluster. In Platynereis dumerilii, we cloned a single coe gene, Pdu-coe, and found that it is exclusively expressed in post mitotic neural cells. Using an original technique of in silico 3D registration, we show that Pdu-coe is co-expressed with many different neuronal markers and therefore that, like in Drosophila, its expression defines a heterogeneous population of neurons with diverse molecular identities. Our detailed characterization and comparison of coe gene expression in the CNS of two distantly-related protostomes suggest conserved roles of coe genes in neuronal differentiation in this clade. As similar roles have also been observed in vertebrates, this function was probably already established in the last common ancestor of all bilaterians."
https://openalex.org/W1971415136,"Although there is growing evidence for a role of the innate immune response in Parkinson's disease, the nature of any humoral response in dopaminergic degeneration is uncertain. Here we report on a protracted N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model of dopaminergic death that potentially allows a more full adaptive humoral response to develop. Rag2 mutant mice that lack the full adaptive response (deficient in both T and B cells) are resistant to dopaminergic death and behavioral deficiencies in this model. These mice are resensitized after reconstitution with WT splenocytes. To more directly provide evidence for humoral/IgG involvement, we show that deficiency of Fcγ receptors, which are critical for activation of macrophages/microglia by binding to IgGs, is also protective in this protracted model. FcγR-deficient mice display improved behavior and impaired microglial activation. Interestingly, however, Rag2 mutant but not FcγR-deficient mice are resistant to a more standard N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine paradigm where death is more rapid. Taken together, these data indicate that, provided sufficient time, the humoral arm of the adaptive immune system can play a critical functional role in modulating the microglial response to dopaminergic degeneration and suggest that this humoral component may participate in degeneration in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2079250752,"Background The innate immune responses to virus infection are initiated by either Toll-like receptors (TLR3/7/8/9) or cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-recognizing RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5. To avoid causing injury to the host, these signaling pathways must be switched off in time by negative regulators. Methodology/Principal Findings Through yeast-two hybrid screening, we found that an ubiquitin-like protein named protein linking integrin-associated protein to cytoskeleton 1(PLIC-1 or Ubiquilin 1) interacted with the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of TLR4. Interestingly, PLIC-1 had modest effect on TLR4-mediated signaling, but strongly suppressed the transcriptional activation of IFN-β promoter through the TLR3-Trif-dependent pathway. Concomitantly, reduction of endogenous PLIC-1 by short-hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) enhanced TLR3 activation both in luciferase reporter assays as well as in new castle disease virus (NDV) infected cells. An interaction between PLIC-1 and Trif was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and GST-pull-down assays. Subsequent confocal microscopic analysis revealed that PLIC-1 and Trif colocalized with the autophagosome marker LC3 in punctate subcellular structures. Finally, overexpression of PLIC-1 decreased Trif protein abundance in a Nocodazole-sensitive manner. Conclusions Our results suggest that PLIC-1 is a novel inhibitor of the TLR3-Trif antiviral pathway by reducing the abundance of Trif."
https://openalex.org/W2090573073,"Deliberate and natural outbreaks of infectious disease, the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains, and the ease by which antibiotic resistant bacteria can be intentionally engineered all underscore the necessity of effective vaccines and continued development of novel antimicrobial/antiviral therapeutics. Isoprenes, a group of molecules fundamentally involved in a variety of crucial biological functions, are derived from either the mevalonic acid (MVA) or methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. While mammals utilize the MVA pathway, many bacteria utilize the MEP pathway, highlighting the latter as an attractive target for antibiotic development. In this report we describe the cloning and characterization of Francisella tularensis MEP cytidylyltransferase, a MEP pathway enzyme and potential target for antibiotic development. Size exclusion chromatography indicates the protein exists as a dimer in solution. Enzyme assays produced an apparent , , , , and a . The enzyme exhibits a strict preference for Mg+2 as a divalent cation and CTP as the nucleotide. Titanium dioxide chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified Thr141 as a site of phosphorylation. T141D and T141E site-directed mutants are catalytically inactive, suggesting a mechanism for post-translational control of metabolic flux through the F. tularensis MEP pathway. Overall, our study suggests that MEP cytidylyltransferase is an excellent target for the development of novel antibiotics against F. tularensis."
https://openalex.org/W2020235701,"T20 (enfuvirtide, Fuzeon) is the first generation HIV-1 fusion inhibitor approved for salvage therapy of HIV-1-infected patients refractory to current antiretroviral drugs. However, its application is limited by the high cost of peptide synthesis, rapid proteolysis, and poor efficacy against emerging drug-resistant strains. Here we reported the design of a novel chimera protein-based fusion inhibitor targeting gp41, TLT35, that uses a flexible 35-mer linker to couple T20 and T1144, the first and next generation HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, respectively. TLT35, which was expressed in Escherichia coli with good yield, showed low nm activity against HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains (X4 or R5), including T20-resistant variants and primary HIV-1 isolates of clades A to G and group O (R5 or X4R5). TLT35 was stable in human sera and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture and was more resistant to proteolysis than either T20 or T1144 alone. Circular dichroism spectra showed that TLT35 folded into a thermally stable conformation with high α-helical content and T(m) value in aqueous solution. It formed a highly stable complex with gp41 N-terminal heptad repeat peptide and blocked formation of the gp41 six-helix-bundle core. These merits combined with an anticipated low production cost for expression of TLT35 in E. coli make this novel protein-based fusion inhibitor a promising candidate for further development as an anti-HIV-1 microbicide or therapeutic for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2074169269,"Single particle tracking was used to evaluate lateral motions of individual FLAG-tagged human luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors expressed on CHO cells and native LH receptors on both KGN human granulosa-derived tumor cells and M17 human neuroblastoma cells before and after exposure to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Compared with LH receptors on untreated cells, LH receptors on cells treated with 100 nm hCG exhibit restricted lateral diffusion and are confined in small, nanometer-scale, membrane compartments. Similar to LH receptors labeled with Au-hCG, LH receptors labeled with gold-deglycosylated hCG, an hCG antagonist, also exhibit restricted lateral diffusion and are confined in nanoscale membrane compartments on KGN cells treated with 100 nm hCG. LH receptor point mutants lacking potential palmitoylation sites remain in large compartments despite treatment with 100 nm hCG as do LH receptors on cells treated with cytochalasin D. Finally, both polarization homotransfer fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging and photon counting histogram analysis indicate that treatment with hCG induces aggregation of YFP-coupled LH receptors stably expressed on CHO cells.

LH receptor signaling in response to saturating concentrations of LH or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) involves substantial changes in receptor lateral and rotational dynamics (1Roess D.A.

Endocrinol. 1979; 15: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) indicate that functional hormone-receptor complexes can also become self-associated into dimers/oligomers following ligand binding. Previous experimental strategies have examined changes in receptor motions on collections of cells or large numbers of fluorescently tagged molecules on single cells. It is now possible, however, to examine the lateral motions of individual LH receptors on living cells using microscope-based single particle tracking techniques (6Murase K. Fujiwara T. Umemura Y.

Although the mechanism involved in retention of hCG-occupied LH receptors in small membrane compartments is still unclear, exposure to saturating concentrations of hCG results in confinement of the majority of LH receptors within small cell surface compartments. LH receptors remain within these compartments for comparatively long times and appear to diffuse pseudo-randomly before being captured within another compartment of similar size (7Smith S.M. Lei Y. Liu J. Cahill M.E. Hagen G.M. Barisas B.G. Roess D.A. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar behavior has been described and analyzed by Kusumi and co-workers (6Murase K. Fujiwara T. Umemura Y. Suzuki K. Iino R. Yamashita H. Saito M. Murakoshi H. Ritchie K. Kusumi A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 4075-4093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) for selected phospholipids and for transferrin receptors (8Sako Y. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and by Daumas and co-workers (9Daumas F. Destainville N. Millot C. Lopez A. Dean D. Salomé L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 356-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) for the μ-opioid receptor. Daumas argues that the μ-opioid receptor can both diffuse within the bulk membrane and exhibit confinement within a microdomain that itself diffuses slowly. Kusumi and co-workers (6Murase K. Fujiwara T. Umemura Y. Suzuki K. Iino R. Yamashita H. Saito M. Murakoshi H. Ritchie K. Kusumi A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 4075-4093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) suggest that particles may be confined by proteins forming a barrier that is either continuous or discontinuous, leading to receptor diffusion within small membrane regions accompanied by intermittent escape from compartments and periods of unrestricted diffusion in the bulk membrane. Our previous studies of LH receptor lateral and rotational diffusion suggest that actin microfilaments or membrane protein interactions with the cytoskeleton may provide organizing structures that restrict the lateral motions of receptors (1Roess D.A. Niswender G.D. Barisas B.G. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Roess D.A. Jewell M.A. Philpott C.J. Barisas B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of hormone-initiated LH receptor confinement in small compartments has not been examined previously in detail at the single molecule level. In the present work, we compared the lateral dynamics of individual LH receptors that were either FLAG-tagged and identified using FLAG-specific antibodies with the diffusion of native receptors occupied by gold nanoparticle-hCG conjugates (Au-hCG) or gold-deglycosylated hCG (Au-DG-hCG). The latter material is an hCG antagonist (10Sairam M.R. Manjunath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 445-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that binds LH receptors with high affinity and can block hCG binding for more than 24 h (11Dunkel L. Jia X.C. Nishimori K. Boime I. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This allowed us to determine whether LH receptor motions are dependent on hCG concentration and limited to hCG-occupied receptors or, alternatively, whether hCG binding to a fraction of available receptors has global effects on LH receptor diffusion regardless of whether they have been activated by hCG. We also explored whether point mutations to palmitoylation sites on the LH receptor C terminus, known to eliminate LH receptor translocation into membrane rafts (12Lei Y. Hagen G.M. Smith S.M. Barisas B.G. Roess D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) affected receptor confinement within small compartments and to what extent the actin cytoskeleton is responsible for the restriction of LH receptor lateral motions. Because slower lateral diffusion may result from extensive self-association of membrane proteins, polarization homotransfer FRET (homo-FRET) and photon-counting histogram (PCH) analysis were utilized to evaluate increased oligomerization of YFP-coupled human LH receptors (YFP-LHR) stably expressed on individual, viable CHO cells in response to increasing concentrations of hCG. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of hCG binding to native LH receptors on KGN cells and to estimate the number of native LH receptors on these cells. FCS was also used estimate the number of YFP-LHR stably expressed on the CHO cells used in homo-FRET and PCH analysis studies. Finally, we considered how changes in receptor cell surface density might contribute to the apparent aggregation of YFP-LHR stably expressed on CHO cells. CHO cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg streptomycin/ml (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA), and 1× minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich). KGN cells, a human granulosa-like tumor cell line developed by Dr. Yoshihiro Nishi and Dr. Toshihiko Yanase at Kyusyu University (13Nishi Y. Yanase T. Mu Y. Oba K. Ichino I. Saito M. Nomura M.

KGN cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/ml as described previously (13Nishi Y. Yanase T. Mu Y. Oba K. Ichino I.

M17 human neuroblastoma cells, which express LH receptors (14Bowen R.L. Verdile G. Liu T. Parlow A.F. Perry G. Smith M.A. Martins R.N. Atwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20539-20545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in minimum Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg streptomycin/ml (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA), 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mm minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich). All cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified environment. Geneticin (G418 sulfate) was purchased from Mediatech, Inc. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody directed against the FLAG epitope tag was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 40-nm of gold colloid was obtained from Ted Pella, Inc. (Redding, CA). Highly purified hCG (Fitzgerald Industries, Inc., Concord, MA) was prepared in 1× PBS. Dr. George Bousfield (Wichita State University) kindly provided deglycosylated hCG used in single particle tracking studies on KGN and M17 cells. Deglycosylated hCG was prepared using modifications of the method described by Edge et al. (15Edge A.S. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert Jr., L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Rather than using a desalting column as described, deglycosylated protein was incubated in 0.5 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, overnight at 37 C to reassociate dissociated subunits, and the heterodimer fraction was then isolated using Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography. To monitor the extent of LH receptor signaling in M17 cells, levels of intracellular cAMP were assessed following exposure to hCG using a TiterFluor Direct Cyclic AMP Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI). Dr. K. M. Menon from the University of Michigan kindly provided us with N-terminal FLAG-tagged LHR subcloned into the pFLAG vector (FLAG-LHR) (Sigma-Aldrich). A stable cell line expressing FLAG-tagged palmitoylation-deficient LH receptors was prepared as described previously (12Lei Y. Hagen G.M. Smith S.M. Barisas B.G. Roess D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For homo-FRET, FCS, and PCH experiments, we used a stable CHO cell line expressing human YFP-LHR at the C terminus as described previously (16Lei Y. Hagen G.M. Smith S.M. Liu J. Barisas G. Roess D.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260–262: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Lateral dynamics and the size of compartments accessed by individual FLAG-LHR on CHO cells or native LH receptors on KGN and M17 cells were evaluated using single particle tracking methods as described by Kusumi and co-workers (17Dietrich C. Yang B. Fujiwara T. Kusumi A. Jacobson K. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 274-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To identify FLAG-LHR, 40-nm nanogold particles were conjugated with a mixture of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and BSA at the lowest possible total protein concentration, typically 40 μg/ml, needed to stabilize the gold solution. To identify individual native LH receptors expressed on KGN or M17 cells, 40-nm gold particles were coupled to Au-hCG or Au-DG-hCG using the same protocol. For labeling cells, the ratio of antibody or hormone to BSA, typically 1:100 by weight, was selected to give 10–20 particles bound per cell. The binding of anti-FLAG antibody or hormone was specific: when cells were preincubated with a 10-fold excess of anti-FLAG antibody or gold-tagged hormone, no gold particles were detected on cells. Cells were labeled with gold-coupled probes for 1 h at 4 °C. After receptor labeling, cells were treated with 0.1, 1, or 100 nm hCG for 1 h at 37 °C. Because the off rates for hCG and DG-hCG are on the order of 24–48 h (11Dunkel L. Jia X.C. Nishimori K. Boime I. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Zeng H. Phang T. Song Y.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3451-3458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that gold-tagged hormones were displaced from LH receptors by introduction of hCG on the timescale of these experiments. In some experiments, cells grown on coverslips placed in 60 mm2 Petri dishes were pretreated with 40 μg/ml cytochalasin D for 1 h prior to labeling with gold-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody. Individual gold nanoparticles were imaged by differential interference contrast using a 1.4 numerical aperture 63× oil objective in a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV inverted microscope. Images were acquired using a Dage IFG-300 camera and were recorded for 2 min (3600 frames) at ∼30 nm/pixel under the control of Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). Trajectories of individual gold particles were measured over time and then segmented into compartments by calculation of statistical variance in particle position (6Murase K. Fujiwara T. Umemura Y.

Hagen G.M. Pecht I. Roess D.A. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 126: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The variance of a particle's position was calculated within windows of varying duration, which were translated along the particle trajectory, producing a variance plot that exhibited peaks indicating intercompartmental boundaries. These results were analyzed using custom analysis programs to yield the compartment size and residence time for each particle. Effective macroscopic diffusion coefficients (D) were calculated as the square of the compartment diagonal divided by four times the residence time in the compartment as described previously (19Barisas B.G. Smith S.M. Liu J. Song J. Hagen G.M. Pecht I. Roess D.A. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 126: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Data are presented either as the mean ± S.E. or mean ± S.D. as indicated in the figure legends. Significance was assessed using Student's t test, and p values are indicated (p < 0.05). We investigated aggregation of human LH receptors in response to 0.1, 1, and 100 nm hCG using polarization homotransfer FRET or energy migration FRET. Homotransfer FRET assesses energy transfer between identical fluorescent donor and acceptor molecules by measuring fluorescence anisotropy as probe molecules are photobleached (20Bader A.N. Hoetzl S. Hofman E.G. Voortman J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. van Meer G. Gerritsen H.C. ChemPhysChem. 2011; 12: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Increasing anisotropy as probe molecules are progressively photobleached is indicative of FRET. CHO cells stably expressing YFP-LHR were plated overnight in Willco 35 cm2 1.5 glass-bottomed Petri dishes (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). FRET between YFP molecules on single cells were analyzed using an Olympus FV 300 confocal microscope with a polarizing beam splitter placed in front of the detection PMTs, allowing two orthogonally polarized fluorescence images to be recorded simultaneously. YFP was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon laser and appropriate barrier and dichroic filters were selected for YFP emission. Individual cells with ring-like fluorescence from YFP at their plasma membrane were imaged. A sequence of cell images, typically ∼20, was obtained as YFP was progressively photobleached until ∼10% of the initial average intensity remained. Each anisotropy measurement was accompanied by acquisition of g-factor and background images. Imaging analysis was performed with custom analysis programs. Total intensity (s) and fluorescence anisotropy (r) were calculated as s = I‖ + 2I⊥ and r = (I‖ − I⊥)/s, where I‖ and I⊥ are fluorescence emission polarized parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the polarization of linearly polarized excitation light (21Lidke D.S. Nagy P. Barisas B.G. Heintzmann R. Post J.N. Lidke K.A. Clayton A.H. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Jovin T.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). PCH analysis was used to evaluate oligomerization of YFP-LHR stably expressed on CHO cells in response to increasing concentrations of hormone. The related technique FCS was used to determine the KD of hCG binding to native LH receptors on KGN cells and obtain estimates of the number of LH receptors on KGN cells and on CHO cells expressing YFP-LHR. KGN cells were seeded onto sterile dishes, grown to 50% confluence, washed, and treated with 0.01–500 nm hCG for 45 min. Cells were then washed and sequentially treated with anti-hCG rabbit IgG (Upstate) for 30–40 min, 600 nm anti-rabbit biotin IgG (Sigma) for 30 min, and 600 nm FITC-avidin for 20 min before observation. CHO cells stably expressing YFP-LHR were grown to 50% confluence on sterile dishes and examined directly. Both FCS and PCH experiments were performed on a modified Nikon TE1000 inverted microscope equipped with a 100×, 1.25 numerical aperture, oil immersion objective, an Omnichrome Melles-Griot multiline air-cooled argon ion laser operating at 514.5 nm, two 570/32 nm band pass filters, two PerkinElmer Life Sciences single photon counting modules (SPCM-AQR-14), an ALV-6010 digital hardware correlator, and a Becker and Hickl GmbH PMS-400 multichannel photon counter as described previously (23Fogarty K. McPhee J.T. Scott E. Van Orden A. Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 1/e2 radius of the excitation beam at the sample was experimentally determined to be 241 nm using aqueous rhodamine 6G. In live cell studies, the laser excitation beam was vertically positioned on the apical cell membrane by adjusting the objective z-position to maximize detector count rates and minimize diffusional correlation times (τD) as described by Ries and Schwille (24Ries J. Schwille P. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2008; 10: 3487-3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All FCS and PCH experiments were conducted at room temperature. In both FCS and PCH experiments samples were illuminated for ∼10 s before collection of data to allow for the irreversible photobleaching of immobile particles (25Chiantia S. Ries J. Schwille P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). FCS data were then collected for two consecutive 10-s intervals, whereas PCH data were collected for 30 s. During acquisition of FCS and PCH data, the average fluorescence from the sample was relatively uniform as indicated by the avalanche photodiode signal readouts. Analysis of FCS data, including determination of τD and the normalized initial g(τ) were accomplished according to established procedures using Igor Pro (version 5.05A) (24Ries J. Schwille P. Phys.

Using FCS, the number of receptors per μm2 was determined from the effective number of correlating particles detected in the illuminated area (Neff) at saturating concentrations of fluorophore conjugated receptor-specific probe and the radius of the laser interrogation area. The KD for hCG was determined by fitting FCS data to a hyperbolic function describing a single site binding model. For PCH, detected photons were accumulated into successive 1-μs counting channels and rebinned into 9-μs channels to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Rebinned photon counts were then simultaneously subjected to autocorrelation, pseudo-cross-correlation, and PCH. Weighted least-squares fitting was used to obtain estimates of Neff, the average molecular brightness (ϵ) of detected particles and the out-of-focus emission ratio (F) as described previously (29Jung J.

Single particle tracking methods were used to examine the lateral diffusion of individual LH receptors and receptor compartmentalization in response to binding of hCG (Fig. 1). Treating CHO cells expressing FLAG-LHR with 0.1 nm hCG did not have a statistically significant effect on either receptor diffusion (lower panel) or average size of compartments containing LH receptors (upper panel). However 1 nm hCG and 100 nm hCG significantly increased the number of receptors appearing in compartments of less than 100 nm in diameter to 62 and 91% of the total receptor population, respectively (Fig. 2). Individual FLAG-LH receptors on cells treated with 100 nm hCG also exhibited significantly slower lateral diffusion (Fig. 1, lower panel).FIGURE 2Distribution of compartment sizes accessed by FLAG-LH receptors stably expressed on CHO cells before (●) and after treatment with 0.1 nm hCG (○), 1.0 nm hCG (▾) or 100 nm hCG (△).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the lateral dynamics of native LH receptors on viable KGN granulosa-like tumor cells and M17 human neuroblastoma cells, 10–20 receptors per cell were tagged with Au-hCG. When KGN cells were exposed to 1 and 100 nm unlabeled hCG, gold-tagged LH receptors became confined in small membrane compartments of <100-nm diameter (Fig. 1, upper panel). For cells treated with 0.1 nm hCG, 16% of hCG-occupied LH receptors on KGN cells were confined in these small compartments, and this number increased to 48% when cells were treated with 100 nm hCG. The diffusion rate of individual LH receptors was also reduced from 0.7 ± 0.2 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 to 0.3 ± 0.1 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 after 100 nm hCG treatment (Table 1). We observed similar dose-dependent effects of hCG on the diameter of compartments accessed by hCG-occupied LH receptors on M17 neuroblastoma cells. With increasing concentrations of hCG, more Au-hCG occupied LH receptors were confined in small membrane compartments. Au-hCG occupied LH receptors on cells treated with 100 nm were located in smaller compartments with an average diameter of 131 ± 18 nm. In M17 cells, the average rate of diffusion was reduced from 0.9 ± 0.3 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 to 0.4 ± 0.1 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 after treatment with 100 nm hCG (Table 2).TABLE 1Effects of hCG treatment on single particle tracking of individual human LH receptors on KGN cells using Au-hCG or Au-DG-hCG probesGold probeTreatmentCompartments per trajectoryaThe average number of compartments accessed by an individual LH receptor during a 2-min, 3600 frame image sequence.D0–1bD0–1, diffusion coefficient within compartment calculated from the first two points of MSD versus time plot as described by Daumas et al.

https://openalex.org/W2013251997,"The filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) can cause devastating infections in immunocompromised individuals. Early diagnosis improves patient outcomes but remains challenging because of the limitations of current methods. To augment the clinician's toolkit for rapid diagnosis of AF infections, we are investigating AF secreted proteases as novel diagnostic targets. The AF genome encodes up to 100 secreted proteases, but fewer than 15 of these enzymes have been characterized thus far. Given the large number of proteases in the genome, studies focused on individual enzymes may overlook potential diagnostic biomarkers.As an alternative, we employed a combinatorial library of internally quenched fluorogenic probes (IQFPs) to profile the global proteolytic secretome of an AF clinical isolate in vitro. Comparative protease activity profiling revealed 212 substrate sequences that were cleaved by AF secreted proteases but not by normal human serum. A central finding was that isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine predominated at each of the three variable positions of the library (44.1%, 59.1%, and 57.0%, respectively) among substrate sequences cleaved by AF secreted proteases. In contrast, fewer than 10% of the residues at each position of cleaved sequences were cationic or anionic. Consensus substrate motifs were cleaved by thermostable serine proteases that retained activity up to 50°C. Precise proteolytic cleavage sites were reliably determined by a simple, rapid mass spectrometry-based method, revealing predominantly non-prime side specificity. A comparison of the secreted protease activities of three AF clinical isolates revealed consistent protease substrate specificity fingerprints. However, secreted proteases of A. flavus, A. nidulans, and A. terreus strains exhibited striking differences in their proteolytic signatures.This report provides proof-of-principle for the use of protease substrate specificity profiling to define the proteolytic secretome of Aspergillus fumigatus. Expansion of this technique to protease secretion during infection could lead to development of novel approaches to fungal diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2125689467,"Exposure to cadmium is associated with human pathologies and altered gene expression. The molecular mechanisms by which cadmium affects transcription remain unclear. It has been proposed that cadmium activates transcription by altering intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and disrupting calcium-mediated intracellular signaling processes. This hypothesis is based on several studies that may be technically problematic; including the use of BAPTA chelators, BAPTA-based fluorescent sensors, and cytotoxic concentrations of metal.In the present report, the effects of cadmium on [Ca(2+)](i) under non-cytotoxic and cytotoxic conditions was monitored using the protein-based calcium sensor yellow cameleon (YC3.60), which was stably expressed in HEK293 cells. In HEK293 constitutively expressing YC3.60, this calcium sensor was found to be insensitive to cadmium. Exposing HEK293::YC3.60 cells to non-cytotoxic cadmium concentrations was sufficient to induce transcription of cadmium-responsive genes but did not affect [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization or increase steady-state mRNA levels of calcium-responsive genes. In contrast, exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of cadmium significantly reduced intracellular calcium stores and altered calcium-responsive gene expression.These data indicate that at low levels, cadmium induces transcription independently of intracellular calcium mobilization. The results also support a model whereby cytotoxic levels of cadmium activate calcium-responsive transcription as a general response to metal-induced intracellular damage and not via a specific mechanism. Thus, the modulation of intracellular calcium may not be a primary mechanism by which cadmium regulates transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2075178078,"The heart integrates neuroregulatory messages into specific bands of frequency, such that the overall amplitude spectrum of the cardiac output reflects the variations of the autonomic nervous system. This modulatory mechanism seems to be well adjusted to the unpredictability of the cardiac demand, maintaining a proper cardiac regulation. A longstanding theory holds that biological organisms facing an ever-changing environment are likely to evolve adaptive mechanisms to extract essential features in order to adjust their behavior. The key question, however, has been to understand how the neural circuitry self-organizes these feature detectors to select behaviorally relevant information. Previous studies in computational perception suggest that a neural population enhances information that is important for survival by minimizing the statistical redundancy of the stimuli. Herein we investigate whether the cardiac system makes use of a redundancy reduction strategy to regulate the cardiac rhythm. Based on a network of neural filters optimized to code heartbeat intervals, we learn a population code that maximizes the information across the neural ensemble. The emerging population code displays filter tuning proprieties whose characteristics explain diverse aspects of the autonomic cardiac regulation, such as the compromise between fast and slow cardiac responses. We show that the filters yield responses that are quantitatively similar to observed heart rate responses during direct sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Our findings suggest that the heart decodes autonomic stimuli according to information theory principles analogous to how perceptual cues are encoded by sensory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2020850562,"Biomarker-based cross-sectional incidence estimation requires a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm (RITA) with an adequately large mean recency duration, to achieve reasonable survey counts, and a low false-recent rate, to minimise exposure to further bias and imprecision. Estimating these characteristics requires specimens from individuals with well-known seroconversion dates or confirmed long-standing infection. Specimens with well-known seroconversion dates are typically rare and precious, presenting a bottleneck in the development of RITAs.The mean recency duration and a 'false-recent rate' are estimated from data on seroconverting blood donors. Within an idealised model for the dynamics of false-recent results, blood donor specimens were used to characterise RITAs by a new method that maximises the likelihood of cohort-level recency classifications, rather than modelling individual sojourn times in recency.For a range of assumptions about the false-recent results (0% to 20% of biomarker response curves failing to reach the threshold distinguishing test-recent and test-non-recent infection), the mean recency duration of the Vironostika-LS ranged from 154 (95% CI: 96-231) to 274 (95% CI: 234-313) days in the South African donor population (n = 282), and from 145 (95% CI: 67-226) to 252 (95% CI: 194-308) days in the American donor population (n = 106). The significance of gender and clade on performance was rejected (p-value = 10%), and utility in incidence estimation appeared comparable to that of a BED-like RITA. Assessment of the Vitros-LS (n = 108) suggested potentially high false-recent rates.The new method facilitates RITA characterisation using widely available specimens that were previously overlooked, at the cost of possible artefacts. While accuracy and precision are insufficient to provide estimates suitable for incidence surveillance, a low-cost approach for preliminary assessments of new RITAs has been demonstrated. The Vironostika-LS and Vitros-LS warrant further analysis to provide greater precision of estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2046095110,"The aim of this study was to assess the disease burden of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in Greece.Data on influenza-like illness (ILI), collected through cross-sectional nationwide telephone surveys of 1,000 households in Greece repeated for 25 consecutive weeks, were combined with data from H1N1 virologic surveillance to estimate the incidence and the clinical attack rate (CAR) of influenza A(H1N1). Alternative definitions of ILI (cough or sore throat and fever>38°C [ILI-38] or fever 37.1-38°C [ILI-37]) were used to estimate the number of symptomatic infections. The infection attack rate (IAR) was approximated using estimates from published studies on the frequency of fever in infected individuals. Data on H1N1 morbidity and mortality were used to estimate ICU admission and case fatality (CFR) rates. The epidemic peaked on week 48/2009 with approximately 750-1,500 new cases/100,000 population per week, depending on ILI-38 or ILI-37 case definition, respectively. By week 6/2010, 7.1%-15.6% of the population in Greece was estimated to be symptomatically infected with H1N1. Children 5-19 years represented the most affected population group (CAR:27%-54%), whereas individuals older than 64 years were the least affected (CAR:0.6%-2.2%). The IAR (95% CI) of influenza A(H1N1) was estimated to be 19.7% (13.3%, 26.1%). Per 1,000 symptomatic cases, based on ILI-38 case definition, 416 attended health services, 108 visited hospital emergency departments and 15 were admitted to hospitals. ICU admission rate and CFR were 37 and 17.5 per 100,000 symptomatic cases or 13.4 and 6.3 per 100,000 infections, respectively.Influenza A(H1N1) infected one fifth and caused symptomatic infection in up to 15% of the Greek population. Although individuals older than 65 years were the least affected age group in terms of attack rate, they had 55 and 185 times higher risk of ICU admission and CFR, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2017761659,"Vector susceptibility to Plasmodium infection is treated primarily as a vector trait, although it is a composite trait expressing the joint occurrence of the parasite and the vector with genetic contributions of both. A comprehensive approach to assess the specific contribution of genetic and environmental variation on ""vector susceptibility"" is lacking. Here we developed and implemented a simple scheme to assess the specific contributions of the vector, the parasite, and the environment to ""vector susceptibility."" To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that employs such an approach.We conducted selection experiments on the vector (while holding the parasite ""constant"") and on the parasite (while holding the vector ""constant"") to estimate the genetic contributions of the mosquito and the parasite to the susceptibility of Anopheles stephensi to Plasmodium gallinaceum. We separately estimated the realized heritability of (i) susceptibility to parasite infection by the mosquito vector and (ii) parasite compatibility (transmissibility) with the vector while controlling the other. The heritabilities of vector and the parasite were higher for the prevalence, i.e., fraction of infected mosquitoes, than the corresponding heritabilities of parasite load, i.e., the number of oocysts per mosquito.The vector's genetics (heritability) comprised 67% of ""vector susceptibility"" measured by the prevalence of mosquitoes infected with P. gallinaceum oocysts, whereas the specific contribution of parasite genetics (heritability) to this trait was only 5%. Our parasite source might possess minimal genetic diversity, which could explain its low heritability (and the high value of the vector). Notably, the environment contributed 28%. These estimates are relevant only to the particular system under study, but this experimental design could be useful for other parasite-host systems. The prospects and limitations of the genetic manipulation of vector populations to render the vector resistant to the parasite are better considered on the basis of this framework."
https://openalex.org/W2145512111,"Leukaemia is often associated with genetic alterations such as translocations, amplifications and deletions, and recurrent chromosome abnormalities are used as markers of diagnostic and prognostic relevance. However, a proportion of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases have an apparently normal karyotype despite comprehensive cytogenetic analysis. Based on conventional cytogenetic analysis of banded chromosomes, we selected a series of 23 paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and performed whole genome array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) using DNA samples derived from the same patients. Imbalances involving large chromosomal regions or entire chromosomes were detected by aCGH in seven of the patients studied. Results were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to both interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes using appropriate bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes. The majority of these copy number alterations (CNAs) were confirmed by FISH and found to localize to the interphase rather than metaphase nuclei. Furthermore, the proliferative states of the cells analyzed by FISH were tested by immunofluorescence using an antibody against the proliferation marker pKi67. Interestingly, these experiments showed that, in the vast majority of cases, the changes appeared to be confined to interphase nuclei in a non-proliferative status."
