https://openalex.org/W2018422556,"Recently developed technologies have enabled multi-well measurement of O(2) consumption, facilitating the rate of mitochondrial research, particularly regarding the mechanism of action of drugs and proteins that modulate metabolism. Among these technologies, the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer was designed for use with intact cells attached in a monolayer to a multi-well tissue culture plate. In order to have a high throughput assay system in which both energy demand and substrate availability can be tightly controlled, we have developed a protocol to expand the application of the XF24 Analyzer to include isolated mitochondria. Acquisition of optimal rates requires assay conditions that are unexpectedly distinct from those of conventional polarography. The optimized conditions, derived from experiments with isolated mouse liver mitochondria, allow multi-well assessment of rates of respiration and proton production by mitochondria attached to the bottom of the XF assay plate, and require extremely small quantities of material (1-10 µg of mitochondrial protein per well). Sequential measurement of basal, State 3, State 4, and uncoupler-stimulated respiration can be made in each well through additions of reagents from the injection ports. We describe optimization and validation of this technique using isolated mouse liver and rat heart mitochondria, and apply the approach to discover that inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors in the preparation of the heart mitochondria results in a specific decrease in rates of Complex I-dependent respiration. We believe this new technique will be particularly useful for drug screening and for generating previously unobtainable respiratory data on small mitochondrial samples."
https://openalex.org/W2117840333,"Chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is accurately regulated by essential transcription factors and signaling cascades. However, the precise mechanisms involved in this process still remain to be defined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various biological processes by binding target mRNA to attenuate protein synthesis. To investigate the mechanisms for miRNAs-mediated regulation of chondrogenic differentiation, we identified that miR-145 was decreased during transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3)-induced chondrogenic differentiation of murine MSCs. Subsequently, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay data demonstrated that miR-145 targets a putative binding site in the 3′-UTR of SRY-related high mobility group-Box gene 9 (Sox9) gene, the key transcription factor for chondrogenesis. In addition, over-expression of miR-145 decreased expression of Sox9 only at protein levels and miR-145 inhibition significantly elevated Sox9 protein levels. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-145 decreased mRNA levels for three chondrogenic marker genes, type II collagen (Col2a1), aggrecan (Agc1), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), type IX collagen (Col9a2) and type XI collagen (Col11a1) in C3H10T1/2 cells induced by TGF-β3, whereas anti-miR-145 inhibitor increased the expression of these chondrogenic marker genes. Thus, our studies demonstrated that miR-145 is a key negative regulator of chondrogenic differentiation by directly targeting Sox9 at early stage of chondrogenic differentiation."

Here, we induced social anxiety and altered social recognition memory in adult mice using unpredictable maternal separation and maternal stress during early postnatal life. We show that these social defects are not only pronounced in the animals directly subjected to stress, but are also transmitted to their offspring across two generations. The defects are associated with impaired serotonergic signaling, in particular, reduced 5HT1A receptor expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and increased serotonin level in a dorsal raphe projection area. These findings underscore the susceptibility of social behaviors and serotonergic pathways to early stress, and the persistence of their perturbation across generations."
https://openalex.org/W2052424568,"BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mice have recently been reported to have behaviors that resemble those of autistic individuals, in that this strain has impairments in social interactions and a restricted repetitive and stereotyped pattern of behaviors. Since immune responses, including autoimmune responses, are known to affect behavior, and individuals with autism have aberrant immune activities, we evaluated the immune system of BTBR mice, and compared their immunity and degree of neuroinflammation with that of C57BL/6 (B6) mice, a highly social control strain, and with F1 offspring. Mice were assessed at postnatal day (pnd) 21 and after behavioral analysis at pnd70. BTBR mice had significantly higher amounts of serum IgG and IgE, of IgG anti-brain antibodies (Abs), and of IgG and IgE deposited in the brain, elevated expression of cytokines, especially IL-33 IL-18, and IL-1β in the brain, and an increased proportion of MHC class II-expressing microglia compared to B6 mice. The F1 mice had intermediate levels of Abs and cytokines as well as social activity. The high Ab levels of BTBR mice are in agreement with their increased numbers of CD40hi/I-Ahi B cells and IgG-secreting B cells. Upon immunization with KLH, the BTBR mice produced 2–3 times more anti-KLH Abs than B6 mice. In contrast to humoral immunity, BTBR mice are significantly more susceptible to listeriosis than B6 or BALB/c mice. The Th2-like immune profile of the BTBR mice and their constitutive neuroinflammation suggests that an autoimmune profile is implicated in their aberrant behaviors, as has been suggested for some humans with autism."
https://openalex.org/W2012234015,"Navigational control of avian migration is understood, largely from the study of terrestrial birds, to depend on either genetically or culturally inherited information. By tracking the individual migrations of Atlantic Puffins, Fratercula arctica, in successive years using geolocators, we describe migratory behaviour in a pelagic seabird that is apparently incompatible with this view. Puffins do not migrate to a single overwintering area, but follow a dispersive pattern of movements changing through the non-breeding period, showing great variability in travel distances and directions. Despite this within-population variability, individuals show remarkable consistency in their own migratory routes among years. This combination of complex population dispersion and individual route fidelity cannot easily be accounted for in terms of genetic inheritance of compass instructions, or cultural inheritance of traditional routes. We suggest that a mechanism of individual exploration and acquired navigational memory may provide the dominant control over Puffin migration, and potentially some other pelagic seabirds, despite the apparently featureless nature of the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1991946493,"Background Intercellular communication can occur via the release of membrane vesicles. Exosomes are nanovesicles released from the endosomal compartment of cells. Depending on their cell of origin and their cargo they can exert different immunoregulatory functions. Recently, fungi were found to produce extracellular vesicles that can influence host-microbe interactions. The yeast Malassezia sympodialis which belongs to our normal cutaneous microbial flora elicits specific IgE- and T-cell reactivity in approximately 50% of adult patients with atopic eczema (AE). Whether exosomes or other vesicles contribute to the inflammation has not yet been investigated. Objective To investigate if M. sympodialis can release nanovesicles and whether they or endogenous exosomes can activate PBMC from AE patients sensitized to M. sympodialis. Methods Extracellular nanovesicles isolated from M. sympodialis, co-cultures of M. sympodialis and dendritic cells, and from plasma of patients with AE and healthy controls (HC) were characterised using flow cytometry, sucrose gradient centrifugation, Western blot and electron microscopy. Their ability to stimulate IL-4 and TNF-alpha responses in autologous CD14, CD34 depleted PBMC was determined using ELISPOT and ELISA, respectively. Results We show for the first time that M. sympodialis releases extracellular vesicles carrying allergen. These vesicles can induce IL-4 and TNF-α responses with a significantly higher IL-4 production in patients compared to HC. Exosomes from dendritic cell and M. sympodialis co-cultures induced IL-4 and TNF-α responses in autologous CD14, CD34 depleted PBMC of AE patients and HC while plasma exosomes induced TNF-α but not IL-4 in undepleted PBMC. Conclusions Extracellular vesicles from M. sympodialis, dendritic cells and plasma can contribute to cytokine responses in CD14, CD34 depleted and undepleted PBMC of AE patients and HC. These novel observations have implications for understanding host-microbe interactions in the pathogenesis of AE."
https://openalex.org/W2009746777,"Farming of animals and plants has recently been considered not merely as a more efficient and plentiful supply of their products but also as a means of protecting wild populations from that trade. Amongst these nascent farming products might be listed bear bile. Bear bile has been exploited by traditional Chinese medicinalists for millennia. Since the 1980s consumers have had the options of: illegal wild gall bladders, bile extracted from caged live bears or the acid synthesised chemically. Despite these alternatives bears continue to be harvested from the wild. In this paper we use stated preference techniques using a random sample of the Chinese population to estimate demand functions for wild bear bile with and without competition from farmed bear bile. We find a willingness to pay considerably more for wild bear bile than farmed. Wild bear bile has low own price elasticity and cross price elasticity with farmed bear bile. The ability of farmed bear bile to reduce demand for wild bear bile is at best limited and, at prevailing prices, may be close to zero or have the opposite effect. The demand functions estimated suggest that the own price elasticity of wild bear bile is lower when competing with farmed bear bile than when it is the only option available. This means that the incumbent product may actually sell more items at a higher price when competing than when alone in the market. This finding may be of broader interest to behavioural economists as we argue that one explanation may be that as product choice increases price has less impact on decision making. For the wildlife farming debate this indicates that at some prices the introduction of farmed competition might increase the demand for the wild product."
https://openalex.org/W2069757963,"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major clinical challenge, particularly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. MDR-TB treatment is increasingly available, but outcomes have not been well characterized. South Africa has provided MDR-TB treatment for a decade, and we evaluated outcomes by HIV status for patients enrolled between 2000 and 2004 prior to anti-retroviral access.We assessed treatment outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients with MDR-TB from eight provincial programs providing second line drugs. World Health Organization definitions were used. Results were stratified by HIV status.Seven hundred fifty seven patients with known HIV status were included in the final analysis, and HIV infection was documented in 287 (38%). Overall, 348 patients (46.0%) were successfully treated, 74 (9.8%) failed therapy, 177 (23.4%) died and 158 (20.9%) defaulted. Patients with HIV were slightly younger and less likely to be male compared to HIV negative patients. Patients with HIV were less likely to have a successful treatment outcome (40.0 vs. 49.6; P<0.05) and more likely to die (35.2 vs. 16.2; P<0.0001). In a competing risk survival analysis, patients with HIV had a higher hazard of death (HR: 2.33, P<0.0001). Low baseline weight (less than 45 kg and less than 60 kg) was also associated with a higher hazard of death (HR: 2.52, P<0.0001; and HR: 1.50, P<0.0001, respectively, compared to weight greater than 60 kg). Weight less than 45 kg had higher risk of failure (HR: 3.58, P<0.01). Any change in treatment regimen was associated with a higher hazard of default (HR: 2.86; 95% CI 1.55-5.29, P<0.001) and a lower hazard of death (HR: 0.63, P<0.05).In this MDR-TB treatment program patients with HIV infection and low weight had higher hazards of death. Overall treatment outcomes were poor. Efforts to improve treatment for MDR-TB are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2060374612,"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed male malignancy. The normal prostate development and prostate cancer progression are mediated by androgen receptor (AR). Recently, the roles of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and its activator, p35, in cancer biology are explored one after another. We have previously demonstrated that Cdk5 may regulate proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. In addition, we also identify that Cdk5 overactivation can be triggered by drug treatments and leads to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study is to investigate how Cdk5 regulates AR activation and growth of prostate cancer cells. At first, the data show that Cdk5 enables phosphorylation of AR at Ser-81 site through direct biochemical interaction and, therefore, results in the stabilization of AR proteins. The Cdk5-dependent AR stabilization causes accumulation of AR proteins and subsequent activation. Besides, the positive regulations of Cdk5-AR on cell growth are also determined in vitro and in vivo. S81A mutant of AR diminishes its interaction with Cdk5, reduces its nuclear localization, fails to stabilize its protein level, and therefore, decreases prostate cancer cell proliferation. Prostate carcinoma specimens collected from 177 AR-positive patients indicate the significant correlations between the protein levels of AR and Cdk5 or p35. These findings demonstrate that Cdk5 is an important modulator of AR and contributes to prostate cancer growth. Therefore, Cdk5-p35 may be suggested as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for prostate cancer in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2078787428,"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and its role in maintenance of pluripotency has been suggested previously. In epithelial cancer cells, activation of the EpCAM surface-to-nucleus signaling transduction pathway involves a number of membrane proteins. However, their role in somatic cell reprogramming is still unknown. Here we demonstrate that EpCAM and its associated protein, Cldn7, play a critical role in reprogramming. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) indicated that EpCAM and Cldn7 were up-regulated during reprogramming. Analysis of numbers of alkaline phosphatase- and Nanog-positive clones, and the expression level of pluripotency-related genes demonstrated that inhibition of either EpCAM or Cldn7 expression resulted in impairment in reprogramming efficiency, whereas overexpression of EpCAM, EpCAM plus Cldn7, or EpCAM intercellular domain (EpICD) significantly enhanced reprogramming efficiency in MEFs. Furthermore, overexpression of EpCAM or EpICD significantly repressed the expression of p53 and p21 in the reprogramming MEFs, and both EpCAM and EpICD activated the promoter activity of Oct4. These observations suggest that EpCAM signaling may enhance reprogramming through up-regulation of Oct4 and possible suppression of the p53-p21 pathway. In vitro and in vivo characterization indicated that the EpCAM-reprogrammed iPSCs exhibited similar molecular and functional features to the mouse ESCs. In summary, our studies provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms of reprogramming and suggest a more effective means of induced pluripotent stem cell generation."
https://openalex.org/W2065615506,"Background Phenotypically similar diseases have been found to be caused by functionally related genes, suggesting a modular organization of the genetic landscape of human diseases that mirrors the modularity observed in biological interaction networks. Protein complexes, as molecular machines that integrate multiple gene products to perform biological functions, express the underlying modular organization of protein-protein interaction networks. As such, protein complexes can be useful for interrogating the networks of phenome and interactome to elucidate gene-phenotype associations of diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings We proposed a technique called RWPCN (Random Walker on Protein Complex Network) for predicting and prioritizing disease genes. The basis of RWPCN is a protein complex network constructed using existing human protein complexes and protein interaction network. To prioritize candidate disease genes for the query disease phenotypes, we compute the associations between the protein complexes and the query phenotypes in their respective protein complex and phenotype networks. We tested RWPCN on predicting gene-phenotype associations using leave-one-out cross-validation; our method was observed to outperform existing approaches. We also applied RWPCN to predict novel disease genes for two representative diseases, namely, Breast Cancer and Diabetes. Conclusions/Significance Guilt-by-association prediction and prioritization of disease genes can be enhanced by fully exploiting the underlying modular organizations of both the disease phenome and the protein interactome. Our RWPCN uses a novel protein complex network as a basis for interrogating the human phenome-interactome network. As the protein complex network can capture the underlying modularity in the biological interaction networks better than simple protein interaction networks, RWPCN was found to be able to detect and prioritize disease genes better than traditional approaches that used only protein-phenotype associations."
https://openalex.org/W2086939150,"Decreased expression of prosurvival and progrowth-stimulatory pathways, in addition to an environment that inhibits neuronal growth, contribute to the limited regenerative capacity in the central nervous system following injury or neurodegeneration. Membrane/lipid rafts, plasmalemmal microdomains enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and the protein caveolin (Cav) are essential for synaptic development/stabilization and neuronal signaling. Cav-1 concentrates glutamate and neurotrophin receptors and prosurvival kinases and regulates cAMP formation. Here, we show that primary neurons that express a synapsin-driven Cav-1 vector (SynCav1) have increased raft formation, neurotransmitter and neurotrophin receptor expression, NMDA- and BDNF-mediated prosurvival kinase activation, agonist-stimulated cAMP formation, and dendritic growth. Moreover, expression of SynCav1 in Cav-1 KO neurons restores NMDA- and BDNF-mediated signaling and enhances dendritic growth. The enhanced dendritic growth occurred even in the presence of inhibitory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β) and myelin-associated glycoproteins (MAG, Nogo). Targeting of Cav-1 to neurons thus enhances prosurvival and progrowth signaling and may be a novel means to repair the injured and neurodegenerative brain.

https://openalex.org/W2072137340,"We present an algorithm to identify individual neural spikes observed on high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Our method can distinguish large numbers of distinct neural units, even when spikes overlap, and accounts for intrinsic variability of spikes from each unit. As MEAs grow larger, it is important to find spike-identification methods that are scalable, that is, the computational cost of spike fitting should scale well with the number of units observed. Our algorithm accomplishes this goal, and is fast, because it exploits the spatial locality of each unit and the basic biophysics of extracellular signal propagation. Human intervention is minimized and streamlined via a graphical interface. We illustrate our method on data from a mammalian retina preparation and document its performance on simulated data consisting of spikes added to experimentally measured background noise. The algorithm is highly accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2085148880,"Overproduction of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein in the brain has been hypothesized as the primary toxic insult that, via numerous mechanisms, produces cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholinesterase inhibition is a primary strategy for treatment of AD, and specific compounds of this class have previously been demonstrated to influence Aβ precursor protein (APP) processing and Aβ production. However, little information is available on the effects of rivastigmine, a dual acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor, on APP processing. As this drug is currently used to treat AD, characterization of its various activities is important to optimize its clinical utility. We have previously shown that rivastigmine can preserve or enhance neuronal and synaptic terminal markers in degenerating primary embryonic cerebrocortical cultures. Given previous reports on the effects of APP and Aβ on synapses, regulation of APP processing represents a plausible mechanism for the synaptic effects of rivastigmine. To test this hypothesis, we treated degenerating primary cultures with rivastigmine and measured secreted APP (sAPP) and Aβ. Rivastigmine treatment increased metabolic activity in these cultured cells, and elevated APP secretion. Analysis of the two major forms of APP secreted by these cultures, attributed to neurons or glia based on molecular weight showed that rivastigmine treatment significantly increased neuronal relative to glial secreted APP. Furthermore, rivastigmine treatment increased α-secretase cleaved sAPPα and decreased Aβ secretion, suggesting a therapeutic mechanism wherein rivastigmine alters the relative activities of the secretase pathways. Assessment of sAPP levels in rodent CSF following once daily rivastigmine administration for 21 days confirmed that elevated levels of APP in cell culture translated in vivo. Taken together, rivastigmine treatment enhances neuronal sAPP and shifts APP processing toward the α-secretase pathway in degenerating neuronal cultures, which mirrors the trend of synaptic proteins, and metabolic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2012552694,"Iridoids are one of the most widely distributed secondary metabolites in higher plants. They are pharmacologically active principles in various medicinal plants and key intermediates in the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids as well as quinoline alkaloids. Although most iridoids are present as 1-O-glucosides, the glucosylation step in the biosynthetic pathway has remained obscure. We isolated a cDNA coding for UDP-glucose:iridoid glucosyltransferase (UGT85A24) from Gardenia jasminoides. UGT85A24 preferentially glucosylated the 1-O-hydroxyl group of 7-deoxyloganetin and genipin but exhibited only weak activity toward loganetin and no activity toward 7-deoxyloganetic acid. This suggests that, in the biosynthetic pathway of geniposide, a major iridoid compound in G. jasminoides, glucosylation occurs after methylation of 7-deoxyloganetic acid. UGT85A24 showed negligible activity toward any acceptor substrates other than iridoid aglycones. Thus, UGT85A24 has a remarkable specificity for iridoid aglycones. The mRNA level of UGT85A24 overlaps with the marked increase in genipin glucosylation activity in the methyl jasmonate-treated cell cultures of G. jasminoides and is related to iridoid accumulation in G. jasminoides fruits."

The CMG (Cdc45·Mcm2–7·GINS) complex, which is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2–7, and the GINS (Go-Ichi-Ni-San) complex consisting of Sld5 and Psf1 to Psf3, is recruited by Cdc6 and Cdt1 onto origins bound by the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) and functions as a replicative helicase.

However, unlike archaea, trypanosomes possess components of the eukaryote-like CMG complex, but whether they form an active helicase complex, associate with the ORC, and regulate DNA replication remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the CMG complex is formed in vivo in trypanosomes and that Mcm2–7 helicase activity is activated by the association with Cdc45 and the GINS complex in vitro. Mcm2–7 and GINS proteins are confined to the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, whereas Cdc45 is exported out of the nucleus after DNA replication, indicating that nuclear exclusion of Cdc45 constitutes one mechanism for preventing DNA re-replication in trypanosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2052191760,"Background Since November 2009, WHO recommends that adults infected with HIV should initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) at CD4+ cell counts of ≤350 cells/µl rather than ≤200 cells/µl. South Africa decided to adopt this strategy for pregnant and TB co-infected patients only. We estimated the impact of fully adopting the new WHO guidelines on HIV epidemic dynamics and associated costs. Methods and Finding We used an established model of the transmission and control of HIV in specified sexual networks and healthcare settings. We quantified the model to represent Hlabisa subdistrict, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We predicted the HIV epidemic dynamics, number on ART and program costs under the new guidelines relative to treating patients at ≤200 cells/µl for the next 30 years. During the first five years, the new WHO treatment guidelines require about 7% extra annual investments, whereas 28% more patients receive treatment. Furthermore, there will be a more profound impact on HIV incidence, leading to relatively less annual costs after seven years. The resulting cumulative net costs reach a break-even point after on average 16 years. Conclusions Our study strengthens the WHO recommendation of starting ART at ≤350 cells/µl for all HIV-infected patients. Apart from the benefits associated with many life-years saved, a modest frontloading appears to lead to net savings within a limited time-horizon. This finding is robust to alternative assumptions and foreseeable changes in ART prices and effectiveness. Therefore, South Africa should aim at rapidly expanding its healthcare infrastructure to fully embrace the new WHO guidelines."

Although uPA and vitronectin engage structurally distinct binding sites on uPAR, they nonetheless cooperate functionally, as uPA binding potentiates uPAR-dependent induction of lamellipodia on vitronectin matrices. We now present data advancing the possibility that it is the burial of the β-hairpin in uPA per se into the hydrophobic ligand binding cavity of uPAR that modulates the function of this receptor. Based on these data, we now propose a model in which the inherent interdomain mobility in uPAR plays a major role in modulating its function. Particularly one uPAR conformation, which is stabilized by engagement of the β-hairpin in uPA, favors the proper assembly of an active, compact receptor structure that stimulates lamellipodia induction on vitronectin.

https://openalex.org/W2022303644,"Progress in understanding the mechanism underlying the enzymatic formation of iron-sulfur clusters is difficult since it involves a complex reaction and a multi-component system. By exploiting different spectroscopies, we characterize the effect on the enzymatic kinetics of cluster formation of CyaY, the bacterial ortholog of frataxin, on cluster formation on the scaffold protein IscU. Frataxin/CyaY is a highly conserved protein implicated in an incurable ataxia in humans. Previous studies had suggested a role of CyaY as an inhibitor of iron sulfur cluster formation. Similar studies on the eukaryotic proteins have however suggested for frataxin a role as an activator. Our studies independently confirm that CyaY slows down the reaction and shed new light onto the mechanism by which CyaY works. We observe that the presence of CyaY does not alter the relative ratio between [2Fe2S](2+) and [4Fe4S](2+) but directly affects enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2021899008,"Background The cyclin-D/CDK4,6/p16INK4a/pRB/E2F pathway, a key regulator of the critical G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, is universally disrupted in human cancer. However, the precise function of the different members of this pathway and their functional interplay are still not well defined. Methodology/Principal Findings We have shown here that the tumor suppressor p16INK4a protein positively controls the expression of cyclin D1 and E2F1 in both human and mouse cells. p16INK4a stabilizes the mRNAs of the corresponding genes through negative regulation of the mRNA decay-promoting AUF1 protein. Immunoprecipitation of AUF1-associated RNAs followed by RT-PCR indicated that endogenous AUF1 binds to the cyclin D1 and E2F1 mRNAs. Furthermore, AUF1 down-regulation increased the expression levels of these genes, while concurrent silencing of AUF1 and p16INK4a, using specific siRNAs, restored normal expression of both cyclinD1 and E2F1. Besides, we have shown the presence of functional AU-rich elements in the E2F1 3′UTR, which contributed to p16/AUF1-mediated regulation of E2F1 post-transcriptional events in vivo. Importantly, genome-wide gene expression microarray analysis revealed the presence of a large number of genes differentially expressed in a p16INK4a -dependent manner, and several of these genes are also members of the AUF1 and E2F1 regulons. We also present evidence that E2F1 mediates p16-dependent regulation of several pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, and the consequent induction of spontaneous as well as doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Conclusion/Significance These findings show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a is also a modulator of transcription and apoptosis through controlling the expression of two major transcription regulators, AUF1 and E2F1."

Methods and Findings We studied PP13-binding to erythrocytes, maternal blood-group effect on serum PP13 and its performance as a predictor of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Datasets of maternal serum PP13 in Caucasian (n = 1078) and Hispanic (n = 242) women were analyzed according to blood groups. In vivo, in vitro and in silico PP13-binding to ABO blood-group antigens and erythrocytes were studied by PP13-immunostainings of placental tissue-microarrays, flow-cytometry of erythrocyte-bound PP13, and model-building of PP13 - blood-group H antigen complex, respectively. Women with blood group AB had the lowest serum PP13 in the first trimester, while those with blood group B had the highest PP13 throughout pregnancy. In accordance, PP13-binding was the strongest to blood-group AB erythrocytes and weakest to blood-group B erythrocytes. PP13-staining of maternal and fetal erythrocytes was revealed, and a plausible molecular model of PP13 complexed with blood-group H antigen was built. Adjustment of PP13 MoMs to maternal ABO blood group improved the prediction accuracy of first trimester maternal serum PP13 MoMs for preeclampsia and IUGR. Conclusions ABO blood group can alter PP13-bioavailability in blood, and it may also be a key determinant for other lectins' bioavailability in the circulation. The adjustment of PP13 MoMs to ABO blood group improves the predictive accuracy of this test."

This study investigated the non-macrophage (NM) expression of proteins associated with M1 and M2 macrophages in NSCLC. Methods Using immunohistochemistry, CD68+ macrophages and proteins associated with either a cytotoxic M1 phenotype (HLA-DR, iNOS, and MRP 8/14), or a non-cytotoxic M2 phenotype (CD163 and VEGF) were identified. NM expression of the markers was analysed in the islets and stroma of surgically resected tumours from 20 patients with extended survival (ES) (median 92.7 months) and 20 patients with poor survival (PS) (median 7.7 months). Results The NM expression of NM-HLA-DR (p<0.001), NM-iNOS (p = 0.02) and NM-MRP 8/14 (p = 0.02) was increased in ES compared to PS patients in the tumour islets. The tumour islet expression of NM-VEGF, was decreased in ES compared to PS patients (p<0.001). There was more NM-CD163 expression (p = 0.04) but less NM-iNOS (p = 0.002) and MRP 8/14 (p = 0.01) expression in the stroma of ES patients compared with PS patients. The 5-year survival for patients with above and below median NM expression of the markers in the islets was 74.9% versus 4.7% (NM-HLA-DR p<0.001), 65.0% versus 14.6% (NM-iNOS p = 0.003), and 54.3% versus 22.2% (NM-MRP 8/14 p = 0.04), as opposed to 34.1% versus 44.4% (NM-CD163 p = 0.41) and 19.4% versus 59.0% (NM-VEGF p = 0.001). Conclusions Cell proteins associated with M1 and M2 macrophages are also expressed by other cell types in the tumour islets and stroma of patients with NSCLC. Their tissue and cellular microlocalisation is associated with important differences in clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2031062917,"Introduction Dysregulated cytokine action on immune cells plays an important role in the initiation and progress of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex autoimmune disease. Comprehensively quantifying basal STATs phosphorylation and their signaling response to cytokines should help us to better understand the etiology of SLE. Methods Phospho-specific flow cytometry was used to measure the basal STAT signaling activation in three immune cell types of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from 20 lupus patients, 9 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 13 healthy donors (HDs). A panel of 27 cytokines, including inflammatory cytokines, was measured with Bio-Plex™ Human Cytokine Assays. Serum Prolactin levels were measured with an immunoradiometric assay. STAT signaling responses to inflammatory cytokines (interferon α [IFNα], IFNγ, interleukin 2 [IL2], IL6, and IL10) were also monitored. Results We observed the basal activation of STAT3 in SLE T cells and monocytes, and the basal activation of STAT5 in SLE T cells and B cells. The SLE samples clustered into two main groups, which were associated with the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000, their erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and their hydroxychloroquine use. The phosphorylation of STAT5 in B cells was associated with cytokines IL2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IFNγ, whereas serum prolactin affected STAT5 activation in T cells. The responses of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 to IFNα were greatly reduced in SLE T cells, B cells, and monocytes, except for the STAT1 response to IFNα in monocytes. The response of STAT3 to IL6 was reduced in SLE T cells. Conclusions The basal activation of STATs signaling and reduced response to cytokines may be helpful us to identify the activity and severity of SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2020866179,"Rev1 and DNA polymerase ζ (Polζ) are involved in the tolerance of DNA damage by translesion synthesis (TLS). The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the auxiliary factor of nuclear DNA polymerases, plays an important role in regulating the access of TLS polymerases to the primer terminus. Both Rev1 and Polζ lack the conserved hydrophobic motif that is used by many proteins for the interaction with PCNA at its interdomain connector loop. We have previously reported that the interaction of yeast Polζ with PCNA occurs at an unusual site near the monomer-monomer interface of the trimeric PCNA. Using GST pull-down assays, PCNA-coupled affinity beads pull-down and gel filtration chromatography, we show that the same region is required for the physical interaction of PCNA with the polymerase-associated domain (PAD) of Rev1. The interaction is disrupted by the pol30-113 mutation that results in a double amino acid substitution at the monomer-monomer interface of PCNA. Genetic analysis of the epistatic relationship of the pol30-113 mutation with an array of DNA repair and damage tolerance mutations indicated that PCNA-113 is specifically defective in the Rev1/Polζ-dependent TLS pathway. Taken together, the data suggest that Polζ and Rev1 are unique among PCNA-interacting proteins in using the novel binding site near the intermolecular interface of PCNA. The new mode of Rev1-PCNA binding described here suggests a mechanism by which Rev1 adopts a catalytically inactive configuration at the replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W2058852955,"Oxidative damage to DNA, if not repaired, can be both miscoding and blocking. These genetic alterations can lead to mutations and/or cell death, which in turn cause cancer and aging. Oxidized DNA bases are substrates for two overlapping repair pathways: base excision (BER) and nucleotide incision repair (NIR). Hydantoin derivatives such as 5-hydroxyhydantoin (5OH-Hyd) and 5-methyl-5-hydroxyhydantoin (5OH-5Me-Hyd), major products of cytosine and thymine oxidative degradation pathways, respectively, have been detected in cancer cells and ancient DNA. Hydantoins are blocking lesions for DNA polymerases and excised by bacterial and yeast DNA glycosylases in the BER pathway. However little is known about repair of pyrimidine-derived hydantoins in human cells.Here, using both denaturing PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS analyses we report that the bacterial, yeast and human AP endonucleases can incise duplex DNA 5' next to 5OH-Hyd and 5OH-5Me-Hyd thus initiating the NIR pathway. We have fully reconstituted the NIR pathway for these lesions in vitro using purified human proteins. Depletion of Nfo in E. coli and APE1 in HeLa cells abolishes the NIR activity in cell-free extracts. Importantly, a number of redundant DNA glycosylase activities can excise hydantoin residues, including human NTH1, NEIL1 and NEIL2 and the former protein being a major DNA glycosylase activity in HeLa cells extracts.This study demonstrates that both BER and NIR pathways can compete and/or back-up each other to remove hydantoin DNA lesions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2109787184,"Progression of fertilized mammalian oocytes through cleavage, blastocyst formation and implantation depends on successful implementation of the developmental program, which becomes established during oogenesis. The identification of ooplasmic factors, which are responsible for successful embryo development, is thus crucial in designing possible molecular therapies for infertility intervention. However, systematic evaluation of molecular targets has been hampered by the lack of techniques for efficient delivery of molecules into embryos. We have developed an automated robotic microinjection system for delivering cell impermeable compounds into preimplantation embryos with a high post-injection survival rate. In this paper, we report the performance of the system on microinjection of mouse embryos. Furthermore, using this system we provide the first evidence that recombinant BCL-XL (recBCL-XL) protein is effective in preventing early embryo arrest imposed by suboptimal culture environment. We demonstrate that microinjection of recBCL-XL protein into early-stage embryos repairs mitochondrial bioenergetics, prevents reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and enhances preimplantation embryo development. This approach may lead to a possible treatment option for patients with repeated in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure due to poor embryo quality."
https://openalex.org/W1980797897,"Cassava is the major source of calories for more than 250 million Sub-Saharan Africans, however, it has the lowest protein-to-energy ratio of any major staple food crop in the world. A cassava-based diet provides less than 30% of the minimum daily requirement for protein. Moreover, both leaves and roots contain potentially toxic levels of cyanogenic glucosides. The major cyanogen in cassava is linamarin which is stored in the vacuole. Upon tissue disruption linamarin is deglycosylated by the apolplastic enzyme, linamarase, producing acetone cyanohydrin. Acetone cyanohydrin can spontaneously decompose at pHs >5.0 or temperatures >35°C, or is enzymatically broken down by hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) to produce acetone and free cyanide which is then volatilized. Unlike leaves, cassava roots have little HNL activity. The lack of HNL activity in roots is associated with the accumulation of potentially toxic levels of acetone cyanohydrin in poorly processed roots. We hypothesized that the over-expression of HNL in cassava roots under the control of a root-specific, patatin promoter would not only accelerate cyanogenesis during food processing, resulting in a safer food product, but lead to increased root protein levels since HNL is sequestered in the cell wall. Transgenic lines expressing a patatin-driven HNL gene construct exhibited a 2–20 fold increase in relative HNL mRNA levels in roots when compared with wild type resulting in a threefold increase in total root protein in 7 month old plants. After food processing, HNL overexpressing lines had substantially reduced acetone cyanohydrin and cyanide levels in roots relative to wild-type roots. Furthermore, steady state linamarin levels in intact tissues were reduced by 80% in transgenic cassava roots. These results suggest that enhanced linamarin metabolism contributed to the elevated root protein levels."
https://openalex.org/W2010145969,"Paramyxoviruses, including the childhood pathogen human parainfluenza virus type 3, enter host cells by fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. This fusion results from the concerted action of its two envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion protein (F). The receptor-bound HN triggers F to undergo conformational changes that render it competent to mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We proposed that, if the fusion process could be activated prematurely before the virion reaches the target host cell, infection could be prevented. We identified a small molecule that inhibits paramyxovirus entry into target cells and prevents infection. We show here that this compound works by an interaction with HN that results in F-activation prior to receptor binding. The fusion process is thereby prematurely activated, preventing fusion of the viral membrane with target cells and precluding viral entry. This first evidence that activation of a paramyxovirus F can be specifically induced before the virus contacts its target cell suggests a new strategy with broad implications for the design of antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W1979768697,"The Embedded Figures Test (EFT) requires observers to search for a simple geometric shape hidden inside a more complex figure. Surprisingly, performance in the EFT is negatively correlated with susceptibility to illusions of spatial orientation, such as the Roelofs effect. Using fMRI, we previously demonstrated that regions in parietal cortex are involved in the contextual processing associated with the Roelofs task. In the present study, we found that similar parietal regions (superior parietal cortex and precuneus) were more active during the EFT than during a simple matching task. Importantly, these parietal activations overlapped with regions found to be involved during contextual processing in the Roelofs illusion. Additional parietal and frontal areas, in the right hemisphere, showed strong correlations between brain activity and behavioral performance during the search task. We propose that the posterior parietal regions are necessary for processing contextual information across many different, but related visuospatial tasks, with additional parietal and frontal regions serving to coordinate this processing in participants proficient in the task."
https://openalex.org/W2000756426,"GIV (Gα-interacting vesicle-associated protein, also known as Girdin) is a bona fide enhancer of PI3K-Akt signals during a diverse set of biological processes, e.g. wound healing, macrophage chemotaxis, tumor angiogenesis, and cancer invasion/metastasis. We recently demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV by receptor and non-receptor-tyrosine kinases is a key step that is required for GIV to directly bind and enhance PI3K activity. Here we report the discovery that Src homology 2-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) is the major protein-tyrosine phosphatase that targets two critical phosphotyrosines within GIV and antagonizes phospho-GIV-dependent PI3K enhancement in mammalian cells. Using phosphorylation-dephosphorylation assays, we demonstrate that SHP-1 is the major and specific protein-tyrosine phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated GIV in vitro and inhibits ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV downstream of both growth factor receptors and GPCRs in cells. In vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that SHP-1 and GIV interact directly and constitutively and that this interaction occurs between the SH2 domain of SHP-1 and the C terminus of GIV. Overexpression of SHP-1 inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV and formation of phospho-GIV-PI3K complexes, and specifically suppresses GIV-dependent activation of Akt. Consistently, depletion of SHP-1 enhances peak tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV, which coincides with an increase in peak Akt activity. We conclude that SHP-1 antagonizes the action of receptor and non-receptor-tyrosine kinases on GIV and down-regulates the phospho-GIV-PI3K-Akt axis of signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2027024248,"Disruption of 14-3-3 function by alpha-synuclein has been implicated in Parkinson's disease. As 14-3-3s are important regulators of cell death pathways, disruption of 14-3-3s could result in the release of pro-apoptotic factors, such as Bax. We have previously shown that overexpression of 14-3-3θ reduces cell loss in response to rotenone and MPP(+) in dopaminergic cell culture and reduces cell loss in transgenic C. elegans that overexpress alpha-synuclein. In this study, we investigate the mechanism for 14-3-3θ's neuroprotection against rotenone toxicity. While 14-3-3s can inhibit many pro-apoptotic factors, we demonstrate that inhibition of one factor in particular, Bax, is important to 14-3-3s' protection against rotenone toxicity in dopaminergic cells. We found that 14-3-3θ overexpression reduced Bax activation and downstream signaling events, including cytochrome C release and caspase 3 activation. Pharmacological inhibition or shRNA knockdown of Bax provided protection against rotenone, comparable to 14-3-3θ's neuroprotective effects. A 14-3-3θ mutant incapable of binding Bax failed to protect against rotenone. These data suggest that 14-3-3θ's neuroprotective effects against rotenone are at least partially mediated by Bax inhibition and point to a potential therapeutic role of 14-3-3s in Parkinson's disease."

RON receptor activation is also associated with resistance to tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer cells. Nrf2 is a positive regulator of cytoprotective genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and site-directed mutagenesis studies of the RON promoter, we identified Nrf2 as a negative regulator of RON gene expression. High Nrf2 and low RON expression was observed in normal mammary tissue whereas high RON and low or undetectable expression of Nrf2 was observed in breast tumors. The Nrf2 inducer sulforaphane (SFN) as well as ectopic Nrf2 expression or knock-down of the Nrf2 negative regulator keap1, which stabilizes Nrf2, inhibited RON expression and invasion of carcinoma cells. Consequently, our studies identified a novel functional role for Nrf2 as a ""repressor"" and RON kinase as a molecular target of SFN, which mediates the anti-tumor effects of SFN. These results are not limited to breast cancer cells since the Nrf2 inducer SFN stabilized Nrf2 and inhibited RON expression in carcinoma cells from various tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W2061236937,"While numerous studies have shown that a night of sleep profits memory relative to wake, we still have little understanding about what factors mediate this effect of sleep. A clear understanding of the dynamics of this effect of sleep beyond the initial night of sleep is also lacking. Here, we examined the effect of extrinsic rewards on sleep-dependent declarative memory processing across 12 and 24 hr training-retest intervals. Subjects were either paid based on their performance at retest ($1 for each correct answer), or received a flat fee for participation. After a 12 hr interval we observed pronounced benefits of both sleep and reward on memory. Over an extended 24 hr interval we found 1) that an initial night of sleep partially protects memories from subsequent deterioration during wake, and 2) that sleep blocks further deterioration, and may even have a restorative effect on memory, when it follows a full day of wake. Interestingly, the benefit imparted to rewarded (relative to unrewarded) stimuli was equal for sleep and wake subjects, suggesting that the sleeping brain may not differentially process rewarded information, relative to wake. However, looking at the overall impact of sleep relative to reward in this protocol, it was apparent that sleep both imparted a stronger mnemonic boost than reward, and provided a benefit to memory regardless of whether it occurred in the first or the second 12 hrs following task training."

Here we elucidate the role of olfactory cues in earthworm attraction to food sources and document specific chemical cues that attract Eisenia fetida to the soil fungi Geotrichum candidum. Fungi and other microorganisms are major sources of volatile emissions in soil ecosystems as well as primary food sources for earthworms, suggesting the likelihood that earthworms might profitably use olfactory cues to guide foraging behavior. Moreover, previous studies have documented earthworm movement toward microbial food sources. But, the specific olfactory cues responsible for earthworm attraction have not previously been identified. Using olfactometer assays combined with chemical analyses (GC-MS), we documented the attraction of E. fetida individuals to filtrate derived from G. candidum colonies and to two individual compounds tested in isolation: ethyl pentanoate and ethyl hexanoate. Attraction at a distance was observed when barriers prevented the worms from reaching the target stimuli, confirming the role of volatile cues. These findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying key trophic interactions in soil ecosystems and have potential implications for the extraction and collection of earthworms in vermiculture and other applied activities."

All studies to date are limited to the definition of statin-induced myotoxicity omitting to investigate whether and how HMGR inhibition influences muscle functions. To this end, 3-mo-old male rats (Rattus norvegicus) were treated for 3 wk with a daily intraperitoneal injection of simvastatin (1.5 mg/kg/d), and biochemical, morphological, mechanical, and functional analysis were performed on extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Our results show that EDL muscles from simvastatin-treated rats exhibited reduced HMGR activity; a 15% shift from the fastest myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoform IIb to the slower IIa/x; and reduced power output and unloaded shortening velocity, by 41 and 23%, respectively, without any change in isometric force and endurance. Moreover, simvastatin-treated rats showed a decrease of maximum speed reached and the latency to fall off the rotaroad (∼-30%). These results indicate that the molecular mechanism of the impaired muscle function following statin treatment could be related to the plasticity of fast MHC isoform expression."

Rod PDE6 is composed of heterodimeric catalytic subunits (αβ), while the catalytic core of cone PDE6 (α') is a homodimer. It is not known if variations between PDE6 subunits preclude rod PDE6 catalytic subunits from coupling to the cone phototransduction pathway. To study this issue, we generated a cone-dominated mouse model lacking cone PDE6 (Nrl(-/-) cpfl1). In this animal model, using several independent experimental approaches, we demonstrated the expression of rod PDE6 (αβ) and the absence of cone PDE6 (α') catalytic subunits. The rod PDE6 enzyme expressed in cone cells is active and contributes to the hydrolysis of cGMP in response to light. In addition, rod PDE6 expressed in cone cells couples to the light signaling pathway to produce S-cone responses. However, S-cone responses and light-dependent cGMP hydrolysis were eliminated when the β-subunit of rod PDE6 was removed (Nrl(-/-) cpfl1 rd). We conclude that either rod or cone PDE6 can effectively couple to the cone phototransduction pathway to mediate visual signaling. Interestingly, we also found that functional PDE6 is required for trafficking of M-opsin to cone outer segments."

CaM has been shown to interact and co-localize with the HIV-1 Gag protein in infected cells. However, the precise molecular mechanism of this interaction is not known. Binding of Gag to CaM is dependent on calcium and is mediated by the N-terminal-myristoylated matrix (myr(+)MA) domain. We have recently shown that CaM binding induces a conformational change in the MA protein, triggering exposure of the myristate group. To unravel the molecular mechanism of CaM-MA interaction and to identify the minimal CaM binding domain of MA, we devised multiple approaches utilizing NMR, biochemical, and biophysical methods. Short peptides derived from the MA protein have been examined. Our data revealed that whereas peptides spanning residues 11–28 (MA-(11–28)) and 31–46 (MA-(31–46)) appear to bind preferentially to the C-terminal lobe of CaM, a peptide comprising residues 11–46 (MA-(11–46)) appears to engage both domains of CaM. Limited proteolysis data conducted on the MA-CaM complex yielded a MA peptide (residues 8–43) that is protected by CaM and resistant to proteolysis. MA-(8–43) binds to CaM with a very high affinity (dissociation constant = 25 nm) and in a manner that is similar to that observed for the full-length MA protein.

Subsequent to virus assembly and budding, the virus undergoes a major morphological reorganization upon cleavage of the Gag polypeptides into several domains including the myristoylated matrix (myr(+)MA), capsid, and nucleocapsid proteins (3Adamson C.S.

Among the multiple functions proposed for the MA domain, its role in mediating Gag-membrane binding appears to be the most understood.

Gag binding to CaM is mediated by the MA domain and is dependent on calcium (29Radding W. Williams J.P. McKenna M.A. Tummala R. Hunter E. Tytler E.M. McDonald J.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Investigation of the underlying mechanism of Gag-CaM interactions has gained some momentum recently. Our laboratory (46Ghanam R.H. Fernandez T.F. Fledderman E.L. Saad J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41911-41920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and others (47Chow J.Y. Jeffries C.M. Kwan A.H. Guss J.M. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 702-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have shown that CaM binds directly to the MA protein in a calcium-dependent manner. Our NMR data revealed that binding of CaM to MA induces the extrusion of the myr group (46Ghanam R.H. Fernandez T.F. Fledderman E.L. Saad J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41911-41920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, despite the evidence that the N terminus of MA is likely to be the CaM binding domain, severe NMR signal broadening/loss did not allow for determination of the exact MA region that interacts with CaM (46Ghanam R.H. Fernandez T.F. Fledderman E.L. Saad J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41911-41920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In pioneering studies, Radding et al. (29Radding W. Williams J.P. McKenna M.A. Tummala R. Hunter E. Tytler E.M. McDonald J.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that peptides from the N-terminal region of MA bind to CaM with variable affinities and in different modes. These studies have prompted others to conduct SAXS experiments to elucidate the overall global features of CaM bound to short peptides derived from the MA protein (48Izumi Y. Watanabe H. Watanabe N. Aoyama A. Jinbo Y. Hayashi N. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7158-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Most recently, SAXS studies conducted on CaM complexed with full-length MA provided more insights on the global features of the complex (47Chow J.Y. Jeffries C.M. Kwan A.H. Guss J.M. Trewhella J. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 702-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, because of the low resolution “limitation,” SAXS methods cannot provide details on the complex interface, nor can it identify specific residues that are important for the formation and stabilization of the complex. To complement the SAXS studies and to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism of MA-CaM interactions, we devised multiple approaches utilizing NMR, biochemical, and biophysical methods. Short peptides derived from the MA protein have been examined. Our data revealed that a 36-amino acid peptide in the N-terminal region of MA spanning residues 8–43 (MA-(8–43)) constitutes the minimal CaM binding domain. We also found that this peptide binds very tightly to CaM in a manner that is very similar to that observed for the full-length MA protein. A plasmid encoding full-length (residues 1–148) Norvegicus rattus calmodulin was a kind gift from Madeline Shea (University of Iowa). The CaM sequence is identical (100% conserved) to the human CaM sequence (Swiss-port code P62158). To construct the MA-(8–43) clone, the MA-(8–43) coding sequence was PCR-amplified from the pNL4–3 isolate (NCBI accession code M15390) and ligated to the 3′-end of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) gene via BamHI and XhoI sites within a pET28 vector. The resulting plasmid has a His6 tag encoded on the N terminus of SUMO. Both the SUMO plasmid and another encoding for His6-SUMO protease were kindly provided by Jin-Biao Ma (University of Alabama at Birmingham). The unmyristoylated MA (myr(−)MA) protein was expressed and purified as described (49Massiah M.A. Starich M.R. Paschall C. Summers M.F. Christensen A.M. Sundquist W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 198-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 50Saad J.S. Loeliger E. Luncsford P. Liriano M. Tai J. Kim A. Miller J. Joshi A. Freed E.O. Summers M.F. J. Mol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Sorensen B.R. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4244-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaM protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21 Codon+ (DE3) RIL) cell line. To make unlabeled CaM, starter cells (20 ml) were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB media containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter). Next day, cells were transferred to 2 liters of LB media (100 mg/liter ampicillin) and grown until A600 reached ∼0.6–0.7, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside and grown for 4 h. Cells were then harvested, spun down at 5000 rpm, and stored overnight at −80 °C. The next day the cell pellet was resuspended in 60 ml (30 ml/liter cell culture) of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.2 and 1 mm EDTA. Cells were then sonicated, and cell lysate was spun down at 17,000 rpm for 30 min. The CaM-containing supernatant was then purified using an ion-exchange column (Q column, GE Healthcare). Fractions containing CaM protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 10 mm CaCl2 (wash buffer A). The dialyzed sample was loaded on phenyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and the CaM protein was extensively washed with wash buffer A followed by wash buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2) and another round with wash buffer A. CaM protein was then eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 10 mm EDTA. CaM samples were stored at −20 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris at pH 7.0 and 10 mm CaCl2. Protein purity was verified by SDS-PAGE. Uniformly 15N- and 13C-labeled CaM samples were prepared according to a previously described protocol (53Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and purified as described above for the unlabeled sample. The His6-SUMO-MA-(8–43) protein was expressed in the E. coli (BL21 Codon+ (DE3) RIL) cell line. To make the unlabeled sample of MA-(8–43) peptide, the His6-SUMO-MA-(8–43) starter cells (20 ml) were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB media containing kanamycin (50 mg/liter). The next day cells were transferred to 2 liters of LB media (50 mg/liter kanamycin) and grown until A600 reached ∼0.6–0.7, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside, and grown for 4 h. Cells were then harvested, spun down at 5000 rpm, and stored overnight at −80 °C. The next day the His6-SUMO-MA-(8–43) cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Cells were sonicated, and cell lysate was spun down at 17,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was then loaded on nickel resin (Thermo Scientific), and protein was washed and eluted on FPLC (Bio-Rad) using a gradient protocol (elution buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole). FPLC fractions were then pooled and dialyzed overnight in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8 and 250 mm NaCl. The MA-(8–43) peptide was cleaved by SUMO protease (at 1:1000 protease:protein) and purified via nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography methods. SUMO protease was expressed and purified as described (54Malakhov M.P. Mattern M.R. Malakhova O.A. Drinker M. Weeks S.D. Butt T.R. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). 15N-labeled samples of MA-(8–43) were prepared as described (53Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of MA-(8–43) was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Mmeas:Mcalc = 4390.47:4390.45). Synthetic MA peptides for residues 11–28 (MA-(11–28)), 31–46 (MA-(31–46)), and 11–46 (MA-(11–46)) were >95% pure and used as received (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). NMR data were collected at 35 °C on a Bruker Avance II (700 MHz 1H) spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple-resonance probe, processed with NMRPIPE (55Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar), and analyzed with NMRVIEW (56Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). All NMR samples were prepared in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-d11, pH 6.3, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR chemical shifts for CaM have been assigned as described (46Ghanam R.H. Fernandez T.F. Fledderman E.L. Saad J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41911-41920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ITC data were collected on an Auto-iTC200 microcalorimeter (MicroCal Corp., Northampton, MA) in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. In a typical experiment involving MA-(11–28) or MA-(31–46), ∼800 μm peptide was titrated into 50–80 μm CaM. For MA-(8–43) and MA-(11–46), the reciprocal titration was performed with ∼150–200 μm of CaM titrated into a cell sample containing ∼20 μm of peptide. Exothermic heats of reaction were measured at 37 °C for 19 injections. Heats of dilution were measured by titrating CaM or peptide into a buffer under identical conditions. Base-line corrections were performed by subtracting heats of dilution from the raw CaM-peptide titration data. Binding curves were analyzed, and dissociation constants were determined by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the base-line-corrected data using Origin 7.0 (MicroCal Corp.). CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco J815 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C from 260 to 185 nm. The scanning rate was set to 50 nm/min. Loading concentrations were 70 μm for peptides (in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7) and 10 μm for CaM and the CaM-MA-(8–43) complex (in 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2). The background signal from the buffer solution was subtracted from each spectrum. Proteolytic digestion reactions were conducted on highly pure samples of myr(−)MA, CaM, and myr(−)MA-CaM complex in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. The myr(−)MA-CaM complex was made at 1:1 stoichiometry and run on a gel filtration column (Superdex 75) to ensure sample homogeneity. Protein samples were then subjected to limited proteolysis by the addition of thermolysin (from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus rokko, Sigma) at 1:1000 (enzyme:complex) stoichiometry. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Digestion reactions were monitored for 24 h via SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. To identify the peptides present in the digested samples, the CaM-MA thermolysin digests were separated on a 50 × 2-mm Synergi Fusion-RP column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a 30-min acetonitrile gradient (0–50% containing 0.1% formic acid) and electrosprayed into a hybrid ion trap-FT ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ-FT, Thermo Finnigan, Waltham, MA). Eluting peptides were fragmented for MS/MS analysis with collision-induced dissociation fragmentation. Fragmentation spectra were annotated by a SEAQUEST search with a custom data base containing thermolysin, CaM, and MA sequences. MA peptides corresponding to residues 7–43 and 7–44 were identified by MS/MS and accurate mass analyses. The intact peptides were detected as multiple charge states (4+–10+), which when deconvoluted match the calculated mass of the peptides within 4 ppm. Our recent NMR studies revealed that the majority of 1H,15N resonances corresponding to residues in the N-terminal region of MA (residues ∼2–50) exhibit significant chemical shift changes upon binding to CaM (46Ghanam R.H. Fernandez T.F. Fledderman E.L. Saad J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41911-41920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, extensive loss and/or broadening of the NMR signals precluded unambiguous identification of residues critical for binding. Here, we devised new approaches to further characterize CaM-MA interactions and identify the minimal binding domain of MA. In the MA protein, residues 11–19 form an α-helix (helix I), and residues 20–30 form a β-sheet (Fig. 1) (28Saad J.S. Miller J. Tai J. Kim A. Ghanam R.H. Summers M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Early studies suggested that a peptide made of residues 11–25 can bind to CaM with 2:1 (peptide:CaM) stoichiometry and dissociation constant of about 10−9 m (29Radding W. Williams J.P. McKenna M.A. Tummala R. Hunter E. Tytler E.M. McDonald J.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subsequent SAXS data suggested that CaM adopts a dumbbell-like structure upon binding of 2 peptide molecules (residues 11–28) to the N and C termini of CaM (48Izumi Y. Watanabe H. Watanabe N. Aoyama A. Jinbo Y. Hayashi N. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7158-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We chose MA-(11–28) as a representative peptide to understand how it interacts with CaM. The CD spectrum obtained for MA-(11–28) shows a negative band at ∼200 nm, consistent with a random coil in solution (supplemental Fig. S1). Our two-dimensional HSQC NMR data obtained for a 15N-labeled CaM as a function of added unlabeled MA-(11–28) peptide shows that a subset of signals exhibited significant chemical shift changes upon binding of MA-(11–28) (Fig. 2). Amide chemical shift changes were calculated as ΔδHN (ppm) = [(Δδ1H)2 + (Δδ15N)2]1/2, where Δδ1H and Δδ15N are the 1H and 15N amide chemical shift changes, respectively. Chemical shift mapping revealed that these signals correspond to residues in the C-terminal domain of CaM (Fig. 2). More specifically, residues Phe-89, Leu-105, Arg-106, Met-109, Thr-110, Lys-115, Met-124, Ala-128, Phe-141, Met-144, Met-145, and Thr-146 exhibited the most dramatic chemical shift"
https://openalex.org/W2027789677,"Enhanced production of a 42-residue beta amyloid peptide (Aβ(42)) in affected parts of the brain has been suggested to be the main causative factor for the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The severity of the disease depends not only on the amount of the peptide but also its conformational transition leading to the formation of oligomeric amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) in the brain of AD patients. Despite being significant to the understanding of AD mechanism, no atomic-resolution structures are available for these species due to the evanescent nature of ADDLs that hinders most structural biophysical investigations. Based on our molecular modeling and computational studies, we have designed Met35Nle and G37p mutations in the Aβ(42) peptide (Aβ(42)Nle35p37) that appear to organize Aβ(42) into stable oligomers. 2D NMR on the Aβ(42)Nle35p37 peptide revealed the occurrence of two β-turns in the V24-N27 and V36-V39 stretches that could be the possible cause for the oligomer stability. We did not observe corresponding NOEs for the V24-N27 turn in the Aβ(21-43)Nle35p37 fragment suggesting the need for the longer length amyloid peptide to form the stable oligomer promoting conformation. Because of the presence of two turns in the mutant peptide which were absent in solid state NMR structures for the fibrils, we propose, fibril formation might be hindered. The biophysical information obtained in this work could aid in the development of structural models for toxic oligomer formation that could facilitate the development of therapeutic approaches to AD."
https://openalex.org/W2012348587,"Studies of influenza virus evolution under controlled experimental conditions can provide a better understanding of the consequences of evolutionary processes with and without immunological pressure. Characterization of evolved strains assists in the development of predictive algorithms for both the selection of subtypes represented in the seasonal influenza vaccine and the design of novel immune refocused vaccines. To obtain data on the evolution of influenza in a controlled setting, naïve and immunized Guinea pigs were infected with influenza A/Wyoming/2003 (H3N2). Virus progeny from nasal wash samples were assessed for variation in the dominant and other epitopes by sequencing the hemagglutinin (HA) gene to quantify evolutionary changes. Viral RNA from the nasal washes from infection of naïve and immune animals contained 6% and 24.5% HA variant sequences, respectively. Analysis of mutations relative to antigenic epitopes indicated that adaptive immunity played a key role in virus evolution. HA mutations in immunized animals were associated with loss of glycosylation and changes in charge and hydrophobicity in and near residues within known epitopes. Four regions of HA-1 (75-85, 125-135, 165-170, 225-230) contained residues of highest variability. These sites are adjacent to or within known epitopes and appear to play an important role in antigenic variation. Recognition of the role of these sites during evolution will lead to a better understanding of the nature of evolution which help in the prediction of future strains for selection of seasonal vaccines and the design of novel vaccines intended to stimulated broadened cross-reactive protection to conserved sites outside of dominant epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2145668406,"Imelysin-like proteins define a superfamily of bacterial proteins that are likely involved in iron uptake. Members of this superfamily were previously thought to be peptidases and were included in the MEROPS family M75. We determined the first crystal structures of two remotely related, imelysin-like proteins. The Psychrobacter arcticus structure was determined at 2.15 Å resolution and contains the canonical imelysin fold, while higher resolution structures from the gut bacteria Bacteroides ovatus, in two crystal forms (at 1.25 Å and 1.44 Å resolution), have a circularly permuted topology. Both structures are highly similar to each other despite low sequence similarity and circular permutation. The all-helical structure can be divided into two similar four-helix bundle domains. The overall structure and the GxHxxE motif region differ from known HxxE metallopeptidases, suggesting that imelysin-like proteins are not peptidases. A putative functional site is located at the domain interface. We have now organized the known homologous proteins into a superfamily, which can be separated into four families. These families share a similar functional site, but each has family-specific structural and sequence features. These results indicate that imelysin-like proteins have evolved from a common ancestor, and likely have a conserved function."
https://openalex.org/W2047271051,"The brush border (BB) Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE3 is rapidly activated or inhibited by changes in trafficking, which mimics renal and intestinal physiology. However, there is a paradox in that NHE3 has limited mobility in the BB due to its binding to the multi-PDZ domain containing the NHERF family. To allow increased endocytosis, as occurs with elevated intracellular Ca(2+), we hypothesized that NHE3 had to be, at least transiently, released from the BB cytoskeleton. Because NHERF1 and -2 are localized at the BB, where they bind NHE3 as well as the cytoskeleton, we tested whether either or both might dynamically interact with NHE3 as part of Ca(2+) signaling. We employed FRET to study close association of NHE3 and these NHERFs and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to monitor NHE3 mobility in the apical domain in polarized opossum kidney cells. Under basal conditions, NHERF2 and NHE3 exhibited robust FRET signaling. Within 1 min of A23187 (0.5 μm) exposure, the NHERF2-NHE3 FRET signal was abolished, and BB NHE3 mobility was transiently increased. The dynamics in FRET signal and NHE3 mobility correlated well with a change in co-precipitation of NHE3 and NHERF2 but not NHERF1. We conclude the following. 1) Under basal conditions, NHE3 closely associates with NHERF2 in opossum kidney cell microvilli. 2) Within 1 min of elevated Ca(2+), the close association of NHE3-NHERF2 is abolished but is re-established in ∼60 min. 3) The change in NHE3-NHERF2 association is accompanied by an increased BB mobile fraction of NHE3, which contributes to inhibition of NHE3 transport activity via increased endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2038708171,"In this paper we use detailed data about the biology of the head louse (pediculus humanus capitis) to build a model of the evolution of head lice colonies. Using theory and computer simulations, we show that the model can be used to assess the impact of the various strategies usually applied to eradicate head lice, both conscious (treatments) and unconscious (grooming). In the case of treatments, we study the difference in performance that arises when they are applied in systematic and non-systematic ways. Using some reasonable simplifying assumptions (as random mixing of human groups and the same mobility for all life stages of head lice other than eggs) we model the contagion of pediculosis using only one additional parameter. It is shown that this parameter can be tuned to obtain collective infestations whose characteristics are compatible with what is given in the literature on real infestations. We analyze two scenarios: One where group members begin treatment when a similar number of lice are present in each head, and another where there is one individual who starts treatment with a much larger threshold (“superspreader”). For both cases we assess the impact of several collective strategies of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2027915832,"Lower lung function is associated with an elevated systemic white cell count in men. However, these observations have not been demonstrated in a representative population that includes females and may be susceptible to confounding by recent airway infections or recent cigarette smoking. We tested the hypothesis that lung function is inversely associated with systemic white cell count in a population-based study.The study population consisted adults aged 17-90+ years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not report a recent cough, cold or acute illness in a non-smoking and smoking population.In non-smoking adults with the highest quintile of the total white cell count had a FEV(1) 125.3 ml lower than those in the lowest quintile (95% confidence interval CI: -163.1 to -87.5). Adults with the highest quintile of the total white cell count had a FVC 151.1 ml lower than those in the lowest quintile (95% confidence interval CI: -195.0 to -107.2). Similar associations were observed for granulocytes, mononuclear cells and lymphocytes. In current smokers, similar smaller associations observed for total white cell count, granulocytes and mononuclear cells.Systemic cellular inflammation levels are inversely associated with lung function in a population of both non-smokers and smokers without acute illnesses. This may contribute to the increased mortality observed in individuals with a higher baseline white cell count."

The ts gtf1 mutants accumulate an electrophoretic variant of the mitochondrially encoded Cox2p subunit of cytochrome oxidase and an unstable form of the Atp8p subunit of the F1-F0 ATP synthase that is degraded, thereby preventing assembly of the F0 sector.

https://openalex.org/W2042758236,"In family-based data, association information can be partitioned into the between-family information and the within-family information. Based on this observation, Steen et al. (Nature Genetics. 2005, 683-691) proposed an interesting two-stage test for genome-wide association (GWA) studies under family-based designs which performs genomic screening and replication using the same data set. In the first stage, a screening test based on the between-family information is used to select markers. In the second stage, an association test based on the within-family information is used to test association at the selected markers. However, we learn from the results of case-control studies (Skol et al. Nature Genetics. 2006, 209-213) that this two-stage approach may be not optimal. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage joint analysis for GWA studies under family-based designs. For this joint analysis, we first propose a new screening test that is based on the between-family information and is robust to population stratification. This new screening test is used in the first stage to select markers. Then, a joint test that combines the between-family information and within-family information is used in the second stage to test association at the selected markers. By extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the joint analysis always results in increased power to detect genetic association and is robust to population stratification."
https://openalex.org/W1983825995,"Until now cooperation experiments in primates have paid little attention to how cooperation can emerge and what effects are produced on the structure of a social group in nature. I performed field experiments with three groups of wild vervet monkeys in South Africa. I induced individuals to repeatedly approach and operate food containers. At least two individuals needed to operate the containers in order to get the reward. The recurrent partner associations observed before the experiment only partly predicted the forming of cooperative partnerships during the experiment. While most of the tested subjects cooperated with other partners, they preferred to do so with specific combinations of individuals and they tended not to mix with other group members outside these preferred partnerships. Cooperation therefore caused the relatively homogeneous networks I observed before the experiment to differentiate. Similar to a matching market, the food sharing partners selected each other limiting their choice. Interestingly neither sex nor age classes explained the specific partner matching. Kinship could not explain it either. Rather, higher ranking individuals cooperated with other higher ranking individuals, and lower ranking also matched among the same rank. This study reveals the key role dominance rank plays when food resources are patchy and can only be accessed through sharing with other individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2058654056,"Information on ongoing body movements can affect the perception of ambiguous visual motion. Previous studies on “treadmill capture” have shown that treadmill walking biases the perception of ambiguous apparent motion in backward direction in accordance with the optic flow during normal walking, and that long-term treadmill experience changes the effect of treadmill capture. To understand the underlying mechanisms for these phenomena, we conducted Experiment 1 with non-treadmill runners and Experiment 2 with treadmill runners. The participants judged the motion direction of the apparent motion stimuli of horizontal gratings in front of their feet under three conditions: walking on a treadmill, standing on a treadmill, and standing on the floor. The non-treadmill runners showed the presence of downward bias only under the walking condition, indicating that ongoing treadmill walking but not the awareness of being on a treadmill biased the visual directional discrimination. In contrast, the treadmill runners showed no downward bias under any of the conditions, indicating that neither ongoing activity nor the awareness of spatial context produced perception bias. This suggests that the long-term repetitive experience of treadmill walking without optic flow induced the formation of a treadmill-specific locomotor-visual linkage to perceive the complex relationship between self and the environment."
