https://openalex.org/W1995443865,"A radical polymerization process that yields well-defined polymers normally obtained only through anionic polymerizations is reported. Atom transfer radical polymerizations of styrene were conducted with several solubilizing ligands for the copper(I) halides: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl, 4,4'-di-n-heptyl, and 4,4'-di-(5-nonyl)-2,2'-dipyridyl. The resulting polymerizations have all of the characteristics of a living polymerization and displayed linear semilogarithmic kinetic plots, a linear correlation between the number-average molecular weight and the monomer conversion, and low polydispersities (ratio of the weight-average to number-average molecular weights of 1.04 to 1.05). Similar results were obtained for the polymerization of acrylates."
https://openalex.org/W2022437015,"A general circulation model that simulated changes in solar irradiance and stratospheric ozone was used to investigate the response of the atmosphere to the 11-year solar activity cycle. At solar maximum, a warming of the summer stratosphere was found to strengthen easterly winds, which penetrated into the equatorial upper troposphere, causing poleward shifts in the positions of the subtropical westerly jets, broadening of the tropical Hadley circulations, and poleward shifts of the storm tracks. These effects are similar to, although generally smaller in magnitude than, those observed in nature. A simulation in which only solar irradiance was changed showed a much weaker response."
https://openalex.org/W1969305880,"An electrohydrodynamic methodology has been developed that makes possible the precise assembly of two- and three-dimensional colloidal crystals on electrode surfaces. Electrophoretically deposited colloidal particles were observed to move toward one another over very large distances (greater than five particle diameters) to form two-dimensional colloidal crystals for both micrometer- and nanometer-size particles. This coalescence of particles with the same charge is opposite to what is expected from electrostatic considerations and appears to result from electrohydrodynamic fluid flow arising from an ionic current flowing through the solution. The ability to modulate this ""lateral attraction"" between particles, by adjusting field strength or frequency, facilitates the reversible formation of two-dimensional fluid and crystalline colloidal states on the electrode surface. Further manipulation allows controlled structures to be assembled."

The MORB data are consistent with the presence of a common mantle source region for OIBs that is sampled by mantle plumes. 3He/4He ratios for MORBs show both positive and negative correlation with the 206Pb/204Pb ratios, depending on the MORB suite. These data suggest that the common mantle source is located in the transition zone region. This region contains recycled, oceanic crustal protoliths that incorporated some continental lead before their subduction during the past 300 to 2000 million years."
https://openalex.org/W1969314093,"The origin of a new diploid species by means of hybridization requires the successful merger of differentiated parental species' genomes. To study this process, the genomic composition of three experimentally synthesized hybrid lineages was compared with that of an ancient hybrid species. The genomic composition of the synthesized and ancient hybrids was concordant (rs = 0.68, P < 0.0001), indicating that selection to a large extent governs hybrid species formation. Further, nonrandom rates of introgression and significant associations among unlinked markers in each of the three synthesized hybrid lineages imply that interactions between coadapted parental species' genes constrain the genomic composition of hybrid species."
https://openalex.org/W2013182835,"Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) fossils discovered in the Kem Kem region of Morocco include large predatory dinosaurs that inhabited Africa as it drifted into geographic isolation. One, represented by a skull approximately 1.6 meters in length, is an advanced allosauroid referable to the African genus Carcharodontosaurus. Another, represented by a partial skeleton with slender proportions, is a new basal coelurosaur closely resembling the Egyptian genus Bahariasaurus. Comparisons with Cretaceous theropods from other continents reveal a previously unrecognized global radiation of carcharodontosaurid predators. Substantial geographic differentiation of dinosaurian faunas in response to continental drift appears to have arisen abruptly at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous."
https://openalex.org/W2004789205,Peridotite xenoliths from the Cascade arc in the United States and in the Japan arc have neodymium and osmium isotopic compositions that are consistent with addition of 5 to 15 percent of subducted material to the present-day depleted mantle. These observations suggest that osmium can be partitioned into oxidized and chlorine-rich slab-derived fluids or melts. These results place new constraints on the behavior of osmium (and possibly other platinum group elements) during subduction of oceanic crust by showing that osmium can be transported into the mantle wedge.
https://openalex.org/W2019050142,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and γ-interferon (IFNγ) activate an overlapping set of genes via the Jak/STAT pathway. However, at least in human cells, a differential activation of STAT transcription factors was observed: IL-6 activates both acute phase response factor (APRF)/STAT3 and STAT1, whereas IFNγ leads only to STAT1 activation. All STATs cloned so far contain SH2 domains. Since all cytokine receptors using the Jak/STAT pathway were found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after ligand binding, it has been proposed that specific phosphotyrosine modules within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor chains recruit different STAT factors. We have analyzed by mutational studies and by phosphopeptide competition assays which of the tyrosine modules of the IL-6 signal transducer gp130 are capable of recruiting either APRF or STAT1. We found that two of the four tyrosine modules that are important for APRF activation also activate STAT1. For these modules, we propose the new consensus sequence YXPQ. We further present evidence that STAT1 is activated independently from APRF suggesting that gp130 contains multiple independent STAT binding sites. We compare the APRF and STAT1 activation motifs of gp130 with the STAT1 activation motif of the IFNγ receptor and demonstrate that the specificity of activation can be changed from APRF to STAT1 and vice versa by only two point mutations within a tyrosine module. These data strongly support the concept that the activation of a specific STAT is determined mainly by the phosphotyrosine module. The significance of these findings for other receptor systems is discussed. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and γ-interferon (IFNγ) activate an overlapping set of genes via the Jak/STAT pathway.

This region contains two short segments referred to as “box 1” and “box 2” which are conserved between members of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family. Three members of the Janus tyrosine kinase family, Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2, are found to be constitutively associated with gp130 and are activated and autophosphorylated after IL-6 stimulation (12Lütticken C.

The Jak kinases are believed to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, thereby creating docking sites for SH2 domain containing signaling molecules (15Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar). All STAT factors contain SH2 as well as SH3 domains (16Fu X.Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain has been shown to be involved in both activation and dimerization of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to interferons (17Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E.

Two members of the STAT family of transcription factors, namely APRF (or STAT3) and STAT1 are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in a number of cell types upon IL-6 stimulation, a process for which Jak1 kinase was found to be essential (12Lütticken C.

They homo- or heterodimerize and are then translocated into the nucleus where they bind to specific enhancers within promoter regions of acute phase protein genes (22Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J.

Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that any of the last four carboxyl-terminal tyrosine-containing motifs within the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 is sufficient for the activation of APRF. They proposed the amino acid sequence YXXQ as an APRF binding consensus sequence. In the IFNγ receptor α-chain a single tyrosine residue, Tyr-440, was found to be functionally important for signal transduction and binding of STAT1 to the receptor (25Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Mutational studies demonstrated that the important sequence in the IFNγ receptor is YDXXH, with tyrosine, aspartic acid, and histidine all being crucial for stimulation of major histocompatibility class I expression and IRF-1 induction. Although STAT1 activation is also triggered via gp130, there is no sequence within the cytoplasmic tail of gp130 resembling the YDKPH motif of the IFNγ receptor. Therefore, the question arose, how STAT1 recruitment can be triggered by IL-6. Three alternative mechanisms can be envisioned: (i) STAT1 is recruited directly via specific phosphotyrosine modules of gp130, (ii) STAT1 associates with gp130 only indirectly via bound APRF, and (iii) STAT1 associates directly with an activated Jak kinase. In the present study, we therefore identified by DNA binding competition assays with synthetic phosphopeptides and by mutational analysis the specific tyrosine motifs required for APRF and STAT1 activation through gp130. We found that APRF can be activated independently via four tyrosine modules but that only two of these were able to mediate STAT1 activation. The specificity of the activation sequences can be changed by two point mutations in both directions. The identification of a novel phosphotyrosine motif within the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 important for STAT1 activation strongly suggests that STAT1 transiently associates with gp130 independent of APRF. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Oligonucleotides were either synthesized with the Gene Assembler (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) or purchased from Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium), Biometra (Göttingen, Germany) or MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). DMEM and DMEM/F12-Mix was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein, Germany), fetal calf serum was from Seromed (Berlin, Germany). Recombinant human IL-6 was prepared as described by Arcone et al. (27Arcone R. Pucci P. Zappacosta F. Fontaine V. Malorni A. Marino G. Ciliberto G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific activity was 1 × 106 B-cell stimulatory factor-2 units/mg of protein. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been kindly provided by J. Burg and K.-H. Sellinger (Boehringer Mannheim, Penzberg, Germany). The erythropoietin receptor cDNA was a generous gift of Harvey F. Lodish (Boston). STAT cDNAs and antisera were kindly provided by James E. Darnell (New York) and Chris Schindler (New York). A frequently used buffer was phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.76 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2). The monoclonal antibody M2 against the FLAG epitope (N-DYKDDDDK-C) was purchased from Kodak (New Haven). COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and HepG2 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12-Mix at 5% CO2 in a water-saturated atmosphere. All cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 mg/liter), and penicillin (60 mg/liter). Standard cloning procedures were performed as outlined by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A Bluescript-SK-gp130 vector (pB130), which lacks EcoRV, AccI, ClaI, HindIII, and SalI restriction sites was digested with SphI and BamHI. Into these sites, an oligonucleotide was introduced which encodes the sequence for the FLAG-epitope and contains SphI, SalI, NsiI, BamHI sites, and a stop-codon: 5′-CAT GTC GAC TAC AAA GAC GAT GAC GAT AAA TAG-3′. The ΔS mutant was subcloned into the pSVL-Eg expression vector via the EcoRI and BamHI site of the Eg chimera and the pSVL, respectively. The construction of the pSVL-Eg vector coding for the extracellular domain of the murine EpoR, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic part of gp130, is described elsewhere. 2Hemmann, U., Gerhartz, C., Heesel, B., Sasse, J., Kurapkat, G., Grötzinger, J., Wollmer, A., Zhong, Z., Darnell, J.

An oligonucleotide 5′-CCT AAA AGT TAC TTA CCA CAG ACT GTA CGG CAA GGC GGC TAC ATG CCT CAG G-3′ containing the sequence of gp130 from amino acids 902-918 and a SphI and SalI site was introduced into the SphI and SalI sites of the pB130 plasmid. The construct was subcloned into pSVL-Eg as described above. A pBluescript-vector containing the cDNA for the Eg-chimera was digested with BglII and SphI and a linker with the sequence 5′-GAT CTG AAA TCA GGC ATG-3′ was introduced into these sites. The EgΔB construct was subcloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the pSVL expression vector. Oligonucleotides containing the NsiI and SphI sites and the sequence encoding 7 amino acids around tyrosines 759 and 767 of gp130 and 440 of the IFNγ receptor were inserted into pB130. These constructs were digested with SphI and BamHI and ligated with the FLAG-oligonucleotide (see above). The constructs were subcloned into pSVL-Eg as described. Oligonucleotides coding for the different tyrosine motifs and containing a NsiI and SalI site were introduced in the NsiI/SalI-digested pB130ΔS plasmid. The mutants were subcloned into pSVL-Eg as described. An oligonucleotide coding for the Y915 motif containing a NsiI, BamHI site and a STOP codon was introduced in the NsiI and BamHI sites of the pB130ΔS plasmid. The mutant was subcloned into pSVL-Eg as described. The sequences of the oligonucleotides coding for the tyrosine modules can be obtained upon request. Construction of the STAT1 and APRF/STAT3 expression vectors pSVL-STAT1 and pSVL-STAT3 is described elsewhere. 2Hemmann, U., Gerhartz, C., Heesel, B., Sasse, J., Kurapkat, G., Grötzinger, J., Wollmer, A., Zhong, Z., Darnell, J. E., Jr., Graeve, L., Heinrich, P. C., and Horn, F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12999-13007. Transfection of cells was carried out using the Gene Pulser™ from Bio-Rad Laboratories (München, Germany). 2 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml of DMEM were co-transfected with 10 µg of pSVL vector containing either the STAT1 or APRF cDNA plus 20 µg of pSVL vector containing EpoR/gp130 chimera cDNAs using a voltage of 230 V and a capacity of 960 µF. Three days after transfection, cells were used for additional studies. All peptides were synthesized as amides on a multiple peptide synthesizer (Abimed AMS 422, Langenfeld, Germany) according to the standard Fmoc machine protocols using TentaGel S RAM resin (50 µM) (Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany) and PyBOP (benzotriazole-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) activation (Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany). Side chain protection groups were Trityl (Asn, Gln, His, Cys), Pmc (Arg), tert-butyl (Ser, Thr, Tyr, Asp, Glu), and t-Boc (Lys, Trp). For the synthesis of the phosphorylated peptides, Fmoc-Tyr(PO3H2)-OH (Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) was used. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected by treatment with 750 mg of phenol, 250 µl of ethanedithiol, 500 µl of thioanisole, 500 µl of water in 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h. After precipitating the peptides with cold t-butyl methylether, the samples were washed six times with t-butyl methylether, dissolved in 5% acetic acid, and freeze-dried. All products were purified to greater than 80% purity by preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were prepared as described previously (22Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells were prepared as described by Andrews and Faller (29Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was measured with a Bio-Rad™ protein assay. EMSAs were performed as described previously (22Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells a gel shift incubation buffer without KCl was used. We used a double-stranded 32P-labeled mutated SIE-oligonucleotide from the c-fos promoter (m67SIE: 5′-GAT CCG GGA GGG ATT TAC GGG GAA ATG CTG-3′) (30Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol in 0.25-fold TBE at 20 V/cm for 4 h. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 80% water for 1 h, dried, and autoradiographed. For the supershift assay, nuclear extracts, gel shift mixture, and antisera (in a final dilution of 1:500) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then the double-stranded 32P-labeled m67SIE-oligonucleotide was added and the EMSAs were performed. Nuclear extracts, gel shift mixture, and peptides, in the concentrations as indicated in the figures, were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, the radioactive m67SIE-probe was added, and EMSAs were performed. In order to elucidate through which tyrosine module STAT1 is activated upon IL-6 stimulation, we first used a phosphopeptide competition assay. Such an approach has recently been used successfully in studying the activation of IL-4STAT/STAT6 (31Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Since the SH2 domain of a STAT factor is believed to mediate both, binding to the receptor at phosphotyrosine sites and dimerization with a second phosphorylated STAT factor (18Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), incubation of a STAT dimer with a large molar excess of relevant phosphotyrosine peptides should lead to the dimer dissociation and thereby prevention of its binding to the specific DNA element. We examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) the inhibitory effects of several synthetic peptides containing each one of the six tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain of gp130 in a nonphosphorylated and a phosphorylated form (Fig. 1A). In addition, the following peptides were analyzed: Yγ, which contains tyrosine 440 of the IFNγ receptor (32Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar); YAPRF, which contains tyrosine 705 of APRF believed to play a critical role in dimerization (19Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar); YRHE, which contains tyrosine 767 but has a point mutation from glutamine (Q) to glutamic acid (E) at position +3 and Yn, which contains the identical amino acids as peptide Y767 but in a random formation (Fig. 1A). Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells stimulated with IL-6 were analyzed using an oligonucleotide with high affinity to both APRF and STAT1 (19Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E.

EMSAs of control extracts show three complexes (Fig. 1B, left lanes) which are (from top to bottom), APRF homodimers, APRF-STAT1 heterodimers, and STAT1 homodimers (19Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Four of the six phosphopeptides from gp130 were able to specifically inhibit the formation of DNA-protein complexes: YP767, YP814, YP905, and YP915 (Fig. 1B), whereas YP683 and YP759 had no effect (data not shown). Peptides YP767 and YP905 were effective already at the lowest concentration used (30 µM), phosphopeptides YP814 and YP915 inhibited the DNA binding of STATs only when used at higher concentrations. The phosphopeptide YPRHE which has the same sequence as YP767 except for a point mutation Gln → Glu at position +3 showed almost no competition indicating that the glutamine in position +3 from tyrosine 767 is important for APRF activation. Peptide YPγ from the IFNγ receptor preferentially abolished the association with the DNA of STAT1 and only at high concentrations reduced that of APRF. Interestingly, the phosphopeptide from APRF (YAPRF) also competed STAT1 and APRF DNA binding. Random peptide YPn showed no competition, nor did the nonphosphorylated peptides (Fig. 1B, right lanes). To more precisely identify the tyrosine residues of gp130 necessary for STAT1 recruitment, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts of gp130 (Fig. 2). These chimeric receptors allowed us to study the activation of the STAT factors independently of endogenous gp130 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells which do not express the EpoR. The expression of the different chimeric receptors as analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody to the FLAG epitope was found to be comparable (data not shown). Three days after transfection, cells were stimulated with Epo, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSAs. To first investigate whether both STAT1 and APRF activation can be triggered through the EpoR/gp130 chimera (Eg), we compared the STAT factor activation by Epo in transfected COS-7 cells with the one stimulated by an IL-6·;soluble IL-6R complex in untransfected cells. Stimulation via the endogenous gp130 in nontransfected COS-7 cells by soluble IL-6R and IL-6 resulted in the formation of three DNA-protein complexes, designated a, b, and c corresponding to APRF homodimers, APRF-STAT1 heterodimers, and STAT1 homodimers, respectively (Fig. 3) (19Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 33Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.-J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). After transient transfection of COS-7 cells with cDNAs coding for the chimera containing the complete cytoplasmic domain of gp130 (Eg) and murine APRF, complex a and, to a minor extent, complex b were formed (Fig. 3). Both disappeared after preincubation with APRF antiserum, whereas treatment with STAT1 antibodies had no effect. Nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells expressing the Eg-chimera and STAT1 showed only complex c. Anti-APRF treatment had no effect, whereas incubation with anti-STAT1 led to a supershift. From these results we conclude that both APRF and STAT1 can be activated via the Eg-chimera. However, our observations indicated that the endogenous levels of the two STAT factors in COS-7 cells are quite different. Stimulation of endogenous gp130 preferentially activated STAT1 but only small amounts of APRF. This is in contrast to the typical IL-6 response in HepG2 and other cells (Fig. 1B). Similarly, in COS-7 cells that were transfected with the Eg-chimera alone, preferential STAT1 activation was observed. 2Hemmann, U., Gerhartz, C., Heesel, B., Sasse, J., Kurapkat, G., Grötzinger, J., Wollmer, A., Zhong, Z., Darnell, J. E., Jr., Graeve, L., Heinrich, P. C., and Horn, F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12999-13007. Also, Wen and colleagues (34Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar) found only low endogenous amounts of APRF in COS-7 cells. Therefore, all subsequent studies were performed with either APRF or STAT1 coexpression. To investigate which of the tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 are responsible for the activation of APRF and/or STAT1, we performed coexpressions of the different chimeras (Fig. 2) with either APRF or STAT1. In control cells which were transfected with the pSVL vector and either APRF- or STAT1-cDNAs, no activation of STAT factors was detected (Fig. 4). The full-length chimera (Eg) was able to activate both APRF and, to a minor extent, STAT1. In contrast, the deletion mutant EgΔS, which lacks the two carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues of gp130 resulted in the activation of exogenous APRF, whereas coexpressed STAT1 could not be recruited. Deletion mutant EgΔB which includes only the box 1 and 2 regions of gp130 and therefore lacks the five carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues, activated neither APRF nor STAT1. These results indicate that the last two tyrosine residues are required for STAT1 recruitment. In order to further investigate which tyrosine residue directs the activation of STAT1, chimeric molecules containing box 1 and box 2 plus one of the five distal tyrosine modules of gp130 were tested (Fig. 2). For comparison, a construct containing box 1 and box 2 of gp130 and the tyrosine module of the IFNγ receptor was used (EgYγ440). Stimulation of chimeric receptor EgY759 did not result in the activation of any of the two STAT factors (Fig. 4). Recently, it was shown that this tyrosine residue binds the phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP1D/syp (24Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). In contrast, the chimeras containing tyrosine modules Y767 and Y814 predominantly activated APRF. However, a weak activation of endogenous STAT1 also must have occurred since in both cases small amounts of the APRF/STAT1 heterodimer were formed. The chimeric receptors containing Y905 and Y915, however, were capable of stimulating both STAT proteins; nevertheless, they were still more active toward APRF (Fig. 4, lower panel). The last amino acid in gp130 is the glutamine in position +3 from tyrosine 915. To exclude that the amino acid residues of the FLAG epitope that is fused to the Y915 module in our construct artificially create an activation motif for STATs, we also constructed a chimeric receptor lacking this epitope. This protein showed the same activation pattern as EgY915 with the FLAG epitope (data not shown). Thus, our data show that tyrosine residues 767, 814, 905, and 915 recruit APRF, whereas tyrosines 905 and 915 can also recruit STAT1. A mutant receptor EgYγ440 containing the tyrosine module of the IFNγ receptor crucial for the activation of STAT1 by IFNγ (25Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) stimulated DNA binding mainly of STAT1 (Fig. 4). Only in cells overexpressing APRF, also low amounts of APRF and APRF/STAT1 heterodimer were activated. This result demonstrates that the specificity of STAT activation is determined neither by the box 1 and box 2 region nor by the kinases involved (Jak1 and Jak2 in both cases"

A., and Raetz, C. R. H.(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15410-15417). The E. coli DNA inserts in λ232 and λ233 suggested that a known gene (htrB) required for rapid growth above 33°C might encode the lauroyl transferase. Using the intermediate (Kdo)2-lipid IVA as the laurate acceptor, extracts of strains with transposon insertions in htrB were found to contain no lauroyl transferase activity. Cells harboring hybrid htrB+ plasmids overproduced transferase activity 100-200-fold. The overproduced transferase was solubilized with a non-ionic detergent and purified further by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. With lauroyl acyl carrier protein as the donor, the purified enzyme rapidly incorporated one laurate residue into (Kdo)2-lipid IVA. The rate of laurate incorporation was reduced by several orders of magnitude when either one or both Kdos were absent in the acceptor. With a matched set of acyl-acyl carrier proteins, the enzyme incorporated laurate 3-8 times faster than decanoate or myristate, respectively. Transfer of palmitate, palmitoleate, or R-3-hydroxymyristate was very slow.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A priori, it seemed reasonable that a separate enzyme would be needed for the generation of each acyloxyacyl moiety. In cell extracts, two laurates, two myristates, or one of each can be transferred efficiently to (Kdo)2-lipid IVA(10.Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 16.Borodovsky M. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After allowing 15 min for infection at 37°C, 150-μl portions of LB broth supplemented with 10 mM MgSO4 were added to each well. The lysates from the original library were used undiluted or diluted 1/10, as required, to accomplish lysis of the W3110 host within 5-8 h after infection. The microtiter plates were incubated on a shaker at 37°C. At 4.5 h after infection, and at 30-min intervals thereafter, the plates were inspected for wells displaying complete lysis. As soon as cultures showed lysis, the lysates were transferred to a new microtiter plate and stored at 4°C, while the unlysed cultures in the original microtiter plate were incubated further at 37°C. At the end of the experiment, the lysates were all stored at −80°C. For the purpose of screening the entire library, lysates (0.5 μl of a 1:5 dilution) were assayed for lauroyl transferase activity in a 10-μl screening assay mixture, containing 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μM (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (1 × 104 dpm/nmol), 25 μM lauroyl-ACP, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30°C. A 5-μl portion of each reaction mixture was spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis to determine the extent of acylation catalyzed by each extract (see below). To determine the specific activity of the lauroyl transferase in various extracts and purified fractions, assays were generally performed at 30°C, as described previously(10.Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (Method I) contained 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 μM (Kdo)2-lipid IVA (2 × 103 dpm/nmol), 25 μM lauroyl-ACP, O.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.4-1000 μg/ml enzyme protein, as indicated, in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were stopped by spotting a 4-5-μl portion onto a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. After a few minutes to allow the spots to dry, the plates were developed in chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v), and then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The amounts of radioactivity in both the substrate and the acylated product were measured using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The specific activity of the lauroyl transferase was expressed in terms of nanomoles/min/mg of protein. In the course of purifying the lauroyl transferase, an improved assay was developed (Method II). The latter was identical to Method I, except that 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM NaCl were included in the reaction mixture to stabilize the enzyme. Crude cell-free extracts were made from 1-2 liters of logarithmically growing cultures. After harvesting by low speed centrifugation at 2°C, cells were washed once in 30 mM Hepes pH 7.5 containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA (half the volume of the original culture). The washed cell pellet was resuspended in 30 mM Hepes pH 7.5 containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA (a volume approximately equal to the volume of the cell pellet). Cells were broken using an ice-cold French Pressure cell (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 20,000 p.s.i. The broken cell suspension was adjusted to 10 mM MgSO4, and DNase I was added to 1 μg/ml. After a brief sonication on an ice water bath to decrease the viscosity, the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Membranes and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was centrifuged a second time to remove residual contaminating membranes. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of 30 mM Hepes pH 7.5 containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM EGTA, and it was centrifuged again as above to generate the final, washed membrane fraction. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as the standard(25.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

A derivative of [4′-32P]lipid IVA bearing only one Kdo residue (designated Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA) was synthesized from [4′-32P]lipid IVA under the same conditions used to make (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, except that membranes (1 mg/ml final concentration) isolated from Haemophilus influenzae(30.White K.A. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: A1376Google Scholar) were substituted for the purified E. coli Kdo transferase(27.Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various acyl-ACPs were synthesized from the corresponding fatty acids and commercial acyl carrier protein, as described previously(31.Kelly T.M. Stachula S.A. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19866-19874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the immobilized acyl-ACP synthase was replaced with 80 μg/ml solubilized membrane protein from the acyl-ACP synthase overproducing strain, E. coli LCH109pLCH5/pGP1-2(32.Jackowski S. Jackson P.D. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the acyl-ACP synthetase, LCH109/pLCH5/pGP1-2 membranes were solubilized using a modification of the procedure of Rock and Cronan (32.Jackowski S. Jackson P.D. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7116-7122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two 1-liter cultures of LCH109/pLCH5/pGP1-2 were grown at 30°C until the cultures reached an A600 of approximately 0.4. The cultures were then shifted to 42°C for 30 min. Next, the cultures were allowed to continue growing for 90 min at 37°C. To harvest, the cells were centrifuged at 4500 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. A French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. was used to disrupt the cells, and unbroken cells were removed by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was made 10 mM in MgCl2 by adding 1 M MgCl2. Then, the extract was centrifuged for 1 h at 150,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Next, a 5-ml solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 4% Triton X-100 and 20 mM MgCl2 was added to solubilize the inner membrane proteins. The suspension was stirred on ice for 30 min. The solubilized membranes were centrifuged a second time at 150,000 × g for 1 h to remove outer membrane proteins, which were not extracted efficiently under these conditions. The supernatant was stored in aliquots at −80°C. The enzymatic acylation of ACP with laurate, myristate, palmitate, decanoate, palmitoleate, or R-3-hydroxymyristate was carried out as follows. ACP (1 mg) and 8.6 mM dithiothreitol were incubated in 500 μl of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a sealed tube at 37°C for 1 h. Next, a 320-μl solution consisting of 0.7 M LiCl, 40 mM MgCl2, 20 mM ATP, pH 8.0, 750 μM fatty acid, 2.7% Triton X-100, and 540 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to the tube with the ACP. Last, 400 μl of 0.25 mg/ml LCH109/pLCH5/pGP1-2 solubilized membranes was added, and the acylation reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1-2 h. The extent of acylation was determined by analyzing 5-μl portions of the reaction mixture on a polyacrylamide/urea gel system(34.Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate the product, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with water and loaded onto a 1-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated with 10 mM bis-tris, pH 6.0. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of 10 mM bis-tris, pH 6.0, 5 volumes of 10 mM bis-tris, pH 6.0, containing 50% isopropyl alcohol, and 5 volumes of 10 mM bis-tris, pH 6.0. The column was eluted with 3 volumes of 10 mM bis-tris, pH 6.0, containing 0.2 M LiCl and 3 volumes of 10 mM bis-tris, pH 6.0, containing 0.6 M LiCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. The acyl-ACPs eluted in the second 0.6 M LiCl fraction. This fraction was concentrated and exchanged into distilled H2O using a Centricon-3 membrane (Amicon). The acyl-ACPs were about 90% pure, as judged by electrophoresis in the polyacrylamide/urea gel system and staining with Coomassie Blue (34.Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were generated in E. coli strain W3110, using an ordered subset of the E. coli chromosomal λ library of Kohara(15.Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 16.Borodovsky M. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Every insert in this “miniset” collection has been mapped with restriction enzymes and positioned on the E. coli chromosome(15.Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 16.Borodovsky M. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), facilitating the identification of genes. Satisfactory λ lysates were obtained with 461 of the 476 clones that constitute the miniset collection. The remaining 15 clones did not cause lysis of E. coli W3110, probably because of a low titer in the original library lysates. No attempt was made to retrieve these 15 clones. Before screening all the lysates for overproduction of the lauroyl transferase, the ability of these lysates to overexpress a characterized enzyme of lipid A biosynthesis with a known structural gene was validated. The kdtA gene, encoding Kdo transferase (Fig. 1), was previously mapped to the overlapping DNA segments present in λ clones [573]4D2 and [572]2A6 of the Kohara library(16.Borodovsky M. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 35.Clementz T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9687-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The λ lysates generated with these clones on W3110 displayed a 5-10-fold higher specific activity of Kdo transferase than lysates generated from other, randomly selected λ clones (data not shown). Overexpression, like that seen with kdtA, was also observed in lysates generated with clones harboring two other mapped genes of lipid biosynthesis (dgk and glpK)(16.Borodovsky M. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that certain cloned E. coli genes present on non-lysogenic hybrid λ vectors are transcribed and translated efficiently during infection. It is possible to detect clones containing a gene of interest by assaying for overexpression of enzymatic activity above the background derived from the chromosomally encoded gene. Screening for overexpression of enzyme activity in lysates prepared with hybrid λ libraries therefore affords a useful alternative for identifying novel genes in such libraries, especially if no sequence information is available. Given the results with the Kdo transferase, all 461 lysates generated in E. coli strain W3110 with the Kohara library were assayed for overproduction of the lauroyl transferase that acts on (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (Fig. 1)(10.Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate dilutions of these lysates were used to give a conversion within the linear range of the assay (1-10% under these conditions) for the chromosomally encoded activity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Screening the lysates in this manner resulted in the identification of two clones (Fig. 2) that overexpressed the lauroyl transferase, as judged by thin layer chromatography and PhosphorImager analysis. Lysates from clones [232]1H7 and [233]E4H10S, containing adjacent and partially overlapping chromosomal fragments, catalyzed 25 and 45% conversion of substrate to product, respectively, as compared to 5.5 and 7.1% for the two flanking clones, [231]1C7 and [234]E3G11 (Fig. 2). The overexpressed transferase displayed an absolute dependence on the addition of lauroyl-ACP as a cosubstrate (Fig. 2), as did the transferase present in extracts of control cells. The cloned DNA fragments in [232]1H7 and [233]E4H10S include approximately 11 kilobases of overlapping sequences, according to the EcoMap6(16.Borodovsky M. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 309-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since both these clones directed overexpression of the transferase, we assumed that the entire gene encoding the transferase should reside within the overlap. A few sequenced genes had previously been mapped to this region (near minute 25), one of which is htrB(17.Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18.Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2004660422,"Retinal guanylyl cyclase-1 (RetGC-1) is a membrane guanylyl cyclase found in photoreceptor outer segments. It consists of an apparent extracellular domain (ECD) linked by a single transmembrane segment to an intracellular domain (ICD). Guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2 (GCAP-2) is a Ca2+-binding protein that activates RetGC-1 in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. To establish whether GCAP-2 stimulates RetGC-1 through the ECD or ICD, we made deletion mutants lacking either the ECD or both the ECD and transmembrane domains (TMD) of RetGC-1. Recombinant wild type RetGC-1 and both deletion mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells, and their sensitivities to GCAP-2, Ca2+, and ATP were compared. Our data demonstrate that both deletion mutants are regulated similarly to wild type RetGC-1 with indistinguishable EC50 values for Ca2+ and similar K½ values for activation by GCAP-2. This shows that GCAP-2 functions through the ICD of RetGC-1 and that removal of the ECD and TMD do not significantly alter regulation by these factors. Our data also show that ATP potentiates stimulation of guanylyl cyclase activity by GCAP-2 and that neither the ECD nor the TMD of RetGC-1 participate in its regulation by ATP."

Overall, NOS appears to be a moderately conserved protein. Northern analysis showed that chicken iNOS mRNA is approximately 4.5 kilobases (kb), a size similar to mammalian inducible NOS. Analysis of 3.2 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the chicken iNOS gene showed a putative TATA box at 30 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcription initiation site. The functional importance of the upstream region was determined by transient expression of deletion constructs. An endotoxin regulatory region was located exclusively within 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. This is in contrast to the two distinct sites identified in the mouse macrophage NOS promoter. Transcription factor binding sites such as NF-κB, PEA1, PEA3, and C/EBP were identified. Using a NF-κB inhibitor, we showed that NF-κB is indeed involved in the induction of chicken iNOS gene by lipopolysaccharide.

There are, at least, three genetically distinct types of NOS: type 1 (nNOS), a constitutive form which was initially identified in neurons; type 2 (iNOS), an inducible form from macrophages, and type 3 (eNOS), a constitutive form which was initially identified in endothelium. All isoforms utilize the amino acid arginine, molecular oxygen, and NADPH as substrates and require tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and FMN as cofactors(3.Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two constitutive forms are activated by and dependent on changes in intracellular calcium(5.Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar), whereas the inducible isoform is calcium independent apparently because calmodulin is a tightly bound subunit of the iNOS(34.Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).Although there has been considerable research on the biological functions of NO and the regulation of NOS in humans and rodents(35.Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), little is known of NOS in any nonmammalian system. It has been reported that other species are capable of producing NO, such as Limulus polyphemus(35.Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hematophagous insects(36.Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M.H. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), fish(37.Holmqvist B.I. Östholm T. Alm P. Ekström P. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 171: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and chickens(38.Sung Y.J. Hotchkiss J.H. Austic R.E. Dieter R.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 50: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a single report of a primary structure of the constitutive NOS from Drosophila(39.Regulski M. Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 92: 9072-9076Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) but there are no known NOS sequences from other nonmammalian species. This has not only impeded the understanding the evolution of NOS protein but also made the study of the regulation of NOS at the molecular level in other species impossible. Since chickens do not possess the urea cycle (40.Tamir H. Ratner S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 102: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and thus can not synthesize the substrate of NOS (arginine) directly, the chick represents a unique and potentially important model to study NOS gene expression. In an effort to study NOS regulation and to evaluate the evolution of NOS, we have cloned the first nonmammalian inducible NOS cDNA from a chicken macrophage cell line. In addition, we report the cloning and analysis of chicken iNOS 5′-flanking region. We have identified an upstream region of chicken iNOS gene responsible for LPS stimulation. In this LPS-responsive region, several transcription factor binding elements were identified, but NF-κB was shown to be involved in the induction of chicken iNOS gene expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureThe chicken macrophage cell line, HD11(41.Beug H. von Krichbach A. Doderlein G. Conscience J. Graf T. Cell. 1979; 18: 375-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Dietert (Cornell University, Ithaca). Cells were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), penicillin, and streptomycin. LPS (Escherichia coli, serotype 0128:B12) was purchased from Sigma, prepared in DMEM medium at 1 mg/ml, and stored at −80°C prior to use. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.Reverse Transcription-PCR to Generate a Probe for cDNA Library ScreeningHighly degenerate oligonucleotides were deduced from conserved amino acid residues between rat neuronal NOS (24.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar) and mouse macrophage NOS (31.Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A.H. Troso T. Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar) sequences for polymerase chain reaction. The reaction was performed by using total RNA from LPS-induced chicken macrophages, HD11. The two degenerate primers were: the sense strand, ITPVFHQEM (ATIACICCIGTITTICAICAIGAIATG), corresponding to amino acids 466-474 in mouse iNOS; the antisense strand, ATETGKS (CGITGICTITGICCITTIAG), corresponding to amino acids 538-544 in mouse iNOS. Restriction enzymes, EcoRI and HindIII, recognition sequences were flanked at the 5′ end of the primer sequences for subcloning purpose. A reverse transcription-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) was used with the renature temperature 50°C for 40 cycles. The PCR product was further subcloned in Bluescript plasmids (Stratagene), sequenced, and used as a probe for cDNA library screening.cDNA Library ScreeningThe cDNA library was made commercially (Stratagene) by using 500 μg of total RNA isolated from chicken macrophages stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 12 h. The cDNA library was constructed in λ ZAPII phages by using random priming and poly(A) priming on chicken macrophage mRNA. Phages were plated on E. coli strain MRF- and further transferred onto Dulose membranes (Stratagene). The membranes were hybridized in 2 × PIPES, 50% deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured, sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and random priming [32P]CTP-labeled PCR product (1 million cpm/ml) at 42°C for at least 18 h. Membranes were washed in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60°C until radioactivity on membranes was below 1,000 cpm and then exposed to x-ray films for at least 8 h before developing. Approximately 1 million independent clones were screened and several dozen positive clones identified. Positive clones were successively spread and screened until pure clones were obtained. Twenty-four positive clones were further rescued to Bluescript plasmids as described by the manufacturer's procedures (Stratagene) for restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Manual DNA sequencing was done using Sequenase 2.0 kits. (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and verified using the automated sequencing facility at Cornell University (Applied Biosystems).Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated using guanidine thiocyanate in a single step method(42.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62982) Google Scholar), fractionated on a denaturing, 1% agarose gel, and transferred onto a GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont NEN). The blot was hybridized at 42°C in 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% deionized formamide, and probed with [32P]CTP-labeled chicken iNOS cDNA (1 million cpm/ml). The probe was labeled by random priming. Membranes were washed at high stringency: 0.1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 45°C. The blot was exposed to x-ray films at −80°C for at least 24 h before developing.Transient ExpressionThe chick iNOS cDNA which contained a full open reading frame obtained from cDNA library screening was excised at the EcoRI restriction enzyme site and subcloned into an eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The expression vector containing chick iNOS cDNA was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells by lipofection (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-1 cells, 1-1.2 × 105 cells, were seeded in each well on a 6-well plate 1 6 to 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were incubated at 37°C (5% CO2) until 50-60% confluence. Prior to transfection, cells were washed with DMEM without serum at least three times, and 2.4 μg of DNA and 12 μl of LipofectAMINE were added into culture dishes with DMEM alone. Five h later, an equal amount of DMEM plus 20% fetal calf serum with no antibiotics was added to each well. After 12 to 24 h, the medium was changed back to DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum plus antibiotics with or without inhibitor (100 μML-NMMA or aminoguanidine) and with or without L- or D-arginine (1 mM). Two to three days after transfection, the cell culture supernatant was taken for nitrite analysis.Nitrite DeterminationNitrite was measured as described by Green et al.(43.Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10664) Google Scholar). 100 μl of cell culture supernatant was added to 100 μl of Griess reagent (1;1, v/v, 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine and 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H3PO4) in a 96-well flat-bottomed plate. The reading of absorbance at 550 nm was taken using medium as blank. Nitrite concentration was obtained by comparison with NaNO2 standard curve.Genomic Library ScreeningAn amplified genomic library derived from an adult Leghorn male chicken was purchased from Clontech (La Jolla, CA). The iNOS cDNA containing a full open reading frame was used as a probe and labeled by random priming. Screening procedures were followed according to the λ library protocol handbook from Clontech with minor modifications. Briefly, 30,000 to 40,000 plaques were seeded in each 150-mm Petri dish. Two million clones were screened, and duplicate membranes were used through screenings. Membranes were hybridized in 2 × PIPES, 50% deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA at 42°C for at least 16 h. Membranes were washed using the following conditions: twice (15 min each) at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; twice (15 min each) at 42°C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; twice (15 min each) at 65°C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. After membranes were washed, a Geiger counter was used to estimate the intensity of the signal and the background. If the background radioactivity was over 2,000 cpm, then the membranes would be washed another 3 times (15 min each) at 65°C at 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were then exposed to x-ray films (X-Omar film, Kodak) at −70°C for at least 16 h. Positive plaques were rescreened by the same procedures until pure clones were obtained. Eight positive clones were obtained, and DNA from positive clones was purified. Restriction enzyme analyses (data not shown) indicated that these eight positive clones belonged to four independent clones.Cloning the 5′-Flanking Region of iNOS GeneDNA from the four independent genomic clones was subject to PCR reaction to identify the clones containing 5′-flanking sequence of chicken iNOS gene. A pair of primers were synthesized corresponding to the 5′ end sequences of iNOS cDNA with sense strand, TTCAAACCTCATGCTGTTAA (corresponding to most of amino acid residues 8-15); antisense strand, GATTATAGGTGACATCTTCA (corresponding to most of amino acid residues 52-58). The PCR reaction was set at an annealing temperature of 60°C for 25 cycles. After PCR reactions, 10 μl of PCR product was analyzed on an agarose gel (1%) along with DNA molecular weight markers. Among these four positive clones, only one clone possessed the 5′-flanking sequence of chicken iNOS gene (data not shown). λ phage DNA from this positive clone was digested by four different restriction enzymes, BamHI, EcoRI, XbaI, and SacI, and subcloned into Bluescript plasmid at the respective restriction enzyme sites. After subcloning, plasmids were transformed into E. coli cells (DH5α) and spread on ampicillin agar plates. Twelve colonies were randomly picked from each subcloning group, and their plasmids were isolated. PCR was used again to identify the colonies containing the 5′-flanking sequences of iNOS gene. Two colonies, one in the XbaI group and one in the SacI group, were identified to contain the 5′-flanking region of iNOS gene. The 5′-flanking region of iNOS was sequenced on both strands by a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The sequences were confirmed by the automated sequencing facility at Cornell University (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequence analysis identified that the one in the SacI group possessed the longer 5′-flanking sequence of iNOS gene than that of the XbaI group.Mapping the Transcriptional Start Site of the Chick iNOSThe primer extension analysis was applied to map the transcriptional initiation site of the chick iNOS gene. The avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase primer extension system from Promega was used with minor modifications. Total RNA was isolated from chicken macrophages, HD11 cells, stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or unstimulated. An oligonucleotide, GTTGTTCCCAAATCTGCTAG (see Fig. 4), complementary to the 5′ end sequence of the chicken iNOS was end-labeled with 32P, and it was used as the primer. The primer annealing temperature was 50°C for 1 h using 5 μg of total RNA. The reverse transcription was performed in using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 41°C for 1 h. The same primer was used in DNA sequencing on a plasmid containing the 5′-flanking region of chick iNOS gene. The sequencing product was run side by side as a molecular weight marker with the primer extension product in a 6% sequencing gel. The gel was dried, transferred to chromatography paper, and exposed overnight to an x-ray film. The transcription initiation site of the chick iNOS gene was obtained by aligning the size of the reverse transcription product with the DNA sequencing result.Figure 4:Nucleotide sequence of the chicken iNOS 5′-flanking region. The mRNA initiation site is denoted as nucleotide position +1 which is bold. Intron 1 is enclosed with parentheses located from +86 to +182 (97 nucleotides). The complementary sequence of nucleotides, +52 to +71, was made as a primer (underlined arrow), 20 nucleotides long, for the primer extension experiment. A putative TATA box is located at nucleotide −30 (boxed). The region associated with LPS response was labeled with a vertical line. Potential transcription factor binding sites are underlined and labeled. All the transcription factor binding sites shown are perfect matches with reported consensus sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Construction of a Reporter Gene with the Upstream Sequence of iNOS GeneA 3.2-kb fragment of iNOS upstream sequence was cloned into a luciferase reporter gene, pGL2 Basic (Promega). The iNOS 5′-flanking sequence was excised from the plasmid by PvuII and SacI restriction enzymes. The excised fragment was incubated with Klenow enzyme to generate blunt ends for ligation into a luciferase reporter gene. A pGL2 luciferase reporter plasmid was linearized by the XhoI restriction enzyme and incubated with Klenow enzyme to generate blunt ends. The linearized and blunt end insert (iNOS 5′ end fragment) and vector (pGL2) were incubated together in the presence of the ligation buffer and 1 μl of high concentration T4 ligase (15 units/μl) at 18°C overnight. The ligation mixture was transformed into DH5α E. coli cells and spread on ampicillin agar plates. Six colonies were randomly picked from the plates, and their plasmids were isolated. The isolated plasmids were digested individually with restriction enzymes (HindIII and KpnI) to screen the clone containing the iNOS upstream fragment insert. The positive clones were sequenced to determine the orientation of the insert. The clone containing the correct orientation was used to generate deletion clones.Construction of Deletion ClonesA series of deletion constructs were made from a chimeric plasmid containing the 3.2-kb 5′ upstream region of the iNOS gene ligated in front of a luciferase gene by using a kit, Erase-a-Base system (Promega). The plasmid (20 μg) was digested with MluI and KpnI restriction enzymes to generate 5′- and 3′-protruding ends, respectively. Exonuclease III was used to digest the 5′-protruding end of DNA at 25°C which would digest approximately 90 base pairs per min. An aliquot of DNA was taken every minute to obtain a spectrum of deletion clones. The partial digested DNA was then treated with S1 nuclease and Klenow enzyme to generate blunt ends. The DNA with two blunt ends were ligated together by T4 DNA ligase at room temperature for 1 h. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli DH5α competent cells. Plasmid was isolated from randomly picked colonies, and the size of deletion clones was estimated by PCR reaction by using the primers generated from pGL2 vector close to the polycloning sites. DNA sequencing was used to identify the exact size of the deletion clones.Transient Expression of Deletion ClonesHD11 cells (1.8 × 106 cells/dish) were seeded in a 100-mm culture dish 24 h before transfection. Cells were kept in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator until cells were approximately 60% confluent. HD11 cells were then washed with DMEM buffer without serum and antibiotics three times prior to transfection. For every two 100-mm culture dishes, 4 μg of reporter DNA containing galactosidase gene as a control for transfection efficiency and 4 μg of reporter DNA containing various sizes of iNOS upstream sequence were used in transfection experiments. The two kinds of DNA were mixed well before being distributed into two tubes for transfection. Therefore, each tube contains 4 μg of DNA. LipofectAMINE (30 μl/tube) was then added to each tube. DNA and LipofectAMINE were mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min prior to adding to cell culture dishes. HD11 cells were then incubated with DNA and LipofectAMINE mixture in DMEM without serum and antibiotics. Five hours after transfection, HD11 cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman and pooled from two dishes. Transfected cells were washed twice with DMEM without serum and then reseeded into a 6-well culture dish in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml LPS. 15 h after LPS treatment, cellular extract was isolated and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured.RESULTSChicken Macrophage NOS SequenceOligonucleotide primers (see “Materials and Methods”) designed from the conserved sequences between mouse macrophage NOS (31.Lyons C.R.

A partial chick type II NOS (iNOS) cDNA was obtained which was approximately 220 bp and showed 68% sequence identity with mouse iNOS cDNA and no sequence similarity to any other existing proteins in GenBank™ (data not shown). Thus, the PCR product was used as a probe to screen a chicken macrophage cDNA library. Approximately 1 million independent clones from an unamplified library were screened, and hundreds of positive clones were identified. After secondary and tertiary screening, 24 independent clones were isolated. A clone containing the longest insert was fully sequenced on both strands. It possessed an open reading frame which encoded 1,136 amino acid residues, predicting a protein of 129,648 Da molecular mass. The deduced amino acid sequence of chicken macrophage NOS was aligned with published NOS sequence by using MEGALIGN in DNA STAR, Lasergene (Fig. 1). There were conserved regions in deduced amino acid sequences of chicken iNOS for the binding of iNOS cofactors: heme, calmodulin, FMN, FAD, and NADPH.Figure 1:The deduced amino acid sequence of chicken macrophage iNOS (CKiNOS) aligned with the amino acid sequences of murine macrophage iNOS (MUiNOS)(31.Lyons C.R.

https://openalex.org/W2061244674,"Glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles is driven by an electrochemical proton gradient formed across the membrane by a vacuolar H+-ATPase. Chloride has a biphasic effect on glutamate transport, which it activates at low concentrations (2-8 mM) and inhibits at high concentrations (>20 mM). Stimulation with 4 mM chloride was due to an increase in the Vmax of transport, whereas inhibition by high chloride concentrations was related to an increase in Km to glutamate. Both stimulation and inhibition by Cl- were observed in the presence of A23187 or (NH4)2SO4, two substances that dissipate the proton gradient (ΔpH). With the use of these agents, we show that the transmembrane potential regulates the apparent affinity for glutamate, whereas the ΔpH antagonizes the effect of high chloride concentrations and is important for retaining glutamate inside the vesicles. Selective dissipation of ΔpH in the presence of chloride led to a significant glutamate efflux from the vesicles and promoted a decrease in the velocity of glutamate uptake. The H+-ATPase activity was stimulated when the ΔpH component was dissipated. Glutamate efflux induced by chloride was saturable, and half-maximal effect was attained in the presence of 30 mM Cl-. The results indicate that: (i) both transmembrane potential and ΔpH modulate the glutamate uptake at different levels and (ii) chloride affects glutamate transport by two different mechanisms. One is related to a change of the proportions between the transmembrane potential and the ΔpH components of the electrochemical proton gradient, and the other involves a direct interaction of the anion with the glutamate transporter."

These studies demonstrate that thyroid hormone (T3) can modulate the binding activity of the IRP to an IRE in vitro and in vivo. T3 augmented an iron-induced reduction in IRP binding activity to a ferritin IRE in RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays using cytoplasmic extracts from human liver hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Hepatic IRP binding to the ferritin IRE also diminished after in vivo administration of T3 with iron to rats. In transient transfection studies using HepG2 cells and a human ferritin IRE-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (H-IRE-CAT) construct, T3 augmented an iron-induced increase in CAT activity by ∼45%. RNase protection analysis showed that this increase in CAT activity was not due to a change in the steady state level of CAT mRNA. Nuclear T3-receptors may be necessary for this T3-induced response, because the effect could not be reproduced by the addition of T3 directly to cytoplasmic extracts and was absent in CV-1 cells which lack T3-receptors. We conclude that T3 can functionally regulate the IRE binding activity of the IRP.

https://openalex.org/W2079963068,"The role of the functional architecture of human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) active center in facilitating reactions with organophosphorus inhibitors was examined by a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies of phosphorylation with organophosphates differing in size of their alkoxy substituents and in the nature of the leaving group. Replacements of residues Phe-295 and Phe-297, constituting the HuAChE acyl pocket, increase up to 80-fold the reactivity of the enzymes toward diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, diethyl phosphorofluoridate, and p-nitrophenyl diethyl phosphate (paraoxon), indicating the role of this subsite in accommodating the phosphate alkoxy substituent. On the other hand, a decrease of up to 160-fold in reactivity was observed for enzymes carrying replacements of residues Tyr-133, Glu-202, and Glu-450, which are constituents of the hydrogen bond network in the HuAChE active center, which maintains its unique functional architecture. Replacement of residues Trp-86, Tyr-337, and Phe-338 in the alkoxy pocket affected reactivity toward diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate and paraoxon, but to a lesser extent that toward diethyl phosphorofluoridate, indicating that both the alkoxy substituent and the p-nitrophenoxy leaving group interact with this subsite. In all cases the effects on reactivity toward organophosphates, demonstrated in up to 10,000-fold differences in the values of bimolecular rate constants, were mainly a result of altered affinity of the HuAChE mutants, while the apparent first order rate constants of phosphorylation varied within a narrow range. This finding indicates that the main role of the functional architecture of HuAChE active center in phosphorylation is to facilitate the formation of enzyme-inhibitor Michaelis complexes and that this affinity, rather than the nucleophilic activity of the enzyme catalytic machinery, is a major determinant of HuAChE reactivity toward organophosphates."

This polysaccharide had a molecular weight of 29,000, calculated based on the viscometry, and a uniform repeating disaccharide structure of →4)-2-acetyl,2-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranose (1→4)-2-sulfo-α-L-idopyranosyluronic acid (1→. This polysaccharide represents a new, previously undescribed glycosaminoglycan. It is related to the heparin and heparan sulfate families of glycosaminoglycans but is distinctly different from all known members of these classes of glycosaminoglycans. The structure of this polysaccharide, with adjacent N-acetylglucosamine and 2-sulfo-iduronic acid residues, also poses interesting questions about how it is made in light of our current understanding of the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate. This glycosaminoglycan represents 3-5% of the dry weight of this snail's soft body tissues, suggesting important biological roles for the survival of this organism, and may offer new means to control this pest. Snail glycosaminoglycan tightly binds divalent cations, such as copper(II), suggesting a primary role in metal uptake in the snail. Finally, this new polysaccharide might be applied, like the Escherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide, to the study of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and to the semisynthesis of new glycosaminoglycan analogs having important biological activities.

The biological functions of proteoglycans, including the regulation of cell growth, result, in large part, through the interaction of the GAG chains in proteoglycans with proteins, such as growth factors and their receptors(1.Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). There are two major classes of GAGs: 1) glucosaminoglycans, including heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and keratan sulfate; and 2) galactosaminoglycans, including chondroitin and dermatan sulfates (1.Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J.

Heparin and heparan sulfate have been the subject of intensive study because of their well recognized ability to bind many different proteins that regulate a variety of important biological processes(2.Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Witczak Z.B. Nieforth K.A. Carbohydrates as Drugs. Marcel Dekker, New York1996Google Scholar). Heparin and heparan sulfate GAGs are comprised of alternating 1→4 linked glucosamine and uronic acid residues. Heparan sulfate is composed primarily of monosulfated disaccharides of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid, while heparin is composed mainly of trisulfated disaccharides of N-sulfoyl-D-glucosamine and L-iduronic acid(2.Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Witczak Z.B. Nieforth K.A. Carbohydrates as Drugs. Marcel Dekker, New York1996Google Scholar). GAGs have been isolated from various tissues obtained from a large number of animal species including both vertebrates and invertebrates (3.Hovingh P. Piepkorn M. Linker A. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4.Nader N.B. Dietrich C.P. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin; Chemical and Biological Properties, Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 81-96Google Scholar). An exhaustive assessment showed that while a large number of invertebrate species contain GAGs, mollusks are a particularly rich source of these sulfated polysaccharides(4.Nader N.B. Dietrich C.P. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin; Chemical and Biological Properties, Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 81-96Google Scholar). Invertebrates were first shown to contain a heparin or heparan sulfate type GAG by Burson and co-workers in 1956(5.Burson S.L. Fahrenbach M.J. Frommhagen L.H. Riccardi B.A. Brown R.A. Brockman Crenshaw M.A. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1972; 143: 506-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin has only been found in one invertebrate phylum, the Mollusca, and it often corresponds to up to 90% of the total GAG content of these organisms. While the heparins isolated from various mollusks are structurally different from human heparin (6.Linhardt R.J. Ampofo S.A. Fareed J. Hoppensteadt D. Mulliken J.B. Folkman J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12441-12445Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and pharmaceutical heparins(7.Linhardt R.J. Rice K.G. Kim Y.S. Lohse D.L. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Biochem.

While pursuing our long term study of heparin's structure, we isolated a pure GAG in large amounts from the giant African snail Achatina fulica having a unique structure. This GAG is neither heparin nor heparan sulfate, but instead represents a new type of 1→4 linked GAG. A number of biological roles are likely for this molecule in the snail. Giant snails (A. fulica Bowdich) originated in East Africa and were purchased in Seoul, Korea, where they are a local food source. Porcine mucosal heparin and heparan sulfate (12.Griffin C.C.

Res. 1995; 276: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (sodium salt) were from Celsus (Cincinnati, OH). Heparin lyase II used in the large-scale depolymerization was from IBEX (Montreal, Canada). Heparin lyase I (EC 4.2.2.7), heparin lyase II (no EC number), and heparin lyase III (EC 4.2.2.8) used in structural studies were purified in our laboratory to homogeneity from Flavobacterium heparinum(13.Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin disaccharide standards were from Grampian Enzymes (Aberdeen, UK). All other reagents used were analytical grade. Alkaline protease mixture, Alcalase, was from Novo (New York, NY). Gel filtration chromatography was performed on Sephadex G-50 (superfine) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and on Bio-Gel P-2 (fine) from Bio-Rad. Spectrapore dialysis membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 1000 were from Spectrum Medical (Los Angeles, CA). Strong anion exchange HPLC was performed on a 5-μm Spherisorb 2.5 × 25-cm column from Phase Separation (Norwalk, CT) using dual face programmable LC-7A titanium-based pumps (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Pharmacia variable wavelength detector. Gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed on a 20-cm vertical slab gel (Protean(™)II, equipped with a model 1420B power source from Bio-Rad. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was performed using a Dionex Capillary Electrophoresis system with advanced computer interface, model I, equipped with high voltage power supply capable of constant or gradient voltage control using a fused silica capillary from Dionex Corporation (Sunnyvale, CA). The Cannon-Ubbelohde semimicro capillary viscometer was from Cannon Instruments (State College, PA). A Perkin-Elmer (Ueberlingen, Germany) model 141 polarimeter was used to determine optical rotations. The shell of a giant snail (A. fulica) was removed, and the whole soft body was defatted using three 24-h extractions with acetone. The fat-free dried snail was cut into a fine powder using a razor blade. Approximately 4 g of dried, defatted, pulverized powder was suspended in 40 ml of 0.05 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.2). The suspension was shaken for 48 h at 200 rpm at 60°C after adding 2 ml of Alcalase (2.4 Anson units/g). The digestion mixture was cooled to 4°C, and trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 5%. The sample was mixed, allowed to stand for 10 min, and then centrifuged for 20 min at 8000 × g. The supernatant was recovered by decanting. Three volumes of 5% potassium acetate in ethanol was added to one volume of supernatant. After mixing, the suspension was stored overnight at 4°C and then centrifuged for 30 min at 8,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was washed with absolute alcohol. The precipitate (1 g) was dissolved in 40 ml of 0.2 M NaCl and centrifuged for 30 min at 8,000 × g, and insoluble material was discarded. To the supernatant 0.5 ml of cetylpyridinium chloride (5%) was added, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of 2.5 M NaCl, 5 volumes of ethanol was added, and the precipitate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The precipitate was dissolved in water and dialyzed against 100 volumes of water, and the dialyzate was freeze-dried to obtain 0.18 g of GAG as a white powder. A stock solution of polysaccharide (snail GAG, heparin, or heparan sulfate) was prepared in 0.5 M sodium chloride at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The viscosity of each polysaccharide was determined using a capillary viscometer(14.Roden L. Baker J.R. Cifonelli J.A. Mathews M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 73-140Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The intrinsic viscosity was calculated from the specific viscosity (ŋSP) of each polysaccharide. The viscometric molecular weight (Mv) was determined from the Mark-Houwink equation using constants (K = 3.55, a = 0.09) obtained from heparin by Liberti and Stivala(15.Liberti P.A. Stivala S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The optical rotation [α]D was obtained for each polysaccharide in water at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/ml. Sample (200 μg) was thoroughly dried under P2O5in vacuo and dissolved in 0.5 ml of methanolic 1 M HCl using a screw-capped tube with a Teflon-lined cap(16.Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Nitrogen gas was bubbled through the solution for 15 s, and then the tube was sealed. After methanolysis for 24 h at 80°C, the acid solution was neutralized by the addition of 0.15 ml of pyridine. Re-N-acetylation was carried out by the addition of 0.1 ml of acetic anhydride. This mixture was kept at room temperature for 1 h. The sample solution was evaporated with nitrogen gas flow at 35°C. The residue was dried for 16 h in vacuo over P2O5. Finally, the sample was trimethylsilylated with 50 μl of silylating reagent (pyridine/N,O-Bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide, 1:2 (v/v)) for 30 min at room temperature. Compositional analysis by GC (16.Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) was performed using a capillary column AT-1, 0.53 mm × 30-m (1.5-μm thickness), from Alltech Associates (Deerfield, IL) on a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) gas chromatograph, model GC-14A, with a flame ionization detector, equipped with Shimadzu Chromatopac CR501 integrating recorder. The injection port temperature and the detector temperature were 270 and 280°C, respectively. For the analysis of mixtures of monosaccharides, the oven temperature was programmed 120-260°C at 10°C/min. The composition of disaccharides and oligosaccharides produced from intact polysaccharide by each heparin lyase was analyzed by CE(12.Griffin C.C. Linhardt R.J. VanGorp C.L. Toida T. Hileman R.E. Schubert R.L. Brown S.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Smith A.E. Hileman R.E. Gallagher J.T. Jackson P. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag, AG, Basel1996Google Scholar). The CE system was operated in the reverse polarity mode by applying the sample at the cathode and run with 20 mM phosphoric acid adjusted to pH 3.5 with 1 M dibasic sodium phosphate as described previously(18.Pervin A. Al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The capillary (75-μm inner diameter, 375-μm outer diameter, 68 cm long) was manually washed before use with 0.5 ml of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide followed by 0.5 ml of distilled water and then 0.5 ml running buffer. Samples were applied using gravity injection (20 s) by hydrostatic pressure (45 mm), resulting in a sample volume of 9.2 nl. Each experiment was conducted at a constant 18,000 V. Data collection was at 232 nm. Peaks were identified by co-injection with disaccharide and oligosaccharide standards prepared and characterized in our laboratory (18.Pervin A. Al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20.Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Ampofo S.A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) The size of products formed on treating snail GAG with heparin lyase II was determined by gel permeation chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 (superfine) column (1.5 × 25 cm) eluted with 0.2 M sodium chloride and monitored using a carbazole assay(19.Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). The disaccharide product of heparin lyase II treatment was prepared for analysis by semipreparative strong anion exchange HPLC (21.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and desalted by chromatography on a 5-cm × 0.5-m Bio-Gel P-2 column. For 1H NMR spectroscopy, approximately 1 mg of each sample was exchanged three times with 0.5-ml portions of 2H2O (99.96%; Sigma), followed by in vacuo desiccation over P2O5. The thoroughly dried sample was redissolved in 0.7 ml of 2H2O (99.96%), and spectra were obtained using a UNITY-500 spectrometer at the operating frequency of 500 MHz equipped with a VXR 5000 computer system from Varian Instruments. The operation conditions for one-dimensional spectra were as follows: frequency, 500 MHz; sweep width, 6 kHz; flip angle, 90° (11.1 μs); sampling point, 48 K; accumulation, 256 pulses; temperature, 298 K for oligosaccharides and 333 K for polysaccharides. Quantitative analysis was performed at each temperature with a pulse delay 5 times the longest t1 (5.5 s), estimated from an inversion-recovery experiment. Chemical shifts were indicated by parts per million from the signal of 3-(trimethylsilyl)-d4-propionic acid sodium salt as an internal reference. The water resonance was suppressed by selective irradiation during the relaxation delay. Two-dimensional double quantum-filtered COSY and multiple relayed COSY spectra were recorded using the phase-sensitive mode. All two-dimensional spectra were recorded with 512 × 2048 data points and a spectral width of 3200 Hz. The water resonance was suppressed by selective irradiation during the relaxation delay. A total of 128-256 scans were accumulated for each t1, with a relaxation delay of 2 s. The digital resolution was 1.6 Hz/point in both dimensions with zero-filling in the t1 dimension. A phase-shifted sine function was applied for both t1 and t2 dimensions in the case of double quantum-filtered COSY, and a Lorentz-Gauss function was applied in all other cases. Gradient PAGE was performed on a polyacrylamide linear gradient resolving gel (14 × 16 cm, 12-22% total acrylamide) prepared and run as described previously(22.Al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J. Appl. Theor. Electrophoresis. 1991; 1: 305-312PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular sizes of these oligosaccharide samples were determined by comparing them with a banding ladder of heparin oligosaccharide standards prepared from bovine lung heparin(23.Edens R.E. Al-Hakim A. Weiler J.M. Rethwisch D.G. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 823-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were visualized by Alcian blue staining(22.Al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J. Appl. Theor. Electrophoresis. 1991; 1: 305-312PubMed Google Scholar). The GAG component of the soft body tissue of the giant African snail was isolated by proteolysis of defatted tissue and purified by fractional precipitation. Carbazole assay (19.Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar) of the polysaccharide component showed that it contained uronic acid, and Azure A dye binding assay (24.Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Linhardt R.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1981; 41: 360-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of sulfate groups, consistent with it being a GAG. The Mv of snail GAG showed it to have a molecular weight of 29,000, significantly higher than the values of 12,000 and 15,500 measured for porcine mucosal heparin and heparan sulfate, respectively(12.Griffin C.C. Linhardt R.J. VanGorp C.L. Toida T. Hileman R.E. Schubert R.L. Brown S.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23.Edens R.E. Al-Hakim A. Weiler J.M. Rethwisch D.G. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 823-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The optical rotation [α]D of the snail GAG was +44°. Monosaccharide compositional analysis of the polysaccharide isolated from giant African snail using GC showed it to be composed of 47% IdoAp, 3% GlcAp and 50% GlcNpAc(16.Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The uronic acid component of the original GAG might have been sulfated, since O-sulfoyl groups are labile and lost on acidic methanolysis(25.Linhardt R.J. Ogura H. Hasegawa A. Suami T. Carbohydrates: Synthetic Methods and Applications in Medicinal Chemistry. Kodansha/VCH, Tokyo/Weinheim1992: 385-401Google Scholar). While GlcNp and GlcNp2S residues might have been present in the original polysaccharide and subsequently converted to GlcNpAc following methanolysis and re-N-acetylation, it is well known that the glycosidic linkage to these residues is resistant to acidic methanolysis. Since no disaccharide peaks were observed in the GC chromatogram obtained from the snail GAG (several such peaks are detected in the acidic methanolysis of heparin) these data are consistent with a GAG made up of IdoAp:GlcNpAc at approximately a 1:1 composition. 1H NMR analysis of the intact polysaccharide demonstrated the presence of two anomeric protons having chemical shifts corresponding to the H-1 of GlcNpAcα1→ at δ5.1 and H-1 of IdoAp2Sα1→ at δ5.2, respectively. The H-1 of GlcNpAc is detected at δ5.4 in the spectrum of heparan sulfate(12.Griffin C.C. Linhardt R.J. VanGorp C.L. Toida T. Hileman R.E. Schubert R.L. Brown S.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 276: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The observation of this upfield shift caused on only the anomeric proton of GlcNpAc appeared to be attributable to the unusual sequence GlcNpAcα→IdoAp2S (Fig. 1). Complete assignment of the 1H NMR spectrum of snail GAG were obtained using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2 and Table 1).Figure 2:1H NMR spectrum of snail GAG. Assignment of each signal is shown in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Snail GAG was examined by gradient PAGE with Alcian blue staining (Fig. 3). Intact GAG showed a pattern of discrete banding consistent with a polysaccharide of a relatively homogenous structure with the greatest staining intensity at a degree of polymerization of ∼64 (Fig. 3, lane a) corresponding to a molecular weight of ∼29,000(23.Edens R.E. Al-Hakim A. Weiler J.M. Rethwisch D.G. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 823-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Next, the sensitivity of the snail GAG toward heparin lyases I, II, and III was examined. No degradation when the polysaccharide was treated with heparin lyase I (Fig. 3, lane b), little degradation on treatment with heparin lyase III (Fig. 3, lane d) and substantial degradation on treatment with heparin lyase II (Fig. 3, lane c) was found. Products having a low level of negative charge (<-3) do not stain, so that a disaccharide having a single sulfate group would not be visualized. Analysis of snail GAG treated with heparin lyase II, on Sephadex G-50 (21.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), demonstrated that >90% of the weight of product mixture corresponded to disaccharide. CE analysis confirmed that the polysaccharide was converted by heparin lyase II into a single product (Fig. 4b). This product was prepared in milligram amounts using semipreparative strong anion exchange HPLC (21.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and on CE analysis it co-migrated with a disaccharide standard having the structure, ΔUAp2S(1→4)-D-GlcNpAcα,β. CE analyses also demonstrated that the snail GAG was only very slightly degraded by heparin lyase III and gave no products on treatment with heparin lyase I (Fig. 4). The spectrum of the disaccharide obtained by heparin lyase II treatment of snail GAG confirmed its structure to be ΔUAp2S(1→4)-D-GlcNpAcα,β (Fig. 5 and Table 2), consistent with that reported by Yamada and co-workers(26.Yamada S. Yoshida K. Sugiura M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Figure 4:CE analysis of snail GAG on treatment with heparin lyases. Electropherogram a, heparin lyase I; electropherogram b, heparin lyase II; electropherogram c, heparin lyase III. The peak observed at 11 min in electropherogram b co-migrates with ΔUA2S(1→4)-D-GlcNAc α,β. Intact polysaccharide (control, no heparin lyase treatment (not shown) and electropherogram a) has no chromophore absorbing at 232 nm and shows no peak.

INTRODUCTIONPeroxisomal β-oxidation is an important pathway in mammalian metabolism for catabolizing long and very long chain fatty acids. In many organisms, including yeasts, peroxisomal β-oxidation is the sole mechanism for the breakdown of fatty acids(1.Kunau W.H. Buhne S. De La Garza M. Kionka C. Mateblowski M. Schultz-Borchard U. Thieringer R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in this pathway are regulated according to the growth environment. Expression of genes encoding peroxisomal proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is repressed when the yeast cells are grown in the presence of glucose, derepressed during growth on a nonfermentable carbon source, and activated when a fatty acid such as oleate is supplied for growth(2.Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This control is achieved through stringent transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding these proteins(3.Einerhand A.W.C. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4.Einerhand A.W.C. Kos W.T. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Eur. J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3405-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Over the past several years we have focused our attentions toward understanding the mechanisms that regulate genes encoding peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes in S. cerevisiae. In order to address this question, we have concentrated on the regulation of POX1, the gene encoding acyl-CoA oxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme of this cycle. Previously we characterized two upstream repression sequences (URS1 and URS2) 1The abbreviations used are: URSupstream repressing sequenceUASupstream activating sequencePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)BrdUrdbromo-2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate. and one upstream activating sequence (UAS1) in the promoter region of POX1(7.Wang T.W. Lewin A.S. Small G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9.Wang T. Luo Y. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24480-24485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that a protein or protein complex binds to UAS1 in an oleate-dependent fashion, and this brings about the activation of POX1. A similar UAS sequence (termed oleate response element) was identified in the upstream regions of genes encoding some of the other peroxisomal proteins(3.Einerhand A.W.C. Voorn-Brouwer T.M.

This gene also undergoes regulation when the yeast is grown in glucose or oleate medium. The gene products of ADR1, SNF1, and SNF4 are all known regulators of glucose-repressible genes and have been shown to be positive regulators of FOX3 expression(5.Simon M. Binder M. Adam G. Hartig A. Ruis H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the ADR1 or SNF1 genes appear to have little or no effect on the expression of POX1(11.Stanway C.A. Gibbs J. Berardi E. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting that different and/or additional factors are involved in the regulation of this gene.Having identified some of the DNA elements that serve as binding sites for specific transcription factors involved in POX1 regulation, we have now turned our attentions to characterizing the biochemical properties of these trans-acting proteins. In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to purify and characterize these proteins. Here we describe the purification and molecular identification of a UAS1-binding oleate-activated transcription factor (Oaf1p). We demonstrate that the amount of Oaf1p that binds to UAS1 progressively increases during growth on oleate. Thus, oleic acid is required, either for the induction of Oaf1p itself or for its activation. We have utilized photo-affinity cross-linking to confirm the molecular weight of this protein. Furthermore, we have identified the gene (OAF1) encoding this transcription factor and have demonstrated that POX1 is not induced by oleate in a yeast strain that carries an OAF1 disruption.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains and Culture ConditionsThe S. cerevisiae strains 3A (ura3, trp1, arg4, ctt1)(12.Zhang J.W.

YPG medium contains 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 3% glycerol. YNO was prepared according to Erdmann et al.(15.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Samples were taken at each of the following time points: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 18 h. Band shift experiments were carried out with labeled 80-mer containing the whole UAS1 or with a 184-mer containing URS2 and UAS1 (see (9.Wang T. Luo Y. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24480-24485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for details of DNA sequences). The intensity of the shifted band was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).RNA Purification and Northern AnalysisTotal yeast RNA was isolated using a slight modification of the guanidine thiocyanate procedure as described(16.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D. Seidman G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 10.6.3Google Scholar). The RNA was resolved in a formaldehyde-agarose gel and then transferred to Genescreen Plus nylon membrane (NEN Research products). The membranes were prehybridized for 1 h and then hybridized overnight in the presence of [α-32P]dATP-labeled random-primed probes (106 cpm/ml) at 65°C using standard conditions(17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the filters were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and scanned, and the intensities of the corresponding bands were determined using Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager software (Imagequant).Preparation of a UAS1-Oligonucleotide Affinity ColumnThe oligonucleotides YL1 and YL2 (see Table 1), which contain the upstream palindrome of the POX1 UAS1(9.Wang T.

All further operations were performed at 4°C. An amount of glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) equivalent to half of the cell suspension volume was added, and the cells were disrupted by vortexing for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1.5 h). A saturated solution of ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to give a concentration of 25%. Following a 10-30 min incubation, the precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).The cell extract was then passed through a cation exchange SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were eluted using a linear KCl gradient (0.2-0.7 M prepared in buffer A). Fractions containing the highest amounts of Oaf1p (as judged by specific binding activity in a DNA band shift assay) were pooled and concentrated using a centriprep-10 centricon (Amicon). The concentrate was adjusted to 0.1 M KCl and then loaded onto a calf thymus double-stranded DNA cellulose column. Elution of proteins bound to the column was achieved using a KCl gradient, as above, and fractions with highest levels of Oaf1p activity were again pooled and concentrated. The concentrated fractions were loaded onto a 2-ml UAS1-oligonucleotide affinity column (100 μg DNA/ml Sepharose) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (25 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.25 M KCl. The column was then washed with 30 ml of equilibrating buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0.25-1.0 M in buffer A). Eluted fractions were analyzed in a DNA band shift assay with a labeled DNA fragment containing UAS1. Aliquots of the fractions were also run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and silver-stained by the method described(16.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston E. Moore D. Seidman G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 10.6.3Google Scholar).Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of Tryptic Peptides from Oaf1pThe ≈120-kDa protein was purified from 60 liters of oleate-induced yeast cells by the above procedure. It was resolved from minor contaminants by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was electrotransferred to nitrocellulose in standard Towbin buffer. The portion of the nitrocellulose paper containing the upper band of the doublet at approximately 120 kDa was excised. This portion of the membrane was rinsed with water and stained with 1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid, destained in 5% acetic acid, and processed for tryptic digestion as described initially by Fernandez et al.(19.Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and later modified to bleach the Ponceau S from the protein in the digestion buffer (1% hydrogenated Triton X-100 in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) rather than in a dilute NaOH solution(20.Fernandez J. Gharahdaghi F. Mische S.M. Tech. Prot. Chem. 1995; 6: 135-142Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar); we also omitted the preblocking step that involved polyvinylpyrrolidone. Peptides generated after a 20-h digestion with 1 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim) were resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Hewlett Packard model 1090 binary gradient chromatograph and a Linear Instruments 206PHD UV/Vis spectrophotometer with a 6-μl flow cell; the eluate was monitored at 230, 278, and 295 nm. Peptides were separated using a 2 × 150-mm Hypersil ODS column developed at 0.25 ml/min with a gradient from 2-45% solvent B over 140 min (solvent A: 1.2% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% methanol, 2% acetonitrile in water (w/v/v); solvent B: 0.9% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% methanol, 2% water in acetonitrile (w/v/v)). Fractions of 0.25 ml each were collected and lyophilized to near dryness in a Savant SpeedVac. Fractions were selected for analysis after comparison with a control digest to exclude autolysis products and other nonpeptide peaks on the basis of their absorbance at 278 and 295 nm, which indicate the presence of Tyr and Trp or of Trp alone, respectively. Amino acid sequences of peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation using a Beckman model 2090E gas phase sequencer with on-line PTH-derivative identification using minor modifications of the manufacturer's programs.PCR Amplification of the Gene Encoding Oaf1pIn order to obtain a DNA fragment encoding the 118.2-kDa putative transcription factor, we designed oligonucleotides YL3 and YL4 (see Table 1), which were complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA sequence obtained from the GenBank(™) data base. These oligonucleotides were used in a PCR amplification with genomic DNA isolated from S. cerevisiae strain W3031A.Disruption of the OAF1 GeneTo confirm that the cloned gene encodes the purified UAS1-binding protein, we disrupted the genomic copy of this gene using a one-step gene disruption procedure(21.Rothstein R. Wu R. Grossman L. Moldave K. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1983: 202-213Google Scholar). The DNA product obtained from the PCR amplification described above was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and a 1.3-kb SphI fragment, containing part of the open reading frame, was excised. The ends of the plasmid were rendered blunt with T4 DNA polymerase, and a 1.8-kb SmaI-HincII fragment containing the HIS3 gene was inserted. The 3.8-kb OAF1::HIS3 insert was then excised and introduced into S. cerevisiae W3031A, which had previously been transformed with a plasmid (pPOXlz) containing the lacZ reporter gene under control of the POX1 promoter.UV Cross-linking in a Gel SupportThe complementary regions of oligonucleotides YL2 and YL5 (see Table 1) containing the upstream palindrome of POX1 UAS1 were annealed, and the noncomplementary, overhanging regions were filled in with [32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment and substituting bromo-2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdUrd) for thymidine in order to increase the cross-linking efficiency(22.Wu C. Wilson S. Walker B. Dawid I. Paisley T. Zimarino V. Ueda H. Science. 1989; 238: 1247-1253Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). 1 μl of the labeled DNA (approximately 10,000 cpm) was incubated with 4 μl of a fraction containing UAS1 binding activity eluted from an SP cation exchange column or the UAS1 affinity column (see above) in the presence of 1 μg of a competitor DNA, poly(dI•dC). The mixture was separated in a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. For experiments using a mutated version of the upstream palindrome of UAS1 as nonlabeled competitor DNA, oligonucleotides YL6 and YL7 (Table 1) were annealed. Following electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to UV radiation (3000 uw/cm2) for 5 min at 4°C and was then exposed to film for 1 h. The shifted band due to the formation of a specific protein-DNA complex was located by lining up the gel with the film, and the gel slice in this region was excised. The gel slice was then incubated with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer (120 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% sucrose, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 20 mM dithiothreitol) for 15 min at 68°C, loaded into the well of an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed for 2 h at 150 volts. The gel was subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography.UV Cross-linking in SolutionA binding mixture that contained 10 μl of binding buffer, 5 μl of the fraction with highest UAS1 binding activity eluted from an SP cation exchange column (described above), 1 μl of a uniformly labeled UAS1-DNA fragment (prepared as described above), and 2 μg of competitor poly(dI•dC) was prepared. This solution was directly exposed to UV radiation (3000 uw/cm2) for 7 min. The sample was treated with DNase I (2 units) for 20 min at 37°C. SDS sample buffer was then added to the DNase-treated sample, and the sample was boiled for 5 min and then electrophoresed through an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.Other MethodsDNA band shift, protein, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (9.Wang T. Luo Y. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24480-24485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSOaf1p Binding as a Function of Growth in Oleate MediumWe wished to determine the kinetics of Oaf1p activation and whether Oaf1p-UAS1 binding activity could be detected immediately when cells were shifted from glucose to oleate medium. To this end, we carried out a time course study to determine the level of UAS1 binding of Oaf1p. We carried out a DNA band shift experiment with cell extracts from each time point. These experiments were performed either with a 184-mer, which contains both URS2 and UAS1 (Fig. 1a), or an 80-mer, which contains UAS1 alone (Fig. 1b), as DNA probes (see (9.Wang T. Luo Y. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24480-24485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for details of upsteam elements). The band shift caused by protein binding to UAS1 was of low intensity at the 2-h time point (Fig. 1a, C2), suggesting that Oaf1p binding activity was low. However, a band shift with high intensity due to a protein binding to URS2 was observed after 2 h (Fig. 1a, C1). Thus, the protein that binds to this repressive element appears to be abundant. During the 18-h induction period, the amount of Oaf1p binding to UAS1 gradually increased (the intensity of the band shift increased 8-fold over 18 h), whereas the intensity of the band caused by protein binding to URS2 approximately doubled after 4 h and then remained fairly constant (2.8-fold increase over 18 h). The time-dependent increase in Oaf1p binding occurred irrespective of whether the 184-mer, containing both URS and UAS1 elements (Fig. 1a), or the 80-mer, containing the UAS1 alone (Fig. 1b), were used in the assay. Furthermore, in both cases the maximal increase was approximately 8-fold, and no further increase was detected when the time course was carried out for longer periods of up to 24 h (data not shown). These results suggest that either the expression of Oaf1p itself is induced by oleate or that activation of Oaf1p occurs in the presence of oleate, thus enabling it to bind to UAS1.Figure 1:DNA band shift assays carried out with extracts from cells grown in oleate medium for 0-18 h. a, the band shift assay was carried out with 30 μg of cell extract and a 184-nucleotide 32P-labeled DNA fragment that contains URS2 and UAS1. b, the assays were carried out as for a except that the DNA used was an 80-mer containing UAS1. C1 refers to the complex formed by protein binding to URS2, and C2 refers to the complex formed when Oaf1p binds to UAS1. The intensity of the shifted bands was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Temporal Induction of POX1 ExpressionWe wished to determine if the kinetics of POX1 induction correlated with the binding of Oaf1p to UAS1. For this purpose we used strain Pp13570, which contains the lacZ gene under the control of the POX1 promoter(9.Wang T. Luo Y. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24480-24485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for the time course study shown in Fig. 1. Thus, we could measure the expression of POX1 and the activity of β-galactosidase driven by the POX1 promoter. Total RNA was isolated at various time points, and the abundance of POX1 message was analyzed by Northern blot using a DNA probe consisting of the coding region of POX1. The relative abundance of POX1 message was quantified by normalizing the mRNA levels to those of phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK1) for each time point. This analysis revealed an intriguing pattern of expression. The POX1 transcript was not detectable in glucose-grown cells but was rapidly induced following the shift to oleate medium (Fig. 2a). The expression increased rapidly during the first 2-4 h following the switch to oleate medium, after which the level slowly declined up until the 12-h time point. However, at 14 and 18 h the level of POX1 message was increased (Fig. 2, a and b). This fluctuation was not due to unequal loading of the gel as determined by ethidium bromide-staining of the agarose gel (data not shown), and the pattern in POX1 expression was the same whether compared with that of PGK1 (Fig. 2) or with actin (ACT1, data not shown). As a second, independent method to quantify induction of POX1, we measured the POX1 promoter-dependent expression of β-galactosidase in samples of cell extracts taken at each time point. The activity followed a similar pattern to that of POX1 expression in that the β-galactosidase activity reached a maximum value at 6-8 h of induction (Fig. 2b). The activity decreased at the 12-h time point; however, by 18 h the activity increased slightly. Whether these fluctuations are caused by protein and/or mRNA degradation or due to transcriptional control is unclear.Figure 2:Temporal expression of POX1 in cells switched from glucose to oleate medium. a, Northern blot analysis of POX1 and PGK1 mRNA isolated from cells grown for 8 h in YPD and then transferred to YPGO and grown for the number of hours indicated. b, the mRNA levels shown in a were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, and the relative POX1 mRNA abundance was normalized to the level of PGK1 mRNA. POX1 promoter-dependent β-galactosidase activities were also measured in extracts prepared from the same cells used in a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purification of the UAS1-binding ProteinPOX1 expression is activated in yeast cells grown in YPGO medium. By means of DNA band shift analysis, we have shown that this induction corresponds with the binding of a protein or proteins to a specific sequence, designated UAS1, in the POX1 promoter. As a first step toward understanding the mechanisms by which activation of this POX1 UAS1 element mediates oleate-specific induction of this gene, we purified a protein that binds to this regulatory element. Details of the purification protocol are given under “Materials and Methods.” As one of the purification steps, we carried out double-stranded calf thymus DNA cellulose chromatography. The absorbance and Oaf1p activity profiles of fractions eluted from this DNA cellulose column are shown in Fig. 3a. We estimate that we recovered approximately 30% of the UAS1-binding protein during this step of the purification (Table 2). Oaf1p DNA binding activity was followed by performing a DNA band shift assay with alternate fractions, and the highest activity was recovered in fractions 6-10 (Fig. 3b, lanes 5-7).Figure 3:Elution profile of Oaf1p obtained by thymus DNA cellulose chromatography. a, protein and DNA binding activity profile. The protein concentration of alternate fractions eluted from a thymus-DNA column were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Oaf1p activity was measured by performing a DNA band shift assay with 1 μl of alternate fractions and quantitating the radioactivity in the shifted band using a PhosphorImager. b, elution profile of the double-stranded thymus DNA cellulose column as detected by a DNA band shift assay carried out with 1 μl out of a total of 40 ml of column loading sample (lane 1), 1 μl of flow-through (lane 2), and 1 μl of alternate fractions (1.3 ml each) eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0.2-0.7 M) and 10 fmol of labeled annealed UAS oligonucleotides (lanes 3-14).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1Fractions 6-10 from the DNA cellulose column were concentrated and loaded onto a UAS1 affinity column. The bulk of the nonspecific proteins did not bind to this column, and Oaf1p DNA binding activity was eluted at a KCl concentration between 0.4-0.6 M in fractions 4-10 (Fig. 4a, lanes 6-9). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fractions eluted from the affinity column revealed by silver staining protein bands that appear to consist of a doublet, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 110-120 kDa (Fig. 4b, lanes 7-9). We were unable to detect Oaf1p in fraction 4 by silver staining, even though we found DNA binding activity in this fraction (compare Fig. 4, a and b). The reason for this is not clear; however, much less protein sample was used in the DNA band shift assay than was loaded onto the SDS gel (1 μl compared with 20 μl). Thus, it is possible that the discrepancy is due to experimental error if a volume slightly greater than 1 μl was inadvertently added to the band shift assay. Nevertheless, the strongest silver-stained band was recovered in fraction 8, which was also the fraction with the greatest DNA binding activity. The protein concentration of these fractions was too low to measure by standard techniques, thus we are unable to give accurate and specific recoveries for this step of the purification. However, by comparing the intensity of the bands on the silver-stained gel with that of a known concentration of protein from the molecular weight standards and from the band shift assays, we estimate that approximately 7% of the Oaf1p from the original lysate was recovered following affinity chromatography. This gave approximately an 18,000-fold purification (Table 2).Figure 4:Elution profile of Oaf1p from a UAS affinity column. a, DNA band shift assays were carried out with 10 fmol of labeled annealed UAS-oligonucleotides and 1 μl of each of the following: starting sample (concentrated samples eluted from the thymus DNA column) (lane 1), flow-through (lane 2), 0.25 M KCl wash (lanes 3 and 4), and alternate fractions eluted from the UAS affinity column by a linear KCl gradient (0.25-1.0 M KCl) (lanes 5-12). b, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein components in fractions eluted from the affinity column. 20 μl"

According to this strategy we tentatively engineered a new curaremimetic molecule by transferring the functional central loop of a snake toxin, sequence 26-37, sandwiched between two hairpins, onto the structurally similar β-hairpin of the scorpion toxin charybdotoxin, stabilized by a short helix. The resulting chimeric molecule, only 31 amino acids long, was produced by solid phase synthesis, refolded, and purified to homogeneity. As shown by structural analysis performed by CD and NMR spectroscopy, the chimera maintained the expected α/β fold characteristic of scorpion toxins and presented a remarkable structural stability. The chimera competitively displaces the snake curaremimetic toxin α from the acetylcholine receptor at 10-5M concentrations. Antibodies, elicited in rabbits against the chimera, recognize the parent snake toxin and prevent its binding to the acetylcholine receptor, thus neutralizing its toxic function. All these data demonstrate that the strategy of active site transfer to the charybdotoxin scaffold has general applications in the engineering of novel ligands for membrane receptors and in vaccine design.

Genuine successes in the generation of functionally useful novel proteins, however, have been obtained by a more conservative approach which exploits the structure of some natural proteins as appropriate structural scaffolds and manipulates surface loops and insert new functional sequences in permissive regions. As an illustration of this strategy, a human-mouse chimera was obtained by the transfer of the complementarity-determining regions of a mouse antibody into the corresponding one of a human myeloma protein, with concomitant reproduction of antibody specificity into the human protein (11.Jones P.T.

Recently, we proposed the small disulfide-stabilized structure of the scorpion charybdotoxin as a basic scaffold, able to present guest sequences in a defined and well ordered conformation as a means to engineer novel proteins(22.Vita C. Roumestand C. Toma F. Ménez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6404-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The scorpion toxin structure (Fig. 1), containing only 37 amino acids, consists of a short α-helix and a triple stranded β-sheet, with three disulfide bridges forming most of the interior core. This structural motif is common to all scorpion toxins, irrespective of whether they contain 60-65 amino acids, as in long scorpion toxins, active on Na+ channels or contain 30-40 amino acids, as in short scorpion toxins, active on K+ channels and Cl- channels(23.Bontems F.

Science. 1991; 254: 1521-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The same structural motif is also present in insect defensins(24.Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Ménez A. Toma F. Science. 1991; 254: 1521-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), expressing antimicrobial activity through membrane permeabilization and in plant γ-thionins(25.Bruix M. Jiménez M.A. Santoro J. Gonzàlez C. Colilla F.J. Méndez E. Rico M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The only amino acid residues common to all these proteins are the six cysteines forming the three disulfide bridges(23.Bontems F. Roumestand C. Boyot P. Gilquin B. Doljanski Y. Ménez A. Toma F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24.Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Ménez A. Toma F. Science. 1991; 254: 1521-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This simple, compact, and well organized structural motif seems to have been naturally selected for its high sequence permissiveness (as shown by its compatibility with hundreds of different sequences from scorpion toxins and insect defensins) and functional versatility (as shown by its compatibility with Na+, K+, Cl- channel blockage activity in scorpion toxins and antibacterial activity in defensins). A major difference of this structural scaffold from the previously reported ones is that a large part of its molecular surface might be substituted by a novel sequence and not just the exposed loops. On the basis of these considerations, we thought that it was possible to artificially engineer many more functions on this fold than those that are naturally selected. Thus, by transferring the carbonic anhydrase metal binding site into the β-sheet of the scorpion scaffold, we engineered a new metal binding activity with affinity and selectivity for transition metals(22.Vita C. Roumestand C. Toma F. Ménez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6404-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

Snake venom contains toxins that bind to the AchoR at the postsynapic membranes of skeletal muscle, thus provoking flaccid paralysis. This activity is similar to that shown by the alcaloid curare and is of potential clinical interest in anesthesia. Curaremimetic neurotoxins constitute a family of proteins with a high sequence similarity that present a similar overall folding, consisting of three adjacent loops forming a β-pleated sheet, which emerge from a globular core containing four conserved disulfides(26.Ménez A.

These residues define a continuous surface, forming the curaremimetic site of snake neurotoxins, centered around the central loop (residues 26-37) of the concave face of the β-sheet platform, containing six of the ten most “active” residues. Toxin α, from the venom of Naja nigricollis, has high sequence similarity and the same residues in the concave side of the central loop as erabutoxin a, besides the substitution His33→ Phe. Its three-dimensional structure (Fig. 1) has been recently solved on the basis of NMR data (27.Zinn-Justin S. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Bontems F. Ménez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11335-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be highly similar to the crystal structure of erabutoxin a(30.Corfield P.W.R. Lee T.J. Low B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9239-9242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutational studies of curaremimetic toxins suggest that being able to fix the sequence of the central loop of toxin α in its native conformation should result in a molecule possessing some affinity for AchoR. On the basis of a backbone structural similarity between the loop sequence 26-37 of toxin α and the β-hairpin 25-36 of the charybdotoxin structure, we transferred the snake sequence into the scorpion framework. The newly designed chimeric protein was produced by solid phase synthesis. Its structure was analyzed by CD and NMR spectroscopy. Its function was investigated by competitive binding to AchoR and by analyzing the specificity of the antibodies produced by immunization of this chimeric construction in rabbits. Solvents and reagents for peptide synthesis were obtained from SDS (Peypin, France) and Nova Biochem, respectively. Oxidized and reduced glutathione, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma Toxin α, from Naja nigricollis, was purified as described previously(31.Eaker D. Porath J. J. Microbiol. 1967; 11: 353-355Google Scholar). Charybdotoxin (synthetic) was obtained as published(32.Vita C. Bontems F. Bouet F. Tauc M. Poujeol P. Vatanpour H. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. Toma F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Denatured chimera, used in binding assays, was obtained by carboxymethylation (33.Waxdal M.J. Konigsberg W.H. Henley W.L. Edelman G.M. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) of the six cysteines after disulfide reduction of the chimera and purified by HPLC. Other chemicals were of the highest grade available. Peptide synthesis was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer, starting from 0.25 mmol of Rink-resin (4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenylhydroxymethylphenoxy resin, 0.48 mmol/g; Nova Biochem). Four-fold excess (1 mmol) of Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected-amino acids (Nova Biochem) was used and coupled in N-methylpyrrolidone in the presence of 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (34.Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Gillessen D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 35.Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously(36.Pierret B. Virelizier H. Vita C. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Single coupling was used throughout, except for the first 10 cycles which were doubled. The following side chain protections were used: t-butyl ether for Ser, Thr, and Tyr; t-butyl ester for Glu and Asp; trityl for Cys, His, Asn, and Gln; 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchromane-6-sulfonyl for Arg; and t-butoxycarbonyl for Lys. The peptide was simultaneously cleaved from the resin and deprotected by treatment (500 mg of resin/50 ml) with 82.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% H2O, 5% phenol, 5% thioanisole, 2.5% ethanedithiol (Reagent K) (37.King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The resin was filtered, and the solution was added dropwise to cold methyl-t-butyl ether in order to precipitate the peptide; after 10 min centrifugation at 6000 rpm the peptide pellet was resuspended in methyl-t-butyl ether and the process repeated three times. The final pellet was dissolved in 20% acetic acid and lyophilized. The crude peptide (50 mg) was dissolved in water (5 ml) and then added to the oxidizing buffer (500 ml), consisting of 0.05 M sodium phosphate, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 × 10-4M reduced glutathione, and 5 × 10-4M oxidized glutathione, pH 7.8. After 2 h at room temperature the solution was acidified to pH 3.0 with acetic acid and then directly applied to an Aquapore RP 300 column (25 × 1 cm), at 3 ml/min flow rate. The peptide was then eluted at 6 ml/min with a 30-min 12-33% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing the correct oxidized peptide were analyzed by analytical HPLC; single peak fractions were pooled and lyophilized; impure fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and purified on a Vydac C18 column (25 × 1 cm) by using a 40-min 15-25% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Analytical HPLC was carried out on a Spectra-Physics system formed by a P2000 pump, UV2000 detector, and CromJet recorder. Preparative HPLC was carried out on a Merck-Hitachi system, consisting of an L6200 pump, L4000 UV detector, and D-2500 integrator. For amino acid analysis, peptide samples (50 μg) were hydrolyzed in ultrapure 6 N HCl for 16 h at 120°C in sealed evacuated tubes. The hydrolysates were then analyzed on an Applied Biosystems model 130A automatic analyzer equipped with an on-line model 420A derivatizer for the conversion of the free amino acids into their phenylthiocarbamoyl derivatives. Mass analysis was performed in a Nermag R10-10 mass spectrometer, coupled to an Analitica of Branford electrospray source. The quadrupole was scanning over the range m/z 300-2000. A HP-ChemStation software (Hewlett-Packard) was used to drive the spectrometer and to acquire the data. For peptide mapping, the folded oxidized purified product (70 μg), dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1 M Tris•HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mM iodoacetamide (to prevent disulfide scrambling) was digested for 15 h at 30°C with a mixture of trypsin (3 μg) and chymotrypsin (3 μg). Digest was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm) using a 30-min linear gradient of 1-25% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 214 nm. Peaks were collected, lyophilized and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Peptide concentrations were determined by 280 nm absorbance readings by using a molar extinction coefficient of 11,740, calculated on the basis of the known amino acid content(38.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were obtained with a Jobin-Yvon CD6 dichrograph, driven by an IBM-PC operating with a CD6 data acquisition and manipulation program. Spectra were run at 20°C in 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and from 180 to 255 nm, with a 0.1-cm quartz cell and a protein concentration 1.5-2.0 × 10-5M; from 250 to 320 nm with a 1.0-cm quartz cell and a 1.0-1.5 × 10-4M protein concentration. For the NMR experiments, 9 mg of protein were dissolved in 0.4 ml of solvent so that the final concentration was 7 mM. The solvents used were either a mixture of 95% (v/v) H2O and 5% (v/v) D2O at pH 3.5 or 100% D2O at pD 3.5. Chemical shifts were measured relative to 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,2,3,3-2H4)propionate. Proton two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz with a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer. Spin system identification was achieved using COSY(39.Aue W.P. Bartholi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), DQF-COSY(40.Rance M. Sorensen O. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar), TOCSY(41.Davies D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), and NOESY (42.Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) spectra recorded at two temperatures (20 and 30°C). 273 distance restraints were obtained from the volume integration of NOESY cross-peaks. 23 angle restraints were defined from the analysis of the COSY and DQF-COSY spectra. 18 three-dimensional solution structures consistent with the distance and angle restraints were calculated using a hybrid DIANA/X-PLOR protocol(43.Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 44.Br ü nger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven and London1992Google Scholar). A final minimization of the structures was carried out in a force field derived from CHARMM22 (file parallh22x.pro and topallh22x.pro in X-PLOR 3.1). All the structures were displayed, analyzed, and compared on a Silicon Graphics 4D/25 station using the SYBYL package (Tripos Associates, Inc.). Binding of the chimera to AchoR was performed by competitive inhibition of labeled toxin α binding to microtiter plates, coated with AchoR according to the published procedure(45.Leonetti M. Pillet L. Maillere B. Lamthanh H. Frachon P. Couderc J. Ménez A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4214-4221PubMed Google Scholar). Torpedo marmorata electric organ membrane fragments were prepared according to standard procedures(46.Bougis P.E. Marchot P. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7235-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and acetylcholine receptor was solubilized as described previously(47.Sobel A. Heidmann T. Carteaud J. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 96-Well microtiter plates (Maxisorb, Nunc) were coated with 100 μl of solubilized receptor at a concentration of 2 μg/well in 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, for one night at 4°C and saturated with 200 μl of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M sodium chloride and 0.3% bovine serum albumin (PBSA) for 2 h at room temperature. Soluble inhibitors were diluted in 50 μl of the saturating solution and were titrated into the wells. Starting concentrations ranged from 10-7M for the native toxin to 10-4M for the chimera and the denatured chimera. A constant dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated toxin α (45.Leonetti M. Pillet L. Maillere B. Lamthanh H. Frachon P. Couderc J. Ménez A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4214-4221PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 μl was then added to the wells. This dilution corresponded to 50% binding in direct binding assays. The plate was then incubated for either 4 h at 20 or 24 h, 48 h at 4°C. After washing five times with 0.1 M Tris•HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Tween 20, the binding of HRP toxin α was detected by using the substrate 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS, Pierce) and by measuring the absorbance at 414 nm, after 30-min incubation. Inhibition of binding of labeled toxin α to AchoR was expressed as the concentration of the inhibitor giving 50% inhibition of binding (IC50). Antibodies directed against the chimeric construction were obtained by immunizing, subcutaneously and at multiple sites, two rabbits (blanc du Bouscat, Wiss) with 200 μg of chimera in complete Freund's adjuvants. Rabbits were reimmunized three times in incomplete Freund's adjuvants with the same quantity of peptide at 21-day interval. Animals were bled 15 days after each boosting, and their sera were tested for specific antibody production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Elicited antibodies were titrated against either the chimera and toxin α, coated on microtiter plates (1.0 and 0.1 μg/well, respectively). After overnight incubation at 4°C, wells were then saturated with PBSA (saturating buffer), 100 μl of rabbit antiserum, diluted 1/50 in saturating buffer, were added to the well (serially diluted 1/3) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, 100 μl of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP (Sigma), diluted 1/6000, was added to each well for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected as above using ABTS as substrate. Pooled anti-chimera sera were purified by affinity chromatography through a toxin α-Sepharose 4B column (3.5 × 1 cm), prepared by coupling the toxin α (4.0 mg) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (1.0 g; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Relative affinities of the purified antibodies for the chimera and native toxin α were tested by competitive inhibition ELISA. These tests were performed by coating the purified anti-chimera antibodies into the wells (0.5 μg/well) and, after saturation and washing, by titrating the soluble antigens (50 μl) into the wells. Starting concentrations were 10-6M for chimera and toxin α and 10-5M for the denatured chimera. A constant dilution (corresponding to 50% binding in direct binding assays) of HRP-toxin α in 50 μl was then added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing the bound HRP-toxin α was detected as described above. Antibody neutralization of toxin α binding to AchoR was performed by using anti-chimera antibodies. Microtiter plates were coated with solubilized AchoR as described above. Serial dilutions of 50 μl of either the affinity-purified anti-chimera antibodies or the monoclonal antibodies Mα2-3(48.Trémeau O. Boulain J.-C. Couderc J. Fromageot P. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or M14-1-1(49.Ozato K. Mayer N. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 533-543PubMed Google Scholar) were added to the wells. The starting concentration for all three antibodies was 5 × 10-7M. A constant dilution of HRP-toxin α in 50 μl was then added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Bound HRP-toxin α was detected as described above. The specificity of the binding of anti-chimera antibodies to toxin α was tested by incubating the antibodies with 10-6M chimera 2 h before adding the HRP-toxin α conjugate. Mutagenesis experiments (28.Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol.

The structure of this loop in toxin α, residues 26-37, was taken as the reference model for the curaremimetic site (Fig. 1). This loop has the conformation of a β-hairpin, formed by the β-strand 26-29, the β-turn 30-33 followed by the β-strand 34-37. Charybdotoxin, the structural scaffold, presents a β-hairpin in position 25-36 (Fig. 1B). Superposition of the snake β-hairpin (sequence 26-37 of toxin α) to the scorpion β-hairpin (sequence 25-36 of charybdotoxin) results in a good fitting with a calculated 1.1 Å root mean square difference for the backbone atoms, suggesting that the β-hairpin sequence may be transferred from one protein to the other, with little perturbation of the guest original conformation and the host overall fold. However, structure superposition and sequence alignment (Fig. 2) show that Val27, Arg29, Thr34, and Ile36 of toxin α correspond to the structurally important(23.Bontems F. Roumestand C. Boyot P.

Jupiter's inner radiation region had extremely large fluxes of energetic electrons and protons; intensities peaked at approximately2.2RJ (where RJ is the radius of Jupiter). Absorption of the measured particles was found near the outer edge of the bright dust ring. The instrument measured intense fluxes of high-energy helium ions (approximately62 megaelectron volts per nucleon) that peaked at approximately1.5RJ inside the bright dust ring. The abundances of all particle species decreased sharply at approximately1.35RJ; this decrease defines the innermost edge of the equatorial jovian radiation.

Plasma levels of apoB, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein triglycerides were increased, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were decreased in the transgenic mice, compared with nontransgenic littermate controls. Although p649 contained 33 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 11 kb of 3′-flanking sequences, the tissue pattern of transgene expression was different from that of the endogenous apoB gene. RNA slot blots and RNase protection analysis indicated that the transgene was expressed in the liver but not in the intestine, whereas the endogenous apoB gene was expressed in both tissues. To confirm the absence of transgene expression in the intestine, the mouse apoB transgenic mice were mated with the apoB knockout mice, and transgenic mice that were homozygous for the apoB knockout mutation were obtained. Because of the absence of transgene expression in the intestine, those mice lacked all intestinal apoB synthesis, resulting in a marked accumulation of fats within the intestinal villus enterocytes. The current studies, along with prior studies of human apoB transgenic animals, strongly suggest that the DNA sequence element(s) controlling intestinal expression of the apoB gene is located many kilobases from the structural gene.

A. 1994; 91: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These mice were generated with a P1 bacteriophage clone that spanned the entire human apoB gene. The human apoB transgenic mice displayed several noteworthy features that posed questions for subsequent studies. First, the tissue pattern of transgene expression was decidedly abnormal. In multiple lines of mice, the human apoB transgene was expressed at high levels in the liver, but expression was undetectable in the intestine(3.Young S.G. Farese Jr., R.V. Pierotti V.R. Taylor S. Grass D.S. Linton M.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 4.Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L.

This finding was surprising in view of the fact that the 80-kb transgene contained rather extensive flanking sequences 19 kb 5′ from the transcriptional start site and 17.5 kb 3′ from the translation termination codon. One possible explanation for absent transgene expression in the intestine was that the intestinal tissue-specific regulatory element was located so far from the structural gene that it simply was not contained within the 80-kb transgene. However, other potential explanations existed. One possibility was that the human intestinal element was located within the 80-kb fragment but that it was not recognized by the mouse transcriptional machinery. An obvious means of testing the latter possibility would be to analyze transgene expression patterns in mice generated with a P1 clone spanning the mouse apoB gene. apolipoprotein B mouse apoB transgene human apoB transgene fast phase liquid chromatography hemizygous for the mouse apoB transgene hemizygous for the human apoB transgene high density lipoproteins low density lipoproteins glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase kilobase(s) base pair(s). A second issue that arose during the study of the human apoB transgenic mice was the finding of the high levels of triglyceride-rich low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the plasma of the mice(1.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although we were initially tempted to ascribe the high levels of LDL to apoB overproduction by the liver, another potential explanation existed. Human apoB100 binds to the mouse LDL receptor with very low affinity, compared with mouse LDL(5.Corsini A. Mazzotti M. Villa A. Maggi F.M. Bernini F. Romano L. Romano C. Fumagalli R. Catapano A.L. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 93: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), so it is possible that the increased LDL levels could have been due, in large part, to defective clearance of the human LDL from the plasma. Indeed, this issue raised serious doubts as to whether transgenic expression of human apoB, with its defective binding to the mouse LDL receptor, could yield an accurate portrayal of the phenotype of apoB overproduction by the liver. An obvious way to obtain an accurate view of the phenotype of hepatic apoB overproduction was to develop and characterize transgenic mice that overexpress mouse apoB. To address the issues posed by the human apoB transgenic mice, we obtained a P1 clone spanning the mouse apoB gene and used that clone to develop transgenic mice that expressed high levels of mouse apoB. A P1 bacteriophage mouse genomic library made from Mus musculus (strain RIII) genomic DNA was screened for clones containing the mouse apoB gene (a service of Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Two pairs of polymerase chain reactions were used for screening. Oligonucleotides Mus5-5 (5′-AGCTTTCTTCCATGACTGGCGCTG-3′) and Mus5-3 (5′-GATTGCAGAGCTTTCTATTGTGGC-3′) were used to amplify a 448-bp fragment located between −582 and −135 bp 5′ of the apoB transcriptional start site. Oligonucleotides Mus3-5 (5′-GATTGCAGAGCTTTCTATTGTGGC-3′) and Mus3-3 (5′-ATCATCAGCTCTCCTTGAGCAAGC-3′) were used to amplify a 294-bp fragment starting 8 bp upstream from the apoB translation termination codon. A single clone, designated p649, yielded positive polymerase chain reactions with both pairs of primers. The clone was mapped by standard restriction analysis and Southern blots, using both P1 vector probes (see probes A and B in Fig. 1) and mouse apoB gene probes (probes C and D). To prepare p649 DNA for microinjection, plasmid DNA was isolated from Escherichia coli strain NS3529 (6.McCormick S.P.A. Linton M.F. Young S.G. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1994; 11: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and cleaved with MluI. A 95-kb MluI fragment containing the entire 87-kb insert and ∼8 kb of P1 vector sequences (∼2200 bp 5′ and ∼5800 bp 3′) was purified from a pulsed-field agarose gel and dialyzed against a microinjection buffer(6.McCormick S.P.A. Linton M.F. Young S.G. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1994; 11: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After adjusting the DNA concentration to 3 ng/μl, the DNA was microinjected into F2 murine zygotes (C57BL/6J × SJL), both at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and at DNX Transgenics. Transgenic animals were identified by Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested tail DNA using P1 vector probes A and B (see Fig. 1). Six transgenic founders were identified; two of the founders (6690 and 6691, both males) had increased levels of mouse apoB in the plasma, as judged by Western blots of agarose gels probed with a 125I-labeled antibody to rat apoB(1.Linton M.F.

Founders 6690 and 6691 were mated with C57BL/6J mice, and F1 transgenic offspring (genotype MBTg+/0) were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA and by agarose gel electrophoresis of plasma samples. In initial experiments, founder animals 6690 and 6691 appeared to have a similar increase in the plasma apoB levels, compared with nontransgenic mice. We arbitrarily used the progeny from founder 6691 for most lipoprotein analyses since we initially obtained more F1 animals from that line. After obtaining additional F1 animals from line 6690, we studied those animals in greater detail. Those studies revealed that the F1 animals from line 6690 actually had 2-fold more plasma apoB than F1 animals from line 6691. Accordingly, some of the subsequent experiments used mice from transgenic line 6690. For all experiments, nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. Founder 6691 was mated to mice heterozygous for an apoB knockout mutation (7.Farese Jr., R.V. Ruland S.L. Flynn L.M. Stokowski R.P. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1774-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) to generate mouse apoB transgenic mice that were heterozygous for the knockout mutation. Those mice were intercrossed to generate mouse apoB transgenic mice that were homozygous for the knockout mutation (genotypes MBTg+/+,apoB-/- or MBTg+/0,apoB-/-). Mice that were homozygous for the knockout mutation were detected by demonstrating a “double dose” of the neo gene (inserted into the apoB locus in the knockout mice), as compared with the “single dose” of neo in mice heterozygous for the knockout mutation. For these studies, tail DNA was digested with HindIII, and Southern blots were probed simultaneously with a neo probe and a cDNA probe for the α-tocopherol transport protein(8.Sato Y. Arai H. Miyata A. Tokita S. Yamamoto K. Tanabe T. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17705-17710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of the neo signal relative to the α-tocopherol transport protein signal was assessed using a Phosphorimager (Fuji Bio-Imaging Analyzer, BAS 1000 with MacBAS, Fuji Medical Systems, USA, Inc., Stamford, CT). To determine transgene copy number, tail DNA from F1 transgenic mice (line 6690) and nontransgenic littermates was digested with EcoRI, and Southern blots were performed using probe D (see Fig. 1). Transgene copy number was determined using a Phosphorimager, based on the amount of radioactivity in the apoB band on the Southern blot. To determine whether intact copies of the 87-kb transgene had been incorporated into the mouse genome, Southern blot analysis was performed using NruI-cleaved, high molecular weight DNA from F1 mice of transgenic lines 6690 and 6691. The strategy was to identify an 88-kb NruI fragment within the genomic DNA. Both of the NruI sites are located within the 95-kb MluI fragment (see Fig. 1). Liver cell suspensions were prepared from transgenic and nontransgenic mice, and the cells were embedded and DNA prepared in agarose plugs(9.Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Huxley C. Josephson B.M. Haugen H.S. Furukawa T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7593-7597Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The plugs were digested with NruI, and the DNA was size-fractionated on a pulsed-field 1% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) at 6 V/cm for 15.16 h at 14°C, with initial and final switching times of 0.22 and 21.79 s, respectively. The gel was blotted onto a nylon membrane, and the membrane was hybridized to probe D (see Fig. 1). Six-week-old F1 transgenic offspring from founder 6691 (and nontransgenic littermate controls) were sacrificed, and total cellular RNA was prepared from liver and intestine (duodenum) using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Three amounts of RNA (0.25, 1.0, and 4.0 μg) were loaded onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a slot-blot apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH), and the membrane was hybridized to a probe containing sequences from exon 25 of the mouse apoB gene (probe D in Fig. 1) as well as a probe for mouse glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (to control for the amount of RNA bound to the membrane). The intensity of the apoB signal, relative to the GAPDH signal, was assessed using a phosphorimager. For the RNase protection assays, total RNA was isolated from liver and intestine (duodenum) of F1 mice from lines 6690 and 6691 by homogenization in guanidine isothiocyanate (10.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar) using the RNAzol(™) method (Tel-test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). A 245-bp antisense RNA transcript was prepared with XbaI-linearized plasmid pBSmB245 and T7 RNA polymerase, using the MAXIscript(™) In Vitro transcription Kit (Ambion). Plasmid pBSmB245 contains a XbaI/MscI fragment from the 5′ portion of exon 26 of the mouse apoB gene. The RNase protection assay was performed using the RPA II Ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion). The samples were electrophoresed on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography and with the phosphorimager. To determine the molecular basis of the exon 26 DNA polymorphism in the transgene, a 399-bp segment of the 5′ portion of exon 26 of the mouse apoB gene (exon 26 nucleotides 1-399) was enzymatically amplified, both from p649 and from genomic DNA from nontransgenic mice. The 399-bp DNA fragments were cloned into the TA3 PCR vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer (Foster City, CA). Mouse LDL (d = 1.006-1.063 g/ml) were prepared by ultracentrifugation (11.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6480) Google Scholar). The LDL (3 ml) were mixed with 6 ml of sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2% sodium deoxycholate), and protease inhibitors (aprotinin (final concentration, 100 KI units/ml), leupeptin (0.1 mM), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM)) were added to the solution. After sonicating the solution with six 10-s pulses and one 15-s pulse using a Branson Sonifier 450 sonicator (power output = 2, with the micro tip), 1.5 ml of the solution was overlaid onto each of six SW41 ultracentrifuge tubes containing a 10-40% sucrose gradient. The sucrose gradient was prepared in buffers containing 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and the aforementioned protease inhibitors. Following ultracentrifugation in an SW41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 60 h at 10°C, fractions (0.5 ml each) were unloaded from the gradient and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4-15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Low density lipoproteins were visualized by staining the gels with the Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus kit. Those fractions containing exclusively apoB48 and apoB100 were pooled and used to immunize a human apoB transgenic New Zealand White rabbit (12.Fan J. McCormick S.P.A. Krauss R.M. Taylor S. Quan R. Taylor J.M. Young S.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The rabbit was immunized with 10 μg of mouse apoB in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by booster immunizations of 5 μg of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 4, 6, and 14 weeks. Serum samples were taken weekly after the final immunization. The rabbit was sacrificed, and serum was collected at 19 weeks. Rabbit serum was screened for binding to mouse LDL by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. The specificity of the antibody for mouse apoB48 and apoB100 was confirmed by Western blots of plasma proteins that had been size-fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured in fresh plasma samples after a 4-h fast. Plasma lipoprotein electrophoresis was performed on 1% agarose gels(13.Young S.G. Bertics S.J. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The agarose gels were either stained for neutral lipids with Fat Red 7B or used for Western blots with a 125I-labeled rabbit antibody to rat apoB(1.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To analyze the distribution of cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB within the plasma lipoproteins, plasma (250 μl pooled from six animals of the same genotype) was fractionated on a Superose 6 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using the automated Bio-Rad Biologic System (Bio-Rad). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 96 fractions (0.25 ml each) were collected in a 96-well plate. Consecutive fractions were pooled to obtain 48 fractions (0.5 ml each), and cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in each fraction were measured using colorimetric methods(4.Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The distribution of mouse apoB in each fraction was analyzed on Western blots of 4% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, using the rabbit antibody to mouse apoB and the Enhanced Chemiluminescense Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Corp.). Mice lacking apoB synthesis in the intestine (genotype MBTg+/0,apoB-/-), as well as wild-type littermates, were sacrificed at 10 days of age. Sections of 10 μm thickness were prepared from paraffin-embedded liver and intestine and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To generate transgenic mice expressing mouse apoB, the 95-kb MluI fragment of p649 was microinjected into murine zygotes (Fig. 1). Six founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis and the two with the highest levels of plasma apoB, 6690 and 6691, were selected for breeding and further analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). Using Southern blots of pulsed-field agarose gels, we demonstrated that both of the transgenic lines contained intact copies of the transgene (Fig. 2C). In line 6690, the transgene copy number was assessed by phosphorimager analysis of a Southern blot as ∼20. High copy numbers were also found in the human apoB transgenic mice generated with a P1 bacteriophage clone(1.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice from line 6691 had increased amounts of β-migrating lipoproteins on an agarose gel (Fig. 3A), and Western blots demonstrated increased levels of mouse apoB (Fig. 3B). Using chemical techniques, the concentration of mouse apoB in the plasma of the nontransgenic mice was 10 mg/dl. Quantitative analysis of the Western blots of agarose gels with a phosphorimager revealed a 3-fold increase in the amount of plasma apoB in the transgenic animals (line 6691) compared with nontransgenic controls. Therefore, based on the analysis of the Western blots, we estimate that the concentration of apoB in the plasma of the transgenic mice (line 6691) was ∼30 mg/dl. The plasma apoB levels in transgenic line 6690 were approximately 2-fold higher than those in line 6691, ∼60 mg/dl. The increased amounts of apoB in the plasma of the transgenic mice were associated with significantly increased amounts of plasma triglycerides and significantly decreased amounts of HDL cholesterol, compared with nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 4). Fractionation of the plasma by fast phase liquid chromatography (FPLC) revealed that the transgenic mice had increased amounts of LDL cholesterol (Fig. 5A). The FPLC studies revealed that the LDL of the transgenic animals was strikingly enriched in triglycerides (Fig. 5B), accounting for the increased plasma triglyceride levels in these animals. Western blots of the FPLC fractions revealed differences in the quantity of apoB48 and apoB100 in transgenic and nontransgenic animals, but there were no significant differences in the particle size distribution of apoB100 and apoB48 (Fig. 5C). Most of the apoB48 and apoB100 were located in LDL-sized lipoproteins.Figure 4:Lipids and lipoproteins in transgenic and nontransgenic mice.

Pooled plasma samples from six female transgenic mice and six female nontransgenic littermate controls were size-fractionated on an FPLC column, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cholesterol and triglycerides were determined by an enzymatic assay (panels A and B), and the distributions of apoB48 and apoB100 were determined by Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a rabbit antibody to mouse apoB and the Enhanced Chemiluminescense Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Corp.) (panel C). The angled appearance of the apoB48 and apoB100 bands in the lower blot in panel C was due to the angled placement of the gel on the blotting paper before electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess levels of apoB mRNA in the liver and intestines of transgenic animals (line 6691), we used RNA slot blots (Fig. 6). Quantitative analysis of the RNA slot blots using a phosphorimager indicated that the livers of the transgenic mice had a 3-fold increase in the amount of apoB mRNA (Fig. 6A). However, no increase in the amount of intestinal apoB mRNA was observed in the transgenic mice (Fig. 6B). To further evaluate the issue of apoB mRNA levels, we performed RNase protection studies of liver and intestine RNA samples, using a riboprobe from exon 26 of the mouse apoB gene (both the 6690 and 6691 lines). In the nontransgenic animals, as well as the transgenic animals, we observed the expected 245-bp protected fragment. This fragment was of equal intensity in transgenic and nontransgenic animals (Fig. 7). In addition, the liver RNA from transgenic animals yielded protected fragments of approximately 151 and 91 bp. DNA sequencing revealed that the transgene contained two single-nucleotide substitutions, separated by one nucleotide, in exon 26 of the apoB gene (the exact DNA sequence changes were determined and are given in the legend to Fig. 7). Thus, the smaller protected fragments in the RNase protection experiment represented apoB mRNA derived from the transgene, which had been cleaved at the mismatched bases. In a separate RNase protection assay, the apoB mRNA levels were normalized to the amount of mRNA for GAPDH (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of apoB mRNA levels (relative to GAPDH mRNA levels) using a phosphorimager indicated a 3-fold increase in hepatic apoB mRNA in the transgenic mice (total radioactivity in the 245-, 151-, and 91-bp bands) compared with the nontransgenic mice (the 245-bp band). With the intestinal RNA, the endogenous 245-bp protected fragment was observed in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice; however, the 151- and 91-bp bands (indicative of transgene expression) were not observed. To evaluate intestinal transgene expression further, the transgenic mice (line 6691) were mated with apoB knockout mice to obtain mice that carried the transgene and were homozygous for the knockout of the endogenous apoB gene (genotype MBTg+/0,apoB-/-). In the presence of the mouse apoB transgene, we demonstrated homozygosity for the apoB knockout mutation by showing that these animals had a double dose of the neo gene, relative to a signal from an unrelated single-copy gene (Fig. 8, A and B). The MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice had a striking phenotype. Within 24 h of birth, these animals developed a completely white abdominal cavity and manifested growth retardation (Fig. 9). The white abdominal cavity was due to the failure to synthesize apoB in the intestines, which caused a massive accumulation of lipids in the villus enterocytes (Fig. 10). Of note, the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice had increased levels of triglycerides and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol, compared with nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4B). FPLC fractionation of the plasma of the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice revealed that these animals had an increased amount of LDL cholesterol, compared with nontransgenic animals, and a marked reduction in HDL cholesterol (Fig. 11A). The LDL of the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice was enriched in triglycerides (Fig. 11B). The size distribution of apoB48- and apoB100-containing lipoproteins was similar in the nontransgenic mice and the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice (Fig. 11C).Figure 9:Photograph of two 6-day-old mice. The mouse on the left (genotype MBTg+/0,apoB-/-) lacks apoB expression in the intestine. Approximately one-third of the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice survived until they were weaned.

Pooled plasma samples were size-fractionated on an FPLC column as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cholesterol and triglycerides were determined by an enzymatic assay (panels A and B), and the distributions of apoB48 and apoB100 were determined by Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a rabbit antibody to mouse apoB and the ECL detection system (panel C). For panel C, the control plasma sample that was used was from a apoB100/100 mouse, which is a mouse that is homozygous for a targeted apoB mutation that prevents the formation of apoB48 (R. V. Farese Jr. and S. G. Young, unpublished results). The slightly angled appearance of the apoB48 and apoB100 bands in panel C was due to the angled placement of the gel on the blotting paper before electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we used a 95-kb MluI fragment from a mouse apoB P1 clone, p649, to produce transgenic mice that overexpress mouse apoB. As judged by Southern blots of pulsed-field gels of high molecular weight liver DNA, intact copies of the transgene were incorporated into the genomes of the transgenic lines that we investigated. Documentation of transgene expression was straightforward, even though the transgenic animals also expressed apoB from their endogenous apoB alleles. The apoB transgene used in this study was isolated from a strain RIII genomic library, and it contained two single nucleotide substitutions within the 5′ portion of exon 26. The existence of this pair of DNA sequence polymorphisms made it possible to document transgene expression unequivocally using RNase protection assays. The RNase protection studies, as well as the RNA slot blot studies, indicated that the hepatic levels of apoB mRNA in transgenic line 6691 were increased 3-fold, compared with nontransgenic mice. One of the most intriguing aspects of these studies was that the mouse transgene, which contained 33 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 11 kb of 3′-flanking sequences, was not expressed in the intestines, an organ where the endogenous gene is normally expressed at high levels. This finding, which initially was shown by RNA slot blot and RNase protection studies, was further analyzed by breeding the transgenic mice with the apoB knockout mice. Transgenic mice that were homozygous for the knockout mutation (MBTg+/0,apoB-/-) could not synthesize apoB in the intestines and consequently developed a massive accumulation of fats within the villus enterocytes of the small and large intestines. In a prior study(1.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we found that a human apoB gene construct containing 19 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 17.5 kb of 3′-flanking sequences did not confer intestinal expression of the apoB gene in transgenic mice. Although we suspected that the human transgene simply lacked the DNA sequences controlling intestinal expression of the gene, those studies did not allow us to exclude the possibility that the mouse was simply incapable of recognizing and utilizing the human sequences that control intestinal expression of the apoB gene. The current studies using a mouse transgene argue strongly against the latter possibility and, together with the human transgene studies, suggest that the intestinal element is probably located more than 33 kb 5′ of the structural gene or more than 11 kb 3′ from the gene. One hypothesis to explain the distant location of the cis-acting DNA sequence element controlling intestinal apoB expression is that the element might be shared with a neighboring gene. Sharing a tissue-specific element with an adjacent gene would not be unprecedented. For example, apoE and apoCI are known to share a DNA sequence element that governs liver expression of both genes(14.Taylor J.M. Simonet W.S. Lauer S.J. Zhu G. Walker D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 84-89Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice was similar to that of the HuBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice that we described earlier(15.Young S.G. Cham C.M. Pitas R.E. Burri B.J. Connolly A. Flynn L. Pappu A.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2932-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), both in terms of the intestinal pathology and the lipoprotein phenotype. However, two findings with the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice deserve to be underscored. First, those animals had higher levels of triglycerides in the plasma, compared with nontransgenic animals, despite the fact that they had severe intestinal pathology. Because fat absorption is markedly reduced in these mice(15.Young S.G. Cham C.M. Pitas R.E. Burri B.J. Connolly A. Flynn L. Pappu A.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2932-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the high plasma triglyceride levels are probably maintained by prodigious rates of de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Second, the MBTg+/0,apoB-/- mice had markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol. This finding is consistent with the low levels of HDL cholesterol that are observed in human patients with abetalipoproteinemia (16.Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 1139-1164Google Scholar) and suggests a critical role for normal chylomicron formation in the maintenance of normal plasma concentrations of HDL. The studies of the mouse apoB transgenic mice helped to clarify the lipoprotein phenotype associated with increased apoB production by the liver. High levels of human apoB expression in transgenic mice resulted in a large increase in the amount of LDL cholesterol in the plasma, as well as decreased levels of HDL cholesterol(1.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4.Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V.

However, since human apoB binds very poorly to the mouse LDL receptor(5.Corsini A. Mazzotti M. Villa A. Maggi F.M. Bernini F. Romano L. Romano C. Fumagalli R. Catapano A.L. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 93: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), one could make a strong argument that the LDL accumulation in these animals might be caused, in large part, by defective clearance of the human LDL from the plasma. The current study, involving overexpression of mouse apoB in mice, provides a portrayal of hepatic apoB overexpression that is free of caveats regarding the intrinsic metabolic properties of a heterologous apoB. The transgenic mice that overproduce mouse apoB in the liver had increased plasma levels of LDL cholesterol and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol, strongly suggesting that these findings represent hallmark metabolic features of apoB overexpression by the liver. Finally, our prior studies of the human apoB transgenic mice revealed that those animals had a marked triglyceride enrichment of the LDL(1.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This unexpected finding suggested the possibility that lipolysis of triglycerides within the human apoB-containing lipoproteins might be defective in the mouse. The fact that we observed triglyceride enrichment of the LDL in the mouse apoB transgenic mice casts serious doubt on that potential explanation. It seems more likely that the triglyceride enrichment of the LDL might be due to relatively low levels of hepatic triglyceride lipase in the mouse 2M. Komaromy, personal communication. or to the production of small, triglyceride-rich nascent lipoproteins by the liver(1.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H.

https://openalex.org/W1993825619,"Previous studies established that uterine epithelial cells and cell lines express cell surface heparin/heparan sulfate (HP/HS)-binding proteins (Wilson, O., Jacobs, A. L., Stewart, S., and Carson, D. D.(1990) J. Cell. Physiol. 143, 60-67; Raboudi, N., Julian, J., Rohde, L. H., and Carson, D. D.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11930-11939). The accompanying paper (Liu, S., Smith, S. E., Julian, J., Rohde, L. H., Karin, N. J., and Carson, D. D.(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11817-11823) describes the cloning of a full-length cDNA corresponding to a candidate cell surface HP/HS interacting protein, HIP, expressed by a variety of human epithelia. A synthetic peptide was synthesized corresponding to an amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA sequence and used to prepare a rabbit polyclonal antibody. This antibody reacted with a protein with an apparent Mr of 24,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that was highly enriched in the 100,000 × g particulate fraction of RL95 cells. This molecular weight is similar to that of the protein expressed by 3T3 cells transfected with HIP cDNA. HIP was solubilized from this particulate fraction with NaCl concentrations ≥0.8 M demonstrating a peripheral association consistent with the lack of a membrane spanning domain in the predicted cDNA sequence. HIP was not released by heparinase digestion suggesting that the association is not via membrane-bound HS proteoglycans. NaCl-solubilized HIP bound to heparin-agarose in physiological saline and eluted with NaCl concentrations of 0.75 M and above. Furthermore, incubation of 125I-HP with transblots of the NaCl-solubilized HIP preparations separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated direct binding of HP to HIP. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that HIP is expressed on the surfaces of intact RL95 cells. Binding of HIP antibodies to RL95 cell surfaces at 4°C was saturable and blocked by preincubation with the peptide antigen. Single cell suspensions of RL95 cells formed large aggregates when incubated with antibodies directed against HIP but not irrelevant antibodies. Finally, indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HIP is expressed in both lumenal and glandular epithelium of normal human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle. In addition, HIP expression increases in the predecidual cells of post-ovulatory day 13-15 stroma. Collectively, these data indicate that HIP is a membrane-associated HP-binding protein expressed on the surface of normal human uterine epithelia and uterine epithelial cell lines. Previous studies established that uterine epithelial cells and cell lines express cell surface heparin/heparan sulfate (HP/HS)-binding proteins (Wilson, O., Jacobs, A. L., Stewart, S., and Carson, D. D.(1990) J. Cell. Physiol. 143, 60-67; Raboudi, N., Julian, J., Rohde, L. H., and Carson, D. D.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11930-11939). The accompanying paper (Liu, S., Smith, S. E., Julian, J., Rohde, L. H., Karin, N. J., and Carson, D. D.(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11817-11823) describes the cloning of a full-length cDNA corresponding to a candidate cell surface HP/HS interacting protein, HIP, expressed by a variety of human epithelia. A synthetic peptide was synthesized corresponding to an amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA sequence and used to prepare a rabbit polyclonal antibody. This antibody reacted with a protein with an apparent Mr of 24,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that was highly enriched in the 100,000 × g particulate fraction of RL95 cells. This molecular weight is similar to that of the protein expressed by 3T3 cells transfected with HIP cDNA. HIP was solubilized from this particulate fraction with NaCl concentrations ≥0.8 M demonstrating a peripheral association consistent with the lack of a membrane spanning domain in the predicted cDNA sequence. HIP was not released by heparinase digestion suggesting that the association is not via membrane-bound HS proteoglycans. NaCl-solubilized HIP bound to heparin-agarose in physiological saline and eluted with NaCl concentrations of 0.75 M and above. Furthermore, incubation of 125I-HP with transblots of the NaCl-solubilized HIP preparations separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated direct binding of HP to HIP. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that HIP is expressed on the surfaces of intact RL95 cells. Binding of HIP antibodies to RL95 cell surfaces at 4°C was saturable and blocked by preincubation with the peptide antigen. Single cell suspensions of RL95 cells formed large aggregates when incubated with antibodies directed against HIP but not irrelevant antibodies. Finally, indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HIP is expressed in both lumenal and glandular epithelium of normal human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle. In addition, HIP expression increases in the predecidual cells of post-ovulatory day 13-15 stroma. Collectively, these data indicate that HIP is a membrane-associated HP-binding protein expressed on the surface of normal human uterine epithelia and uterine epithelial cell lines.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, HSPGs and a variety of HP/HS-binding proteins have been shown to participate in a diverse range of biological processes such as cell attachment, growth factor binding, cell proliferation, migration, morphogenesis, and viral pathogenicity(6.Hassell J.R. Kimura J.H. Hascall V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 539-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7.Poole A.R. Biochem.

Several lines of evidence indicate that HSPGs play an important role during the initial attachment of the apical plasma membrane of trophectodermal cells of the blastocyst to the apical plasma membrane of the uterine epithelium. In mice, HSPGs are expressed on the cell surfaces of two-cell stage and post-implantation stage embryos(9.Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Paulsson M. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, blastocyst attachment to laminin, fibronectin, and isolated mouse uterine epithelial cells is inhibited by HP. Embryo attachment also is inhibited by the treatment of embryos with HP/HS lyases or inhibitors of proteoglycan biosynthesis(10.Farach M.C. Tang J.-P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11.Farach M.C. Tang J.-P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunological studies of murine embryo implantation sites indicated that the core protein of the basement membrane HSPG, perlecan, and HP/HS chains are located between the apical cell surfaces of trophectodermal cells and uterine epithelial cells during the peri-implantation stage(12.Carson D.D. Tang J.-P. Julian J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Expression of perlecan on the external trophectodermal surface correlates with acquisition of attachment competence in vitro as well. Externally disposed H/HS-binding sites have been described on the cell surface of mouse uterine epithelial cells(13.Wilson O. Jacobs A.L. Stewart S. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using a heterologous cell adhesion assay, we demonstrated that HP/HS-like glycosaminoglycans participate in the initial attachment between two human cell lines, JAR and RL95, used to mimic the initial attachment of the human embryonic trophectoderm to human uterine epithelial cells, respectively(14.Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As is the case for mouse uterine epithelia, the human uterine epithelial cell line, RL95, has specific, high affinity cell surface HP/HS-binding sites, which are sensitive to mild trypsin digestion of intact cells. Three tryptic peptides that retained HP/HS binding specificity were isolated from such trypsinates and partially amino-terminal sequenced (15.Raboudi N. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the accompanying paper(36.Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the full-length cDNA sequence to one of these proteins, named HIP for HP/HS interacting protein, was obtained and shown to encode a cell surface protein with an Mr of 24,000 when expressed in transfected 3T3 cells. HIP is expressed in a cell type-specific fashion by many human cell lines, particularly those of epithelial origin. heparan/sulfate proteoglycans bovine serum albumin heparin/heparan sulfate phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the current study, we have generated and characterized a rabbit antibody to a synthetic peptide designed from a predicted 16-amino acid sequence of HIP. These studies demonstrate that HIP is a peripheral membrane protein that directly binds HP and is expressed on the surfaces of normal human uterine epithelia and many uterine epithelial cell lines.

Rabbit antibodies to human factor VIII and laminin were purchased from Dakopatt's (Glostrup, Denmark) and Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA), respectively. All chemicals used were reagent grade or better. Cells (RL95-2 or HEC-1a) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/Ham's F12, 1:1 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air:5% CO2 (v/v). For collection of conditioned medium, the same medium was used except that the fetal bovine serum was omitted. Medium was collected after a 24-h incubation. In most experiments, RL95 cells were used; however, in some experiments HEC-1a (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection) or Ishikawa cells (a generous gift of Dr. Erlio Gurpide, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York) were cultured under the same conditions and used for preparation of whole cell extracts or conditioned media. Human endometrial tissue was obtained from routine biopsy specimens. A synthetic peptide of the following sequence was constructed on a Vega 250 peptide synthesizer using FMOC methodology(16.Chang C.D. Meienhofer J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), CRPKAKAKAKAKDQTK. This synthetic peptide was conjugated to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein, using the Imject Maleimide Activated Carrier Proteins kit (Pierce) and was used for rabbit immunization following standard protocols (University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Bastrop, TX). Western blot analysis and immunocytochemical studies were conducted using polyclonal antibodies affinity purified with the synthetic peptide linked to maleimide-activated BSA (Pierce) conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated-Sepharose (Sigma), using the manufacturer's protocol. Cells or particulate subcellular fractions were initially solubilized and SDS-PAGE and Western blotting performed as described previously (17.Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar, 22.Julian J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Erickson H.P. Carson D.D. Development. 1994; 120: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using affinity purified rabbit anti-HIP as primary antibody and 125I-protein A (30 μCi/μg) as the detection system. RL95 cells were grown to 70% confluency on a 100-mm tissue culture plate. Membranes were isolated by differential centrifugation. Briefly, cells were washed three times with PBS and released from the plate by incubation with 10 mM EDTA in PBS at 37°C for 15-30 min. Cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in homogenizing buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors(10.Farach M.C. Tang J.-P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) and homogenized on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The 1000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The 10,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Samples of pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. RL95 cell surface components were radioiodinated with 1 mCi/ml Na125I (carrier-free; Amersham Corp.) in PBS for 30 min on ice by overlaying the cell layers with glass coverslips coated with 10 μg of IODO-GEN (Pierce)(19.Markwell M.A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). After this period, the coverslips were removed, and the cell layers were rinsed several times with PBS containing 1 mM NaI. Cells were scraped from the tissue culture dish with a rubber policeman and subsequently homogenized and subjected to the subcellular fractionation scheme described above. Equal protein loads of each fraction was applied to SDS-PAGE, and the location of the 125I-labeled cell surface components determined by autoradiography of the dried gels. High speed (100,000 × g) membrane fractions were divided into equal parts and extracted either with 0.15, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, or 1.6 M NaCl in 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 mM Tris (pH 7.4), incubated overnight at 4°C, and centrifuged the next day at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatants were precipitated overnight at 4°C by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). Pellets were dissolved in 0.2 ml of sample extraction buffer and then precipitated and prepared for SDS-PAGE as described above. High speed (100,000 × g) membrane preparations were extracted overnight at 4°C with 0.4 M NaCl in 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h. The 0.4 M NaCl-insoluble pellet was subsequently extracted with 0.8 M NaCl in 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0) at 4°C for 4 h and centrifuged 1.5 h at 100,000 × g. The protein eluted between 0.4 and 0.8 M NaCl was diluted to 0.15 M NaCl, applied to a 0.5-ml pellet of prerinsed heparin-agarose (Sigma), and incubated overnight batchwise with constant rotary agitation at 4°C. A stepwise elution from heparin-agarose was performed with NaCl extending from 0.15-2.0 M in 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0). All fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. High speed (100,000 × g) particulate preparations were subjected to differential salt extraction with 0.4 M NaCl followed by 0.8 M NaCl as described above. The proteins then were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (20.O'Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above for Western blotting. The unblocked nitrocellulose was incubated with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent-derivatized HP (15.Raboudi N. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 0.15 M NaCl overnight at 4°C. The blot then was washed 3 times with PBS before drying for autoradiography. The same blot was blocked and then probed with HIP antibody and binding subsequently visualized with a peroxidase ABC system using a diaminobenzidene substrate kit as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). A parallel gel run under exactly the same conditions was silver-stained as described (21.Wray W. Boulikas Q. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar) to visualize the migration positions of all proteins on the gel. Cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. After a brief rinse in PBS, the cells were fixed with 2.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed twice in PBS, and aldehyde groups blocked by incubation with 50 mM ammonium chloride in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and mounting of coverslips were as described in Julian et al.(22.Julian J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Erickson H.P. Carson D.D. Development. 1994; 120: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For staining of endometrium, human endometrium was rapidly frozen in O.C.T. (Miles; Elkhart, IN) and sections prepared at −20°C on a Reichert Jung cryostat. These sections were fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at room temperature, rehydrated in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and immediately used for immunostaining. The stage of the menstrual cycle was identified in all cases by standard histological examination (23.Noyes R.W. Hertig A.T. Rock J. Fertil. Steril. 1950; 1: 3-25Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and serum hormone profiles. In all cases, the affinity purified HIP primary antibody was used at a concentration of 25 μg/ml and the secondary antibody, fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Corp.), at a 1:10 dilution. Rabbit antiserum to human factor VIII was used at a 1:30 dilution. Rabbit antiserum to mouse laminin was used at a 1:50 dilution. RL95 cells were grown to 90% confluency in 24-well tissue culture plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were rinsed three times with Hanks'-buffered saline and preincubated for 15 min at 4°C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (PBS containing 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) hemoglobin, 1 mM NaI, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3). The binding buffer was removed, and 0.2 ml of binding buffer containing anti-HIP or nonimmune rabbit IgG was incubated for 45 min at 4°C in duplicate wells. IgG was added at the following concentrations, 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml. Cells were rinsed 3 times with binding buffer at 4°C for 5 min and incubated with binding buffer containing 125I-protein A (1 × 106 cpm/well) for 30 min at 4°C. After rinsing 3 times with ice-cold binding buffer, cells were solubilized with 1% (w/v) SDS and 0.5 M NaOH, and the amount of 125I-protein A bound to RL95 cell surface was determined. To determine nonspecific binding of anti-HIP or nonimmune rabbit IgG, antibody was preincubated for 2 h at 4°C with or without 100 μl of peptide affinity matrix and then centrifuged. RL95 cells were grown in tissue culture plates to 70% confluency and detached with 10 mM EDTA in PBS without calcium and magnesium. Cells were resuspended in media, (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 containing 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1% (w/v) BSA), at a concentration of 3.5 × 106 cells/ml. To prevent adhesion, wells were precoated with 1 mg of polyhema in 100% ethanol at 37°C overnight until dry and then rinsed 3 times with media before use. The following components were added to each well: 1 ml of the media, 100 μl of buffer (PBS plus 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) with or without control IgG antibody, or anti-HIP protein at 25 μg/ml and 7 × 105 cells (200 μl). Plates were incubated for 3 h at 37°C on a rotary shaker at 1700 rpm. Afterward, cellular aggregation was viewed and photographed with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope using phase microscopy. An antibody was generated to a synthetic peptide sequence predicted from the full-length HIP cDNA sequence(36.Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sequence was predicted to be hydrophilic and likely to be exposed on the external surface of the intact protein. The antibodies routinely used for the studies described below were affinity purified on a column composed of the BSA-conjugated HIP peptide linked to agarose. As shown below, these antibodies reacted primarily with a protein with the Mr of 24,000 as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. This molecular weight is similar to that observed for HIP protein expressed by 3T3 cells transfected with full-length HIP cDNA(36.Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation was used as an initial step to partially purify HIP for subsequent analytical studies. Fractionation of RL95 cells and subsequent Western blot analysis determined that HIP was most highly enriched in the 100,000 × g pellet; however, HIP was detected in other particulate fractions as well (Fig. 1). Lower molecular weight components immunologically related to HIP were detected in the 1000 × g/20 min and 10,000 × g/20 min particulate fraction. These components were presumed to be partially degraded forms of HIP. In contrast, HIP appeared to be quantitatively depleted from the 100,000 × g soluble fraction. A similar distribution of HIP was observed in JAR and HEC-1a cells, human trophoblastic and uterine adenocarcinoma cell lines, respectively (data not shown). The high speed particulate fraction was used further as the most convenient source of HIP. The 100,000 × g particulate fraction was subjected to incubations with increasing concentrations of NaCl and then analyzed by Western blot analysis. At a NaCl concentration greater than 0.8 M, HIP was eluted from the membrane fraction into a 100,000 × g soluble fraction (Fig. 2). Analyses of the corresponding supernatants for each salt wash indicated that HIP is partially eluted with 0.4 M NaCl but is completely eluted with NaCl concentrations of 0.8 M or greater. The solubilization of HIP with salt indicates that HIP is likely to be peripherally associated with the particulate fractions of cells. Conditioned media from RL95 cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the corresponding pellet and supernatant were analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). HIP was not detected in secretions from RL95 cells, indicating that this protein is not secreted or released from RL95 cells to a significant extent.Figure 3:HIP is not secreted or released from RL95 cells. Serum-free RL95 cell-conditioned medium from a 24-h incubation was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The 100,000 × g/60-min supernatant was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and equal portions of all fractions were analyzed for the presence of HIP by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, RL95 cell homogenate; lane 2, 100,000 × g pellet from conditioned medium; lane 3, the 100,000 × g supernatant from conditioned medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 0.8 M NaCl eluate from the 100,000 × g particulate fraction was diluted to 0.15 M NaCl and incubated with heparin-agarose (Fig. 4). Elution of the heparin-agarose with increasing concentrations of NaCl demonstrated that HIP bound to heparin and was released at NaCl concentrations greater than 0.75 M. Staining with Coomassie Blue (data not shown) indicated that multiple proteins were present in the heparin-binding fractions. Therefore, a HP overlay assay was employed to demonstrate the ability of HIP to bind HP directly(15.Raboudi N. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and sequentially probed with 125I-HP and anti-HIP. Profiles of total proteins were visualized in a parallel sample by silver staining. As shown in Fig. 5, many proteins co-isolated with HIP by this procedure (panel A); however, only a subset of these proteins retained the ability to bind 125I-HP (panel B). Collectively, the binding and the elution of HIP from heparin-agarose and the coincident binding of 125I-HP and anti-HIP indicate that HIP is a HP-binding protein.Figure 5:HIP directly binds 125I-heparin. The 100,000 × g particulate fractions were isolated and analyzed by two-dimensional non-equilibrium gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Duplicate gels were used for silver staining or transfer to nitrocellulose and Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A, silver-stained gel; panel B, Western blot from panel C subjected to 125I-HP overlay; panel C, Western blot used in panel B probed with anti-HIP. The arrow indicates the spot corresponding to HIP in all panels.

Initially, concentration dependence and saturability of anti-HIP binding was examined. Fig. 6A shows that binding of anti-HIP to intact RL95 cells was both specific and saturable as compared with binding of nonimmune rabbit IgG. Furthermore, when anti-HIP protein was pre-absorbed with peptide affinity matrix, its binding was reduced to the level observed with nonimmune rabbit IgG (Fig. 6B). Next, anti-HIP was used to examine the distribution of this protein on HEC-1a cell surfaces. As shown in Fig. 7, immunostaining of methanol-permeabilized, paraformaldehyde-fixed HEC-1a cells with anti-cytokeratins demonstrated a strong positive signal (panel B). In contrast, fixed, nonpermeabilized cells displayed only background staining (panel A) comparable with that observed when primary antibody was omitted (panel D). Staining of fixed, nonpermeabilized cells with anti-HIP was uniformly distributed on the surfaces of all cells in these cultures including points of cell-cell contact (panel C). Similar results were obtained with RL95 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicated that reactivity with anti-HIP was reflective of cell surface staining and not due to permeabilization in human uterine epithelial cell lines.Figure 7:Anti-HIP reacts with the surfaces of intact cells. HEC-1a (25.Kuramoto H. Acta Obstet. Gynaecol. Jpn. (Engl. Ed.). 1972; 19: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar) cells were grown on glass coverslips to 50% confluency, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Antibodies to type I cytokeratins were used to stain cells that either were not (panel A) or were (panel B) methanol-permeabilized. Note the lack of staining of the nonpermeabilized cells demonstrating the integrity of the plasma membrane. Nonpermeabilized cells were stained with affinity purified anti-HIP (panel C) or no primary antibody (panel D). Apparent variations in staining intensity between cells are due to differences in focal depths or multi-layering of cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was further reasoned that if HIP was on RL95 cell surfaces then non-fixed, single cell suspensions of living RL95 cells could be aggregated by anti-HIP. As shown in Fig. 8, incubation of single cell suspensions of RL95 cells with anti-HIP greatly enhanced cell aggregation. Parallel controls, including PBS, PBS containing 0"
https://openalex.org/W2044567163,"Ferrochelatase is a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin, the terminal step in protoheme biosynthesis. The functional/structural roles of 10 invariant amino acid residues were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ferrochelatase. The mutant enzymes were expressed in a yeast strain lacking the ferrochelatase gene HEM15 and in Escherichia coli. The kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes were determined for the enzymes associated with the yeast membranes and the enzymes in the bacterial soluble fraction. They were compared with the in vivo functioning of the mutant enzymes. The main conclusions are the following. Glu-314 is critical for catalysis, and we suggest that it is the base responsible for abstracting the N-pyrrole proton(s). His-235 is essential for metal binding. Asp-246 and Tyr-248 are also involved in metal binding in a synergistic manner. The Km for protoporphyrin was also increased in the H235L, D246A, and Y248L mutants, suggesting that the binding sites of the two substrates are not independent of each other. The R87A, Y95L, Q111E, Q273E, W282L, and F308A mutants had 1.2-2-fold increased Vm and 4-10-fold increased Km values for protoporphyrin, but the amount of heme made in vivo was 10-100% of the normal value. These mutations probably affected the geometry of the active center, resulting in improper positioning of protoporphyrin. Ferrochelatase is a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin, the terminal step in protoheme biosynthesis. The functional/structural roles of 10 invariant amino acid residues were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ferrochelatase. The mutant enzymes were expressed in a yeast strain lacking the ferrochelatase gene HEM15 and in Escherichia coli. The kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes were determined for the enzymes associated with the yeast membranes and the enzymes in the bacterial soluble fraction. They were compared with the in vivo functioning of the mutant enzymes. The main conclusions are the following. Glu-314 is critical for catalysis, and we suggest that it is the base responsible for abstracting the N-pyrrole proton(s). His-235 is essential for metal binding. Asp-246 and Tyr-248 are also involved in metal binding in a synergistic manner. The Km for protoporphyrin was also increased in the H235L, D246A, and Y248L mutants, suggesting that the binding sites of the two substrates are not independent of each other. The R87A, Y95L, Q111E, Q273E, W282L, and F308A mutants had 1.2-2-fold increased Vm and 4-10-fold increased Km values for protoporphyrin, but the amount of heme made in vivo was 10-100% of the normal value. These mutations probably affected the geometry of the active center, resulting in improper positioning of protoporphyrin. INTRODUCTIONProtoheme is an important molecule used to build almost all the cytochromes and hemoproteins in the cells of practically all organisms. A key enzyme in protoheme production is ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1; protoheme ferro-lyase), which catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into the tetrapyrrolic nucleus of protoporphyrin IX, at the terminus of the heme biosynthetic pathway. In eukaryotes, ferrochelatase is a peripheral protein associated with the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Protoporphyrin is supplied by protoporphyrinogen oxidase, the preceding enzyme in the pathway, also located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. But the nature and location of the iron pool that serves as substrate for ferrochelatase are not known. Yeast and murine ferrochelatases are synthesized as high molecular weight precursors that are proteolytically processed to their mature forms during their import into the mitochondria (see (1.Dailey H.A.

The prokaryotic enzymes are ∼30 amino acids shorter at the C terminus than the eukaryotic ones. A [2Fe-2S] cluster was recently found in mammalian ferrochelatases, probably bound to a cysteine-rich motif in the carboxyl-terminal extension of the mammalian enzymes, but absent from the extensions of the yeast and plant enzymes(14.Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15.Ferreira G.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Pereira A.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7062-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological role of this cluster remains to be established.In spite of many studies, the catalytic mechanism of ferrochelatase is still unknown. Models have been proposed on the basis of kinetic studies, substrate specificity, and chemical modifications of certain amino acid residues and from analysis of the inhibition by N-alkylporphyrins(1.Dailey H.A. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1990: 123-163Google Scholar, 2.Taketani S. Tohoku J. Exp.

VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1988: 279-314Google Scholar). The active site is believed to be an enclosed hydrophobic pocket(17.Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1287-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with cysteinyl (18.Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2711-2715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and arginyl (19.Dailey H.A. Fleming J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7902-7905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) residues implicated in the binding of metal and porphyrin propionate(s). But the fact that no cysteine is conserved in the known ferrochelatase sequences makes it very unlikely that cysteine is involved in metal binding. Whether the binding of the two substrates is random or ordered, the metal binding prior to porphyrin, is not yet clear. Also unclear is the fate of the two protons released from the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms. Distortion of the porphyrin ring has been suggested as a transition-state intermediate facilitating metalation, and aromatic residues might aid in and/or stabilize the bending of a pyrrole ring(1.Dailey H.A. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1990: 123-163Google Scholar, 16.Lavallee D.K. Liebman J.F. Greenberg A. Mechanistic Principles of Enzyme Activity. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1988: 279-314Google Scholar).Mutations have been identified that cause amino acid substitutions in human and yeast ferrochelatases, and their effects on the enzyme structure and function have been described(20.Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Dailey H.A. Sellers V.M. Dailey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 390-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Gora, M., Chacinska, A., Rytka, J., Labbe-Bois, R. (1996) Biochimie (Paris), in pressGoogle Scholar). These mutations seem to affect structural aspects of the enzyme, rather than active-site residues specifically involved in the binding of either substrate or in catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis in human ferrochelatase has recently shown that one strictly conserved histidine residue plays a significant role in metal ion binding(23.Kohno H. Okuda M. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have now constructed, by directed mutagenesis, single- and double-residue substitutions of 10 invariant amino acids in the yeast ferrochelatase. The mutant enzymes were expressed in a yeast strain from which the ferrochelatase gene HEM15 had been deleted and in Escherichia coli. The functional consequences of these mutations for in vivo heme synthesis were compared with the enzyme defects measured in vitro. The results indicate that the four invariant residues His-235, Asp-246, Tyr-248, and Glu-314 are part of the active center, and their roles in ferrochelatase function are discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Growth ConditionsThe haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AS1(12.Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13405-13413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a derivative of strain S150-2B (MATa leu2-3,112 his3Δ1 trp1-289 ura3-52) in which the HEM15 gene had been deleted (hem15Δ), was used as the host to study the mutant ferrochelatases. Plasmid pMG1 (Fig. 1), carrying the wild-type HEM15 gene or its mutant alleles, was constructed as follows, using routine DNA manipulation procedures(24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pBluescript SK/HEM15(8.Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7278-7283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), carrying the entire 2.5-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. EcoRI-BamHI HEM15 gene, was digested with NdeI and BamHI, filled in with Klenow fragment polymerase, and religated. The resulting plasmid was cut by BglII, filled in, and religated; this destroyed the leftmost BglII site. The EcoRI-BstEII DNA fragment from this plasmid was ligated with the BstEII-BamHI fragment from pBluescript SK/HEM15 and inserted into plasmid pFL39′ cut with EcoRI and BamHI to give pMG1; pFL39′, a centromeric TRP1 plasmid, is a modified pFL39 plasmid (25.Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) in which the BglII TRP1 gene has been replaced by the BamHI TRP1 gene taken from plasmid YDpW (26.Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) to eliminate the two BglII sites. Yeast transformation was performed by a modified lithium acetate method(27.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar); the transformants were recovered on minimal glucose selective medium(28.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The growth phenotype of the transformed cells was monitored on complete solid medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 1% Bacto-peptone) containing 2% glucose (YPG) or 2% glycerol (YPGly), supplemented with 15 mg/liter heme (YPGheme) or 0.2% Tween 80 + 30 mg/liter ergosterol (YPGTe). The cells used for biochemical assays were grown in liquid YPGTe medium at 30°C with vigorous agitation, harvested at the mid-log phase of growth, and used immediately.Site-directed MutagenesisMutagenesis was carried out using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega), which uses a two-primer system to generate site-specific mutations. The single-stranded DNA template was generated using phagemid pALTER-1 (Promega) containing the 2.5-kb EcoRI-BamHI HEM15 gene. Synthetic oligonucleotides, 22-25 bases long (35-mer for the Asp-246/Tyr-248 double mutations) containing one, two, three, or more mismatches, were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer at the Service Synthèse d'Oligonucléotides of the Institut Jacques Monod. All mutations were verified by sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with 35S-dATP and HEM15-specific oligonucleotide primers or with the Pharmacia Biotech ALF automatic sequencer with fluorescein-labeled dATP. Mutations were introduced in plasmid pMG1 by exchanging the 0.88-kb BstEII-StuI or 0.49-kb BglII-BglII fragments that had been entirely sequenced.Overexpression of Yeast Ferrochelatases in E. coliThe pMG2 plasmid (Fig. 1) was constructed to express the mature forms of wild-type and mutant yeast ferrochelatases under the E. coli alkaline phosphatase promoter phoA as described by Ferreira (29.Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for expressing murine ferrochelatase. pBluescript SK/HEM15 served as template for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the hem15Δp allele, truncated HEM15 lacking the N-terminal 31-amino acid presequence, employing the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer). The two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GATATGTCGACTAATGCACAAAAGAGATCACCC, and 5′-CTGCGGATCCTGGCCCTTATCAAGTAGATTCG, contained sequences for SalI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined) at their 5′-ends. The resulting DNA fragment was cut with SalI and BamHI and ligated into the pCASS3 expression vector (30.Kendall D.A. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7261-7265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) digested with SalI and BamHI. The entire hem15Δp sequence was verified by sequencing. The in vitro mutagenized codons were introduced into pMG2 by exchanging the 0.49-kb BglII fragments.The pMG2 plasmids carrying the wild-type and mutant ferrochelatases were transformed into E. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). The bacteria were grown to saturation in LB/ampicillin medium, diluted 1:100 into complete low phosphate/MOPS medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin(29.Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4396-4400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and incubated for 18-20 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 20% glycerol and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4°C) to separate the membrane and soluble fractions. The membrane pellets were resuspended in the above buffer. All fractions were analyzed immediately or stored at −20°C.Ferrochelatase Immunodetection and Activity AssayTotal proteins extracted from trichloroacetic acid-treated yeast cells and proteins from the yeast membrane fractions in 0.05 M NaOH were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. An alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody (Promega) was used to visualize anti-yeast ferrochelatase antibodies(31.Camadro J.-M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total proteins from bacterial cells and proteins from the soluble and membrane fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunodetection of ferrochelatase was performed as described above.Yeast mitochondrial membranes were prepared as described(20.Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ferrochelatase activity was monitored spectrofluorometrically by directly recording the rate of zinc-protoporphyrin formation as described previously in detail(3.Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.-M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar, 20.Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Camadro J.-M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (3-ml final volume) contained 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.2 mg/ml Tween 80, 0.03-15 μM protoporphyrin (in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% Tween 80), and 0.2-25 μM zinc (ZnSO4•5H2O dissolved in water); the reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme. The activity was expressed as nmol of zinc-protoporphyrin/h/mg of protein. The kinetic data were analyzed graphically and using the random Bi Bi fit of the EZ-FIT curve-fitting program(33.Perella F.W. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Heme and Porphyrin ContentThe whole cell cytochrome content was estimated by low temperature (liquid nitrogen) spectrophotometry of cells (40 mg, dry weight) filtered from YPGTe liquid cultures(34.Labbe-Bois R. Rytka J. Litwinska J. Bilinski T. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This rapid and reliable method allows the direct quantitative comparison of the cytochrome (and therefore heme) contents of different strains. Porphyrins accumulated in the cells and excreted into the growth medium were estimated spectrophotometrically(22.Gora, M., Chacinska, A., Rytka, J., Labbe-Bois, R. (1996) Biochimie (Paris), in pressGoogle Scholar, 35.Rytka J. Bilinski T. Labbe-Bois R. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); they were identified by high performance liquid chromatography (35.Rytka J. Bilinski T. Labbe-Bois R. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).RESULTSConstruction of HEM15 Mutant FerrochelatasesThe alignment of the amino acid sequences of ferrochelatases from various species indicates an overall 8% identity extending over the entire length of the proteins(3.Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.-M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar). The 28 invariant amino acids common to all sequences are shown in Fig. 2. To identify the residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis, we mutated those invariant amino acids that were a priori candidates for these functions. They were Arg-87, Tyr-95, Gln-111, His-235, Asp-246, Tyr-248, Gln-273, Trp-282, Phe-308, and Glu-314 (Fig. 2). We also made double mutations, changing both Asp-246 and Tyr-248. The nucleotide changes introduced and the corresponding amino acid substitutions are listed in Table 1. Centromeric, low copy number plasmids (pMG1; Fig. 1) carrying the mutated hem15 alleles under the control of the HEM15 promoter and terminator were transformed into the host strain AS1 from which the chromosomal copy of HEM15 had been deleted (hem15Δ). Five or more individual transformants for each plasmid were scored for their growth phenotypes, and one was retained and used for detailed biochemical analysis.Figure 2:Amino acid sequence of yeast ferrochelatase showing location of residues mutated in this study. The presequence is underlined, and the cleavage site of the precursor form is indicated by an arrow. Invariant residues among ferrochelatases from diverse species are marked by asterisks(3.Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.-M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar). Amino acids substituted in this study are boxed. Overlined amino acids mark positions where substitutions have been identified in hem15 mutants(20.Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 390-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1In Vivo Activity of Mutant FerrochelatasesThe yeast strain AS1 (hem15Δ) makes no ferrochelatase and is therefore totally heme-deficient and accumulates large amounts of protoporphyrin. It cannot grow on glucose medium unless supplemented with heme (YPGheme) or Tween 80 + ergosterol (YPGTe), which supply essential unsaturated fatty acid and sterol, the synthesis of which requires the functioning of microsomal cytochromes b5 and P450, respectively. Also, it cannot grow on glycerol or ethanol medium because it lacks mitochondrial respiratory cytochromes. The catalytic activities of the mutant ferrochelatases, when expressed in the AS1 strain, should correlate with the ability of the transformants to grow on unsupplemented glucose (YPG) medium and glycerol (YPGly) medium. They should also correlate with the amount of total heme made by the cells grown in liquid medium and with the amount of protoporphyrin accumulated and excreted by the cells. Thus, we examined the growth phenotypes and the amounts of total hemes and porphyrins made by the cells carrying the various hem15 mutations; strain AS1 with wild-type HEM15 was used as a positive control, and AS1 without wild-type HEM15 was the negative control. The results are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 3. None of the mutants exhibited temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes when tested at 30 and 37°C. Two mutant ferrochelatases, H235L and E314A, appeared to be totally inactive in vivo. The double mutant ferrochelatases D246A/Y248L and D246V/Y248F had residual activities. They provided enough heme for the synthesis of cytochromes b5 and P450 to allow some growth in the absence of Tween 80 + ergosterol, but that amount of heme was not sufficient to make a functional respiratory chain. The F308A mutant ferrochelatase made ∼10% wild-type heme, which permitted the cells to grow, but poorly, on glycerol medium. All the other mutants showed no growth defects on either YPG or YPGly plates, although the amount of heme made ranged from 20 to 100% of the normal value.Figure 3:Growth phenotypes associated with the expression of the mutant ferrochelatases. The yeast strain AS1 carrying the null allele hem15Δ(-) was transformed with plasmid pMG1 expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of ferrochelatase. The AS1 strain and the different transformants were grown in YPGTe. Drops (3 μl) of each culture were spotted onto different media in 10-fold serial dilutions, and the plates were incubated at 30°C for 2 days (YPG supplemented or not) or 6 days (YPGly). YP plates contained 2% glucose (YPG) or 2% glycerol (YPGly), supplemented with heme (YPGheme) or Tween 80 + ergosterol (YPGTe).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There was a good inverse relationship between the amounts of hemes and those of total porphyrins (intracellular + excreted in the medium) synthesized by the mutant ferrochelatases in vivo: the less hemes, the more porphyrins, mainly protoporphyrin (>90%). However, two mutants departed from this, R87A and Y95L, which accumulated porphyrins in spite of almost normal heme synthesis.Immunological Detection of Mutant Ferrochelatase ProteinsWhole cell protein extracts and membrane fractions were prepared from cells expressing wild-type and mutant ferrochelatases and analyzed for their content of ferrochelatase protein by immunodetection. Western blot analysis of membrane proteins showed that the cells made normal amounts of normal mature-sized ferrochelatases, except for mutants R87A and F308A (Fig. 4, row Y). Identical results were obtained with total cell proteins (data not shown). The steady-state level of the R87A mutant ferrochelatase protein was ∼3-fold lower than normal, suggesting some instability of the protein. The F308A mutant protein migrated more slowly than the others, with a difference in apparent molecular weight of 1000-1500. The entire hem15 allele was resequenced to ensure against a cloning artifact. One possible reason for the abnormal mobility is discussed below. These results indicate that the absence of or decreased activity of the mutant ferrochelatases is not due to a defect in their expression and that all membrane preparations contained roughly the same amount of enzyme protein, except for mutant R87A.Figure 4:Immunodetection of mutant ferrochelatases in S. cerevisiae membrane and E. coli soluble fractions. Yeast membrane proteins (25 μg) (row Y) and E. coli soluble proteins (0.3 μg) (row E) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were reacted first with yeast ferrochelatase antiserum and then with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Yeast and bacterial samples were from the same preparation used to measure ferrochelatase activity. Lane 2, control samples expressing no ferrochelatase (yeast strain AS1, E. coli carrying pCASS3); lane 15, yeast membrane proteins (25 μg) containing wild-type (WT) ferrochelatase. Gels were run for a long time to show the difference in the electrophoretic mobility of the F308A mutant protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetic Parameters of Mutant FerrochelatasesThe activities of the membrane-bound mutant ferrochelatases were studied in the same membrane preparations as used for immunodetection of the enzyme protein. A sensitive assay that permitted direct spectrofluorometric recording of the initial velocity of zinc-protoporphyrin formation in the presence of physiological concentrations of substrates was used. The validity of this assay, and especially the use of Zn2+ in place of Fe2+, has been discussed elsewhere(3.Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.-M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 413-453Google Scholar, 20.Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Camadro J.-M. Labbe P. J. Biol.

The maximal velocities and the Km values for both Zn2+ and protoporphyrin of the mutant enzymes are given in Table 2.Tabled 1The H235L, D246V/Y248F, and E314A mutant ferrochelatases had barely detectable activities. Even when measured with high substrate concentrations (15 μM protoporphyrin, 50 μM Zn2+), the activity was <1% of the wild-type value. The kinetic parameters could not be determined because of this very low activity. The D246A/Y248L mutant (which carried less conservative amino acid substitutions than the D246V/Y248F mutant) had 13% of the wild-type activity, but the Km for both substrates was increased ∼40-fold. All the other mutant enzymes, including the single mutants D246A and Y248L, had higher activities than the wild-type enzyme and higher Km values for protoporphyrin (4-12-fold the normal value). The Km for Zn2+ of these mutant enzymes could not be measured precisely because they were already saturated with the endogenous Zn2+ present in the assay (reaction mixture + membranes), as was the wild-type ferrochelatase.

To determine the structural elements of the PAA binding domain we transferred sequence stretches of the pore-forming regions of repeat III and/or IV from the skeletal muscle α1 subunit (α1S) to the class A α1 subunit (α1A) and expressed these chimeras together with β1a and α2/δ subunits in Xenopus oocytes. The corresponding barium currents (IBa) were tested for PAA sensitivity during trains of depolarizing test pulses (conditioned block). IBa of oocytes expressing the α1A subunit were only weakly inhibited by PAAs (less than 10% conditioned block of IBa during a 100-ms pulse train of 0.1 Hz). Transfer of the transmembrane segment IVS6 from α1S to α1A produced an enhancement of PAA sensitivity of the resulting α1A/α1S chimera comparable to L-type α1 subunits (about 35% conditioned block of IBa during a 100-ms pulse train of 0.1 Hz). Our results demonstrate that substitution of 11 amino acids within the segment IVS6 of α1A with the corresponding residues of α1S is sufficient to transfer L-type PAA sensitivity into the low sensitive class A Ca2+ channel.

The elastic moduli, C22 and C55 of San Carlos olivine and C55 of pure forsterite, were measured to about 13 gigapascals. These data on C22 for San Carlos olivine and C55 for forsterite are consistent with earlier measurements and extrapolations. The C55 for San Carlos olivine increases linearly as a function of increasing pressure, unlike the earlier nonlinear behavior observed at high pressure with impulsive stimulated scattering techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2086725200,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans and their corresponding binding sites have been suggested to play an important role during the initial attachment of murine blastocysts to uterine epithelium and human trophoblastic cell lines to uterine epithelial cell lines. Previous studies on RL95 cells, a human uterine epithelial cell line, had characterized a single class of cell surface heparin/heparan sulfate (HP/HS)-binding sites. Three major HP/HS-binding peptide fragments were isolated from cell surfaces by tryptic digestion, and partial amino-terminal amino acid sequence for each peptide fragment was obtained (Raboudi, N., Julian, J., Rohde, L. H., and Carson, D. D.(27.Raboudi N. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11930-11939). In the current study, using approaches of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cDNA library screening, we have cloned and expressed a novel, cell surface HP/HS-binding protein, named HP/HS interacting protein (HIP), from RL95 cells. The full-length cDNA of HIP encodes a protein of 159 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 17,754 Da and pI of 11.75. Transfection of HIP full-length cDNA into NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated cell surface expression and a size similar to that of HIP expressed by human cells. Predicted amino acid sequence indicates that HIP lacks a membrane spanning region and has no consensus sites for glycosylation. Northern blot analysis detected a single transcript of 1.3 kilobases in both total RNA and poly(A+) RNA. Examination of human cell lines and normal tissues using both Northern blot and Western blot analyses revealed that HIP is expressed at different levels in a variety of human cell lines and normal tissues but absent in some cell lines and some cell types of normal tissues examined. HIP has relatively high homology (∼80% both at the levels of nucleotide and protein sequence) to a rodent ribosomal protein L29. Thus, members of the L29 family may be displayed on cell surfaces where they may participate in HP/HS binding events.

Our laboratory has been interested in studying the mechanism of embryo implantation. We have found that HSPGs and their corresponding binding sites on cell surfaces may be important in the initial stage of mouse embryo attachment to uterine epithelium. Upon hatching from the zona pellucida, the embryo initially attaches to the uterus through the adhesion of the apical surfaces of the trophectodermal cells of the blastocyst. HSPGs are expressed by mouse embryos at the two-cell and post-implantation stages (Dziadek et al., 12.Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Paulsson M. Timple R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression of HSPGs on trophectodermal cell surfaces of mouse blastocysts increases 4-5-fold at the peri-implantation stage (Carson et al., 8.Carson D.D. Tang J.P. Julian J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Farach et al., 13.Farach M.C. Tang J.P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and HS expressed on mouse embryo surfaces is required for embryo attachment to isolated mouse uterine epithelial cells, fibronectin, and laminin (Farach et al., 1987). Similarly, studies have shown that the initial attachment of JAR cells, a human trophoblastic cell line, to RL95 cells, a human uterine epithelial cell line, is HP/HS-dependent, and enzymatic removal of HS from cell surfaces of both JAR and RL95 cells markedly inhibits JAR-RL95 cell-cell adhesion (Rohde and Carson, 28.Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, HSPGs and their binding proteins also may play an important role in the initial attachment of human trophoblast cells to uterine epithelial cells. Specific, saturable cell surface HP/HS-binding sites have been identified on mouse uterine epithelial cells and human uterine epithelial cell lines (Wilson et al., 38.Wilson O. Jacobs A.L. Stewart S. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Raboudi et al., 1992). Since mouse uterine epithelial cells have only been available by primary cell culture, there is a practical limitation to isolating HP/HS-binding sites from this source. Effort has been placed on the study of HP/HS-binding proteins expressed on the cell surfaces of a human uterine epithelial cell line, RL95 (Raboudi et al., 1992). Mild tryptic digestion of RL95 cell surfaces removed most of cell surface HP/HS-binding activity. Three major tryptic peptide fragments, ranging in Mr between 6,000 and 14,000, were released from cell surfaces and retained HP/HS-binding activity. Partial amino-terminal amino acid sequences from each of these three peptides were obtained (Raboudi et al., 1992). We have employed an approach of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify transcripts encoding cell surface HP/HS-binding peptides. Predicted peptide sequence from one of the RT-PCR products revealed an antigenic sequence that also has features of a HP/HS-binding motif suggested by others (Cardin and Weintraub, 7.Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies directed against the synthetic peptide corresponding to this motif recognize a novel HP/HS-binding protein, named HP/HS interacting protein (HIP), expressed on RL95 cell surfaces with an apparent Mr of 24,000 determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Rohde et al., 29.Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (article 377045)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This peptide selectively binds HP/HS, recognizes certain forms of HP and cell surface HS expressed by JAR and RL95 cells, and supports the attachment of human trophoblast cell lines and a variety of other mammalian adherent cell lines. 2S. Liu and D. D. Carson, submitted for publication. Complete cDNA sequence of HIP has been isolated by screening cDNA libraries using the partial cDNA sequence of RT-PCR product of HIP. HIP cDNA sequence contains a single open reading frame encoding 159 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 17,754 Da and a predicted pI of 11.75. This protein is approximately 80% homologous at both the nucleotide and amino acid level to a rodent protein designated as ribosomal protein L29. Transfection of HIP into NIH-3T3 cells results in expression of an Mr 24,000 protein that can be detected on the cell surface. Studies on the expression and distribution of HIP revealed that HIP is expressed at varying levels in a variety of human cell lines and normal human tissues. Sodium chloride, sodium citrate, Tris base, glycine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), β-mercaptoethanol, and Tween 20 were purchased from Bio-Rad. Trichloroacetic acid, acetone, paraformaldehyde, calcium chloride were purchased from Fisher. Formamide and restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All chemicals used were reagent grade or better. RL95, JAR, NIH-3T3, and other cell lines were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). Based on human codon bias (Aota et al., 2.Aota S. Gojobori T. Ishibashi F. Maruyama T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: r315-r391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), degenerate oligonucleotide primers (Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) were designed based on amino-terminal amino acid sequence determined for each tryptic peptide (Raboudi et al., 1992) as follows: peptide 1, GGVKKPL: 5′-CCGAGCTCACMGGVGGVGTAARAARCC-3′; peptide 2, GAKAKG: 5′-CCGAGCTCGGVGCYAARGCYAARGGV-3′; peptide 3, VLNIQI: 5′-CCGAGCTCGTSCTSAAYATHCARATH-3′ (M = A/C, V = G/A/C, R = A/G, Y = C/T, S = G/C, and H = A/T/C). A SacI restriction enzyme site (underlined) was added 5′ to each primer. CCGCGGCCGCdT18 with a 5′ NotI restriction enzyme site (underlined) was used as a primer for reverse transcription (RT) and another primer for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two cytidine nucleotides were added 5′ to each primer to maintain hybridization of terminal regions during RT-PCR. Complete degenerate oligonucleotide primers for each tryptic peptide also were made and used in RT-PCR. Total RNA from RL95 cells was isolated using the method of RNA isolation of Xie and Rothblum(39.Xie W. Rothblum L.I. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 325-327Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using the protocol described in the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) with the concentration of MgCl2 adjusted to 1 mM. The thermal cycle profile described in the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol (Frohman, 14.Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 28-38Google Scholar) was followed. The cDNA pools from RT were amplified by PCR. RT-PCR products were cloned into the pCR II vector using the TA Cloning System kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Plasmids containing RT-PCR products were isolated either following the method described by Sambrook et al.(32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or using “Magic Minipreps” DNA Purification System kit (Promega, Madison, WI). All of RT-PCR products were sequenced using either the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method (Sambrook et al., 1989) following the procedure provided in the Sequenase version 2 kit (Amersham Corp.) or automatic sequencing using fluorescently labeled sequencing primers (T7 and SP6) provided in the Applied Biosystems cycle sequencing kit and analyzed on an Applied Biosystem model 373A automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Northern blot analysis of RNA was performed using method described by Sambrook et al.(1989). Total RNA was extracted (Xie and Rothblum, 1991), and poly(A+) RNA was isolated using Oligotex-dT mRNA kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Both total RNA and poly(A+) RNA were separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.). A cDNA probe (Clone 23-1 in Fig. 1A depleted of poly(A+) tail) was labeled with 32P by utilizing the random oligonucleotide primer method (Sambrook et al., 1989). Hybridization was performed at 42°C overnight in a solution containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured, sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The blot then was washed using 2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS with several changes during 1 h at 25°C and washed once again using 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 2 h at 42°C before exposure to Kodak XAR film with an intensifying screen at −70°C. HeLa cell cDNA libraries constructed in the Lambda gt11 vector from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and Clontech (Pala Alto, CA) were used for cDNA library screening following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) lifted off the plated cDNA library were prehybridized in 0.8 M NaCl, 20 mM Pipes, pH 6.5, 50% formamide, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured, sonicated salmon sperm DNA for >4 h at 42°C and hybridized in a fresh solution of the same composition containing the 32P-labeled probe (2-4 × 106 cpm/ml) for library screening, at 42°C overnight. After hybridization, the blots were briefly washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature and then washed with same mixture at 65°C for 1 h. The blots were exposed to Kodak XAR films with an intensifying screen at −70°C overnight. Positive plaques were isolated and subjected to subsequent screenings under the same conditions. Positive phage DNA from cDNA library screening was purified from the phage lysate (Sambrook et al., 1989) and digested with EcoRI. The cDNA inserts were separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane by standard method (Sambrook et al., 1989). Blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled probe in 6 × SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) formamide, and 100 μg/ml denatured, sonicated salmon sperm DNA overnight. The blots were washed consecutively with 2 × SSC and 0.5% (w/v) SDS for 5 min at room temperature, 2 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 15 min at room temperature, and 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% (w/v) SDS for 1 h at 37°C. Then the blots were washed with 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% (w/v) SDS for 1 h at 68°C prior to the exposure to Kodak film with an intensifying screen at −70°C. Phage with positive cDNA inserts was digested with EcoRI, separated on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II SK-(Stratagene). Subcloned inserts were further analyzed using Southern blot analysis as described above. Clones with positive inserts were identified and both strands of the cDNA sequences were determined. The entire HIP cDNA (clone 36-1 in Fig. 1A) was digested from HIP cDNA-containing pBluescript using NotI, separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gel, purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and subcloned into the NotI site of mammalian expression vector pOPRSVI (Lac Switch Inducible Mammalian Expression System, Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). The clone that contained the entire cDNA in the correct orientation was determined by PCR using oligonucleotide primers derived from both vector and HIP cDNA sequences and selected for transfection. NIH-3T3 cells (30-40% confluence in 100-mm cell culture plates) were transfected with 18 μg/plate HIP expression vector DNA using the calcium phosphate method (Sambrook et al., 1989) and grown for 48-72 h. The transfected cells were then harvested and used for Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses. Cells on cell culture plates were washed three times with PBS and solubilized in sample extraction buffer: 4 M urea, 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% (v/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Solubilized samples were concentrated by precipitation with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4°C. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 10 min at 4°C, washed sequentially with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 100% acetone, and air-dried. The pellets were dissolved in equal volumes of sample extraction buffer and sample buffer (Laemmli, 22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), heated for 2 min at 90°C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 15% (w/v) acrylamide resolving gel as described (Porzio and Pearson, 26.Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). After a brief rinse in transfer buffer (100 mM Tris base and 100 mM glycine, pH 9.2), the gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 4°C for 5 h at 40 V in a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The transferred blot was blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (P.A.T.) overnight at room temperature. The blot then was incubated with primary antibody diluted in 0.1% (w/v) BSA in P.A.T. for at least 4-6 h at room temperature, rinsed with P.A.T. three times for 5 min each, and incubated for at least 4-6 h with 6 μCi of 125I-protein A (30 μCi/μg) in 70 ml of 0.1% (w/v) BSA in P.A.T. Transiently transfected and parental NIH-3T3 cells were grown on coverslips for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were briefly rinsed with PBS and fixed with 2.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS and soaked in PBS for 10 min. Aldehyde groups were blocked by incubation with 2 ml of 50 mM ammonium chloride in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Immunostaining with primary and secondary antibodies and mounting of coverslips were performed as described before (Julian et al., 18.Julian J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Erickson H.P. Carson D.D. Development. 1994; 120: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslips were then incubated with primary antibody in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. After three rinses of 5 min each with PBS, the cells were incubated with the second antibody, fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.), for 40 min at 37°C. Unbound antibody was removed by several 5-min rinses at room temperature with PBS prior to mounting for fluorescence microscopy. Nucleotide and protein sequence analyses were carried out using GCG and MicroGenie programs and the data bases from GeneBank (release 90.0), EMBL (release 43), and SWISS-PROT (release 31). RT-PCR products obtained from each pair of primers were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced. Sequences of all of the RT-PCR products were determined. Among all of the RT-PCR products, one product (RT-PCR 224 in Fig. 1A) displayed several interesting features as follows. 1) There was a single open reading frame. 2) The amino-terminal peptide sequence used to design the primer was contained in the predicted peptide sequence. 3) A polyadenylation signal was found adjacent to the poly(A+) tail. 4) The predicted polypeptide sequence of the cDNA contained an antigenic peptide sequence, CRPKAKAKAKAKDQTK, with features associated with HP/HS-binding motifs (Cardin and Weintraub, 1989). Computer analysis predicted that this motif was α-helical and hydrophilic and likely to be exposed on the external surface of the protein where it may bind HP/HS. The sequence of this 270-bp RT-PCR product was compared with available sequences in GenBank. The highest similarities found by this analysis were 64% (in 265-bp overlap) similarity to Ratus norvegicus (rat) mRNA for ribosomal protein L29 and 67% (in 188-bp overlap) similarity to a rat mRNA for a ribosomal protein related to yeast ribosomal protein YL43. These features and homology analysis suggested that the parental mRNA corresponding to this RT-PCR product encodes a novel protein related to L29. A HeLa cell cDNA library was screened using the cDNA of HIP RT-PCR product (RT-PCR 224 depleted of poly(A+) tail in Fig. 1A) as a probe. As a result, 20 positive clones with identical inserts to that of 23-1 (or 42-1) (Fig. 1A) were obtained from approximately 5 × 105 plaque-forming units. The cDNA sequence of inserts of 23-1 and 42-1 was determined by primer walking. The determined cDNA sequence contains an incomplete open reading frame encoding 117 amino acid residues. Re-screening of a 5′-stretched HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) using 23-1 cDNA as a probe resulted in the isolation of 12 positive clones from 3.0 × 105 plaque-forming units. The inserts ranged between 400 and 650 bp. Restriction analysis revealed that they had the same restriction enzyme maps, indicating that they were likely to be derived from the same mRNA transcript. Sequencing of the two largest inserts, 35-2 and 36-1, revealed identical sequences except that 1) 36-1 contains 26 more bp of 5′-untranslated region than 35-2; 2) 35-2 contains an extra 6 bp of nucleotides (marked with brackets in Fig. 1B) at the 3′ end of 3′-untranslated region; and 3) there is a nucleotide replacement (C replaced with T, marked with [] in Fig. 1B) at nucleotide position 145. This nucleotide replacement does not affect the coding of the amino acid, leucine. The nucleotide sequence of HIP cDNA including differences between different clones and predicted amino acid sequence of HIP are shown in Fig. 1B (accession number, U49083). Further analysis of the sequence showed that HIP cDNA contains a single open reading frame of 477 bp, starting with an ATG codon at position 28 with characteristic purines at positions −3 and +4 relative to the start ATG codon (Kozak, 21.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar), and ending with a stop codon TAG at position 506 (∗ in Fig. 1B). This open reading frame encodes a protein of 159 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 17,754 Da. The HIP peptide sequence used for antibody production is indicated in the predicted protein sequence (shaded letters in Fig. 1B). Following the open reading frame, there are 121 bp of a 3′-untranslated region that contains a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at nucleotide position 613. The predicted protein sequence has high content of positively charged amino acid residues (K + R = 29.6%) and a predicted pI of 11.75. A comprehensive search of the GenBank, EMBL, and SWISS-PROT data bases revealed that the nucleotide sequence of HIP has 80.5% identity in 549-bp overlap to a rat mRNA for ribosomal protein related to yeast ribosomal protein YL43, 77.6% identity in 603-bp overlap to R. norvegicus (rat) mRNA for ribosomal protein L29, and 76.6% identity in 640-bp overlap to Mus musculus (murine) large ribosomal subunit protein mRNA. A BLAST homology search using GenBank revealed two human nucleotide sequences, designated as a putative human ribosomal protein L29, in GenBank (accession number U10248 and Z49148) showing the same nucleotide sequence as that of HIP cDNA; however, these sequences are not published and no further information is available. The predicted amino acid sequence of HIP has 80.3% identity in 157-amino acid residue overlap to a rat 60 S ribosomal protein, L29; however, the region encoding the peptide sequence (HIP peptide) used for antibody production and HP/HS-binding activity studies is not conserved among human and rat or mouse (Fig. 1C). Consequently, the antibodies are specific to human and do not cross-react with L29 of rat or mouse. The expression of HIP mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled clone 23-1. A single predominant transcript of 1.3 kb was detected either using total RNA or poly(A+) RNA from RL95 cells (Fig. 2). Further studies using a variety of human cell lines (see below) indicated that the 1.3-kb transcript is the major HIP mRNA found in most cases. To demonstrate that the cloned cDNA sequence encodes the protein recognized by antibodies generated against the HIP peptide and to verify cell surface expression of HIP, clone 36-1 was subcloned into a Rous sarcoma virus-based mammalian expression vector and used to transfect NIH-3T3 cells. Transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and expression of HIP was detected using anti-HIP. Fig. 3 shows the immunostaining of a representative field of paraformaldehyde-fixed intact NIH-3T3 cells transiently transfected with HIP cDNA. Staining demonstrated cell surface expression of transfected HIP protein in a portion of transfected cells, whereas other cells that presumably were not transfected during the transient assay were negative. Negative staining also was observed using paraformaldehyde-fixed parental NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown). Similar controls as that presented in the accompanying paper (Rohde et al.,1996; Fig. 7) using antibodies directed against cytokeratins were done for the cell surface staining of the transiently HIP-transfected NIH-3T3 cells, and no reactivity was observed under the fixing conditions performed (data not shown). Therefore, the immunostaining of the transfected cells was cell surface staining. Western blot analysis of total protein extracted from transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells using anti-HIP-peptide detected a newly expressed protein with an apparent Mr of 24,000, i.e. the same molecular weight as that of HIP detected in RL95 cells. In contrast, the Mr 24,000 component was not detectable in the parental NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the isolated cDNA sequence encodes the protein recognized by the anti-HIP peptide antibody and that this protein can be expressed on cell surfaces.Figure 4:Western blot analysis of HIP expression in HIP DNA-transfected NIH-3T3 cells. Total homogenates of RL95 cells (lane 1, 50 μg), parental NIH-3T3 cells (lane 2, 200 μg), and NIH-3T3 cells transiently transfected with HIP cDNA (lane 3, 200 μg) were separated on SDS-PAGE, and HIP expression was detected using Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Positions of the molecular mass markers (in kilodaltons) as well as the migration of the Mr 24,000 HIP protein are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression and distribution of HIP in different human cell lines and normal tissues were examined using both Northern blot analysis and Western blot analysis. Northern blot analysis using the HIP cDNA probe detected a single transcript of 1.3 kb in most human cell lines tested. HIP is expressed highly in most human epithelial cell lines including RL95, JAR, HeLa, HEC, and Ishikawa, as well as AFb-11, human fibroblastic cells, moderately in HUVEC (endothelial cells), and relatively low in HL60, a human leukemic cell line. HIP mRNA was not detectable in MDA-231, a human breast cancer cell line, and NCI-H69, a human lung epithelial cell line, or mouse NIT-3T3 cells (Fig. 5). Western blot analyses on several human cell lines also revealed a similar distribution pattern of HIP as that shown i"

From 1979 to 1992 the tropospheric ozone concentration apparently increased by 1.48 &plusmn; 0.40 percent per year or 0.21 &plusmn; 0.06 Dobson unit per year over South America and the surrounding oceans. An increase in biomass burning in the Southern Hemisphere can account for this trend in tropospheric ozone concentrations.

Measurements of the apparent affinity for IP3 (KappIP3) showed that the IPACC is dynamically controlled during cell stimulation and inhibition, i.e. agonists decreased and antagonists increased KappIP3. KappIP3 was also independently regulated by thimerosal, Ca2+ content of the stores, the incubation temperature, activation of protein kinases, and inhibition of protein phosphatases, but none of these mechanisms contributed to the regulation by agonists and antagonists. Incubating the cells with low concentration of GTPγS or AlF3 reproduced the effect of the agonist on KappIP3. Moreover, low [GTPγS] allowed activation of the IPACC by agonists at basal levels of IP3 and markedly impaired channel inactivation by antagonists. Channel sensitization by GTPγS also restored the ability of thimerosal to mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores with no change in cellular IP3 levels. The combination of low [GTPγS] and thimerosal locked the channel in an open, antagonist-insensitive state. All modulatory effects of GTPγS are independent of phospholipase C activation and IP3 production. We propose that the dynamic regulation of the IPACC by a G protein-dependent mechanism can play a major role in triggering and maintaining Ca2+ oscillations at low agonist concentrations when minimal or no changes in IP3 level take place.

Only partial correlation exists between the type of the [Ca2+]i signal generated and IP3 production.

A plausible explanation for Ca2+ release in the absence of IP3 production and in the face of high basal levels of IP3 is that low [agonists] trigger Ca2+ release by regulating the affinity of the IP3-activated Ca2+ channel (IPACC) for IP3. Studies in several cellular systems and the isolated and reconstituted IPACC showed the presence of multiple mechanism of channel regulation. Besides activation by IP3, the channel can be regulated by Ca2+ in a biphasic manner(10.Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 11.Bezprozvanny I.

Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) showed the intimate association of the cerebellar IPACC with calcineurin. The channel's affinity to IP3 was regulated by the combined action of protein kinase C and calcineurin(16.Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The same system was used to show that protein kinase A reduces the apparent affinity of the IPACC to IP3(14.Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1270-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The relationship between all the different modes of regulating IP3 affinity and Ca2+ release are not known. The above regulatory modes offer many mechanisms for the agonists to effect Ca2+ release and initiate Ca2+ oscillations without the need to increase IP3 levels. Indeed, in rat liver, prestimulation with agonists was shown to modify the behavior and/or affinity for IP3(26.Manger J.P. Claret M. Pietri F. Hilly M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8821-8826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently we showed that agonists can activate and antagonists inactivate the IPACC independent of IP3 metabolism(27.Zhang B.-X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Tortorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How such a regulation is achieved, what mechanism the agonists use to modulate Ca2+ release and the antagonists to terminate the release is not known. In the present studies we used agonist/antagonist responsive, streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized pancreatic acini to demonstrate that in the same cells the IPACC can be regulated by multiple and independent mechanisms. More importantly, a G protein-dependent mechanism is used by agonists to activate the channel at basal levels of IP3. Such activation dramatically impairs the ability of the antagonist in inactivating the IPACC. Once activated by the G protein-dependent mechanism, the channel can be locked in the open state by TMS. These findings point to the possible mechanism by which agonists can initiate Ca2+ release and Ca2+ oscillations with minimal changes in IP3 concentrations. Acini were prepared from a rat pancreas using standard collagenase digestion(27.Zhang B.-X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the pancreas was removed, minced, and incubated for 5-6 min at 37°C in a solution composed of (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 glucose, 10 pyruvate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor (solution A) and supplemented with 165 μg/ml collagenase P. After digestion, the acini were collected and washed by centrifugation and kept in solution A on ice until use. This procedure was identical with that described before(27.Zhang B.-X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Tortorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 100 mg acini were washed twice with a solution containing 145 mM KCl and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH) and once with the same solution that was treated with Chelex 100. The acini were transferred to a fluorimeter cuvette containing a warm (37°C) incubation medium composed of the Chelex-treated solution, 3 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 5 units/ml creatine kinase, 10 μM antimycin A, 10 μM oligomycin, 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μM Fluo 3, and 0.4 unit/ml SLO. Fluo 3 fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm. Calibration of Fluo 3 signals was as described before (27.Zhang B.-X. Tortorici G. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17132-17135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Tortorici G. Zhang B.-X. Xu X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29621-29628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Kd of 370 nM at 37°C. In several experiments, IP3-mediated Ca2+ release was measured at 0°C. For these experiments, the Kd for Fluo 3 was measured to be 215 nM, using EGTA to buffer and set the different [Ca2+]. The Kd values for EGTA at 0°C were taken from Martell and Smith(29.Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constructs. 3. Plenum Press, New York1976Google Scholar). Acini were washed and incubated in permeabilization medium as for measurement of Ca2+ uptake and release. After a 1.5-min incubation at 37°C, if required, TMS or U73122 was added, and, after a 2.5-min incubation, the cells were stimulated with agonists. At the indicated times, 100-μl samples were transferred to 100 μl of solution containing 15% perchloric acid, mixed and kept on ice for about 20 min to allow complete protein precipitation. After a 2-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. Standards of IP3 were prepared in permeabilization medium and processed in a similar manner. Perchloric acid was precipitated, and IP3 was extracted by the addition of 0.2 ml of tri-n-octylamine and 0.2 ml of freon. The samples were mixed vigorously, centrifuged for 30 s at 10,000 × g to separate the phases, and 15-25 μl of the upper layer was used for mass measurement of IP3 by a standard radioligand binding assay(13.Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10997-11001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maintained intact signaling system in the SLO-permeabilized cells allowed examination of the acute effect of agonists and antagonists on the IP3-activated Ca2+ channel (IPACC). Fig. 1 shows the properties and demonstrates the advantages of this experimental system. Pancreatic acinar cells are fully permeabilized to small molecules within 10-15 s of exposure to the concentration of SLO used and reduced [Ca2+] of the incubation medium to the 50-80 nM range within 2 min of incubation at 37°C. Addition of increasing concentrations of IP3 resulted in discrete events of [Ca2+] increase, typical of the quantal behavior of Ca2+ release (30.Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plotting the increments in medium [Ca2+] as a function of IP3 concentration showed a saturation kinetic with an apparent affinity for IP3 (KappIP3) of 0.43 ± 0.02 μM (Fig. 1a, Table 1) and a Hill coefficient of 1.42 ± 0.026 (n = 33). Stimulating the cells with low concentrations of the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, caused small Ca2+ release. Titration of Ca2+ release in these cells showed that carbachol stimulation decreases the KappIP3 by about 2.53-fold to 0.17 μM (Fig. 1b, Table 1), without changing the Hill coefficient. On the other hand, stimulation by maximal [carbachol] and inactivation by the antagonist atropine was followed by a 1.42-fold increase in the KappIP3 to about 0.61 ± 0.02 μM (Fig. 1c, Table 1), again without an apparent change in the Hill coefficient. Thus, agonist stimulation increases whereas antagonist inhibition decreases the apparent affinity of the IPACC to its ligand IP3. These changes in KappIP3 are independent of the total amount of Ca2+ release since the release was measured at the same Ca2+ buffering conditions.Tabled 1 To study the possible mechanism by which the agonist and antagonist regulate the KappIP3, we characterized the effect of different compounds reported to affect IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and the relationship between them. Examples of individual experiments are shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, and the combined results are summarized in Table 1. Treating the cells with relatively low concentrations of GTPγS, which by itself caused no or minimal Ca2+ release, decreased KappIP3 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2b, Table 1). Incubation with 10 μM GTPγS for 30 s increased the affinity for IP3 by about 2.4-fold. Thimerosal (TMS) was shown to induce [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic acini (21.Thorn P. Brady P. Llopis J.

Fig. 2c shows that unlike the case in intact cells, TMS (up to 500 μM) alone was unable to cause Ca2+ release in permeable cells. However, as little as 100 μM TMS decreased KappIP3 by about 4-fold (Table 1). Fig. 2c and Table 1 show the results with 100 μM TMS since this concentration was sufficient to maximally modify the effects of the agonist and GTPγS on IPACC (see below).Figure 2:Effect of GTPγS, TMS, Ca2+ load, and temperature on KappIP3. After completion of Ca2+ uptake and stabilization of medium [Ca2+] at about 55 nM (a), the cells were treated with 5 μM GTPγS (b) or 100 μM TMS (c). In experiment d, where indicated, two additions of 5 μM Ca2+ to the incubation medium were made. In experiment e, the acini were first incubated for 2.5 min at 37°C, then transferred to a thermostated cuvette and incubated for 3 min at 0°C before the first addition of IP3. The trace shows the last part of the incubation at 0°C under control conditions. After each treatment, the KappIP3 was measured by incremental additions of IP3. In experiments a-d, additions of IP3 were as those shown in trace a. The numbers in trace e indicate the concentrations of IP3 used for this titration. The results of all similar experiments are summarized in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of Ca2+ content in the IP3-mobilizable Ca2+ pool on IPACC has been studied extensively in several cell types(31.Missiaen L.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Fig. 2d shows that overloading the IP3-sensitive pool with Ca2+ caused small, but significant increase in the affinity to IP3 (see also Table 1). Similar KappIP3 was measured after one (not shown), two (Fig. 2d), and four pulses of 5 μM Ca2+ (not shown). Finally, the temperature of the incubation medium had a profound effect on KappIP3 but without changing the quantal nature of Ca2+ release. Thus, Fig. 2e shows that after 2.5 min of cell permeabilization and Ca2+ loading at 37°C and a subsequent 3-min incubation at 0°C, increasing concentrations of IP3 induce discrete and finite Ca2+ release events. The release was much slower than that at 37°C, which allowed a clear resolution of each Ca2+ release event. In separate experiments, Ca2+ release at submaximal [IP3] was followed up to 15 min with no sign of deviation from quantal behavior (not shown). Table 1 shows that at 0°C KappIP3 was reduced by about 8-fold. An important question concerning the various modes of regulation of KappIP3 was the relationship between them to determine whether they regulate the IPACC by the same or by independent mechanisms. Fig. 3 and Table 1 show the additive and independent effect of the different modes. Thus, overloading the Ca2+ pool did not prevent or reduce the effect of GTPγS (Fig. 3a), TMS (Fig. 3b), or low concentration of carbachol (Table 1) on the KappIP3. Similarly, the effect of low temperature on KappIP3 was additive with the effect of GTPγS (Fig. 3c), TMS (Fig. 3d), and carbachol (Table 1). Interestingly, addition of all agents after cooling to 0°C had no effect on KappIP3. The cells had to be treated with carbachol, GTPγS, or TMS at 37°C before cooling to observe their effect on KappIP3, indicating activation of biochemical pathways by all agents, including TMS, to regulate KappIP3. Several previous studies reported regulation of KappIP3 by activation of protein kinases(13.Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10997-11001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1993; 293: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of protein kinases in the SLO-permeabilized system, we tested the effect of several protein kinase activators (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, cAMP, cGMP), protein kinase inhibitors (genistein, H7), and phosphatase inhibitors (KT62, okadaic acid, cyclosporine) on KappIP3. None of these agents affected KappIP3 in unstimulated SLO-permeabilized cells. Further, these agents did not prevent or augment the effect of TMS, Ca2+ load, or low temperature (not shown). Surprisingly, all kinase activators and phosphatase inhibitors tested reduced or prevented the effect of GTPγS and carbachol, whereas the kinase inhibitors augmented the effect of the agonists. Table 1 lists the effect of the most effective compounds, okadaic acid and H7. Treatment with 0.12 μM okadaic acid largely prevented the effect of 30 s of treatment with 10 μM GTPγS. H7 at 0.5 mM, a concentration sufficient to inhibit most protein kinases(38.Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar), had no effect in unstimulated cells but it increased the effect of submaximal [GTPγS]. The lack of selectivity in the effect of kinase and phosphatase activators/inhibitors raises questions as to the physiological significance of these findings. However, their value for the present studies is in showing the similarity between their effects on GTPγS and carbachol, which were different from those of TMS, Ca2+ load, and low temperature. At this stage of the study, the possibility arose that the effects of carbachol and GTPγS on KappIP3 were simply due to partial stimulation of PLC and a persistent, small global or local increase in [IP3]. Three types of experiments were performed to exclude this possibility. The first is shown in Fig. 4, a-c, in which U73122 was used to inhibit PLC. U73122 did not reduce the effect of either carbachol (Fig. 4b), GTPγS (Fig. 4c), or TMS (not shown) on KappIP3, although it inhibited the small Ca2+ release evoked by low concentrations of carbachol. Table 2 shows that stimulation with 10 μM carbachol had a small effect on IP3, whereas U73122 slightly reduced the basal level of IP3. In the presence of U73122, IP3 level was not changed by carbachol or GTPγS. The second evidence is provided by the finding that prestimulation with low [GTPγS] had a marked effect on KappIP3 with minimal or no effect on IP3 levels, Ca2+ release, or the size of the IP3-mobilizable Ca2+ pool.Tabled 1 The third and most convincing evidence against stimulation of PLC by carbachol or GTPγS as the cause of the change in KappIP3 is shown in Fig. 4, d and e. In these experiments, 25 μg/ml IP3 competitive inhibitor heparin (39.Ghosh T.K. Eis P.S. Mullaney J.M. Ebert C.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11075-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Zhao H. Khademazad M. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14822-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were added to the incubation medium to increase the KappIP3 under control conditions from 0.43 μM (Table 1) to 1.67 μM (Fig. 4d). This should dilute the effect of any IP3 generated by GTPγS or carbachol stimulation by about 4-fold (1.67/0.43) to virtually eliminate the effect of the agents on KappIP3. Fig. 4e shows that this is not the case. Pretreatment with GTPγS in the presence of 25 μg/ml heparin had the same effect on KappIP3 as in control cells. Similar results were obtained with heparin concentrations between 5 and 50 μg/ml and with cells stimulated with 10 μM carbachol (not shown). Hence, together the three protocols indicate that carbachol and GTPγS modified KappIP3 independent of PLC stimulations. The finding that GTPγS can modulate KappIP3 independent of PLC activation suggested that activation of a G protein(s) by GTPγS was sufficient to modulate interaction of IPACC with its ligand. Further support for this notion was obtained by testing the effect of AlF3, which activates mainly heterotrimeric but not small G proteins(41.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). All the effects of GTPγS presented above and in subsequent figures could be initiated by 1 mM NaF + 0.2 μM AlCl3 (not shown). 10 mM NaF + 2 μM AlCl3 induced strong Ca2+ release comparable with that observed with 100 μM GTPγS (see below) or 2 mM carbachol. More dramatic evidence for an effect of G protein(s) activation on the activity of the IPACC was obtained when the effect of a low concentration of GTPγS on the response to carbachol, atropine, and TMS was studied. Fig. 5a shows that exposure of control or stimulated cells to 100 μM TMS in the absence of GTPγS augmented the effect of low concentrations of carbachol on Ca2+ release (Fig. 5, b and c), without affecting IP3 levels during the first 20 s of cell stimulation (Table 2). Performing complete concentration dependence of both IP3 production and Ca2+ release showed that pretreatment with 100 μM TMS had no effect on IP3 production while increasing the apparent affinity for carbachol-mediated Ca2+ release by about 6.3-fold. On the other hand, GTPγS profoundly modified the effect of carbachol. Treating the cells with as little as 2 μM GTPγS for 30 s was sufficient to cause maximal Ca2+ release by 10 μM carbachol (Fig. 5d). That the effect of GTPγS was independent of PLC activation became even more evident when the effect of 2 μM GTPγS on the dose response to carbachol and atropin"

Chemical modification of the enzyme by phenylglyoxal is accompanied by irreversible inhibition of enzymic activity. Our studies demonstrate that phenylglyoxal forms an enzyme-inhibitor complex and that the modification reaction is prevented in the presence of either Ins(1,4,5)P3, D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1, 3,4,5)P4) or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). Direct [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to the covalently modified enzyme is dramatically reduced. The stoichiometry of labeling with 14C-labeled phenylglyoxal is shown to be 2.1 mol of phenylglyoxal incorporated per mol of enzyme. A single [14C]phenylglyoxal-modified peptide is isolated following α-chymotrypsin proteolysis of the radiolabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The peptide sequence (i.e. M-N-T-R-C-P-A-W-C-D-R-I-L) corresponds to amino acids 340-352 of Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase. An estimate of the radioactivity of the different phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives shows the modified amino acids to be Arg-343 and Arg-350. Furthermore, two mutant enzymes were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the two arginyl residues to alanine, and both mutant enzymes have identical UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The two mutants (i.e. R343A and R350A) show increased Km values for Ins(1,4,5)P3 (10- and 15-fold, respectively) resulting in a dramatic loss in enzymic activity. In conclusion, we have directly identified two reactive arginyl residues as part of the active site of Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase.

We therefore investigated the possibility that active site arginines may play such a role in substrate binding for Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase. In this study, modification and inactivation of human Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase by phenylglyoxal, an arginine-specific chemical modification reagent (see (26.Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), was shown to be prevented by Ins(1,4,5)P3. We identified two essential arginines, i.e. Arg-343 and Arg-350, taking part of the sequence segment R-X-P-A-W-C-D-R-I-L. This segment appears to be crucial for enzymic activity, especially for substrate binding. The data have been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of both arginyl residues. This represents the first direct identification of an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase active site peptide. α-Chymotrypsin (tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethane-treated), heptafluorobutyric acid, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Sigma. Phenylglyoxal monohydrate was from Janssen Chimica, and [7-14C]phenylglyoxal (24 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Acetonitrile was from Romil Chemicals. Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and 2,3-BPG were from Boehringer Mannheim. [2-3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (3.3 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Phosphocellulose paper P81 was from Whatman. pTrcHis A expression vector was from Invitrogen. Top 10 and HB 101 strains as well as Ni-NTA-agarose resin were from Qiagen. All other reagents were of the highest available grade. Native bovine brain enzyme was purified as previously reported(27.Verjans B. Lecocq R. Moreau C. Erneux C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The complete 412-amino acid-long coding region of human Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (plasmid ECH10 in (19.De Smedt F. Verjans B. Mailleux P. Erneux C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) was subcloned in pTrcHis A expression vector. It generated plasmid ECH11, which was used to transform competent Top 10 host bacteria. An overnight 5-ml culture was used to inoculate 1.2-liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight culture at 37°C, it was diluted to an OD of 0.6 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-β-galactopyranoside was added at 0.5 mM for an 8-h culture at 30°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min, resuspended in 50 ml of buffer R (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 12 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml Pefabloc, 5 μM leupeptin) per liter of culture and lysed by sonication (three times 15 s at 4°C). The cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The crude lysate was applied to 50 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resin equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 12 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml Pefabloc, 5 μM leupeptin). The column was washed with buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole. Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase was eluted in buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole to obtain 8 mg of pure enzyme per liter of initial bacteria culture. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Petterson(28.Petterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7139) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of the enzyme with anti-(human brain Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase) antibodies was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and corresponding colorimetric methods(29.Kincaid R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 627-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When the pure recombinant enzyme was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single 43-kDa band was stained by Coomassie Blue and recognized by Western blotting (data not shown). Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 was 21 μM, which is comparable to the purified native enzyme (see Table 1).Tabled 1 Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using sequential polymerase chain reactions. Forward and reverse primers were 5′-GGCAAAGAGATCTACTCGG-3′ (BglII restriction site is underlined) and 5′-CTAGGGTACCACGTCACTGCACGACAC-3′ (KpnI restriction site is underlined), respectively. In brief, original wild-type DNA (plasmid ECH11) was used as template for a first PCR step (25 cycles). To generate mutant plasmid ECH11R343A, two PCR products were obtained separately using forward primer and mutated primer 1 (5′-TGGGCACGCGGTGTTCATGTACTG-3′, with the mutations in bold), and reverse primer and mutated primer 2 (5′-GAACACCGCGTGCCCAGCCTGG-3′, with the mutations in bold), respectively. Both purified PCR fragments encompassing the mutation were annealed with each other and extended by mutually primed synthesis using forward and reverse primers in a second unique PCR step (25 cycles). To generate mutant plasmid ECH11R350A, the procedure was the same, exept that the two mutated primers 1 and 2 were 5′-TGAGGATGGCGTCACACCAGGCTG-3′ and 5′-GTGTGACGCCATCCTCATGTC-3′ (the mutations are indicated in bold), respectively. Both final mutated PCR fragments were subcloned in wild-type plasmid ECH11 after digestion with BglII and KpnI restriction enzymes. The presence of the mutations and the absence of any undesired mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The two mutated plasmids were expressed in HB 101 host bacteria. R343A and R350A mutant enzymes were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose resin by the procedure described above. Purified native and expressed Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase were preincubated at 23°C in a final volume of 50 μl in buffer M (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 12 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing various concentrations of phenylglyoxal (0-20 mM) for different times (0-20 min). At the indicated times of incubation, 5-μl aliquots of reaction mixture were removed, diluted 10,000-fold in dilution buffer (50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and directly assayed for remaining enzyme activity. In other experiments, Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase was preincubated in buffer M containing 20 mM phenylglyoxal in the presence or absence of various concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (0-100 μM), Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (0-30 μM), or 2,3-BPG (0-5 mM) before activity assay. Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activity measured in the absence of MgCl2 at 23°C was less than 10% as compared to the enzymic activity measured in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 at 37°C (data not shown). The assay mixture contained 50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3, and 1,500 cpm of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37°C. Separation of [3H]Ins(1, 4)P2 from [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 was achieved on Dowex columns as previously reported(30.Erneux C. Delvaux A. Moreau C. Dumont J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 143: 351-358Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (1 μg) was incubated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (40,000 cpm), 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) in the presence or absence of unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 (0-75 μM), Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (0-30 μM), or 2,3-BPG (0-5 mM) in a total volume of 50 μl. After 2 min at 4°C, 10 μl of bovine γ-globulins (50 mg/ml) and 100 μl of a 30% 8-kDa poly(ethylene glycol), 0.15 M NaCl solution were added for 5 min at 4°C. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g (Eppendorf centrifuge at 4°C). The pellets were washed twice with 100 μl of 15% 8-kDa poly(ethyleneglycol), 0.075 M NaCl solution before being resuspend in 1 ml of water and 5 ml of scintillation mixture. Expressed Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated at 23°C in a final volume of 200 μl for different times (0-30 min) in buffer M with 20 mM [14C]phenylglyoxal. After different incubation times, aliquots (10 μl) were removed for the determination of protein-bound radioactivity by spotting onto phosphocellulose paper and precipitating in 75 mM ice-cold phosphoric acid under agitation. The paper filters were washed five times in 75 mM phosphoric acid and dried before radioactivity was estimated in the presence of 10 ml of Insta-Gel II Plus(31.Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In the same experiment, aliquots (5 μl) were removed and directly assayed for remaining enzyme activity. The protective effect of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, or 2,3-BPG on chemical modification was determined by incubating Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase with 20 mM [14C]phenylglyoxal in the presence and absence of 70 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3, 30 μM Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, or 5 mM 2,3-BPG. The proportion of labeled protein was estimated as described above. Expressed Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase was concentrated to 1.7 mg/ml using an Amicon Centricon 10 centrifugal concentrator. Enzyme (150 μg) was incubated at 23°C for 30 min in a final volume of 200 μl in the presence or absence of 70 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3 in buffer M with 10 mM [14C]phenylglyoxal. The modified arginyl residues were then reduced by adding NaBH4 to a final concentration of 5 mM and allowing the reaction mixture to stand for 2 h at 30°C(32.Wells T.N.C. Scully P. Magnenat E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped at 4°C with 1 ml of 10% (mass/volume) trichloroacetic acid and left on ice for 45 min. Each sample was centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g (Eppendorf centrifuge), and the protein pellet was washed with 1 ml of acetone. After drying the pellet (SpeedVac concentrator), the protein was dissolved in 50 μl of 8 M urea, 0.4 M NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), diluted to 200 μl with water, and digested for 12 h at 30°C with 3.5 μg of α-chymotrypsin. Chymotryptic fragments of [14C]phenylglyoxal-labeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on an Alltech Macrosphere 300 A C18 5U column (2.1 mm × 250 mm) by eluting with a gradient of solvent A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid) and solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min as follows: 100% solvent A for 10 min, followed by a linear acetonitrile gradient (0-72% solvent B over 85 min) and finally 100% solvent B for 5 min. The elution was followed by measuring the absorbance at 214 nm with an Applied Biosystems 1000S Diode Array detector, and each peak was collected separately. A 3-μl aliquot of each peak fraction was counted with 10 ml of scintillation mixture to estimate the radioactivity associated with each peak. The radioactive 115-μl peak fraction (corresponding to the [14C]phenylglyoxal-labeled peptide of which radioactive modification was totaly protected by Ins(1,4,5)P3) was concentrated by SpeedVac to 20 μl and diluted in 0.5 ml of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was further purified onto the same Alltech C18 column and eluted with the same gradient described above except that 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid was replaced by 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 3-μl aliquot of each peak fraction was counted for radioactivity. The amino acid sequence of the labeled peptide was determined by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 477A peptide sequenator, with on-line quantification of the phenylthiohydantoin derivatives by HPLC. Thirty percent of the amino acid phenylthiohydantoin derivatives was collected in the internal fraction collector and counted for radioactivity to identify the labeled amino acid residues. All spectra were collected in a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter in a 0.01-cm cell at 20°C. Scans were collected with a bandwith of 1 nm, a sensitivity of 10 millidegrees, and a time response of 0.125 s. For each enzyme preparation, the final spectra is the result of 12 accumulated scans. Samples were concentrated using an Amicon Centricon 10 centrifugal concentrator and diluted to 1 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min to remove any precipitated protein. The A280 was measured to scale the CD data to the same protein concentration. Secondary structures were estimated by the method outlined in the Jasco manual using seven reference spectra. The arginine-specific modifying reagent phenylglyoxal inactivated native and recombinant Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The time course of inactivation was very similar for both native (Fig. 1A) and recombinant enzyme (Fig. 1B). The linear plots of the logarithm of residual enzymic activity versus the reaction time indicate that the time-dependent decrease in activity displayed pseudo first-order kinetics (Fig. 1). This behavior could be indicative of a two-step mechanism of inactivation described in, where a rapid reversible binding of phenylglyoxal (I) to the enzyme (E) precedes the covalent modification to an inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI∗).REACTION 1 Figure 1:Time course of inactivation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase by phenylglyoxal. Purified native (A) and expressed (B) Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase were incubated at 23°C (pH 7.4) in the presence of indicated concentrations of phenylglyoxal. Aliquots were removed at indicated times and assayed for residual activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rate constants (k) were calculated from plots of the negative natural logarithm of residual activity versus time. The results are from one representative experiment out of three.

(1/k)=(KI/k2)(1/[I])+(1/k2)(Eq. 2) The linearity of a secondary plot of (1/k) versus (1/[phenylglyoxal]) using the data from the primary plot of Fig. 1 indicated that phenylglyoxal binding takes place through the two-step mechanism of interaction described by (Fig. 1C). To further investigate the interaction of phenylglyoxal with Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, protection from labeling was examined by incubating the enzyme with 20 mM phenylglyoxal in the presence of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (0-100 μM) (Fig. 2). Ins(1,4,5)P3 almost completely protected against phenylglyoxal-induced inactivation of the enzyme. The rate of inactivation decreased with increasing substrate Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration, reaching a limit value at approximately 70 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3. Protection was also provided by the other substrate Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and the competitive inhibitor 2,3-BPG (data not shown). These results suggest that at least one reactive arginyl residue is involved in substrate binding. Expressed Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase was covalently modified in the presence of 20 mM phenylglyoxal for 10 min at 23°C. The same treatment in the absence of phenylglyoxal was used to obtain unmodified enzyme as control. Direct substrate binding to the enzyme could be observed. It is displaced by increasing concentrations of unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3; 50% displacement was reached at approximately 28 μM (Fig. 3). The same was observed with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and 2,3-BPG (50% displacement at approximately 3 μM and 0.3 mM, respectively; data not shown). Covalent modification by phenylglyoxal dramatically reduced [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to the enzyme. This effect depended on the concentration of phenylglyoxal used during modification reaction; after modification in the presence of 20 mM phenylglyoxal, [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding was completely prevented (Fig. 3). Since it appeared that phenylglyoxal interacts with the active site of the enzyme, we established the stoichiometry of this covalent modification using 14C-radiolabeled phenylglyoxal. Fig. 4A shows a time course of phenylglyoxal incorporation in the presence or absence of 70 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3. The curve showed an exponential approach to a limiting value of 2.1 arginyl residues modified in the absence of substrate. Ins(1,4,5)P3 almost completely abolished phenylglyoxal incorporation (Fig. 4A). Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and 2,3-BPG also protected against phenylglyoxal incorporation (data not shown). The amount of incorporated phenylglyoxal in the absence of substrate at each time point was measured as a function of the residual Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activity (Fig. 4B). This linear plot showed a direct correlation between the loss of enzyme activity and the incorporation of phenylglyoxal. Extrapolation of the data to 100% loss of enzyme activity indicated that activity was completely abolished when 2.1 mol of modifying reagent/mol of Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase had been incorporated. To determine the sites of modification by phenylglyoxal, the enzyme was radiolabeled with 10 mM [14C]phenylglyoxal in the presence and absence of 70 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3 and extensively digested with α-chymotrypsin. Fig. 5, A and B, shows the separation of the resulting peptides by reverse-phase HPLC after labeling in the absence of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the amount of radioactivity contained within each peak. The appearance of the HPLC profile suggested that complete digestion by the protease was obtained (Fig. 5A). After labeling in the absence of Ins(1,4,5)P3, a single major radioactive peak was observed with a retention time of 48.2 min (Fig. 5B). Since two arginyl residues were covalently modified, we supposed that this single peptide contained both modified residues. In the presence of 70 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3, the HPLC profile was identical to the profile shown in Fig. 5A (data not shown) but the extent of [14C]phenylglyoxal incorporation was greatly reduced (at least 16-fold) (Fig. 5C). Preparation of peptide fraction suitable for sequence analysis required an additional HPLC purification using a different ion pairing agent. The radioactive fraction that was protected by Ins(1,4,5)P3 gave only one major radioactive peak upon rechromatography (Fig. 6). The sites of modification of the radioactive peptide were elucidated by automated gas phase Edman degradation sequencing. Fig. 7 shows the observed amino acid sequence, the radioactivity present in the first 13 cycles, and the yield quantified for each cycle. The major radioactivity appeared at cycles 4 and 11. Some carryover of radioactivity was observed into the two subsequent fractions, which was probably due to incomplete cleavage of the modified residues in cycles 4 and 11. Comparison of the obtained microsequence (M-N-T-R-/-P-A-W-/-D-R-I-L) with the predicted protein sequence of human brain Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (12.Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that this sequence corresponded to amino acids 340-352 and that [14C]phenylglyoxal was covalently attached to Arg-343 and Arg-350. The last residue of the peptide is a leucine residue in spite of the fact this peptide is a chymotryptic digest; the most likely explanation is that low specificity protease activity cleaved at leucine under extensive digestion. Moreover, the yield of phenylthiohydantoin-arginines in the amino acid analyzer was much lower than for the other amino acids in the sequence, consistent with their chemical modification by phenylglyoxal (Fig. 7).Figure 6:Purification of the labeled peptide by reverse-phase HPLC.

Secondary structure analysis by circular dichroism revealed no change in the overall structure of the mutants when compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 8). The spectra were also identical when comparing unmodified enzyme and inactive enzyme after modification by phenylglyoxal (data not shown). As shown in Table 1, the Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 for the wild-type enzyme was 21 μM. The Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 for the R343A and R350A mutants were 205 and 320 μM, respectively, i.e. 10- and 15-fold increases as compared with the wild-type value. Wild-type enzyme had a maximal velocity of 191 μmol/min/mg (Table 1). The R343A and R350A mutants had maximal velocities of 31 and 237 μmol/min/mg, which correspond to a 6-fold decrease and a 20% increase, respectively, as compared with the wild-type value. In this study, we aimed to identify active site residues interacting with the substrate for human Type I InsP3 5-phosphatase. This was investigated in a first step without any assumption concerning the localization of reactive arginyl residues by covalent chemical modification with phenylglyoxal, and in a second step by site-directed mutagenesis of the previously identified arginyl residues. Inactivation kinetics of the enzyme by phenylglyoxal-induced chemical modification are identical for native and expressed protein. Our results indicate that the amount of phenylglyoxal labeling paralleled the loss in enzyme activity and that the labeling involves two residues. The peptide mapping of the protein, which had been labeled with radioactive phenylglyoxal, enabled us to find a peptide which was preferentially labeled in the absence of substrate. We have identified two reactive arginyl residues within the active site of Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, i.e. Arg-343 and Arg-350 (Fig. 9). The identification of both reactive amino acids is supported by two lines of evidence. First, the phenylthiohydantoin residues corresponding to the cycles where the modified arginines should elute contained radioactivity. Second, the yield of unmodified arginine in these cycles was particularly low. The covalent modification results in both an inactivation of the enzyme and a drastic decrease in Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding. This strongly suggests that the Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding domain of human Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase is the target of the chemical modification. The role of Arg-343 and Arg-350 in substrate binding to the enzyme is also supported by the catalytic properties of the two mutants where Arg-343 and Arg-350 have been mutated to alanine. The similarity in the induction yields and circular dichroism spectra between the mutant and the wild-type enzymes indicate that mutation of these arginyl residues did not affect the gross secondary structure of the enzymes. However, the R343A and R350A mutants display a higher Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 as compared to the wild-type enzyme (10- and 15-fold, respectively). The dramatic decrease in affinity for Ins(1,4,5)P3 for both the R343A and R350A mutant enzymes indicates that both Arg-343 and Arg-350 are involved in binding Ins(1,4,5)P3. Although both mutants have decreased affinities for substrate, they exhibit distinct effects on the Vmax for Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase. The more important change in Vmax for R343A mutant enzyme suggest that Arg-343 may also be involved in Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase catalysis. Taking together, our data clearly indicate for the first time that Arg-343 and Arg-350 are two reactive residues involved in Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding by human Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase. A lysine-rich Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-binding motif (R/K-R/K-T-K-X-R/K-R/K-K-T) has been identified in synaptotagmin II(35.Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a polybasic motif has also been proposed to be necessary for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding (R/K-X-X-X-X-K-X-R/K-R/K) and allosteric Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to actin-binding proteins and phospholipase C-δ1, respectively(36.Yu F.-X.

The pleckstrin homology domain is a noncatalytic protein module of approximately 120 amino acids which present the ability to bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3(38.Gibson T.J. Hyvönen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The specific function of the pleckstrin homology domain has not yet been elucidated. However, none of those motives are found in the amino acid sequence of Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, nor in other Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding proteins such as Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinases and Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor/calcium channels. The primary function of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding domain is supposed to anchor the inositol cycle and the three phosphates in position 1, 4, and 5. This probably occurs through locking the inositol cycle in a hydrophobic pocket and binding the phosphates with positively charged residues. Arg-343 and Arg-350 of Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase could play an active role in this last interaction. Indeed, the use of arginine to stabilize the binding of the phosphate moieties of the substrate is quite a common occurrence in proteins for which the three-dimensional structure is known, such as 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (39.Evans P.R. Hudson P.J. Nature. 1979; 279: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), glycogen phosphorylase b(40.Hajdu J. Acharya K.R. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Barford D. Oikonomakos N.G. Klein H. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. An arginyl residue of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase belongs to the active site where the 6-phosphate group is bound: this basic residue is conserved in inositol monophosphatase sequence, which shares a very similar secondary structure topology with fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase(41.Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1080-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 have a net charge of −3 and −4, respectively, both molecules can interact with a cluster of basic amino acids, at least with Arg-343 and Arg-350. Results of the present study indicate that Arg-343 and Arg-350 in Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase take part of an active peptide which may form a core where electrostatic and weak group (inositol ring)-specific interactions take place. Molecular cloning and structural studies revealed that Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase and PtdIns 3-kinase (for review, see (42.Stephens L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) present strong substrate specificities and do not share any sequence homology. Although primary structure corresponding to inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases present little amino acid identity, it is intriguing to note that both reactive arginyl residues Arg-343 and Arg-350 (in human Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase sequence) identified in this study take part of a COOH-terminal sequence segment, i.e.343R-C-P-A-W-C-D-R-I-L352 (active site arginines are indicated in bold), which is well conserved between sequences corresponding to inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (Fig. 9). It would be of interest to investigate the effect of phenylglyoxal on the enzymic activity of other phosphatases involved in the dephosphorylation of inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate molecules since these enzymes may present structural similarities. These 5-phosphatases bind and hydrolyze the C-5 phospho group of substrates, i.e. Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, each presenting an inositol cycle with at least two phospho groups in position 4 and 5 of the inositol ring. We suppose that other amino acid regions in Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, probably also located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, may serve together with residues 343-352 to form a more precise conformation which is critical for the specific binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. However, the presence of a conserved active peptide within the primary structure of inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases suggests that this family of enzymes present common features in the mechanism of substrate binding and/or catalysis. This 10-amino acid-long peptide, which is critical for substrate binding in Type I Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, could represent a diagnostic motif for this family of 5-phosphatases.

Biol. Chem. 270, 8152-8157 and Bose, S., Seetharam, S., Hammond, T., and Seetharam, B.(1995) Biochem. J. 310, 923-929). The current studies were carried out to define the mechanism of TC II-R dimerization. Both the mature TC II-R (62 kDa) and the enzymatically deglycosylated TC II-R (45-47 kDa) demonstrated optimal association and formed dimers of molecular masses of 95 and 124 kDa, respectively, at 22°C when bound to egg PC vesicles containing at least 10 mol % of cholesterol. Mature TC II-R dimerized upon insertion into synthetic phosphatidylcholine vesicles of different fatty acyl chain length (dimyristoyl, dipalmitoyl, and disteroyl phosphatidylcholine) in the absence or the presence of cholesterol at temperatures below or above their transition temperatures, respectively. Dimerization of TC II-R also occurred with vesicles prepared using lipid extract from the plasma but not microsomal membranes. Cholesterol depletion of native intestinal plasma membranes or its enrichment in the microsomal membranes resulted in the in situ conversion of the 124-kDa dimer to the 62-kDa monomer or of the monomer into the dimer form, respectively. Treatment of plasma membranes with phospholipase A2 resulted in the conversion of the dimer form of the receptor to the monomer form and spin label studies using 1-palmitoyl, 12 doxylsteroyl phosphatidylcholine revealed that interactions of TC II-R with PC vesicles increased order around the probe. Based on these results we suggest that dimerization of TC II-R is mediated by its interactions with a rigid more ordered lipid bilayer membrane, is regulated in plasma membranes by cholesterol levels, and is independent of glycosylation-mediated folding.

Rothenberg S.P. Pan Y.-C. E. Stein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15455-15460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue/cellular uptake of TC II-Cbl occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis (2.Youngdhal-Turner P. Risenberg L.E. Allen R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is mediated via TC II-R expressed in the plasma membranes of all tissues(3.Nexo E. Hollenberg M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 628: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The importance of plasma membrane expression of TC II-R in plasma transport of Cbl is borne out by our recent observation (6.Bose S. Komorowski R. Seetharam S. Gilfix B. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4195-4200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that in vivo, functional inactivation of TC II-R by its circulating antibody results in the development of Cbl deficiency. Recent studies (4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) from our laboratory have shown that TC II-R exists as a dimer of molecular mass of 124 kDa in all tissue membranes and that the dimerization of TC II-R is due to noncovalent interaction between two monomers of molecular mass of 62 kDa and in vitro is mediated by its interactions with lipid bilayer prepared using egg PC and cholesterol. Our recent immunoblot studies (4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5.Bose S. Seetharam S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4195-4200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have identified TC II-R dimers in the tissue membranes across species, and in the rat kidney, the 62 kDa monomer was present only in the microsomes, whereas the 124-kDa dimer form of the receptor was the only form of TC II-R present in the apical and basolateral membranes, intermicrovillar clefts, and clathrin-coated vesicles. Neither the monomer nor the dimer form of the receptor was detected in the light endosomes and lysosomes(5.Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The steady state level of TC II-R dimer is 8-10-fold higher than that of TC II-R monomer in all the tissue membranes tested(5.Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies (4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5.Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have indicated that dimerization of TC II-R is a rapid, post-microsomal event and that the inability of the TC II-R to dimerize in the microsomal membranes could be due to (a) lack of lipid microenvironment essential for its dimerization, (b) improper folding of TC II-R due to incomplete maturation of its N- and/or O-linked sugars, or (c) weaker interaction between the two monomers such that the treatment with SDS results in the disassociation of the dimer.The present investigation was carried out to further explore the mechanism of TC II-R dimerization and to examine which of the abovementioned possibilities are operational in mediating the noncovalent interaction between the two monomers of TC II-R. The results of the current study show that (a) in vitro, the dimerization of TC II-R is regulated by a rigid, more ordered lipid bilayer, (b) in vivo, higher cholesterol levels of plasma membranes provide a more ordered lipid microenvironment to facilitate the dimerization of TC II-R, and (c) the dimerization of TC II-R is not influenced by folding alterations due to its N- and O-glycosylation.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe following chemicals were purchased as indicated: egg PC, dimyristoyl PC, dipalmitoyl PC, disteroyl PC, 1-palmitoyl 12-doxylsteroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Alabaster, AL); [57Co] cyanocobalamin (15 μCi/μg) and carrier-free Na2+125I (Amersham Corp.); peptide N-glycosidase from Flavobacterium menengosepticum and O-glycosidase from Diplococcus pneumoniae (Boehringer Mannheim); phospholipase A2 from bee venom, phospholipase C from Clostridium Welchi, phospholipase D from peanut, sialidase from Clostridium Perifringens, dihydrocholesterol, 7-keto cholesterol, and protein A (Sigma).Pure TC II-R was obtained from human placenta essentially as described earlier(4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Monospecific antiserum to TC II-R was prepared in rabbits as described earlier(4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ligand TC II used in the TC II-R assays was partially purified from human plasma according to Lindemans et al.(7.Lindemans J. Van Kappel J. Abels J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1986; 46: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TC II-R activity in the lipid vesicles was determined using human TC II-[57Co]Cbl (2 pmol) and the Triton X-100 extracts of the reconstituted vesicles by the DEAE-Sephadex method of Seligman and Allen(8.Seligman P.A. Allen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1766-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Isolation of Rat Intestinal Microsomal and Basolateral MembranesRat intestinal mucosal microsomes were prepared from a 5% (w/v) homogenate of intestinal mucosa prepared in 0.25 M sucrose containing 5 mM EDTA and 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 2 h, and the pellet obtained was washed in the same buffer once and re-pelleted membranes were used as microsomes. The microsomal membrane contained less than 0.5-1% of the apical and basolateral markers, alkaline phosphatase, and Na+/K+-ATPase, respectively. The basolateral membranes were prepared using differential and sorbitol gradient centrifugation according to Walters et al.(9.Walters J.R.F. Horvath P.J. Weiser M.M. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 34-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These membranes were enriched 12-fold for the marker Na+/K+-ATPase with a recovery of 14% and contained <1-2% of the apical markers, alkaline phosphatase, and γ glutamyl transpeptidase.Lipid Extraction and Modulation of Lipid Composition of Microsomal and Basolateral MembranesMicrosomal or basolateral membranes (5-10 mg of protein) in 2 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was treated with 16 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:1), vortexed, and allowed to stand for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm, and the organic layer was removed for total phospholipid and cholesterol estimations. Total phospholipid was estimated following hydrolysis of the nitrogen dried lipid extract with 70% perchloric acid and estimating inorganic phosphate by the method of Barlett(10.Barlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol in these membrane lipid extracts were determined by the method of Courchaine et al.(11.Courchaine A.J. Miller W.H. Stein D.B. Clin. Chem. 1959; 5: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Cholesterol depletion in the basolateral membranes were carried out as follows. Basolateral membrane (2.5 mg of protein) in 0.5 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 140 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was treated with 5 μg of digitonin for 15 min at 22°C. The membrane collected by centrifugation was washed three times with 2 ml of Tris-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. Cholesterol and phospholipid levels were estimated in the lipid extract of digitonin treated membranes as described above.Cholesterol enrichment of the microsomal membranes was carried out as follows. Cholesterol (25 μg) in chloroform was dried under nitrogen. Microsomal membrane (1 mg of protein) in 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer was added, vortexed, and incubated for 1 h at either 37 or 5°C. The membrane thus treated was collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in the same buffer. In some experiments, cholesterol was replaced by its analogues, dihydrocholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol. Phospholipid and cholesterol (or sterol) levels in these membranes were determined as before.Phospholipase digestion of basolateral membranes was carried out as follows. Basolateral membranes (300 μg) in 50 μl were digested with phospholipase A2 (15 units, 30 min), phospholipase C (7.5 units, 240 min), or phospholipase D (13 units, 30 min).Reconstitution of Pure TC II-R in Synthetic PC and Native Membrane Lipid VesiclesLiposomes were prepared using egg PC (2 μmol) alone or egg PC mixed with cholesterol (molar ratio, 1:0.01-1:0.5) and TC II-R (1 μg) by the cholate dialysis method of Low and Zilversmit (12.Low M.G. Zilversmit D.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3913-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as described recently(4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of pure TC II-R with DMPC, DPPC, and DSPC vesicles was carried out using a similar protein to PC ratio and a PC to cholesterol ratio of 2:1. The reconstitution experiments were carried out at 5 and 37°C, 22 and 45°C, and 22 and 65°C when the PC used were DMPC, DPPC, and DSPC, respectively. The dialysis and ultracentrifugation of all the samples were performed at 22°C. After dialysis the liposomally bound TC II-R was collected by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 2 h. Liposomes were also prepared using pure TC II-R, and the lipid was extracted from the native rat microsomal and basolateral membranes isolated using chloroform:methanol mixture (2:1). In each case the total phospholipid used was 2 μmol, which corresponded to a phospholipid/cholesterol (molar ratio) of 26:1 and 1.6:1 in the microsomal and basolateral membrane lipid extracts, respectively. In some experiments, prior to reconstitution, pure TC II-R was digested with N-glycosidase or with sialidase followed by treatment with O-glycosidase as follows. Pure TC II-R (10 μg) was precipitated with 75% ice-cold ethanol. The pellet obtained was resuspended in 50 μl of 0.075 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.6, containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% SDS. The reaction mixture was heated at 95°C for 3 min and cooled. N-Octylglucoside (0.6%) and 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mM) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 37°C with PNGase F (0.6 units). Pure TC II-R (10 μg) was digested with sialidase (5 milliunits) for 2 h at 37°C, and the reaction was stopped by heating the sample for 3 min at 95°C. The sample was cooled, and SDS (0.1%) was added and further incubated with O-glycanase (25 milliunits) for 12 h at 37°C. The reaction mixture was dialyzed for 2 h, and the dialyzed sample was used for reconstitution.Immunoblot Analysis of TC II-R Monomer and Dimer Bound to Native Membranes or Lipid VesiclesImmunoblot analysis were carried out to detect the monomer and dimer forms of TC II-R present in the native membranes as follows. Native intestinal total membranes (100-300 μg protein) were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (7.5%) according to Lammeli(13.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred at 90 V to nitrocellulose membranes for various time intervals (15-90 min). The filters were probed with 1000-fold diluted TC II-R antiserum and 32I-protein A. Protein A was iodinated as described earlier (4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5.Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 10-12 μCi/μg. The bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by Ambis radio imaging system. A standard immunoblot was carried out using pure TC II-R, and the blot was quantified and found to be linear in the range 10-1600 ng of TC II-R with corresponding radioimage intensity between 0.006-1 × 106 counts or arbitrary units of 0.3-50 (1 unit = 20,000 counts). When the basolateral (5 μg) or microsomal (50 μg) membranes or lipid vesicle bound TC II-R (25-100 ng) were subjected to immunoblot analysis, the transfer to nitrocellulose membranes was carried out for either 45 or 90 min to detect optimal amounts of the monomer or the dimer species, respectively, present in these membranes(4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting experiments using either native membranes or lipid vesicles were carried out at least three times to confirm the results, particularly the relative mobilities of the two species of TC II-R. In all immunoblotting experiments, the distance between the dimer and the monomer forms of TC II-R was measured and was found to vary by less than 5%.Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) SpectroscopyEPR spectroscopy was performed on a Varian Century Series E-109 spectrometer (Varian Associates Inc., Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a TE011 rectangular cavity. Samples were contained in a quartz flat cell (Wilmad, Buena, NJ). Data acquisition was controlled by a PC utilizing the VIKING software package (C. C. Felix, Biophysics Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI). Spectra were obtained using 10 mW incident microwave power and a 100 kHz magnetic field modulation of 0.32 Gauss. Field modulation and sweep widths were calibrated with Fremy's salt (potassium nitrosodisulfonate, Aldrich).RESULTSImmunoblot Analysis of TC II-R Monomer and Dimer FormsTo develop a convenient method for separating the TC II-R monomer and dimer forms, we first utilized the rather unusual property of TC II-R to stay as dimer when treated with SDS(4.Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, in order to optimize the conditions for the recovery of the monomer and dimer forms of TC II-R during immunoblotting, the proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 15-90 min (Fig. 1). Under identical conditions of electrophoresis and time of exposure to x-ray film, the times required for the optimal transfer of the dimer and the monomer forms were 90 (Fig. 1A, top) and 45 min (Fig. 1A, bottom), respectively. However, in order to examine whether both forms of TC II-R can be detected together in a single gel, a transfer time of 60 min was used for immunoblotting of intestinal mucosal total membrane proteins separated on SDS-PAGE. With a transfer time of 60 min, both the monomer and the dimer forms could be seen in the same gel (Fig. 1B). Quantitation of the immunoblots shown in Fig. 1A revealed that the dimer to monomer ratio was 8:1, whereas it was 2:1 for the data shown in Fig. 1B. These results show that a time frame chosen to detect both the monomer and the dimer in the same gel will not quantitatively reflect the actual amount of each species of TC II-R present in any given membrane fraction. Thus, in all subsequent immunoblot analysis, the transfer times employed were 45 and 90 min to visualize the monomer and the dimer forms of TC II-R, respectively.Interactions of Pure TC II-R with Egg PC Vesicles: Effect of Cholesterol ConcentrationPure TC II-R of molecular mass of 62 kDa was reconstituted into egg PC liposomes containing increasing mol % of cholesterol to study the effect of cholesterol on the lipid vesicle association of TC II-R and its molecular mass following its association with these lipid vesicles. At 22°C in the absence of added cholesterol, there was no association of TC II-R activity with egg PC lipid bilayer. However, with the increase in the cholesterol content of the liposomes from 1 to 50 mol %, there was an increase from 25 to 80% of receptor activity associated with the lipid bilayer and as a consequence, TC II-R activity in the supernatant fraction decreased by similar amounts (Fig. 2a).Figure 2:TC II-R association with egg PC vesicles containing increasing mol % of cholesterol. Pure placental TC II-R (1 μg) was added during the preparation of egg PC vesicles. Cholesterol levels in these vesicles were increased from 0-50 mol %, and the concentration of egg PC used was 2 μmol. Following dialysis the liposomally bound TC II-R was collected by centrifuging at 150,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant (○) and the lipid pellet (•) were assayed (a) for TC II-[57Co]Cbl binding. The liposomal pellet was separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted, and the bands were quantified by AMBIS radioimaging system (b). One unit of TC II-R associated is equal to 20,000 counts of image density. The reconstitution experiment using various concentration of cholesterol was carried out in triplicates. The results shown represent the means ± S.D. from duplicate assays from each of these reconstitution experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Upon SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the liposomally bound TC II-R (Fig. 3), the monomer form of 62 kDa was associated with the liposomes prepared with using 1 (Fig. 3a, lane 2) or 2 mol % (Fig. 3a, lane 1) of cholesterol (Fig. 3a) but not with the liposomes prepared using >10 mol % of cholesterol (Fig. 3a, lanes 3-5). On the other hand, the 124-kDa dimer was present only when the cholesterol content of the egg PC liposomes was ≥10 mol % (Fig. 3b, lanes 3-5) but not when the mol % of cholesterol was 1 or 2 (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 2). Quantitation of the immunoblots revealed that TC II-R protein association (Fig. 2b) increased by about 9-fold with an increase in cholesterol content of the liposomes from 1 to 50 mol %. These results suggested that the association of TC II-R with egg PC bilayers is dependent on the presence of cholesterol and that its optimal binding and dimerization occurred when the mol % of cholesterol was at least 10. In order to further examine the role of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer and its effect on the dimerization of TC II-R, reconstitution experiments were carried out using synthetic symmetrical PCs of different length fatty acyl residues in the presence and the absence of cholesterol and at temperatures above and below their phase transition.Figure 3:Immunoblot analysis of liposomally bound TC II-R. The liposomal pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), transferred to nitrocellulose for 45 (a) or 90 min (b), and probed with diluted antiserum to placental TC II-R and 32I-protein A. a, lanes 1-5 represent TC II-R associated with egg PC vesicles containing 2, 1, 10, 20, and 50 mol % of cholesterol. b, lanes 1-5 correspond to 1, 2, 10, 20, and 50 mol % of cholesterol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction of Pure TC II-R with DMPC, DPPC, and DSPC Vesicles: Effect of Cholesterol and TemperaturePure TC II-R associated and dimerized (Fig. 4a) in the absence of cholesterol at temperatures below the phase transition of DMPC (5°C, lane 1), DPPC and DSPC (22°C, lanes 2 and 3) vesicles. At the same temperatures, in the presence of cholesterol (50 mol %), there was no association of TC II-R with DMPC or DPPC or DSPC vesicles, and no dimer form could be detected (Fig. 4a, lanes 4-6). However, at temperatures above their phase transition (Fig. 4b), the association and dimerization of TC II-R occurred in the presence of 50 mol % of cholesterol with DMPC (37°C, lane 1), DPPC (45°C, lane 2), and DSPC (65°C, lane 3) vesicles but not in the absence of cholesterol (Fig. 4b, lanes 4-6). In order to further verify whether the presence of either a monomer or a dimer is solely dependent on the membrane cholesterol, further studies were carried out using native microsomal and basolateral membranes isolated from rat intestinal mucosa. The use of these membranes were prompted by our recent observation that in many tissue microsomal membranes TC II-R exists as a monomer and that in the basolateral membranes it exists as a dimer(5.Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Immunoblot analysis of TC II-R associated with DMPC, DPPC, and DSPC vesicles. a, TC II-R bound to DMPC (lanes 1 and 4), DPPC (lanes 2 and 5), and DSPC (lanes 3 and 6) vesicles below their respective transition phase temperatures in the absence (lanes 1, 2, and 3) and the presence (lanes 4, 5, and 6) of 50 mol % cholesterol were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and subjected to immunoblot analysis as before. Liposomal preparation were carried out at either 5°C for DMPC vesicles or room temperature for DPPC and DSPC vesicles. b, TC II-R bound to DMPC (lanes 1 and 4), DPPC (lanes 2 and 5), and DSPC (lanes 3 and 6) vesicles above their respective phase transition temperatures in the presence (lanes 1, 2, and 3) and the absence (lanes 4, 5, and 6) of 50 mol % cholesterol were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis.

When pure TC II-R was reconstituted with liposomes prepared using 2 μmol of phospholipid in each case, the liposomally bound receptor (Fig. 5, lane 1), like in the native microsomes (Fig. 5, lane 2), was a monomer. In contrast, TC II-R, when reconstituted with liposomes derived from basolateral membrane lipids, was a dimer (Fig. 5, lane 7), like the receptor in the native basolateral membrane (Fig. 5, lane 8). TC II-R bound to microsomal lipids vesicles (Fig. 5, lane 5) or bound to native microsomal (Fig. 5, lane 6) membranes was a monomer and no dimer form of TC II-R could be detected. Similarly, the monomer form of TC II-R could not be detected when TC II-R was bound to basolateral membrane lipid derived liposomes (Fig. 5, lane 3) or in the native basolateral membranes (Fig. 5, lane 4). These studies again suggested that the dimerization of TC II-R in the native membranes is dependent upon its cholesterol content. In order to directly test this hypothesis, cholesterol levels of these native membranes were altered to determine whether the physical state of TC II-R would change in situ without its solubilization from the membranes.Figure 5:Immunoblot analysis of TC II-R bound to liposomes prepared using microsomal and plasma membrane lipids. Pure TC II-R (25 ng) bound to liposomes prepared using lipid extracts from microsomal (lane 1 and 5), basolateral (lanes 3 and 7) membrane lipids, native microsomal membrane (50 μg of protein, lanes 2 and 6), and basolateral membranes (5 μg of protein, lanes 4 and 8) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as before.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Cholesterol Depletion and Enrichment in Native Membranes on the Physical State of TC II-RTreatment of the basolateral membranes with digitonin resulted in the depletion of membrane cholesterol altering the phospholipid/cholesterol ratio from 1.6:1 to 27:1.

The activity behaved as a single component during purification over DEAE-, phenyl-, Reactive Blue-4-, GDP-adipate-, GDP-hexanolamine-, and Superdex gel filtration resins. The purified activity possessed an apparent Mr of 95 × 103, was Mg2+-dependent with a neutral pH optimum, and exhibited a Km for GDP-fucose of 0.34 μM, a Km for pNP-LNB of 0.6 mM, and a Vmax for pNP-LNB of 620 nmol/min/mg protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the Superdex elution profile identified a polypeptide with an apparent Mr of 85 × 103, which coeluted with the cFTase activity and could be specifically photolabeled with the donor substrate inhibitor GDP-hexanolaminyl-azido-125I-salicylate. Based on substate analogue studies, exoglycosidase digestions, and co-chromatography with fucosylated standards, the product of the reaction with pNP-LNB was Fucα1, 2Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNP. The cFTase preferred substrates with a Galβ1,3 linkage, and thus its acceptor substrate specificity resembles the human Secretor-type α1,2-FTase. Afucosyl isoforms of the FP21 glycoprotein, GP21-I and GP21-II, were purified from the cytosol of a Dictyostelium mutant and found to be substrates for the cFTase, which exhibited an apparent Km of 0.21 μM and an apparent Vmax of 460 nmol/min/mg protein toward GP21-II. The highly purified cFTase was inhibited by the reaction products Fucα1,2Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ-pNP and FP21-II. FP21-I and recombinant FP21 were not inhibitory, suggesting that acceptor substrate specificity is based primarily on carbohydrate recognition. A cytosolic location for this step of FP21 glycosylation is implied by the isolation of the cFTase from the cytosolic fraction, its high affinity for its substrates, and its failure to be detected in crude membrane preparations.

https://openalex.org/W2023215667,The Doppler wind speeds derived from Galileo probe data are comparable with the maximum translation speeds observed in the equatorial zone by Voyager 1 and the Hubble Space Telescope. Slower published values of east-west winds are based on measurements of larger features and should be interpreted as translation rates of large weather systems interacting with the wind. The nature of the hot-spot region that the Galileo probe entered is compatible with a high-speed jet at 6 degrees north. The hot spot is associated with an equatorial weather system that spans 5 degrees of latitude and translates at 103 meters per second.

A sufficient capacity and balanced regulation of “high energy phosphate” supply and turnover is essential for the proper function of any cell. Large amounts of energy-rich phosphagens can be found in many cells or tissues throughout the animal kingdom. In all vertebrates and also in some invertebrates this phosphagen is phosphorylcreatine (PCr) 1The abbreviations used are: PCrphosphorylcreatineCKcreatine kinasePCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptionRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsGSPgene-specific primerUTRuntranslated regionbpbase pairskbkilobase pairsMREmetal response element.

PCr and ADP are the products of the reversible transfer of γ-phosphate groups from ATP to creatine, catalyzed by the creatine kinases (CKs). Two fundamental types of CKs can be found in vertebrates: cytosolic and mitochondrial CKs. The subcellular localization, the biochemical and kinetic data, and the loss of flagellar motility in spermatozoa upon inhibition of the CK system and other data (for review, see (2.Walliman T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar)) led to the suggestion of a metabolic PCr circuit with PCr as a transport and storage form of high energy phosphate. The PCr circuit connects sites of high energy phosphate production (glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation) with those of high energy phosphate consumption. At the producing end of the circuit, CK is thought to have privileged access to ATP generated either by glycoclysis or by oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial matrix and uses this ATP to generate PCr. At the receiving end, CK is functionally coupled to various ATPases (for instance myosin ATPase of myofibrils), which use the ATP generated in the reverse CK reaction. phosphorylcreatine creatine kinase polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription rapid amplification of cDNA ends gene-specific primer untranslated region base pairs kilobase pairs metal response element. In chicken there are five different CK subunits known so far; three are found in the cytosol, two in mitochondria. The cytosolic subunits are called M-CK (muscle) and Ba-CK and Bb-CK (brain, more acidic and more basic, respectively) and can dimerize with each other(3.Eppenberger H.M. Dawson D.M. Kaplan N.O. J.

B-CK is expressed in almost all tissues and found enriched in various regions of the brain, retina, heart, gizzard, gut, and sperm(2.Walliman T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M.

Hence the expression of the mitochondrial CKs matches to a certain degree the pattern found for the cytosolic CKs, indicating possible common regulatory mechanisms. Recently a comparison of the 26 known CK protein sequences suggested a highly conserved protein family and allowed the construction of an evolutionary tree(20.Mühlebach S.M. Gross M. Wirz T.

In chicken, only the B-CK gene has been completely analyzed so far, and fragments of the M-CK gene indicate an extraordinarily big size(10.Wirz T. Brändle U. Soldati T. Hossle J.P. Perriard J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11656-11666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the evolution of the CK isoenzyme family, the chicken Mia-CK protein sequence and the Mia-CK gene structure were elucidated as the first nonmammalian Mi-CK gene. The chicken Mia-CK leader peptides were analyzed in order to determine if the functional chicken peptides are isoprotein-specifically conserved. Analysis of the promoter elements of the Mia-CK gene was carried out to investigate if the expression pattern of Mia-CK is coupled to B-CK expression, indicating common regulatory mechanisms of these two genes. In order to test if such mechanisms are active in the chicken, the expression patterns in several adult tissues were studied. The structure of the chicken Mia-CK gene, including the localization of intron-exon boundaries was analyzed, and the structure was compared with the mammalian ubiquitous Mi-CK genes, allowing conclusions on the evolutionary relationship of these genes. A first fragment of chicken Mia-CK was generated with the following degenerate oligonucleotides synthesized on a Gene Assembler (Pharmacia LKB Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden): 5′-GTCGACGTCGACGGYGAACGYCAGMGVCGVAGGTACCC-3′ (derived from the amino-terminal sequence GERQRRRYP with two SalI sites at the 5′-end; highly Mia-CK specific) and 5′-GTYTTRTCRTTRTTRTGCCA-3′ (complementary to amino acids 212-218, WHNNDKT; CK specific). Degeneracy of these oligonucleotides was reduced by analysis of the codon usage of the three available chicken CK sequences(9.Hossle J.P. Rosenberg U.B. Schaefer B. Eppenberger H.M. Walliman T.

PCRs were done as follows: 3 min at 55°C and 40 min at 72°C were followed by 40 cycles of 45 s at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2.5 min at 72°C; PCR 2 was 35 cycles of 45 s at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2.5 min at 72°C. Heat-denatured poly(A)+-selected RNA from chicken brain was reverse-transcribed with the RT-primer. Cycling conditions were as follows: 3 min at 45°C and 40 min at 72°C were followed by 40 cycles of 50 s at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 2 min at 72°C; PCR 2 was 35 cycles of 50 s at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 2 min at 72°C. In all steps, T4-G32-protein (Pharmacia LKB Biotech Inc. Uppsala, Sweden) and perfect match polymerase enhancer (Stratagene) were used. Heat-denatured poly(A)+-selected RNA from chicken leg muscle was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) with the RT-primer. Cycling conditions were as follows: PCR 1 was done as in the Mia-CK-3′-RACE; PCR 2 was done as in the Mia-CK-5′-RACE. Obtained products were verified with an internal, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide by Southern blotting, subcloning, and sequencing. Additional Mia-CK 5′-RACE-RT-PCRs were performed with a set of oligonucleotides derived from a 60-bp stretch located in exon 1, with methylmercuric hydroxide-denatured RNA and with other reverse transcriptases. Genomic DNA was prepared from chicken erythrocytes with the proteinase K method(30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction digests of genomic DNA or plasmid DNA were done overnight according to the manufacturer's conditions (Boehringer Mannheim and New England Biolabs). Digests of DNA were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis followed by transfer onto nylon membranes (Pall Inc.). After UV cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized according to Church and Gilbert(32.Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar), if oligonucleotides were used, or as described in Sambrook et al.(30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for larger cDNA probes. For the 64-bp probe, Denhardt's solution was left out of the hybridization mixture as suggested in recently published protocols(30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Vector-free fragments were isolated from low melting point agarose with Agarase (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA (20-40 ng) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by the random primer method(33.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar). PCR labeling by direct incorporation was done exactly as described previously(34.Schowalter D.B. Sommer S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.3 ng of fragment, as obtained in a normal PCR, served as template with 150 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. Oligonucleotides used were 5′-CTGCTCGCCCGGGACACG-3′ and 5′-CAGCACTGGGCGGGTAGCG-3′. The cycling conditions were 30 s at 95°C, 1 min at 58°C, and 30 s at 72°C. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by T4-polynuclotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's conditions. Sequencing was carried out according to the method of Sanger et al.(35.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). Cycle sequencing was performed with the fmol kit (Promega); the annealing step in the cycling procedure was done at the Tm of the oligonucleotide. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing was done according to the modified method of Som and Tomizawa(36.Som T. Tomizawa J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1982; 187: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PCR on clone UB15-9 was done with the primer 5′-TTACAAGTTAACCCGGCACTGAGCCACG-3′ (HpaI site at 5′-end) and the R-primer of pGEM3-zf (Promega). Cycling conditions were 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 46°C, and 1 min at 72°C. The fragment was digested (HpaI, EcoRI), gel purified, and subcloned into pGEM3-zf(-). The 3′-terminal HaeIII-fragment of the chicken B-CK clone pUC8-18b/e(9.Hossle J.P. Rosenberg U.B. Schaefer B. Eppenberger H.M. Walliman T. Perriard J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1449-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), comprising most of the 3′-UTR, was cloned into pGEM3-zf(-). It was reexcised with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into pTZ19U to allow transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. All plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli XL-1 blue (Stratagene), and DNA was isolated either by an alkali lysis-type method (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by column preparation (Nucleobond AX kit, Machery-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's descriptions. Total RNA was prepared from excised tissue specimen from adult chicken according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(37.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). Two ml of solution D were used per 100 mg of tissue for homogenization with a Polytron mixer. Plasmids pStM5 and pStM6 were linearized with HindIII/NdeI and BamHI/EcoRI, respectively. Both were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), producing probes of approximately 160 and 220 nucleotides, respectively. [32P]rCTP-labeled cRNA-probes were synthesized as follows. Three μl of 5 × transcription buffer (Promega) dithiothreitol (nuclease-free, Sigma) to a concentration of 10 mM; rATP, rGTP, and rUTP (Promega; final concentration, 400 μM each); and 60 μCi of [32P]rCTP were mixed in a siliconized Eppendorf tube. Diethyl pyrocarbonate (Sigma) -treated distilled H2O was added to give a total volume of 15 μl. Linearized plasmid template to a final concentration of 40 to 50 ng/μl, RNAsin (20 units, Promega), and T7-RNA polymerase (20 units, Boehringer, Mannheim) were added at the end. Transcription was done for 1 h at 37°C. The cRNAs were purified by a preparative acrylamide gel and recovered from the gel slices by incubation in cracking buffer (0.3 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequent extraction and precipitation. The RNase protection was done with the RNase protection kit from Boehringer Mannheim. 10 μg of total RNA was used from each tissue with ∼105 cpm of labeled probe, and hybridization was done overnight at 50°C. RNase digestion was done with RNase A and RNase T1 at 37°C for 1 h. One-half of the assays was analyzed on a 4% sequencing gel. Tissues were removed from a decapitated chicken and treated as described previously(38.Sassoon D.A. Garner J.A. Buckingham M. Development. 1988; 104: 155-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Lyons G.E. Mühlebach S. Moser A. Masood R. Paterson B.M. Buckingham M.E. Perriard J.C. Development. 1991; 113: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with one minor modification. After the xylene steps, the tissues were transferred directly into melted paraplast at 60°C. In vitro transcription in the presence of [35S]UTP (>1000 Ci mmol+, Amersham Corp.) was done essentially as described above; 60 μCi of [35S]rUTP were used instead of rCTP. The final volume was 20 μl. After the first hour of incubation, another aliquot of RNA polymerase was added, and the mixture was incubated for another hour. The template was digested with DNase I to stop the reaction. All probes were purified by Sephadex G-50 columns, and sizes were controlled on an analytical 4% polyacryamide-urea gel. Some conditions of prehybridization, hybridization, and subsequent washing (38.Sassoon D.A. Garner J.A. Buckingham M. Development. 1988; 104: 155-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Lyons G.E. Mühlebach S. Moser A. Masood R. Paterson B.M. Buckingham M.E. Perriard J.C. Development. 1991; 113: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were slightly modified. Probe for hybridization was diluted in hybridization buffer to a concentration of ∼20,000 cpm μl+, and 30 μl were applied per slide. Dithiothreitol concentration in the hybridization buffer was increased to 100 mM(40.Dagerlind A. Friberg K. Bean A.J. Hokfelt T. Histochemistry. 1992; 98: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Stringent washes were carried out at 55°C in 0.5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 10 mM dithiothreitol for 2 h. In chicken, the cDNA sequences of the products of three out of the four CK genes are known. In case of the Mia-CK isoform, only partial amino acid sequences have been published. To amplify a cDNA fragment coding for this isoform, a PCR approach with degenerate oligonucleotides was chosen. As chicken Mia-CK is highly expressed in adult brain(17.Wyss M. Schlegel J. James P. Eppenberger H.M. Walliman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15900-15908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), total RNA from chicken brain was used in a RT-PCR. This RT-PCR produced a fragment of 653 bp (Fig. 1A), which was subcloned (clone UB11-83) and sequenced. Comparison to the human, rat, and mouse Mia-CKs (19.Payne R.M. Haas R.C. Strauss A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24.Haas R.C. Korenfeld C. Zhang Z. Perryman P. Roman D. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2890-2897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Steeghs K. Peters W. Brückwilder M. Croes H. van Alewijk D. Wieringa B. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) indicated that we had cloned a chicken Mia-CK fragment. The levels of amino acid identity were around 89% for all of them. A chicken brain λgt10 cDNA library was screened with this fragment to isolate the full-length cDNA. Out of this screening, one clone, containing sequences coding for Mia-CK, was purified to homogeneity, subcloned, and sequenced (UB15-9). This cDNA sequence starts only 170 bp downstream of the ATG initiation codon (see Figure 1:, Figure 2:), reaches to the 3′-end at 1383 bp of the mRNA (see Fig. 1A), but contains no poly(A) tail. The RACE-RT-PCR method (31.Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 28-38Google Scholar) is a way to amplify unknown cDNA ends, with the advantage of avoiding time-consuming screening procedures. Hence this method was used to verify the 3′-end of the chicken Mia-CK cDNA. In this experiment, a poly(A) tail was found at the expected position. The polyadenylation signal sequence CATAAA was identified 19 bp upstream from the 3′-end (see Fig. 2, boxed nucleotides at the end). The 3′-UTR is 134 bp long, but it lacks the sequence similarities observed by others (42.Cheng J.M. Payne R.M. Strauss A.W. Circulation. 1994; 90: 634-643Google Scholar) in the 3′-UTRs of human, rat, and mouse Mia-CKs. For the chicken Mia-CK, a message size of approximately 1700 bp is observed in Northern blot experiments (not shown). Since poly(A) tails usually range between 100 and 200 bp, the Mia-CK cDNA should have a length in the range of 1500 bp. Hence the missing sequence at the 5′-end might be 250-350 bp long. The RACE-RT-PCR method was also applied to amplify these missing 5′-terminal sequences. The largest extension obtained from these experiments provided only 83 additional bp compared with the cDNA clone UB15-9 (Fig. 1A). Other attempts, using strongly denaturing agents like methylmercuric hydroxide to melt possible secondary structure elements in the RNA, did not yield any further sequence information. The method was working in our hands, as the missing 5′-end of chicken Mib-CK (15.Hossle J.P. Schlegel J. Wegmann G. Wyss M. Böhlen P. Eppenberger H.M. Walliman T. Perriard J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was cloned at the same time. There we obtained the remaining 57 bp of the coding region, and the 156 bp of the 5′-UTR (the complete sequence of the Mib-CK leader peptide is given in Fig. 5). Thus at the 5′-end of chicken Mia-CK, 200-300 bp resisted cloning by cDNA-based methods for unknown reasons. The missing sequences were finally obtained by analysis of genomic λ clones (see below). They code for the leader peptide of 39 amino acids, necessary for import into mitochondria, and the 5′-UTR, which we predict to have length of ∼100 bp. The whole cDNA without poly(A) tail has therefore a length around 1480 bp. As mentioned before, we have also cloned the missing 5′-part of the chicken Mib-CK cDNA, which encodes part of the leader peptide necessary for import into mitochondria. Together with the chicken Mia-CK sequence, we now have two nonmammalian leader peptides available for analysis of function and evolutionary relationships. Both leaders show the typical tripartite structure of mitochondrial import sequences(43.Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, the mammalian Mi-CK leader peptides are highly conserved in a isoform-specific manner. The leader peptides of mammalian Mia-CKs display amino acid identities around 90%, and the same is true for the Mib-CKs (Fig. 3, table). If the chicken Mi-CKs are included in this comparison, the values of identity are much lower, and the isoform-specific conserv"

The signal strengths at 3 and 15 kilohertz were relatively large at the beginning of the descent, decreased with depth to a pressure level of about 5 bars, and then increased slowly until the end of the mission. The 15-kilohertz signals show arrival direction anisotropies. Measurements of radio frequency wave forms show that the probe passed through an atmospheric region that did not support lightning within at least 100 kilometers and more likely a few thousand kilometers of the descent trajectory. The apparent opacity of the jovian atmosphere increases sharply at pressures greater than about 4 bars."
https://openalex.org/W2082054385,"High mobility group (HMG) proteins 14 and 17 are abundant chromatin-associated proteins found in all higher eukaryotic nuclei. This observation demonstrates that HMGs 14 and 17 must have an important and universal function with regard to the structure and function of chromatin. What this function is, including how they interact with a nucleosomal array in vivo, is not known. Recently, we have demonstrated that HMGs 14 and 17 can organize nucleosomes into a regular array and increase the repeat length from 145 to about 160-165 base pairs in vitro. In addition, they can increase the apparent repeat length of chromatin deficient in histones H2A/H2B from 125 to approximately 145 base pairs. Importantly, this template was transcriptionally active. In this study, we report five new observations that begin to address the mechanism by which HMGs 14 and 17 space nucleosomal particles. First, we demonstrate that both human placenta HMG 14 and HMG 17 can space nucleosomes to produce a chromatin template with a repeat length around 160 base pairs. This result further highlights the similarity between these proteins in terms of protein structure and perhaps function. Second, we show that digestion of HMG containing chromatin with micrococcal nuclease produces DNA fragments that were approximately 10 and 20 base pairs longer than nucleosome core-particle DNA. This suggests that HMG 14 or HMG 17 can protect, directly or indirectly, at least an additional 10 base pairs of linker DNA from micrococcal digestion. However, this HMG-containing particle does not produce a strong kinetic block, and further digestion results in the eventual accumulation of DNA fragments 145 base pairs in length. Third, by comparing the full-length protein with different domains, we demonstrate that the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain is absolutely required for nucleosome spacing; neither the nucleosome binding domain of HMG 14 or HMG 17 nor the amino-terminal domain plus the nucleosome binding domain of HMG 14 could space nucleosomes. Fourth, we demonstrate that extensive micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin deficient in histones H2A/H2B led to the accumulation of DNA fragments about 110 base pairs in length, which is presumably the length of DNA associated with a nucleosomal particle deficient in one H2A/H2B dimer. Incorporation of either HMG 14 or HMG 17 into this chromatin results in the disappearance of this band and increase in the accumulation of fragments around 140-150 base pairs in length. Finally, in contrast to spacing of complete nucleosomes, we find that the nucleosome binding domain of HMG 17 (but not the nucleosome binding of HMG 14) is the only domain required for spacing of H2A/H2B-deficient chromatin.

https://openalex.org/W1984363657,"Varying length cDNAs encoding the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) from mouse mdr1 P-glyco- protein were prepared on the basis of structure predictions. Corresponding recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the shortest one containing amino acids 395-581 exhibited the highest solubility. Insertion of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag allowed domain purification by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. NBD1 efficiently interacted with nucleotides. Fluorescence methods showed that ATP bound at millimolar concentrations and its 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) derivative at micromolar concentrations, while the 2'(3')-N-methylanthraniloyl derivative had intermediate affinity. Photoaffinity labeling was achieved upon irradiation with 8-azido-ATP. The domain exhibited ATPase activity with a Km for MgATP in the millimolar range, and ATP hydrolysis was competitively inhibited by micromolar 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP. NBD1 contained a single cysteine residue, at position 430, that was derivatized with radiolabeled N-ethylmaleimide. Cysteine modification increased 6-fold the Kd for 2'(3')-N-methylanthraniloyl-ATP and prevented 8-azido-ATP photolabeling. ATPase activity was inhibited with a 5-fold increase in the Km for MgATP. The results suggest that chemical modification of Cys-430 is involved in the N-ethylmaleimide inhibition of whole P-glycoprotein by altering substrate interaction."

We have monitored the interaction of wild-type and truncated forms of yeast TFIIIA with the 5 S RNA gene. The DNase I footprints obtained with full-length TFIIIA and a polypeptide containing the amino-terminal five zinc fingers (TF5) were indistinguishable, extending from nucleotides +64 to +99 of the 5 S RNA gene. This suggests that fingers 6 through 9 of yeast TFIIIA are not in tight association with DNA. The DNase I footprint obtained with a polypeptide containing the amino-terminal four zinc fingers (TF4) was 14 base pairs shorter than that of TF5, extending from nucleotides +78 to +99 on the nontranscribed strand and from nucleotides +79 to +98 on the transcribed strand of the 5 S RNA gene. Protection provided by a polypeptide containing the first three zinc fingers (TF3) was similar to that provided by TF4, with the exception that protection on the nontranscribed strand ended at nucleotide +80, rather than nucleotide +78. Methylation protection analysis indicated that finger 5 makes major groove contacts with guanines +73 and +74.

Seven blue stars of apparent visual magnitude 15 to 17 had irregular photometric variations and hydrogen emission lines in their optical spectra, which suggested that these stars are pre-main-sequence stars of about 10 solar masses. These stars are slightly more massive and definitely more luminous than are Herbig AeBe pre-main-sequence stars in our own galaxy. Continued observations of these very young stars from another galaxy, which are probably at the pre-hydrogen-burning stage, should provide important clues about early stages of star formation."
