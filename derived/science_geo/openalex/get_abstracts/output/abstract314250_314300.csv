https://openalex.org/W1969136683,"Pressure of 40,000 atmospheres at 25 degrees C induces a phase transformation in ytterbium metal; the face-centered cubic structure changes to body-centered cubic. The radius of the atom changes from 1.82 to 1.75 A. At the same time the atom's volume decreases by 11 percent and the volume, observed macroscopically, decreases 3.2 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2057950826,"The published work for which the honor of the Nobel prize for the year 1954 has been accorded to me does not contain the discovery of a new phenomenon of nature but, rather, the foundations of a new way of thinking about the phenomena of nature. This way of thinking has permeated experimental and theoretical physics to such an extent that it seems scarcely possible to say anything more about it that has not often been said already. Yet there are some special aspects that I should like to discuss."

https://openalex.org/W1980537447,"Combination of two types of radar data shows the orbital plane and equator of Venus to be included by less than 2 degrees, and the sidereal rotation period to be 243.09 +/- 0.18 days (retrograde)-remarkably close to the 243.16-day period for which the spin would be in resonance with the relative orbital motions of Earth and Venus. In this resonance, Venus would make, on average, four axial rotations as seen by an Earth observer between successive close approaches of the two planets. Estimates of the instantaneous spin period, accurate within about 0.01 day, would provide important information on the difference of Venus's equatorial moments of inertia, on their orientation, and on the magnitude of the tidal torque exerted on Venus by the sun."

https://openalex.org/W2062947793,"Results of ten rocket soundings conducted from Kronogard, Sweden, and Barrow, Alaska, during the summers of 1963 through 1965 indicate that a temperature of 150°K or less is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of noctilucent clouds. Water vapor appears to be a critical ingredient in the occurrence of these clouds."
https://openalex.org/W2018274903,"A two-dimensional model is used to obtain quantitative data on characteristics of turbulently mixed wakes of bodies submerged in stratified fluids (more dense below than above). The time between turbulent mixing and maximum expansion of the wake before vertical collapse starts is 0.44 T, where T is the local Väisälä-Brunt period. Time after mixing for maximum rate of horizontal spreading is about 2.0 T. The average Väisälä-Brunt period for the oceans and atmosphere is discussed. It is predicted that the wake collapse phenomenon is not unusual in these environments. The characteristic time for the most active phase of vertical wake collapse should be between a few minutes to several tens of minutes. Qualitative observations of aircraft vapor trails tend to confirm that the phenomenon does occur at full scale."
https://openalex.org/W2041429941,Stimulation of the detrusor muscle by means of two implanted wire electrodes increased intravesical pressure markedly in ten trials in normal dogs and in nine trials following transection of the dog's lumbar spinal cord. The urinary bladder could be completely emptied up to 2 or 3 weeks postoperatively. Later stimulation provoked an equally copious urinary flow but a residue persisted even when progressively higher voltage was applied.

We find that the visible surface brightness of anomalous dust populations, if these populations do exist, is less than 10(-9) candela per square centimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2016888315,"The piezomagnetic properties of rock suggest that a change in subsurface stress will manifest itself as a change in the magnetic susceptibility and remanent magnetization and hence the local geomagnetic field. A differential array of magnetometers has been operating since late 1965 on the San Andreas fault in the search for piezomagnetic signals under conditions involving active fault stress. Local changes in the geomagnetic field have been observed near Hollister, California, some tens of hours preceding the onset of abrupt creep displacement on the San Andreas fault."

https://openalex.org/W1978488169,"While the extent of similarity between the two groups was surprising, this similarity may have been due to the particular community studied and should not obscure the real differences which were found, which apparently remained fairly stable. The two groups differed not only in their beliefs about shelters but in their attitudes toward war, United States foreign policy, the motives of the Soviet Union, political affiliation and activity, risk-taking behavior, their own descriptions of themselves and of the opposite group, and a number of general social issues. Finally, each group had misperceptions about the other, one group exaggerating, the other under-rating, the differences."

https://openalex.org/W2075496639,"Utilization of labeled proline by the yeast Candida utilis has been studied. Conversion of the labeled material to biochemically related compounds was observed in the metabolic pools in this organism. The kinetic flow of these molecules into protein was observed, and an explanation is proposed in terms of the absolute cellular concentrations and specific activities of the precursors."

https://openalex.org/W2077319050,"In my letter, College math for 11-years-olds (28 July), I stated that it was apparent
 after a while that parabolas and hyperbolas could sometimes fall into circles and ellipses
 or vice versa. This is not true! Under any nonsingular linear transformation parabolas
 become parabolas, hyperbolas become hyperbolas, and ellipses become ellipses become
 ellipses (or circles)."
