https://openalex.org/W1983530295,"IN recent years many attempts have been made to confirm the belief that dermatophytes have a saprophytic existence in the soil. These investigations have disclosed the widespread occurrence of the pathogenic species Microsporum gypseum (Bodin) Brumpt1–6 and the existence of the saprophytes Keratinomyces ajelloi Vanbreuseghem2,5–7 and Tricho-phyton terrestre Durie and Frey8."

https://openalex.org/W1965794375,"A KNOWLEDGE of the fundamental properties of the insect nerve is very useful in studying the mode of action of insecticides, many of which are nerve poisons. In order to verify the validity of the sodium theory1 in the cockroach giant axon2, the effects on the resting and action potentials of varying the sodium and potassium concentrations in the bathing fluid were examined with intracellular micro-electrodes. A compensation circuit for improving high-frequency responses was employed in place of the simple cathode follower circuit used in our previous study3. The following mean values for the membrane potentials were obtained from axons immersed in modified Ringer's solution containing sodium ions at a concentration of 214 mM : resting potential 70.3 mV.; action potential 94.5 mV.; positive phase 3.4 mV.; maximum rate of rise of action potential 1,113 V./sec.; maximum rate of fall 382 V./sec."

A preliminary report on what variables are relevant has been made by Holland1. Eysenck, Holland and Trouton2 have since claimed that individual differences in length of after-effect conform to predictions from Eysenck's theory. In view of these claims and of the fact that others3,4 are using this phenomenon in a clinical diagnostic context, it is perhaps important to offer this progress report of further experiments on the extent of normal variation and the factors influencing it."

https://openalex.org/W2076613827,IT has been shown by Bacq and his collaborators1 that the administration of cysteamine (β-mercapto-ethylamine) is an extremely effective method of protecting adult animals against X-radiation. The present series of experiments were carried out in order to determine whether the administration of cysteamine to pregnant animals immediately prior to exposure to X-radiation had any value in the prevention of X-ray induced malformations in their young.
https://openalex.org/W2028480958,"IN an attempt to clarify issues raised by changes associated with age in the ability of human subjects to perform perceptual-motor tasks, the rates of information transmission of younger and older subjects in performing discrete, choice reaction time tasks involving two different stimulus-response relationships were calculated. The tasks involved moving a stylus as quickly as possible from a central point to one of a number of targets arranged in a semi-circle in response to the appearance of one of a number of signal lights arranged in a similar semicircle. The first (direct) stimulus-response relationship required subjects to aim at targets corresponding directly in position to signals which appeared. In the second, indirect version of the task, the correct target was the ‘mirror image’ of that directly indicated by the signal."

https://openalex.org/W2049349231,"TETANUS toxin is thought to act by suppressing synaptic inhibition1, and presumably it acts upon some substance at the inhibitory synapses in the grey matter of nervous tissue. As a possible approach to discovering the nature of this substance, the well-known Wassermann–Takaki phenomenon2, that is, the fixation of tetanus toxin by the grey matter of nervous tissue, has been re-investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2080019956,"METABOLIC activity is profoundly altered in the hibernating animal, as compared with that in the normal. Evidence is also available that under hibernating conditions nervous function in certain species can be affected1. Consequently it was of considerable interest to determine the toxicity of a ganglionic blocking agent to animals under the abnormal metabolic conditions produced by hibernation. The toxicity of the cholinesterase inhibitor O, O-diethyl-S-2- diethylaminoethyl phosphonothiolate2 has been determined in the nornal and hibernating hamster by the intraperitoneal route."

https://openalex.org/W2091030482,THE mechanism by which tumours spread into the surrounding tissues or produce metastases in distant organs is still an obscure problem. The reaction of the tissues of the host in relation to the rate of growth and metastasization has not been sufficiently investigated.
https://openalex.org/W1978398965,"DUNNING et al. 1 demonstrated that bladder cancer due to 2-acetylaminofluorene was produced in almost all rats (strain Fisher 344) on a diet containing large quantities (1.4–4.3 per cent) of tryptophan. On the other hand, rats on a diet containing smaller amounts of tryptophan did not develop bladder cancer. We showed that the administration of 2-acetylaminofluorene inhibits 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase in rat hepatic tissue2, with consequent accumulation of the two carcinogenic o-aminophenolic compounds 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and 3-hydroxy-kynurenine3. It seemed of interest to pursue these studies in order to elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1992091331,"GIRARD'S reagent T (trimethylammonium hydrazide chloride)1 is extensively used for the separation of oxo-steroids from other steroids and particularly for purification of 17-oxo-steroids in extracts of acid- or enzyme-hydrolysed urine2. The method employed usually involves dissolving the material and Girard reagent in glacial acetic acid, and either heating the mixture for periods of up to 1 hr. or allowing it to stand overnight at room temperature. During this procedure destruction of labile steroids and some acetylation of hydroxy-steroids tend to occur (ref. 3 and unpublished observations)."
