When compared to nonmanipulated controls it was found that the manipulated rats showed a significant elevation of corticosteroids as early as 15 seconds after shock, whereas the nonmanipulated subjects did not show a significant elevation of steroids until 5 minutes after a brief shock. Further, the levels of corticosteroids were consistently higher in the manipulated subjects over a 15-minute period."

https://openalex.org/W155583357,"Isolated rat liver mitochondria undergo swelling in the presence of certain substances of physiological occurrence which include inorganic phosphate (I), Ca*, (2), L-thyroxine (2, 3), reduced glutathione (4)) and an isooctane-soluble uncoupling agent formed enzymatically in mitochondria, designated U factor (5). Such swelling, with the exception of that brought about by glutathione (4), has been found to be reversed by the addition of adenosine triphosphate + Mg* + serum albumin, with extrusion of water from the mitochondria (6, 7). Adenosine triphosphate also reverses swelling produced by such nonphysiological agents as arsenate (7) and phlorizin (7, 8). These and other aspects of mitochondrial swelling and contraction1 have been reviewed in detail by Lehninger (9, 10). The failure of ATP to reverse mitochondrial swelling induced by glutathione appeared to be a significant exception, since swelling of this type is more drastic and apparently diierent in kind from that produced by the other agents listed (4, 11). In this paper it is shown that although ATP will not contract glutathione-swollen mitochondria in relatively dilute suspensions as are ordinarily used in such assays, it will produce contraction when relatively dense suspensions of mitochondria are employed. The dependence of the ATPlinked contraction on the concentration of mitochondria led to the finding that exposure of mitochondria to GSH causes leakage into the medium and dilution of a critical heat-labile factor. This substance, designated “contraction factor,” or C factor, is apparently a protein and is shown to be required, together with ATP, Mg*, and bovine serum albumin, for the reversal of glutathione-induced swelling. Leakage of C factor reduces its effective concentration below a critical level in dilute suspensions of mitochondria swollen with GSH. A preliminary account of these and some related findings has been published (12) and the following papers describe further investigations on this subject (13).2* 3"

The Mean Square Successive Difference, developed by von Neumann, was employed in the analysis of basal levels of galvanic skin potential recorded for 40-minute periods."

https://openalex.org/W2065176578,"A NUMBER of sources of plant glycosidases are known, notably almonds and lucerne seed1. Having suitable substrates available, we have made a survey of a large number of common garden, farm and wayside plants for different glycosidase activities. At an early stage attention was concentrated on seeds, since they were at least as rich a source of glycosidases as other parts of plants. The species shown in Table 1 are among the highest in enzyme activity: other species tended to display the same general patterns of glycosidases. There was little difference in any respect between varieties of single species. Enzyme preparations were made by grinding the seeds in a glass mortar with a small volume of water to give a smooth paste: after dilution this was centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. No appreciable enzyme activity was detected with p-nitrophenyl α-L-fucoside2, phenyl β-D-mannoside3 or phenyl N-acetyl-α-D-glucosaminide4 as substrate in any species examined. The absence of β-D-glucuronidase from most plant species has already been noted5. It is evident that the seeds of common plants form a convenient source of certain glycosidases, and compare favourably in activity with many other known plant or animal sources."

The spread of oil on to insects walking over superficial films is an essential process in the action of such a deposit, though the quantities of oil involved are extremely small. Using a radioactive tracer technique, measurements have been made of the rate of uptake of oil by active flies of the species Phormia terraenovae R–D from deposits of 3 (µl./cm.2 of a refined mineral oil (‘Risella 17’) on Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Traces of a radioiodine preparation (131I) di-iodo-octadecane were added to the oil and the specific activity adjusted to 2 mc./ml. of oil. The flies were exposed to the oiled substrate by the method of Lewis and Hughes1. After exposure the insects were washed three times in ether to remove the superficial oil from the cuticle, and the tissues later extracted with ether followed by 10 per cent sodium hydroxide."

Recirculation of bilirubin, and its bacterial reduction products, the urobilinoids, has been postulated and denied1. The availability of bilirubin labelled with carbon-14 in this Laboratory2 has obviated many of the problems previously inherent in the study of bilirubin metabolism. The following is a preliminary report of investigations of the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin."

In most cases investigated so far, the amounts of fission products found were too small to permit deductions about concentration of these substances in the lymph nodes. However, in some cases larger activities were observed and the occurrence of a concentration process could be clearly recognized."

https://openalex.org/W2002019664,"IN human beings there exists an inborn character of the red blood cells which is usually harmless, but which, in certain individuals, can lead to severe hæmolysis if the red cells are challenged by the ingestion of certain drugs or foods. The main abnormality in these individuals is a deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the red cells, which usually have a correspondingly low amount of reduced glutathione in them. Further, when such sensitive red cells are incubated in certain chemicals, for example, acetylphenylhydrazine, there is a marked fall in the level of reduced glutathione, which does not occur with erythrocytes of normal persons. This is the glutathione stability test of Beutler1, and it has been pointed out by Beutler et al.2 that the glutathione instability of the drug-sensitive cells probably results from their deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. A simple test for demonstrating this enzyme deficiency state has been developed by Motulsky3."

Usually three major components of greater mobility were accompanied by slower moving minor components. No uniformity of mobility or of proportion of protein was evident. Thus patterns that ""fingerprint"" the species are evident."
