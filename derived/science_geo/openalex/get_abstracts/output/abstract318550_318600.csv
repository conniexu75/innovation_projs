Stress in the skin varies with the internal pressure, and the skin stress controls skin stiffness. Locomotory muscles attach to the skin which is thus a whole-body exotendon whose mechanical advantage in transmitting muscular contraction is greater than that of the endoskeleton."

https://openalex.org/W2069240891,"Combined neodymium and strontium isotope studies on Tertiary volcanics from northwest Scotland indicate that their parental mantle isotopic compositions have been substantially modified in many instances by contamination with the Precambrian continental crust through which they were erupted. The occurrence of samarium-neodymium and rubidium-strontium ""pseudoisochrons"" of different ages in these contaminated continental volcanics indicates that they are artifacts of the contamination processes and have no temporal significance with respect to mantle fractionation events."
https://openalex.org/W2007030986,"Two views about the Darwinian revolution are tested: that nearly all scientists in Great Britain had been converted to a belief in the evolution of species within 10 years after the publication of the Origin of Species, and that younger scientists were converted much more rapidly than older scientists. Both views are shown to be less than accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2025743129,"Polyethism, the divison of labor among members of a colony, is based on worker age and size in ants. In the ponerine species Amblyopone pallipes worker behavior is independent of age, therefore temporal castes, or groups of age-related task specialists, do not exist. This primitive caste system, previously unknown in ants, appears to be correlated with the peculiar characteristics of the life history and ecology of Amblyopone."

https://openalex.org/W2035526147,"Recombination of ground-state oxygen atoms populates six different bound electronic states of molecular oxygen. Of the six optical transitions expected between the three upper states at 4 to 4.5 electron volts and the two lowest states, five have been observed in the afterglow of a conventional helium-oxygen microwave discharge in both 16O(2) and (18)O(2), three of them for the first time in gas-phase spectra. Generation of these emissions from oxygen atoms in a system free of molecular oxygen establishes that atom recombination is the production mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2150717549,"The signal strength, bandwidth, and detection range of acoustic pulses generated by cosmic-ray air showers striking a water surface are calculated. These signals are strong enough to be audible to a submerged swimmer. The phenomena may be useful for studying very-high-energy cosmic rays and may help answer the important question of whether the origin of cosmic rays is extragalactic or galactic."

https://openalex.org/W1997450858,"Methods used to evaluate the inhalation hazard of soil contaminated with plutonium were investigated. Four soil fractionation procedures were used to separate three size fractions of soil particles taken from two locations at the Department of Energy's Rocky Flats facility. The results show that increasing amounts of soil mass and plutonium activity (0.5 to 38 percent and 7 to 84 percent, respectively) remain in the fraction of soil smaller than 10 micrometers as the in situ particle associations are increasingly disrupted by physical and chemical forces. The introduction of forces of dispersion unrelated to ambient conditions yields results that are unrelated to the original particle associations."
