https://openalex.org/W1584149880,"The cleavage of human factor V and human factor Va by human activated protein C (APC) was analyzed in the absence and presence of phospholipid vesicles containing 75% phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 25% phosphatidylserine (PS). Membrane-bound human factor V (250 nM) is cleaved by APC (2.5 nM) to give M(r) = 200,000, 70,000, 45,000, and 30,000 fragments and an M(r) = 22/20,000 doublet. These fragments are released after four sequential cleavages of the membrane-bound procofactor at Arg306, Arg506, Arg679, and Lys994. No cofactor activity is observed following thrombin treatment of the membrane-bound APC-cleaved procofactor. In the absence of a membrane surface, no cleavage of factor V by APC is observed, and following thrombin activation factor Va retains full cofactor activity. Membrane-bound human factor Va (600 nM) loses more than 90% of its initial cofactor activity after 10 min of incubation with APC (10.9 nM), and virtually no cofactor activity is observed after 1 h of incubation. Under similar conditions but in the absence of PCPS vesicles, factor Va is cleaved but retains approximately 80% of its initial cofactor activity after 2 h of incubation with APC. In the presence of PCPS vesicles, the APC related loss of activity is correlated with cleavage of the heavy chain and appearance of fragments of M(r) = 45,000, 30,000, and of 28/26,000, and 22/20,000 doublets. These products correspond to three cleavages of the heavy chain (at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679). Cleavage at Arg506 of factor Va precedes and appears to be required for cleavage at Arg306 and Arg679. In the absence of membrane, proteolysis at Arg506 produces an M(r) = 75,000 fragment which corresponds to the NH2-terminal portion of the human factor Va heavy chain (residues 1-506), and a carboxyl-terminal doublet of M(r) = 28/26,000 (residues 507-709) which is cleaved by APC at Arg679 to generate an M(r) = 22/20,000 doublet and an M(r) = 6,000 peptide. No cleavage of the light chain of the human cofactor is observed in the presence or absence of PCPS vesicles following 2 h of incubation with APC. Our data demonstrate that inactivation of human factor V and human factor Va only occurs in the presence of a membrane surface after cleavage at Arg306. However, while this cleavage site is exposed on membrane-bound human factor V, cleavage at Arg506 on the heavy chain of factor Va appears necessary for complete exposure of the cleavage site at Arg306."
https://openalex.org/W1542710115,"The physiological function of mammalian sperm acrosin has long been believed to be involved in the limited proteolysis of the oocyte zona pellucida, thus enabling the sperm to penetrate this extracellular matrix and to gain access to the oocyte plasma membrane. Here we show that male mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the mouse acrosin gene are still fertile in spite of the complete absence of acrosin protease activity in the sperm. In vitro fertilization assays verified that sperm from the homozygous mutant mice penetrate the zona pellucida and effect fertilization. Therefore, acrosin is not essential for both sperm penetration of the zona pellucida and fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W1483663613,"Several bacterial response regulator proteins (CheY, NRI, PhoB, and OmpR) become phosphorylated in vitro when incubated with acetyl phosphate. In the presence of high levels of acetyl phosphate and Mg2+, CheY reached steady state phosphorylation in less than 30 s; NRI and PhoB reached steady state more slowly (t1/2 to steady state of 1.5 and > 15 min, respectively). A simple method was developed to measure acetyl phosphate levels in Escherichia coli grown in defined media. Levels of acetyl phosphate were elevated in cells grown in pyruvate, glucose, and glucuronic acid and were low in cells grown in fructose, glycerol, and fumarate. The effects of varying the intracellular amounts of acetyl phosphate on chemotaxis and the osmo-response were also investigated. Acetyl phosphate was not required but did influence each of these responses. These results suggest that acetyl phosphate may influence either the sensitivity or the magnitude of an adaptive response."
https://openalex.org/W1548610182,"A transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism occurs as mitogen-activated thymocytes undergo proliferation. Glucose utilization and lactate formation increases 18- and 38-fold, respectively, during proliferation. The absolute amount of 14CO2 production by pyruvate dehydrogenase remains constant, while 14CO2 production by the tricarboxylic acid cycle is reduced during transition from a resting to a proliferating state. Addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol, an agent uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, and phenacinemethosulfate, an electron acceptor, provide evidence that the reduction of glucose oxidation in proliferating thymocytes is caused neither by limitation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle itself nor by an insufficient supply of ADP. Our data suggest that enhanced cytosolic regeneration of NAD+ by induction of the glycolytic enzymes during proliferation effectively competes with NADH transport and its subsequent oxidation in the mitochondria. Mitogen-stimulated rat thymocytes cultured in a conventional medium containing glucose induce their glycolytic enzymes 8-10-fold in the S phase of the cell cycle and divide within a culture period of 72 h. Replacement of glucose by glutamine, glutamine and ribose, or glutamine and uridine prevents glycolytic enzyme induction and thymocyte proliferation. The effect of glucose on glycolytic enzyme induction cannot be mimicked by 3-O-methylglucose or 2-deoxyglucose. In conclusion, glucose is required for proliferation and the glycolytic enzyme induction that mediates the transition from oxidative to glycolytic energy production during the G1/S transition of rat thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1482180296,"The physiological significance of the occurrence of sequence similar antimicrobial peptides in frog skin, as the bombinins in Bombina, the magainins in Xenopus, and the dermaseptins in Phyllomedusa, is a major unanswered question. Dermaseptins s1, s2, s3, s4, and s5, a family of cationic (lysine-rich), amphipathic antifungal peptides of 28-34 residues were thus synthesized, purified to homogeneity, and evaluated for their growth-inhibition activity in vitro against various pathogenic microorganisms. Although all five of these peptides shared a similar spectrum of lytic activity against the filamentous fungi that are responsible for opportunistic lethal infections that follow the immunodeficiency syndrome or the use of immunosuppressive agents, they exhibited marked differences in their potencies to arrest the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and yeasts. Likewise, whereas dermaseptins s1 and s5 were devoid of hemolytic activity, dermaseptin s4 caused lysis of erythrocytes at micromolar concentrations. The dermaseptins exhibited dramatic synergy of action upon combination, resulting in some cases in a 100-fold increase in antibiotic activity of the mixture over the activity of the peptides separately. Shortening the peptide chain of dermaseptin s3 to dermaseptin s3-(1-16)-NH2 did not affect the antimicrobial potency of the peptide. Further reduction of the chain length yielded peptide derivatives gradually showing reduced activity. Surprisingly, however, analogs of dermaseptin s3 as shorter as 10-12 residues in length remained fully active against Enterococcus faecalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and against Aeromonas caviae, the causal agent of red-leg disease in amphibians. Overall, these results suggest that, despite 40% sequence similarities, the dermaseptins have distinct spectra of anti-microbial activity and may act in concert to circumvent host invasion by providing frogs with a better shielding against a broad array of microorganisms. They also demonstrate the potential usefulness of short analogs of these peptides as potential candidates for biorational design of germicides."
https://openalex.org/W1568955905,"GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family are maintained as cytosolic complexes with RhoGDI in resting cells, but are released and translocate to the membrane during the course of cell activation. Membrane association of Rac/Rho/CDC42 was specifically induced by GTP analogs and required a heat- and trypsin-labile membrane component. Translocation was associated with the release of Rho family proteins from RhoGDI, but such release did not occur in the absence of membranes, nor was release in the absence of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) sufficient for membrane association. Membrane binding was correlated with exchange of GTP gamma S for GDP on Rac, and only GTP gamma S-bound Rac became membrane localized. We propose that translocation of Rac and other members of the Rho family is controlled by membrane-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors, providing a mechanism to regulate the release and activation of individual members of the Rho family during cell stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1522933979,"The zeta isoform of protein kinase C (zeta PKC) has been shown to be involved in the maturation of Xenopus oocytes and mitogenic signaling in fibroblasts. zeta PKC also regulates the important transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B, most probably by phosphorylation of the inhibitory molecule I kappa B. The mechanisms that control zeta PKC activity are still poorly characterized. This kinase is not activated by diacylglycerol but is potently stimulated in vitro by the products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which suggests that zeta PKC is at least one of the critical targets of PI 3-kinase-triggered signals, and strengthens its role in cell proliferation. PI 3-kinase has been shown, like Raf, to be a direct effector of Ras. zeta PKC is a required step for Ras mitogenic signaling. Therefore, it is possible that zeta PKC directly interacts with Ras during mitogenic activation. We demonstrate here that Ras interacts in vitro with the regulatory domain of zeta PKC as well as that the association of zeta PKC with Ras in vivo is triggered by platelet-derived growth factor. It is also shown here that the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ras (Asn-17) severely impairs the activation of zeta PKC in mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1532410395,"We have purified to homogeneity from the myofibrillar fraction of pig bladder a mammalian heterotrimeric form of PP-1, SMPP-1M. Purified pig bladder SMPP-1M is similar in composition and substrate specificity to avian gizzard PP-1M reported by Alessi et al. (Alessi, D., Macdougall, L. K., Sola, M. M., Ikebe, M., and Cohen, P. (1992) Eur. J. Biochem. 210, 1023-1035) and consists of the catalytic subunit of PP-1 (37 kDa) and two other equimolar subunits of 130 and 20 kDa. The properties of SMPP-1M and the role of its regulatory subunits in the dephosphorylation of myosin and in the initiation of relaxation were characterized both in vitro and in smooth muscle. We show that the relaxant effect of the catalytic subunit in smooth muscle is markedly potentiated by the addition of the regulatory subunits of SMPP-1M. Our findings demonstrate that SMPP-1M is the major phosphatase dephosphorylating myosin in mammalian smooth muscle and that myosin dephosphorylation is regulated in vivo via targeting subunits that specifically alter the substrate specificity of PP-1C toward myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1529376098,"We previously demonstrated that the growth of starch-induced murine macrophages was stimulated by modified low density lipoproteins, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) and acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL), and that the mitogenic effect of Ox-LDL was much greater than that of acetyl-LDL (Yui, S., Sasaki, T., Miyazaki, A., Horiuchi, S., and Yamazaki, M. (1993) Arterioscler. Thromb. 13, 331-337). The present study was undertaken to elucidate the factor(s) that are involved in this growth-stimulating effect of Ox-LDL. The growth-stimulating effect of acetyl-LDL on murine resident macrophages was negligibly weak compared with that of Ox-LDL. However, the treatment of acetyl-LDL with phospholipase A2 led to an increase in lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) (75% of total phospholipids) and a concomitant increase in the mitogenic activity of acetyl-LDL. In contrast, cell-free incubation of Ox-LDL with high density lipoprotein resulted in a decrease in lyso-PC content and a concomitant loss of growth-stimulating activity. These results suggest that lyso-PC may play an essential role in the mitogenic activity of Ox-LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1495312602,"During the initial stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, 5'-terminally redundant (R') DNA, the minus strand synthesized as the complement of the 5'-long terminal repeat (LTR) terminal redundancy, must anneal to the 3'-LTR RNA to enable template transfer. The (R')DNA sequences contain the site involved in the tat-TAR interaction and extensive secondary structures that strongly interfere with annealing. The novel annealing reaction between (R')DNA and 3'-LTR RNA follows first-order kinetics, consistent with an unusually slow unfolding of the secondary structure as the rate-limiting step followed by a more rapid nucleation step. The HIV nucleocapsid protein accelerates the annealing reaction 3000-fold under optimal conditions. This acceleration may be necessary for strand transfer to efficiently occur in vivo and may provide a target for anti-HIV chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1583840873,"Prior studies demonstrated that increased intracellular availability of ceramide induces apoptotic DNA degradation and cell death in the human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and U937 (Jarvis, W. D., Kolesnick, R. N., Fornari, F. A., Traylor, R. S., Gewirtz, D. A., and Grant, S. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 73-77). The present findings show that diglyceride opposes ceramide-related apoptosis in HL-60 and U937 cells. Acute (6-12-h) exposure to sphingomyelinase (100 milliunits/ml) or synthetic ceramide (10 microM) promoted apoptotic degradation of genomic DNA as indicated by (a) the appearance of both approximately 50-kilobase pair (kbp) DNA fragments and approximately 0.2-1.2-kbp DNA fragment ladders on agarose gels, (b) formation and release of small double-stranded DNA fragments, and (c) loss of integrity of bulk DNA. DNA damage was associated with reduced clonogenicity and expression of apoptotic morphology. In contrast, exposure to phospholipase C (0.001-100 milliunits/ml) or synthetic diglyceride (10 microM) failed to promote apoptosis and abolished the lethal actions of ceramide as defined by each of the indices outlined above. Ceramide-related apoptosis was also reduced by acute (6-h) exposure to tumor promoters such as phorbol dibutyrate and mezerein and the non-tumor-promoting agent bryostatin 1; conversely, chronic (24-h) pretreatment with these agents failed to modify ceramide-mediated cytotoxicity, but abolished the protective actions of diglyceride. These findings demonstrate that diglyceride and pharmacological protein kinase C activators reduce or abolish ceramide-mediated apoptosis in human leukemia cells and support the concept of a cytoprotective function for protein kinase C in the regulation of leukemic cell survival. In addition, the capacity of diglyceride to prevent very early genomic lesions (e.g. generation of 50-kbp DNA fragments) suggests that acute activation of protein kinase C arrests apoptosis at an initial stage."
https://openalex.org/W1591714400,"The Ah receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is structurally related to its dimerization partner, the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and two Drosophila proteins, SIM and PER. All four proteins contain a region of homology now referred to as a PAS homology domain. In addition, the AHR, ARNT, and SIM harbor a basic region helix-loop-helix motif in their N termini, whereas PER does not. Previous mapping studies of the AHR have demonstrated that the PAS domain contains sequences required for ligand recognition, dimerization, and interaction with the 90-kDa heat shock protein. They also have confirmed that the basic region helix-loop-helix domain plays a role in both dimerization and sequence-specific DNA binding. To identify domains involved in transactivation of target genes, we generated chimeras of AHR/ARNT deletion mutants with the DNA binding region of the yeast Gal4 protein, transiently expressed these in COS-1 cells, and monitored their capacity to activate the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under the control of a minimal promoter driven by enhancer elements recognized by Gal4. Extensive analysis of these fusions revealed that the AHR and ARNT harbor potent transactivation domains within their C termini. Importantly, the amino-terminal halves of both the AHR and ARNT were found to be devoid of transactivation activity."
https://openalex.org/W1629044468,"The functional and structural interactions of two androgen receptor-binding sites in the 5'-flanking DNA of the rat probasin gene were determined. Deletion mapping and DNase I footprinting analysis had previously identified two androgen receptor-binding sites (ARBS) necessary for androgen induction of the probasin gene: ARBS-1, which resembled a glucocorticoid-responsive element, and ARBS-2, which had a unique sequence. In this study, maximal androgen induction in transient transfection studies only occurred when both sites were present. Neither binding site functioned independently, and deletion of the DNA sequence between the sites resulted in a 60% loss of androgen inducibility. Moreover, point mutations in either ARBS-1 or ARBS-2 led to > 90% loss in activity. Scatchard analysis indicated that ARBS-1 and ARBS-2 bound a synthetic androgen receptor, AR2, with Kd values of 20.0 and 6.7 nM, respectively. Consistent with the higher affinity, ARBS-2 bound AR2 at half the threshold concentration (200 ng) of that required in reciprocal DNase I footprinting experiments with ARBS-1. By comparison, protection occurred at a much lower threshold concentration of AR2 (60 ng) and to the same extent over each site when both sites were present, suggesting a cooperative interaction between the two sites. The cooperative effect was further substantiated when a point mutation in ARBS-1 blocked AR2 binding not only to ARBS-1, but also to ARBS-2. Similarly, a point mutation in ARBS-2 also prevented receptor binding to both sites. Androgen-specific regulation of probasin gene transcription therefore required an androgen-responsive region (positions -286 and +28) containing two androgen receptor-binding sites, where the binding of the androgen receptor to both sites occurred in a cooperative, mutually dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1553737200,"The extracellular domain of the rabbit growth hormone (GH) receptor has previously been shown to be associated with the nucleus. However, in this species the GH binding protein (BP) is derived by proteolytic cleavage of the full-length receptor, and thus distinction between the receptor and BP is difficult. The intracellular domain of the GH receptor is required for GH-stimulated function. Thus a direct nuclear function of GH would presumably require the receptor intracellular domain in the nucleus. We have therefore characterized the rat nuclear GH receptor and BP based on their distinct antigenic identity. We show, in vivo, that the full-length receptor is associated with the nucleus, including the respective subnuclear fractions (nucleoplasm, outer nuclear membranes, inner nuclear membranes, and chromatin). In vivo, the receptor is also subject to ligand-dependent nuclear translocation. Cellular transfection of rat GH receptor cDNA resulted in the appearance of nuclear binding sites for 125I-labeled human GH not present in the untransfected parental cell line (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), buffalo rat liver). To determine which portion of the receptor was responsible for nuclear anchorage, we examined the binding of 125I-labeled human GH to whole nuclei isolated from CHO cells expressing the full-length receptor, a receptor in which 184 amino acids had been deleted from the carboxyl-terminal intracellular domain (CHO-454) and a receptor containing only 5 of 349 amino acids in the intracellular domain (CHO-294). Nuclear binding above the level of the untransfected parental cell line was detected only in CHO-638 and CHO-454 cells, suggesting that amino acids 294-454 of the receptor are necessary for nuclear anchorage. This observation was not due to membrane contamination, as the CHO-294 cells express a membrane-bound receptor that was not anchored in the nucleus. The full-length GH receptor in receptor cDNA-transfected cells is nucleocytoplasmic in the absence of ligand but is also subject to rapid ligand-dependent nuclear translocation. The presence of the intracellular domain of the GH receptor in the nucleus allows the possibility of a direct nuclear response to GH."
https://openalex.org/W1487426514,"Although myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), has been employed as an indicator for the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in intact cells, little is known about its specificity for PKC family members. To address this question, we partially purified human MARCKS from baculovirus-infected cells and compared the kinetic parameters for phosphorylation by PKC isozymes, conventional PKC alpha (cPKC alpha), novel PKC delta (nPKC delta), nPKC epsilon, and atypical PKC zeta (apKC zeta), all of which are distributed in a wide variety of cells. cPKC alpha, nPKC delta, and nPKC epsilon efficiently phosphorylated intact MARCKS protein in vitro. The affinity of MARCKS for cPKC alpha, nPKC delta, and nPKC epsilon was extremely high and decreased in the order alpha > delta > epsilon with Km values of 10.7, 20.7, and 29.8 nM, respectively. The rate of phosphorylation also decreased in the same order. In contrast, a PKC zeta did not phosphorylate MARCKS efficiently, and we were unable to estimate the kinetic parameters. These results suggest that cPKC alpha, nPKC delta, and nPKC epsilon but not a PKC zeta are enzymes that phosphorylate MARCKS in response to PKC activators in intact cells. The structural requirements of MARCKS for efficient phosphorylation by these PKC members were then examined using a peptide that surrounds the phosphorylation site of MARCKS (peptide MARCKS). Interestingly, intact MARCKS showed a 90-150 times lower rate of phosphorylation by PKCs compared with peptide MARCKS, whereas the former showed a 40-180 times higher affinity for these PKC members. This implies that intact MARCKS protein retains a very high affinity for PKC with the sacrifice of its phospho-accepting activity. The structural requirements of PKC were then examined using a calpain-cleaved active fragment of nPKC delta. MARCKS was phosphorylated by the active catalytic fragment as efficiently as by intact nPKC delta, indicating that the kinase domain is sufficient for the high affinity interaction with intact MARCKS. However, gel overlay assay revealed that both intact nPKC delta and its regulatory domain bind to MARCKS, suggesting that both the kinase and regulatory domains of nPKC delta are involved in the high affinity interaction with intact MARCKS protein."
https://openalex.org/W1560193685,"Irradiation of cells with short wave ultraviolet light (UV-C) induces both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) as well as pyrimidine 6-4 pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PP). We have focused on the removal of both types of DNA photolesions from the transcriptionally active adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) genes and the inactive c-mos gene. Induction levels of both CPD and 6-4 PP were similar for all three genes analyzed, with the induction of 6-4 PP being about 3-fold lower than of CPD. Repair of CPD was analyzed using the CPD-specific enzyme T4 endonuclease V; repair of 6-4 PP was examined employing Escherichia coli UvrABC excinuclease. Unlike the HPRT gene, in which CPD were removed selectively from the transcribed strand, both strands of the 16-kilobase fragment encompassing the 2.6-kilobase APRT gene were repaired efficiently. This suggests the existence of multiple transcription units in the APRT region including transcription units running in the opposite direction of the APRT gene. Only a marginal part of the CPD was removed from the inactive c-mos gene after 24 h. In all three genes investigated, 6-4 PP were repaired more rapidly than CPD and, as demonstrated for the HPRT and APRT genes, without strand specificity. The difference in the repair phenotype of CPD between the HPRT gene and the APRT gene coincides with differences between both genes with regard to the DNA strand distribution of previously published UV-induced mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1558953603,"We have recently demonstrated that release of normal human epithelial cells from cell-substratum and/or cell-cell adhesion generates cellular signals that induce the expression of CYP1A1 in the absence of xenobiotic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sadek, C. M., and Allen-Hoffmann, B. L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 169, 16067-16074). To directly test the involvement of the Ah receptor signal transduction pathway in CYP1A1 induction following suspension of epithelial cells, we analyzed wild-type Hepa 1c1c7 cells, a subclone of the Hepa-1c1 mouse hepatoma line, and two mutant Hepa 1c1c7 lines, Class I and Class II. Suspension of wild-type Hepa 1c1c7 cells for 4 h led to an induction of steady state levels of CYP1A1 mRNA, similar to that obtained following treatment of adherent cells with 10(-9) M 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Mutants of the Hepa 1c1c7 cells defective in different aspects of the Ah receptor signal transduction pathway exhibited negligible (Class I) or no (Class II) suspension-mediated induction of CYP1A1 mRNA. Gel mobility shift analysis of nuclear extracts from suspended or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-treated wild-type cells showed that both treatments produced identical shifts in the mobility of an XRE-containing probe. Antibody supershift experiments confirmed that the Ah receptor was a component of the DNA-protein complex from suspended wild-type Hepa 1c1c7 cells. These data directly demonstrate that suspension of wild-type Hepa 1c1c7 cells leads to nuclear localization and activation of the Ah receptor to a DNA-binding form."
https://openalex.org/W1525629451,"The synchrotron x-ray solution scattering profiles of microtubules assembled from purified GDP- or GTP-tubulin with the antitumor drug docetaxel (Taxotere) are consistent with identical non-globular alpha and beta-tubulin monomers ordered within the known surface lattice of microtubules, with a center to center lateral spacing of 5.7 +/- 0.1 nm. The higher angle part of the scattering profile, and therefore the substructure of the microtubule wall is identical in Taxotere- and Taxol-induced microtubules, to the resolution of the measurements. However, Taxotere-induced microtubules have a mean diameter of 24.2 +/- 0.4 nm, which is 1.12 +/- 0.01 times larger than that of paclitaxel (Taxol) induced microtubules. The population of Taxotere microtubules has on average 13.4 protofilaments, which is similar to control microtubules assembled with glycerol but is in marked contrast with Taxol-induced microtubules, which have on average 12 protofilaments under identical solution conditions. Model populations of Taxotere and Taxol microtubules with the distributions of protofilament numbers determined by electron microscopy reproduce the positions and approximate intensities of the experimental x-ray scattering data. Comparison of the structures and activities of both taxoids strongly suggests that the change of the more frequent lateral bond angle between tubulin molecules from 152.3 degrees (13-protofilament microtubules) to 150 degrees (12-protofilament microtubules) is linked to the binding of the side chain of Taxol. Optimal microtubule formation is obtained with unitary Taxotere to tubulin heterodimer ratio; however, ligand molecules in excess over tubulin dimers cause a loss of cylindrical scattering features, consistent with microtubule opening. The results are compatible with the observed biochemical and thermodynamic properties of this ligand-induced microtubule assembly system and also with the simple working hypothesis that taxoids would bind between adjacent microtubule protofilaments."
https://openalex.org/W1577994680,"The gut-associated excretory antigen CAA (circulating anodic antigen) from adult Schistosoma mansoni worms was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography. Amino acid analysis following alkaline borohydride treatment indicated that CAA is a glycoprotein, O-glycosylated at Thr. The primary structure of the released O-glycan moiety was investigated by one- and two-dimensional, homo- and heteronuclear 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. It was found that the major carbohydrate chains have a novel polysaccharide structure, consisting of a branched disaccharide repeating unit containing 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D- galactopyranose (beta-D-Galp-NAc) and beta-D-glucopyranuronic acid (beta-D-GlcpA). [formula: see text] The major antigenic character of CAA arises from this novel polysaccharide, which was shown to be an absolutely specific diagnostic marker in schistosomiasis. The cross-reactivity of CAA with anti-CCA (circulating cathodic antigen) monoclonal antibodies is caused by the presence of a small amount of O-linked CCA-poly-Lewis x carbohydrate chains on the CAA protein chain."
https://openalex.org/W1538847621,"We have demonstrated that the native proenzymatic form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A can be cleaved at its specific activation site by furin in intact Chinese hamster ovary cells or in vitro by furin in isolated membrane fractions from these cells. We have compared the activity of furin in cell membrane fractions with that of purified, recombinant human furin. We have verified that RPE.40, a Pseudomonas toxin-resistant mutant cell strain, is mutant in the fur gene, and we have demonstrated that these cells are deficient in cleavage of the toxin. We have also determined that this cleavage of Pseudomonas toxin by furin takes place at the authentic activation site to release the 37-kDa active fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1490652718,"Abstract We have screened genes predominantly expressed in the rat spinal cord, and we report here cloning of the most abundant unknown gene. It is a novel member of the central nervous system (CNS) myelin-constituting proteins, myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MOBP). MOBP is abundantly expressed specifically in oligodendrocytes at the mRNA level only next to myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein. Two isoforms have been confirmed. One of them has proline-rich tandem repeats and has 84% homology with human counterpart in terms of predicted amino acid sequences. The cDNA-derived primary structure predicts a small, soluble, basic protein. The immunoelectron microscopy has shown that MOBP is expressed throughout compact myelin. All these characteristics are similar to MBP. One definite difference between MBP and MOBP is that MOBP is expressed exclusively in the CNS myelin. These findings suggest that MOBP shares some important functions with MBP in the CNS myelin such as myelin compaction."
https://openalex.org/W1562183602,"Elongation factor 1 (EF-1) regulates the specific interaction of aminoacyl-tRNA with the ribosome during the elongation phase of protein biosynthesis. Although individual functions of its separate chains have been well defined, to date there is hardly information about the structure and function of the whole complex. We describe here the complete subunit structure of elongation factor 1, and discuss its change during development of Artemia. Elongation factor 1 consists of a pentameric complex, composed of four different subunits alpha, beta, gamma, and delta in a molar ratio of 2:1:1:1. Although one molecule of EF-1 alpha dissociates easily from the complex EF-1 alpha 2 beta gamma delta under the influence of aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP, the second molecule of EF-1 alpha was found to remain firmly attached. Thus, in eukaryotic protein synthesis, movement of transfer RNAs to the ribosome seems under the influence of two distinct molecules of EF-1 alpha, a result possibly related to the presumed consumption of two molecules of GTP by EF-Tu during the elongation step of prokaryotic protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1552619591,"Expression conditions in Escherichia coli of wild-type, Y224F, and Y228F mutants of pig kidney D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) have been changed to yield more enzyme. The mutated proteins show spectral properties similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, in all oxidation-reduction states. All enzymes were studied by steady state and rapid reaction methods. Turnover numbers determined for Y224F DAAO with different substrates were similar to those of wild-type protein, while the Y228F DAAO always showed lower turnover numbers and higher Km values for the D-amino acid. Analyses of reduction traces at 450 and 550 nm of stopped-flow experiments with wild-type DAAO showed the presence of a new phase, the conversion between two different charge-transfer complexes of the reduced enzyme and imino acid product. The substitution of Tyr-228 totally abolished the formation of the long wavelength bands while Y224F DAAO showed long wavelength absorbance only for the first intermediate. Reoxidation of the reduced flavin results from reaction of oxygen with the first charge-transfer complex. The rate of reduction with D-alanine as substrate was 1225,45 and 10 s-1 for wild-type, Y224F, and Y228F DAAOs, respectively. Comparison of the properties of these two mutant enzyme forms with those of the wild-type DAAO indicate that both tyrosine residues have their main function in the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1549226038,"The thyroid hormone receptors (TR) form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXR) and activate target genes through thyroid-responsive elements (TRE). Heterodimerization elevates the DNA binding efficiency and thus can result in functional synergism between TR and RXR. Here we demonstrate that DNA sequences dictate the cooperative activation between TR and RXR despite the high affinity binding of the heterodimer to those TREs. We provide evidence that the C-terminal activation domain of RXR can modulate the triiodothyronine (T3) responsiveness of TR/RXR heterodimers on reporter genes without altering the DNA binding properties of the heterodimers. The modulation function of this relatively small region is under the control of specific TRE sequences and promoter context. These data indicate that this C-terminal region of RXR is likely involved in receptor-cellular factor(s) interactions. Finally, we propose that the synergistic activation by TR and RXR is achieved through elevated DNA binding and, dependent on the DNA sequence, the interaction of RXR with other transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1572241925,"In cells and cell-free extracts, the early steps in histone mRNA decay occur at the 3' terminus and appear to be catalyzed by a polysome-associated 3' to 5' exoribonuclease. We describe the purification of a polysomal 3' to 5' exoribonuclease that is magnesium-dependent, active at pH 7-8 in salt concentrations below 200 mM, and resistant to the inhibitor of the RNase A family of RNases. The purified enzyme is inactive with 3'-phosphorylated RNA substrates and with DNA but can degrade duplex RNA in the absence of added ATP. The enzyme migrates at approximately 37 kDa by native state gel filtration and at 33 kDa in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. It degrades poly(A) but not a complex of poly(A) with poly(A) binding protein, and it accelerates histone mRNA decay in high salt-washed (enzyme-depleted) polysomes. Similarities between the purified exoribonuclease and the activity that degrades histone mRNA in vitro suggest that the enzyme might be a mammalian messenger ribonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1550872113,"A colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1)-dependent murine macrophage cell line (BAC1.2F5) and peritoneal macrophages were used to investigate the relationship between growth factor-dependent phosphorylation/activation of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and arachidonic acid metabolism. The addition of CSF-1 to quiescent BAC1.2F5 cells was followed by the rapid phosphorylation, electrophoretic gel retardation, and stable increase in the specific activity of cPLA2 that correlated with the activation of ERK kinases. cPLA2 phosphorylation depended on the presence of growth factor and persisted throughout the cell cycle. CSF-1 inhibited prostaglandin E2 production and did not enhance arachidonic acid release or increase the levels of lysophosphatidylcholine or glycerophosphocholine. Treatment of BAC1.2F5 cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 plus CSF-1 did not stimulate eicosanoid release. Instead, CSF-1 enhanced the rate of exogenous arachidonic acid incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and its subsequent transfer to phosphatidylethanolamine suggesting that higher rates of arachidonic acid acylation may contribute to the suppression of prostaglandin production. In peritoneal macrophages, ERK kinase activity was stimulated and cPLA2 was phosphorylated and activated in response to CSF-1. However, CSF-1 did not trigger eicosanoid release but did augment arachidonic acid mobilization and prostaglandin E2 production elicited by zymosan and A23187. Thus, cPLA2 phosphorylation/activation and calcium mobilization are not the only determinants for eicosanoid release, and additional components in differentiated tissue macrophages are also required."
https://openalex.org/W1571281254,"Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase, a member of the eukaryotic type I enzyme family, binds duplex DNA and forms a covalent adduct at sites containing a conserved sequence element 5'-CCCTT decreases in the scissile strand. The protein-DNA interface entails essential contacts with four phosphate moieties within the CCCTT motif, including the scissile phosphate, and three phosphates within the GGGAA sequence on the noncleaved strand. Critical protein-phosphate contacts are arrayed across the minor groove of the DNA helix. Base-specific contacts with the pentamer element are within the major groove and are situated on the opposite face of the helix. Thus, vaccinia topoisomerase binds circumferentially to its target site in duplex DNA. This binding mode suggests that the eukaryotic enzyme adopts a toroidal shape in the DNA-bound state. Conformational isomerization of the bound protein provides a plausible mechanism for DNA relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W1489399260,"Bradykinin (BK), a potent vasoactive nonapeptide formed by proteolytic cleavage of kininogen, mediates its activity by binding to specific cell surface receptors. Delivery of BK to these receptors is limited by cell-bound and plasma kininases that degrade BK to inactive fragments. Binding of its parent compound, kininogen, to specific endothelial cell receptors may provide an environment in which the degradation of BK by kininases is restricted. The determinants that mediate kininogen binding to endothelial cells have not been fully elucidated. The present studies suggest that part of BK and the amino-terminal amino acids of kininogens' common light chain constitute part of this recognition sequence. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in culture at 37 degrees C express 2-3-fold more binding sites for biotinylated high molecular weight kininogen (biotin-HK) containing BK than for biotin-HK from which BK has been liberated by plasma kallikrein. Binding of BK-free biotin-HK was not restored by preincubating HUVEC with BK, arguing against the possibility that BK released from biotin-HK stimulated expression of additional HK receptors. The extent of biotin-HK binding to HUVEC at 37 degrees C directly correlated with the amount of BK retained within the protein. Four lines of evidence suggest that part of BK and the amino terminus of the light chain of kininogens are part of the sequence recognized by the endothelial cell kininogen receptor. First, monoclonal antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of BK (MBK3) and the common light chains of the kininogens (HKL6, HKL8) inhibited biotin-HK binding to HUVEC. Second, a synthetic, dimeric bradykinin receptor antagonist blocked biotin-HK (IC50 = 9 microM) binding to HUVEC as did two synthetic tissue kallikrein inhibitors modeled after the carboxyl-terminal sequence of BK. Third, synthetic peptides containing the carboxyl-terminal portion of BK and the amino terminus of kininogens' common light chain, MKRPPGFSPFRSSRIG and GFSPFRSSRIG, blocked binding of biotin-HK (IC50 = 2-3 mM), whereas an overlapping peptide, SPFRSSRIGEIKEETT, at 5 mM and a scrambled peptide, FSGPKRSPIMGRPSFR, did not. Fourth, biotinylated GMKRPPGFSPFRSSRIG specifically bound to HUVEC, and its binding was blocked by HK. Since the presence of the nonapeptide BK in HK contributes to maximal binding of HK to HUVEC, there is a novel type of BK receptor in which part of the nonapeptide is recognized within the context of its parent molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1523680394,"GTPases of the Rab family play a key role in the regulation of vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells. Several accessory proteins that regulate their GDP/GTP cycle as well as their subcellular localization have been identified within the past few years. The best known is Rab3A GDP dissociation inhibitor protein (GDI), originally identified as an inhibitor of GDP dissociation from Rab3A, a Rab protein specifically expressed in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells. Recent studies have pointed out a role of Rab3A GDI as a chaperone of several Rab proteins during their cycling between cytosol and membranes and Rab3A GDI has been considered so far as a general regulator of Rab function. However, cDNAs encoding potential isoforms of this protein, called GDI beta and GDI-2, have been recently isolated. In this study, we have characterized cytosolic Rab protein complexes in various cell types and tissues using Mono Q chromatography. We show that in rat brain and in insulin-secreting RINm5F cells, the majority of Rab proteins are complexed with Rab3A GDI. In contrast, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, they are mainly complexed to a protein that we have identified as GDI beta. In rat liver cytosol, Rab proteins form complexes with both isoforms. We also show that the proportion of Rab proteins complexed with either isoform depends on the relative abundance of Rab3A GDI and GDI beta in the cytosol. These findings suggest that GDI isoforms are either redundant or could be involved in the fine control of Rab function."
https://openalex.org/W1513153622,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the alpha 2A-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2A AR) incorporates [3H]palmitate and that replacement of Cys442 by Ala or Ser eliminates detectable acylation without perturbing coupling to pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins (Kennedy, M. E., and Limbird, L. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8003-8011) or, as shown here, without perturbing agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation, in contrast to the consequences of eliminating beta 2-adrenergic receptor acylation. As a first step in revealing the functional role for this post-translational modification at the alpha 2A AR, we explored sequences in the alpha 2AAR which confer alpha 2AAR acylation and whether or not [3H]palmitoylation of the alpha 2AAR is dynamic. Deletion of the 7 terminal amino acids distal to Cys442 of the alpha 2AAR did not eliminate detectable [3H]palmitoylation of the alpha 2AAR, whereas truncation to Leu441 did, indicating both that Cys442 is the likely site for acylation and that sequences distal to Cys442 are not required for acylation at Cys442. Since mutation of sequences proximal to Cys442 altered overall receptor structure, based on markedly reduced detectable adrenergic receptor binding, proximal motifs required for palmitoylation of the alpha 2AAR could not be explored further. When the turnover of [35S]Met/Cys-labeled alpha 2AAR was compared with the turnover of the [3H]palmitate-labeled alpha 2AAR, it was of interest that agonist treatment accelerated the half-life of decay of the [3H]palmitate-labeled alpha 2AAR without detectable receptor down-regulation, providing evidence that the acylation of the alpha 2AAR may be a dynamic process."
https://openalex.org/W1482566901,"Abstract Human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is inhibited by ethylmalonyl-CoA, cyclopropylcarbonyl-CoA carboxylate, and methylenecyclopropylacetyl-CoA, which are substrate, intermediate, and product analogs, respectively. The mode of inhibition by each analog is reversible and mixed with respect to the substrate, methylmalonyl-CoA. This implies that the inhibitors are able to bind to both free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, although with affinities that are 4.5- to 10-fold different for the two species. The Ki1 for the cyclopropylcarbonyl-CoA carboxylate (0.26 +/- 0.07 mM), is 4-fold greater than the Km(app) measured for the substrate, methylmalonyl-CoA. Additionally, ethylmalonyl-CoA functions as an alternate substrate and is metabolized to methylsuccinyl-CoA. The human mutase is a homodimer that binds 1 mol of cobalamin per subunit. So, the observed mixed inhibition kinetics by substrate analogs is curious. Our finding that methylenecyclopropylacetyl-CoA, the causative agent of Jamaican vomiting sickness, inhibits methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, while interesting, is probably not physiologically important because of the relatively high inhibition constants (Ki1 = 0.47 +/- 0.12 mM and Ki2 = 2 +/- 0.34 mM) observed with this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1494209531,"Inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases by thapsigargin elicits [Ca2+]i oscillations in rat salivary gland (parotid) acinar cells which are similar to those activated by agonists but are nevertheless independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Foskett, J. K., Roifman, C. M., and Wong, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2778-2782). Neither bafilomycin alone or together with monensin or chloroquine inhibited thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations, ruling out the involvement of vacuolar-type proton pumps or organellar acidity in the mechanisms underlying them. Acute inhibition of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase by 1 mM La3+ inhibited the decline of [Ca2+]i during the falling phase of the oscillation. Acute inhibition of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx by removal of extracellular Ca2+, membrane depolarization, or inorganic channel blockers immediately abolished oscillations, even when applied during the [Ca2+]i rising phase of the cycle. Ca2+ influx rate oscillated during [Ca2+]i oscillations, varying 1.5-13-fold during a cycle. Modification of the rate of Ca2+ influx, by titrating the extent of depletion of IP3-sensitive stores or manipulating extracellular [Ca2+], indicated that oscillations depended on a high rate of Ca2+ influx. In thapsigargin- or carbachol-treated cells which did not exhibit a sustained [Ca2+]i rise or [Ca2+]i oscillations, inhibition of Ca2+ influx activated plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability. Thus, agonist- and thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in parotid acinar cells appear to be generated by plasma membrane-based mechanisms which involve periodic inactivation by [Ca2+]i of the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ influx pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1564316119,"The expression and function of eukaryotic protein kinases is highly regulated, primarily through transcriptional and post-translational processes. In this report we demonstrate an unusual mechanism for controlling protein kinase function, translational control. The Trypanosoma brucei Nrk loci encode predicted protein kinases. Here we show that Nrk has protein serine-threonine kinase activity and examine the expression and activity of Nrk during parasite development. While Nrk transcripts were previously found to be constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle, we now find that expression of Nrk protein is highly stage-regulated. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Nrk expression dramatically increased as the parasites differentiated from proliferative slender bloodforms to the non-proliferative stumpy bloodforms. Procyclic form organisms expressed moderate levels of Nrk. Analysis of Nrk activity demonstrated that it too was highest in stumpy bloodforms. Metabolic labeling and pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that Nrk accumulation was highest in stumpy bloodforms and indicated that Nrk abundance is primarily controlled at the level of biosynthesis rather than turnover. All Nrk mRNA was contained in the poly(A)+ fraction, and the 5' ends of the transcript were the same in each developmental stage. Thus, Nrk is under translational control. The strict developmental regulation of the Nrk enzymes within the trypanosome life cycle suggests that the Nrk protein kinase may play a role in parasite differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2155746575,"Exposure of P11 cells to serotonin (5-HT) resulted in a transient increase in levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA. Exposure to 5-HT for as short a time as 1 min was sufficient to trigger a delayed increase in receptor mRNA. 5-HT-induced increases in receptor mRNA levels were not antagonized by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The increase in receptor mRNA levels was accompanied by a transient increase in the half-life of receptor mRNA; the rate of transcription of receptor mRNA was unchanged. Submaximal stimulation of phosphinositide hydrolysis by partial agonists or 6-fluoronorepinephrine, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist, also increased receptor mRNA levels. Exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C, mimicked these effects, whereas the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide antagonized the effects of both 5-HT and PMA. When agonist-promoted increases in receptor mRNA were prevented, the rate of agonist-induced down-regulation was accelerated. These data suggest that levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA are regulated by phospholipase C-coupled receptors via a protein kinase C-dependent, post-transcriptional mechanism and indicate that agonist-promoted increases in levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA modulate receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W1516677723,"S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase catalyzes the conversion of AdoHcy to adenosine (Ado) and homocysteine (Hcy), as well as the reverse reaction, through a mechanism involving an NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of the 3'-hydroxyl group of AdoHcy (3'-oxidative activity), followed by elimination of Hcy to form 3'-keto-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-Ado. The addition of water at the 5'-position (5'-hydrolytic activity) of this tightly bound intermediate, followed by an NADH-dependent reduction, results in the formation of Ado. Based on a computer graphics model of the active site of this enzyme, it was hypothesized that amino acid residues at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein reside in the active site of the enzyme and could play a role in catalyzing the 5'-hydrolytic reaction (Yeh, J. C., Borchardt, R. T., and Vedani, A. (1991) J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 5, 213-234). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show here that lysine 426 is essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme and that it appears to play a crucial role in the 5'-hydrolytic activity and/or stability of the quaternary structure of the human placental enzyme. Mutation of Lys-426 to arginine (K426R) produces a stable tetrameric enzyme that lacks overall catalytic activity and that was isolated predominantly as its NADH form containing tightly bound 3'-keto-Ado, suggesting that the K426R mutant has oxidative activity, but lacks 5'-hydrolytic activity, preventing it from completing the entire catalytic cycle. Mutations of Lys-426 to glutamic acid (K426E) and alanine (K426A) produce enzymes that exist primarily as monomers, do not bind NAD+ or NADH, and lack catalytic activity. The results of the Lys-426 mutations suggest that this lysine residue is crucial for the 5'-hydrolytic activity of the enzyme and/or stabilizing the quaternary structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1504669895,"The fibronectin (Fn) monomer contains two major sites of fibrin binding affinity present within the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains; they consist of five (1F1-5F1) and three (10F1-12F1) consecutive type 1 modules, respectively. Recently, we have reported that the fourth and fifth type 1 module pair (4F1.5F1) of the NH2-terminal domain of fibronectin demonstrated fibrin binding ability (Williams, M. J., Phan, I., Harvery, T. S., Rostagno, A., Gold, L. I., and Campbell, I. D. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235, 1303-1311). In an attempt to further localize fibrin binding activity and to characterize the nature of the interaction between different type 1 modules of Fn and fibrin, we have tested a range of recombinant proteins and subtilisin generated proteolytic fragments of Fn in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by fibrin affinity chromatography. Of the recombinant proteins, we found that only the 4F1.5F1 exhibited significant fibrin binding activity, while 1F1, 1F1.2F1, 7F1, and 10F1 had little to no affinity for fibrin. On a molar basis, 4-5 times more 4F1.5F1 than a proteolytic fragment, corresponding to 1F1-5F1 (25.9 kDa) was required to cause 50% inhibition (IC50) of intact biotinylated Fn binding to fibrin in a competitive ELISA. This suggests that all five type 1 modules in tandem engender higher fibrin binding activity than the 4F1.5F1 alone. Furthermore, since fibrin binding activity of the intact Fn molecule was inhibited, by 70-80%, by the 4F1.5F1, the 25.9-kDa fragment, and a MoAb mapped to an epitope on the 4F1.5F1, the fibrin-binding site within the 4F1.5F1 contributes greatly to the non-covalent interaction of intact Fn with fibrin. These results provide significant insight into the Fn/fibrin interaction, a major component of the processes of wound repair and fibrin matrix assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1663817504,"The transmembrane protein, transferrin receptor (TfR), is found in a soluble form in human serum and in the medium of cell lines grown in tissue culture. The soluble form is generated by proteolytic cleavage between Arg-100 and Leu-101. We used two mutant human TfRs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking endogenous transferrin receptor to characterize the protease that cleaves the TfR and determine its location in the cell. The T104D mutant TfR lacks the O-linked carbohydrate at position 104, and is more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage at Arg-100 than the wildtype human TfR in these cells. We find that the protease is not a component of the serum in the growth medium, and it is not secreted by the cells. Cleavage does not occur during biosynthesis of the TfR, and occurs after the TfR has reached the cell surface. Expression of the T104D TfR in a temperature-sensitive acidification defective CHO cell line, G.7.1, shows that cleavage of the TfR is not dependent on acidification of endosomes. The C20A23 TfR is an endocytosis deficient mutant lacking an internalization signal. This mutant TfR, which is mainly localized to the cell surface, is cleaved less efficiently than the wild-type TfR, indicating that the protease is localized to an intracellular compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1574764700,"Abstract In the presence of transcription substrates ATP, CTP, and UTP, a stable ternary complex containing tetranucleotide AUCA is formed on the phage lambda PL promoter (starting sequence C-3A-2C-1A+1U+2C+3A+4G+5). We show that in the absence of GTP or at undersaturating GTP concentrations the AUCA transcript synthesized at the +1 to +4 segment slips back by 3 nucleotides and is stabilized in the ternary complex in such a way that only its 2 3'-proximal bases remain paired to the -1/+1 positions of the template DNA. The slipped transcript can be extended in a template-directed manner into longer chains that can be cleaved by the GreA or GreB proteins at the +1/+2 junction. The slipped stabilized tetranucleotide delineates the product binding of RNA polymerase responsible for stable holding of the transcript in the ternary transcription complex. The results suggest that the tight product binding site encompasses the locality within the complex where the nascent transcript detaches from the template strand of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2110165433,"We have previously shown that the 50-kDa subunit of the clathrin assembly complex AP-2 (AP50) stoichiometrically binds to and is immunoprecipitated with the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) from clathrin-coated vesicles (Myers, M., and Forgac, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9184-9186). We now report that treatment of stripped coated vesicles with cystine results in a purified V-ATPase complex lacking the AP50 polypeptide. Removal of AP50 can be reversed upon treatment of the vesicles with dithiothreitol. Removal of AP50 reduces the ATPase activity of the purified V-ATPase by 90% relative to the enzyme containing AP50. This inhibition is not reversed upon treatment of the AP50-depleted enzyme with dithiothreitol in the absence of AP50. The reconstituted V-ATPase depleted of AP50 is devoid of ATP-dependent proton transport activity. We observe further that the peripheral V1 subunits are unable to reassemble onto the integral V0 domain in the absence of AP50. The addition of purified AP-2 containing the AP50 polypeptide restores the ability of the V1 subunits to assemble with the V0 sector to give a V-ATPase complex that is functional in ATP-dependent proton transport. These results indicate that the AP50 polypeptide is necessary for both activity and in vitro reassembly of the V-ATPase complex."

https://openalex.org/W2122845637,"UDP-galactose 4-epimerase catalyzes the interconversion of UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose. The enzyme from Escherichia coli is a dimeric protein with an overall molecular weight of 79,000 that contains NAD+ very tightly but noncovalently bound in the enzymatic active site. NAD+ is the coenzyme for epimerization and is transiently reduced to NADH in the course of catalysis. All samples of highly purified UDP-galactose 4-epimerase contain significant amounts of NADH, and that purified after overexpression in E. coli cells contains a substantial amount of NADH. To the degree that NADH replaces enzyme bound NAD+ in the coenzyme binding site, the epimerase activity is decreased. The extinction coefficient at 345 nm for NADH in its binding site is estimated to be 3.3 mM-1 cm-1. 31P NMR spectroscopic and enzymatic analyses reveal that UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP, and UMP are gradually released from the purified enzyme upon addition of UMP or P1-5'-uridine-P2-methyl diphosphate (MeUDP). It is concluded that NADH associated with the purified enzyme is a component of inactive, abortive complexes (E-NADH-uridine nucleotide) that contain tightly bound uridine nucleotides in place of the epimerization intermediate UDP-4-keto-alpha-D-hexoglucopyranose. These complexes are produced in vivo in the course of bacterial growth. The enzymatic activity of purified epimerase is increased by reaction with 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate, which oxidizes the NADH to NAD+. Compositionally defined abortive complexes (E-NADH-uridine nucleotide) containing UMP, UDP, or UDP-hexoses (Glc/Gal) have been prepared in vitro and subjected to activation by 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate. All are activated at rates comparable to that for the purified enzyme, although those containing UMP and UDP-hexose are more readily activated than those containing UDP. The activity of the reactivated enzyme approaches that of the most highly active epimerase that has been reported from E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1529045066,"A sensitive and specific GTP-activated Ca2+ translocation process induces rapid Ca2+ movements within cells and appears to reflect G protein-induced membrane fusion or junctional communication between discrete subpopulations of Ca(2+)-pumping organelles (Ghosh, T. K., Mullaney, J. M., Tarazi, F. I., and Gill, D. L. (1989) Nature 340, 236-239). Since fatty acylation can modify G protein action, modification of GTP-induced Ca2+ translocation by fatty acyl-CoA was investigated to throw light on the mechanism underlying Ca2+ transfer. Using permeabilized DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells, 2 microM palmitoyl-CoA completely blocked Ca2+ release activated by 20 microM GTP, while having no effect on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) for palmitoyl-CoA was 0.5 microM. Above 3 microM, palmitoyl-CoA inhibited Ca2+ accumulation. Fatty acyl chain length was important, C-13 to C-16 fatty acyl-CoA esters all fully blocking the action of GTP; the IC50 for myristoyl-CoA was also 0.5 microM. C-18 or larger acyl groups had diminished effectiveness as did C-8 or smaller acyl groups. Acetyl-CoA had no blocking effect. In contrast, 10 microM CoA itself blocked GTP-induced Ca2+ release. CoA required a free sulfhydryl group to block, desulfo-CoA having no effect. Removal of ATP by hexokinase and glucose prevented the action of CoA but not palmitoyl-CoA. The free sulfhydryl and ATP requirements indicated CoA was being acylated by endogenous fatty-acyl-CoA synthetase to be effective. The nonhydrolyzable myristoyl-CoA analog, S-(2-oxopentadecyl)-CoA, blocked the GTP effect identically to myristoyl- and palmitoyl-CoA (IC50 = 0.5 microM); thus, fatty acyl transfer is not required, indicating that blockade is due to a direct allosteric modification of a component of the GTP-activated process by acyl-CoA esters. Palmitoyl-CoA not only inhibited but completely reversed GTP-activated Ca2+ release, resulting in the released Ca2+ being taken back up into pools. In the presence of oxalate, GTP-activated Ca2+ transfer results in a substantial increase in Ca2+ accumulation; palmitoyl-CoA also completely reversed this effect resulting in rapid termination of Ca2+ uptake. This reversal provides strong evidence that GTP-activated Ca2+ translocation does not reflect a membrane fusion event. Instead, it likely represents formation of a reversible junction or pore between organelles which may be a required prefusion event."
https://openalex.org/W2157447886,"His-412 in wild-type Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase is a direct ligand to one of the two zinc atoms critical for the function of the enzyme. To investigate the function of this residue, site-specific mutagenesis was used to substitute His-412 with asparagine and alanine, generating mutant enzymes H412N and H412A, respectively. Both mutant enzymes show a 5-fold decrease in kcat and 30-fold increase in Km when compared to the corresponding kinetic parameters for the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, Tris and ethanolamine inhibit both the mutant enzymes by inhibiting the hydrolysis reaction and not participating in the transferase reaction; furthermore, both mutants have lower zinc and phosphate content than the wild-type enzyme. The addition of Zn2+ to the H412N and H412A enzymes restores catalytic activity to within 2-fold of the value for the wild-type enzyme, but more importantly the presence of Zn2+ completely restores substrate affinity. The similarity in the kinetic parameters for the H412N and H412A enzymes in the absence and presence of zinc suggests that the asparagine side chain does not play a significant role in coordinating zinc. Furthermore, both the asparagine and alanine substitutions reduce the affinity of the resulting enzymes for zinc. The pH profiles for the two mutant enzymes are different than the pH profile observed for the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the amino acid substitutions may have altered the pKa of the zinc coordinated water molecule that is critical in the second step of the mechanism. These data suggest that His-412 does not directly participate in the catalytic mechanism but is mainly involved in zinc binding, and therefore is also indirectly involved in substrate binding and product release."

Modulation of the number of cell surface receptors by various agents has shown a lack of direct correlation with biological responses to the cytokine. In this report, we used several approaches to investigate the relationship between TNF receptor number and an early response in human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cells. When we examined the activation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), an event mediated by TNF within 10-15 min, we discovered a correlation between TNF receptor occupancy up to a certain threshold and the extent of activation of the transcription factor. In addition, by kinetically down-regulating TNF receptor expression with phorbol esters, cycloheximide, or trypsin, we determined that receptors were necessary for transduction of the TNF signal. However, 10-25% of total receptors were sufficient for optimum induction of the NF-kappa B signal. When examined in different cell lines, the activation of an early biological response was found to be related not only to the TNF receptor number but also to the type of TNF receptor. These results, overall, suggest that although TNF receptors are essential for induction of NF-kappa B, a small percentage is sufficient to fully transduce this signal."
https://openalex.org/W1510504354,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHb) phosphatase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from mitochondria of the adult parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. The enzyme is a heterodimer of 89 and 50 kDa, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It appeared to copurify with its substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) and could be separated by chromatography on Superose 12 in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl. Phosphatase activity was absolutely dependent on Mg2+, with an apparent Km of about 4 mM. In contrast to PDHb phosphatases from other sources, the ascarid enzyme was not stimulated by Ca2+ or spermine, but it was stimulated by L-malate, the major mitochondrial substrate in A. suum. L-Malate had no effect on the dephosphorylation of isolated [32P]E1, but it decreased the apparent Km of the phosphatase for 32P-pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or [32P]E1 in the reconstituted complex about 4-6-fold, suggesting that the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) core was necessary for malate activation. The activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) in isolated A. suum muscle mitochondria was significantly greater than that reported for other mitochondria, and the majority of the PDC appeared to be in the phosphorylated inactive state. Incubation of intact phosphorylating A. suum muscle mitochondria in the absence of substrate and the presence of an uncoupler did not lead to an activation of PDC activity. In contrast, incubation in malate plus Mg2+ markedly increased PDC activity. These results contrast markedly with those reported for aerobic mitochondria and suggest that the regulation of PDC activity in these anaerobic organelles differs significantly from that of their mammalian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1511974988,"beta 1,4-Galactosyltransferase is unusual among the glycosyltransferases in that a subpopulation exists on the cell surface in addition to its traditional biosynthetic location within the Golgi complex. On the cell surface, galactosyltransferase is expressed in spatially restricted, cell type-specific domains, where it functions as a receptor for extracellular oligosaccharide ligands during selected cellular interactions. For example, galactosyltransferase is found on the leading and trailing edges of migrating cells, where it facilitates lamellipodia formation and cell spreading by binding to specific N-linked oligosaccharides within laminin. Although the ability of galactosyltransferase to serve as a laminin receptor is well documented, it is unclear whether it functions solely in a lectin-like capacity to bind laminin glycoside ligands or uses its intrinsic catalytic activity to release itself from and modify its oligosaccharide substrate. In this study, we determined whether cell surface galactosyltransferase spontaneously galactosylates laminin matrices during cell migration using endogenous galactose donors. Cells were prelabeled with [3H]galactose, washed, and transferred in small clusters onto laminin matrices. The prelabeled cells migrated out from the cell cluster, during which time they deposited covalently bound [3H]galactose residues onto the laminin matrix. The degree of galactosylation was both laminin- and time-dependent and required actively migrating, intact cells. The radioactivity released from the 3H-galactosylated laminin by acid hydrolysis comigrated with authentic galactose standards on paper chromatography. In parallel assays, there was no radioactivity deposited on laminin matrices when cells were prelabeled with [3H]fucose or [3H]leucine. Furthermore, [3H]galactosylation was dependent upon galactosyltransferase-mediated cell migration, since prelabeled cells did not deposit [3H]galactose when migrating on fibronectin, upon which migration is integrin-dependent and galactosyltransferase-independent. These results raise the possibility that galactosyltransferase functions catalytically during cell migration, either to dissociate from its oligosaccharide ligand and/or to modify the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1545851699,"Characterization of the hydrophobic EF acceptor pocket involving Phe-beta 85 and Leu-beta 88 as well as the Val-beta 6 donor site is critical for understanding the polymerization of deoxy Hb S. Glu substitutions at beta 85 or beta 88 in Hb S were made and expressed in yeast in an effort to evaluate the role of hydrophobicity in the acceptor pocket during polymerization of Hb S. Both substitutions result in decreased tetramer stability, increases in oxygen affinity, and inhibition in polymerization compared with Hb S. Critical concentrations for polymerization of Hb SF beta 85E and Hb SL beta 88E were 2.4- and 7-fold higher, respectively, than that of Hb S, while the value for Hb SL beta 88E was intermediate between those previously reported for Hb SL beta 88A and Hb SL beta 88F (Adachi, K., Konitzer, P., Paulraj, C. G., and Surrey, S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 17477-17480). Kinetics of polymerization of Glu-beta 85 and Glu-beta 88 deoxy Hb S tetramers were biphasic at lower hemoglobin concentrations like deoxy Hb SL beta 88A, suggesting formation of two types of polymers during polymerization. The time required to form half the total amount of polymer (t1/2) for deoxy Hb SF beta 85E was 10-fold shorter than that for deoxy Hb SL beta 88E. In addition, t1/2 for deoxy Hb SF beta 85E was 2.5-fold shorter, while that for Hb SL beta 88E was 4-fold longer than deoxy Hb SL beta 88A at equivalent concentrations. These results suggest that hydrophobicity of the amino acid at beta 88 appears more critical than that at beta 85 in the acceptor pocket for Val-beta 6. Furthermore, stereospecificity of the acceptor pocket in addition to hydrophobicity of beta 88 are critical for stable hydrophobic interactions with Val-beta 6 during deoxy Hb S polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1590593241,"Abstract Whole-cell patch clamp recording and digital imaging microscopy were used to investigate the electrical and calcium signaling responses of murine J774 monocytes to chemoattractants and other calcium-mobilizing agonists. A latent outwardly rectifying K+ conductance, GkOR, was elicited within seconds by each of the following agonists: C5a, ATP, ADP, interleukin-8, and the adenosine analog 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine. In terms of its pharmacologic profile and current-voltage (I-V) relation, GkOR was very similar to a P2 purinoceptor-activated K+ conductance previously described in rat mast cells and to a K+ conductance elicited in J774 cells by the GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Agonist-induced elevation of calcium, primarily due to intracellular release, and the induction of GkOR both required a GTP-binding protein of the Gi family, as both events were blocked by pertussis toxin; intracellular dialysis with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) also prevented the induction of GkOR, further implicating mediation by a G protein. Induction of GkOR did not depend upon influx of Ca2+, as it occurred equally well when the concentration of external Ca2+ was 100 nM or 2 mM. We attempted to uncouple agonist-induced calcium release from induction of GkOR by dialyzing the cell cytoplasm with Ca(2+)-EGTA or Ca(2+)-1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) buffers before agonist application. When the concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was set to approximately 15 nM with 1.1 or 11 mM EGTA, a slowCa2+ buffer, 10 nM C5a induced a large GkOR (11 nS at 1.1 mM EGTA versus 13.4 nS at 11 mM EGTA). Surprisingly, when [Ca2+]i was buffered at 15 nM with 10 mM BAPTA, a rapid Ca2+ buffer, C5a elicited a much smaller although significant K+ conductance (approximately 3 nS). Systematic increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]i upon dialysis with a series of 10 mM BAPTA-Ca2+ buffers (15-2400 nM [Ca2+]i) revealed activation of a very large K+ conductance (maximum 17.4 nS), even in the presumed absence of receptor stimulation. This conductance had a similar I-V relationship to GkOR, and activation occurred within the range of [Ca2+]i observed in intact cells following stimulation with C5a or ADP (EC50 approximately 475 nM [Ca2+]i). Activation of Gk thus may proceed in part via the release of intracellular calcium from a source in close proximity to the channel or other calcium-binding regulatory protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1484256540,"C1 repressor is required to repress the lytic functions of a P1 prophage in vivo. Transcription of the c1 gene is autoregulated via the C1-controlled operator Op99a,b which overlaps the promoter of the c1 gene. It is negatively affected by Lxc corepressor and the DNA region upstream of c1, which contains the additional operators Op99c, d, and e. We have explored these effects by constructing a set of lacZ reporter plasmids with Op99a,b and varying parts of the upstream DNA region. Transcription levels were measured in vivo with a two-plasmid system containing the lacZ reporter and a c1+ lxc+ or c1+ lxc- plasmid. Compared to the C1+Lxc-repressed lacZ reporter with all operators present, the basal level of beta-galactosidase activity increases successively when (i) upstream operators were deleted or inactivated, (ii) Lxc corepressor was removed, and (iii) C1 and Lxc were absent. By that means a 2 x 2 x 15-fold stepwise increase in enzyme activity was found. Using electron microscopy to visualize the interaction of C1 repressor with the operators in vitro, looped DNA molecules were observed. Although all operators can participate in C1-mediated DNA looping, loops between Op99a,b and Op99d occurred predominantly. Lxc is not required but increases drastically the frequency of loop formation. The results indicate that C1-mediated DNA looping may be a second element besides Lxc for fine-tuning the autoregulation of c1 transcription."
