To investigate the growth-related molecular targets of H2O2, we examined the redox sensitivity of agonist-stimulated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. We show here that angiotensin II elicits a rapid increase in intracellular H2O2 and a rapid and robust phosphorylation of both p42/44MAPK (16-fold) and p38MAPK (15-fold). However, exogenous H2O2 activates only p38MAPK (14-fold), and diphenylene iodonium, an NADH/NADPH oxidase inhibitor, attenuates angiotensin II-stimulated phosphorylation of p38MAPK, but not p42/44MAPK. Furthermore, in cells stably transfected with human catalase, angiotensin II-induced intracellular H2O2 generation is almost completely blocked, resulting in inhibition of phosphorylation of p38MAPK, but not p42/44MAPK, and a subsequent partial decrease in angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy. Specific inhibition of either the p38MAPK pathway with SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole) or the p42/44MAPK pathway with PD98059 (2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl)oxanaphthalen-4-one) also partially, but significantly, attenuates angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy; however, simultaneous blockade of both pathways has an additive inhibitory effect, indicating that the hypertrophic response to angiotensin II requires parallel, independent activation of both MAPK pathways. These results provide the first evidence that p38MAPK is a critical component of the oxidant stress (H2O2)-sensitive signaling pathways activated by angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle cells and indicate that it plays a crucial role in vascular hypertrophy.

Recently, it has become apparent that growth of VSMCs has an essential redox-sensitive component. Rao and Berk (1Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that reactive oxygen species generated by the combination of xanthine with xanthine oxidase stimulates proliferation of VSMCs and that this effect is mainly due to H2O2. Antioxidants have been shown to inhibit VSMC proliferation (2Boscoboinik D. Szewczyk A. Hensey C. Azzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6188-6194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or cause apoptosis, suggesting that some level of oxidant stress is required for normal cell growth (3Tsai J.-C. Jain M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Cooke C. Wang H. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Cooke C. Wang H. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

In VSMCs, the peptide hormone, angiotensin II (Ang II) induces cellular hypertrophy by acting through G protein-coupled AT1 receptors (5Geisterfer A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 6Berk B.C. Vekshtein V. Gordon H.M. Tsuda T.

Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that Ang II-induced hypertrophy is mediated by reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O⨪2) and H2O2, which are derived, at least in part, from a membrane-associated NADH/NADPH oxidase (7Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar, 8Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). However, the redox-sensitive signaling pathways involved in Ang II-induced hypertrophy have not been defined. One potential target for reactive oxygen species may be the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. MAPKs are serine/threonine kinases that transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus in response to classical growth factors and G protein-coupled receptor agonists, as well as cellular stress (9Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 10Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Four groups of MAPKs have been identified in mammalian cells: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, also termed p42/44MAPK), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK, also termed stress-activated protein kinase, SAPK), p38MAPK (also termed CSBP) and Big MAPK 1 (BMK1, also termed ERK5) (10Cano E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Although the MAPK families are structurally related, they are generally activated by distinct extracellular stimuli and phosphorylate different molecular substrates (9Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 10Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 are stimulated by growth factors and mitogenic stimuli and play pivotal roles in cell growth and differentiation (10Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 11Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 stimulation initiates phosphorylation events leading to activation of transcription factors such as Elk-1 and c-Fos, and stimulation of p90rsk ribosomal S6 kinase (10Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). In contrast, p38MAPK and JNK are primarily activated by cellular stresses, including heat and osmotic shock, UV irradiation, proinflammatory cytokines, and hypoxia/reoxygenation in other systems (13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 14Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). JNKs phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF-2, and Elk-1 (15Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H.

Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), whereas p38MAPK phosphorylates ATF-2 and C/EPT-homologous protein (CHOP) (19Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M.

Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). In addition, p38MAPK phosphorylates and activates MAPKAP kinase 2/3 and phosphorylates the heat shock proteins HSP25/27 (21Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 22McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Van Horn S. Lee J.C. Livi G.P. Young P.R. J. Biol.

Interestingly, recent reports have provided evidence that p38MAPK phosphorylates the transcription factor MEF2C, which has been shown to be required for proper growth and development of cardiac muscle (23Han J. Jian Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and to increase transcription of the c-Jun gene (24Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Despite their apparent growth-related downstream targets, studies of activation of the p38MAPK pathway have focused mainly on its response to a variety of physiochemical stresses and inflammatory cytokines (13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar,14Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, a recent study implicated a role of p38MAPK in cell growth such as cardiac hypertrophy and T-cell proliferation (25Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,26Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 are activated by growth factors via the conserved Ras/Raf1/MEK pathway, while p38MAPK is regulated by stress-related signals via different upstream kinases (13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 14Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Several reports demonstrate that p38MAPK is activated by H2O2 in other systems (27Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 28Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar); however, the sensitivity of ERK1/2 to oxidative stress is controversial and varies with the cell type and the stimulus (12Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 27Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar,29Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 30Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). In VSMCs, it has been shown that Ang II activates ERK1/2 via redox-insensitive mechanisms (29Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and its activation is necessary, but not sufficient, for Ang II-induced vascular hypertrophy (31Servant M.J. Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16047-16052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effects of Ang II on p38MAPK have not been studied. Thus, our previous data establishing a role for O⨪2 and H2O2 in VSMC hypertrophy raises the possibility that a redox-sensitive MAPK such as p38MAPK may represent the necessary additional pathway linking the Ang II-induced increase in intracellular oxidative stress to hypertrophy. In this study, we compared the ability of Ang II to activate p38MAPK and ERK1/2, assessed their relative redox sensitivity, and examined their respective roles in hypertrophy. We found that p38MAPK is a major redox-sensitive MAPK that is preferentially activated by Ang II through intracellular generation of H2O2, but that both ERK1/2 activation and p38MAPK activation were required for hypertrophic effects of Ang II. These observations suggest that p38MAPK is a critical component of the redox-sensitive signaling pathways involved in Ang II-induced hypertrophy in VSMCs.

All other chemicals and reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 25 mmol/liter Hepes and 4.5 g/liter glucose, were from Sigma. pCI-neo and pCI-neo containing human catalase were kind gifts from Drs. Sampath Parthasarathy and Nalini Santanam. VSMCs were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rat thoracic aortas by enzymatic digestion as described previously (32Griendling K.K. Taubman M.B. Akers M. Mendlowitz M. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15498-15504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were passaged twice a week by harvesting with trypsin/EDTA and seeding into 75-cm2 flasks. For experiments, cells between passages 6 and 15 were used at confluence. VSMCs were permanently transfected with pCI-neo alone or pCI-neo/catalase plasmid as described previously for pcDNA3/p22phox antisense transfection (8Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M. Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were maintained in selection medium until they were plated into 35- or 100-mm dishes for experiments. Total RNA was extracted from cells as described previously (33Lassègue B. Alexander R.W. Nickenig G. Clark M. Murphy T.J. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 601-609PubMed Google Scholar). 10-μg RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels containing 6.6% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane and immobilized by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The probe, catalase cDNA derived fromXba I/Sal I digestion of pCI-neo/catalase, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Prime-It II). After UV cross-linking, membranes were prehybridized at 68 °C for 2 h in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene). The hybridization was performed for 2 h at 68 °C with32P-labeled probe in the same solution. Membranes were briefly rinsed and washed twice in 1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. Staining of the 28 S rRNA band by ethidium bromide, after transfer to the membrane, was used for normalization. VSMCs at 80–90% confluence in 100-mm dishes were made quiescent by incubation with DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with agonist at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM for specified durations. After treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and placed on ice. Cells were lysed with 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer, pH 7.4 ((in mm) 50 HEPES, 5 EDTA, 50 NaCl), 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors ((in mm) 50 sodium fluoride, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 10 sodium pyrophosphate). Solubilized proteins were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C) for 30 min, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Extracted protein was quantified by the Bradford assay. Proteins (25 μg) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked overnight at room temperature with PBS containing 6% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific p38, ERK1/2, and JNK antibodies that detect MAPK only when activated by phosphorylation on TX Y, at 1:2,000, 1:40,000, and 1:1,000, respectively) in PBS containing 1% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. After incubation with secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, 1:1,000) for 1 h in PBS containing 1% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20, phosphorylated forms of proteins were detected by ECL chemiluminescence. It has been shown that phosphorylation of MAPKs is associated with the activation of MAPKs (27Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 34Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8083-8089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); therefore phosphorylation was routinely taken as a measure of MAPK enzymatic activity. In some experiments, p38MAPK activity was verified directly in VSMC p38MAPK immunoprecipitates. VSMC lysates were prepared as described above for MAPK phosphorylation assays. For immunoprecipitation, 400-μg cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-p38MAPK antibody (1:50 dilution) overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were washed four times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and two times with 500 μl of kinase buffer ((in mm) 25 Tris, pH 7.5, 5 β-glycerophosphate, 2 dithiothreitol, 0.1 Na3VO4, 10 MgCl2). p38MAPK activity in immunoprecipitates was measured using the p38MAPK assay kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This protocol measures p38MAPK-induced phosphorylation of recombinant ATF-2, as assessed by Western blotting using 12% SDS-PAGE and phospho-specific ATF-2 antibody (1:1,000). Confluent VSMCs transfected with pCI-neo alone or pCI-neo/catalase plasmid in 100-mm dishes were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells from duplicate 100-mm dishes were scraped, combined in 10 ml of PBS, and were centrifuged at 900 ×g (4 °C) for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold sonication buffer, pH 7.4 ((in mm) 50 HEPES, 5 EDTA, 50 NaCl), containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and phosphatase inhibitors ((in mm) 50 sodium fluoride, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 10 sodium pyrophosphate). After sonication for 30 s × 3 on ice, protein was quantified by the Bradford assay. Proteins were separated on 9% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and were incubated for 1 h with primary anti-human erythrocyte catalase antibody (1:500) in PBS containing 1% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20, washed three times with PBS containing 1% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000) for 1 h. Expression of catalase protein was detected by ECL chemiluminescence. Cells were plated at low density, grown for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% calf serum, and grown for an additional 24 h in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm Ang II for 1 min, and the H2O2-sensitive fluorophore DCF-DA (5 μm) (36Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) was used to measure intracellular H2O2 by laser confocal scanning microscopy (MRC-1000, Bio-Rad) as described previously (8Ushio-Fukai M.

Although DCF-DA is oxidized by both H2O2 and other peroxides, the complete inhibition of fluorescence in Ang II-stimulated cells by addition of catalase (350 units/ml) (data not shown) and by catalase overexpression (Fig. 4 C ) indicates that the fluorescence signal evoked by Ang II was predominantly derived from H2O2. To measure hypertrophy of VSMCs, cells were quiesced for 48–72 h in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum. Twenty-four hours before harvest, cells were incubated with [3H]leucine (0.5 μCi/ml) in the presence or absence of 100 nm Ang II for 24 h. [3H]Leucine incorporation was measured as described previously (7Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar). The Ang II receptor binding assay was performed as described previously (37Socorro L. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem.

Statistical significance was assessed by Student's paired two-tailed t test or analysis of variance on untransformed data, followed by comparison of group averages by contrast analysis, using the SuperANOVA statistical program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. H2O2 has been shown to activate p38MAPK and JNK in other cell types, but its effects on ERK1/2 are controversial (12Abe J.

To assess the effect of H2O2 on MAPKs in VSMCs, we exposed cells to 200 μm H2O2 and measured activation of individual MAPKs. H2O2 induced a rapid activation of p38MAPK, with a peak occurring 15 min after H2O2 addition (14 ± 1-fold increase) (Fig. 1 A ). p38MAPK activation was still detectable at 30 min. Measurement of p38MAPK activity in p38MAPK immunoprecipitates showed similar results (see Fig. 7). H2O2-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation was dose-dependent, with a threshold of 50 μm and a maximal effect occurring at 200 μm (Fig.1 B ). These concentrations are similar to those previously reported for H2O2-stimulated proliferation of VSMCs (1Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited by H2O2 at 2–5 min, was slightly but not significantly increased to above basal levels by 10 min, and then declined again to below the control levels. H2O2 had a small effect on JNK activation (maximum 2-fold increase at 15 min) (data not shown). These data suggest that p38MAPK is the major MAPK activated by H2O2 in VSMCs.Figure 7Effect of SB203580 on H2O2- and Ang II-induced activation of p38MAPK in VSMCs. VSMCs were incubated with SB203580 at the indicated concentrations for 30 min and then exposed to H2O2 (200 μm) for 15 min (A ) or Ang II (100 nm) for 5 min (B ). p38MAPK activity was assessed by phosphorylation of ATF-2 in p38MAPK imm"

Previously, we observed that the human iNOS gene is transcriptionally regulated by cytokines and demonstrated that the cytokine-responsive regions are upstream of −3.8 kilobase pairs (kb). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to further localize the functional enhancer elements and to assess the role of the transcription factor NF-κB in both human liver (AKN-1) and human lung (A549) epithelial cell lines. The addition of NF-κB inhibitors significantly suppressed cytokine-stimulated iNOS mRNA expression and NO synthesis, indicating that NF-κB is involved in the induction of the human iNOS gene. Analysis of the first 4.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region demonstrated basal promoter activity and failed to show any cytokine-inducible activity. However, promoter constructs extending to −5.8 and −7.2 kb revealed 2–3-fold and 4–5-fold induction, respectively, in the presence of cytokines. DNA sequence analysis from −3.8 to −7.2 kb identified five putative NF-κB cis-regulatory transcription factor binding sites upstream of −4.7 kb. Site-directed mutagenesis of these sites revealed that the NF-κB motif at −5.8 kb is required for cytokine-induced promoter activity, while the sites at −5.2, −5.5, and −6.1 kb elicit a cooperative effect. Electromobility shift assays using a site-specific oligonucleotide and nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with cytokine-mixture, tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1β, but not interferon-γ, exhibited inducible DNA binding activity for NF-κB.

Thus, elucidating the mechanisms that govern iNOS gene expression should provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation in several pathophysiologic states and may even lead to novel therapeutic strategies to modulate iNOS expression. Previously, we reported that transcriptional activation of the human iNOS gene required the presence of cytokine-responsive elements upstream of −3.8 kilobases (kb) in the 5′-flanking region of the human iNOS gene (16de Vera M.E.

These findings contrast markedly with the murine iNOS promoter, where two regions within 1 kb of the transcription start site have been identified as essential for the induction of iNOS in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages by LPS and IFNγ (14Xie Q.

The involvement of NF-κB in the induction of the murine iNOS gene is consistent with the well described role of this transcription factor in regulating inflammation-associated genes.

NF-κB has been implicated in the induction of the human iNOS gene as well, but its role has not been clearly defined (29Spitsin S.V. Farber J.L. Bertovich M. Moehren G. Koprowski H. Michaels F.H.

In the A549 and DLD-1 human epithelial cell lines, inhibitors of NF-κB activation minimally decreased iNOS expression (29Spitsin S.V. Farber J.L. Bertovich M. Moehren G. Koprowski H. Michaels F.H.

In contradistinction, others have shown that the same inhibitors do not inhibit cytokine-stimulated iNOS expression in DLD-1 cells. 2H. Kleinert and U. Forstermann, personal communication. Failure to identify a homologous functional NF-κB site in the human iNOS promoter raises the possibility that NF-κB may not be involved in the expression of the human gene by cytokines. Therefore, studies were performed to determine if NF-κB plays a role in the transcriptional activation of the human iNOS gene in human liver (AKN-1) and lung (A549) cell lines. In this study, we not only demonstrate that NF-κB plays a crucial role in human iNOS gene regulation, we also identify NF-κB response elements in the human iNOS promoter. Unlike the murine iNOS promoter, however, the first 1.0 kb of the human iNOS gene 5′-flanking region is not sufficient for iNOS induction. Instead, inducible NF-κB elements upstream of −4.7 kb are required for cytokine activation of the promoter. Specifically, we have identified a cytokine-responsive enhancer region from −5.2 to −6.1 kb in the human iNOS gene that contains four cis-acting NF-κB elements. Furthermore, gel shift assays and mutational analysis of these regulatory elements indicate that they play a functional role in the trans-activation of the human iNOS gene by NF-κB in response to cytokines. Human recombinant TNFα and IFNγ were obtained from R&D Systems, and IL-1β was provided by Craig Reynolds of the National Cancer Institute. LipofectAMINE was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Gel shift antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The AKN-1 human liver cell line was grown in modified HCD medium supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum as described previously (16de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L.

The A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in F-12k medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. AKN-1 and A549 cells were plated onto 100-mm Petri dishes (Corning Co., Corning, NY) and stimulated with a cytokine mixture (CM) of TNFα (1,000 units/ml) + IL-1β (100 units/ml) + IFNγ (250 units/ml) in the presence or absence of the NF-κB inhibitors pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 20 or 100 μm) or diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC, 10 mm) at the indicated time points. NO production was quantitated by measuring nitrite plus nitrate (NO2−and NO3−) in the culture supernatant by an automated procedure based on the Griess assay (32Green L. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J.

Using a series of both sense and antisense PCR primers, an Eag I-Bam HI fragment of the human iNOS promoter extending from +33 to −7242 kb (GenBank™ accession numberAF049872) was sequenced using the Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing method (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.42-13.74Google Scholar). Sequencing was conducted by Lark Technologies, Inc. (Houston, TX) and the University of Pittsburgh DNA Sequencing Facility. Putative cis-regulatory elements were detected by comparison with the TRANSFAC data base and the MatInspector Release 2.1 data base using a threshold factor of 85.0. AKN-1 and A549 cells were treated with CM at the indicated times. In some experiments, PDTC (100 μm) or DDTC (10 mm) was added 1 h prior to the addition of CM. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Ohlsson and Edlund (34Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the cells were washed, scraped into phosphate-buffered solution, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 25 μg/ml chymostatin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 5 times the packed cell volume and disrupted by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were recovered by microcentrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 15 min, resuspended in the same volume of Buffer B (Buffer A without Nonidet P-40) and re-centrifuged at 5,000 rpm. Nuclear proteins were extracted at 4 °C by gently mixing the nuclei in 150 μl of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and adding 50 μl of Buffer D (Buffer C but with 1.6 mKCl) in a dropwise fashion. Supernatants were collected after 1 h by microcentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the gel shift assays are outlined in TableI. Complementary strands were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Facility of the University of Pittsburgh and annealed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 0.1 mNaCl in one PCR cycle of 85 °C × 2 min, 65 °C × 15 min, 37 °C × 15 min, 23 °C × 15 min, and 4 °C × 15 min. Probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and purified by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel in 1x TBE. Five μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with ∼100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (∼0.5 ng) for 45 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 2 μg poly (dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), 4.2 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 4.2 mm KCl, 0.02 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.5% glycerol, 2% Ficoll, and 21 mmdithiothreitol (final volume of 30 μl). In some experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with excess unlabeled oligonucleotides or antibodies against the different subunits of NF-κB and AP-1 for 15 min before the addition of the labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.4× TBE running buffer (450 mm Tris borate and 1 μmEDTA, pH 8.0). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.Table IOligonucleotides used in electromobility shift assaysNF-κB consensus5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′NF-κB mutant consensus5′-AGTTGAGGTAACTTTCCCAGGC-3′NF-κB-5.8 wild-type5′-AGAGGGCTTTCCCAGAACCA-3′NF-κB-5.8 mutant5′-AGAGGGCTCGCCCAGAACCA-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of a 1.3-kb (piNOS(1.3)Luc) and a 7.2-kb (piNOS(7.2)Luc) iNOS promoter-luciferase construct has been described previously (16de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The piNOS(NA)Luc construct was generated by using the restriction enzymes Nco I and Afl II to cut the DNA from −2.1 to −4.7 from the 7.2-kb promoter construct. The plasmid DNA was ligated, and the promoter construct was then sequenced to confirm the deletion. To generate the mutated NF-κB construct with mutations at −0.11, −5.2, −5.5, −5.8, −6.1, and −6.5 kb, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on individual NF-κB elements in the context of the full-length reporter construct piNOS(7.2)Luc, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR mutagenesis (35Michael S.F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 410PubMed Google Scholar) was also used to generate a piNOS(mut7.2κB)Luc in order to further confirm the mutation, and similar results were obtained regardless of the method used to create piN0S(mut7.2κB)Luc. To reduce errors in the reactions, PCR was performed using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). The piNOS(mut7.2κB)Luc constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing of the initial ∼800 bp of the 5′-flanking region of iNOS promoter, whereas restriction digests and sequencing were performed to confirm the orientation and validity of the upstream NF-κB constructs. The promoter plasmid wild-type and mutated sequences in the NF-κB elements of interest are listed in Figs. 3 and 6.Figure 6Site-directed mutational analysis of the upstream NF-κB cis-regulatory elements. The site-directed mutational constructs utilized in the study are shown along with the wild-type sequence. A549 cells and AKN-1 cells were stimulated with CM following transient transfections of the constructs. Luciferase activity is expressed as light units/μg of protein in cell lysates.

(n = number of experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transient transfections and activity assays were carried out as described previously (16de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To control for transfection efficiency between groups, iNOS promoter constructs were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pIEP-lacZ, a plasmid encoding a CMV promoter-driven β-galactosidase gene (gift of Hideaki Tahara, University of Pittsburgh), and results were normalized to total protein content and to β-galactosidase activity. Significance of differences was determined by ANOVA using the Statview statistics program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Statistical significance was established at a p value < 0.01. To determine whether iNOS induction in human lung and liver cells is NF-κB dependent, A549 cells and AKN-1 cells were treated with the CM of TNFα, IL-1β, and IFNγ in the presence or absence of the established dithiocarbamate NF-κB inhibitors PDTC or DDTC (36Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Bauerle P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). High levels of iNOS mRNA were elicited from the CM-stimulated cells, whereas the addition of PDTC and DDTC inhibited iNOS mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig.1). As expected, nitrite and nitrate release was inhibited in a similar manner. These data demonstrate that NF-κB is necessary for cytokine activation of iNOS gene expression in these human cell types. To document that the transcription factor NF-κB is translocating into the nucleus of A549 and AKN-1 cells in the presence of CM, gel shifts were performed on nuclear extracts of CM-stimulated AKN-1 and A549 cells using a consensus oligonucleotide for NF-κB (37Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). In both AKN-1 and A549 cells, basal levels of NF-κB DNA binding were seen in control cells (Fig. 2 A ). The addition of single cytokines, TNFα or IL-1β alone, induced a strong gel shift complex for NF-κB, whereas IFNγ had no effect. The CM of all three agents also induced DNA binding activity for NF-κB, and the appearance of this complex was markedly suppressed by the addition of PDTC, further implicating NF-κB in iNOS expression. This inducible band was seen as early as 30 min after cytokine stimulation, peaked at the 1-h time point, and began to diminish at 2 h (data not shown). Specificity of the DNA-protein interaction for NF-κB was demonstrated by competition with 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig.2 A ). Competition studies with excess unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide did not abolish the NF-κB DNA complex, further demonstrating specificity for NF-κB. Supershift studies with specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of both p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB in the complex (Fig. 2 B ). Antibody against the transcription factor AP-1 failed to induce a supershift. An NF-κB element at −85 bp upstream in the murine iNOS promoter has been shown to confer LPS responsiveness in the murine iNOS gene (24Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human iNOS gene revealed a putative NF-κB element located at −115 to −106 bp that differs by only one nucleotide from the functional murine NF-κB element at −85 bp (38Chartrain N.A. Geller D.A. Koty P.P. Sitrin N.F. Nussler A.K. Hoffman E.P. Billiar T.R. Hutchinson N.I. Mudgett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6765-6772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the first 400 bp of the human and murine iNOS promoter have 66% homology (38Chartrain N.A. Geller D.A. Koty P.P. Sitrin N.F. Nussler A.K. Hoffman E.P. Billiar T.R. Hutchinson N.I. Mudgett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6765-6772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and because this proximal corresponding NF-κB element in the human iNOS promoter is relatively conserved, we sought to evaluate the functional role of this putative NF-κB element. Transient transfections in AKN-1 cells were performed with a wild-type iNOS 7.2-kb promoter construct (piNOS(7.2κB)Luc) and a mutated NF-κB construct (piNOS(mut7.2κB)Luc) generated by site-directed mutagenesis bearing a 2-bp mutation of the corresponding proximal NF-κB element (Fig. 3 A ). CM treatment of cells transfected with the wild-type construct piNOS(7.2)Luc resulted in a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity. When the 7.2-kb construct containing the mutated proximal NF-κB (−115 to −106 bp) (piNOS(mut7.2κB)Luc) was transfected, there was no significant decrease in either basal (data not shown) or stimulated reporter gene activity (Fig. 3 B ). In addition, the inducible activity of both the 7.2-kb wild-type and mutant constructs was inhibited by PDTC (Fig. 3 B ) and DDTC (data not shown). Interestingly, the addition of NF-κB inhibitors did not change basal, unstimulated luciferase activity, suggesting that NF-κB does not play a dominant role in mediating basal transcription of the human iNOS gene in this cell type. Furthermore, deletion of the region from −36 to −133 bp maintained a 3-fold induction in iNOS promoter activity, which also exhibited PDTC inhibition (data not shown). Thus, either mutation or deletion of the proximal NF-κB element failed to abrogate cytokine-induced iNOS promoter activity. These results indicate that the promoter-proximal NF-κB site is not required for maximal cytokine induction, suggesting that the functional NF-κB elements are further upstream in the human iNOS promoter. We have previously reported that the activation of the human iNOS promoter required the presence of cytokine-responsive elements upstream of −3.8 kb in the 5′-flanking region of the human iNOS gene (16de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To further localize the cytokine-responsive region an additional deletion construct containing the first 4.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region was generated. Transient transfections of the piNOS(4.7)Luc construct into AKN-1 and A549 cells revealed no increase in promoter activity in the presence of CM. However, transfection of piNOS(5.8)Luc followed by CM stimulation resulted in a 2–3-fold induction in luciferase activity in both cell types (Fig. 4). Transfection of the 7.2-kb construct (piNOS(7.2)Luc) produced a 4–5-fold increase in promoter activity, consistent with our previous findings (16de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of these elements upstream of −4.7 kb and demonstrate position-independence of this cytokine responsive enhancer region, the segment from −2.1 to −4.7 kb was deleted to create piNOS(NA)Luc. Transfection studies with this construct in CM-stimulated cells revealed the same 4-fold induction of activity, thereby demonstrating position-independence of this enhancer element and confirming the presence of cytokine-responsive cis-regulatory motifs upstream of −4.7 kb in the human iNOS promoter. The DNA sequence from the transcription start site to −3761 bp of the human iNOS gene has been previously published by our group and others (38Chartrain N.A. Geller D.A. Koty P.P. Sitrin N.F.

VPF plays key roles in several diverse physiologic processes including tumor angiogenesis, diabetic retinopathy, wound healing, and lung repair following oxidant or ischemic injury (1Aiello L.P.

Biol. 1995; 13: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Human VPF has at least four transcriptionally spliced mRNA isoforms that code for polypeptides of 206, 189, 165, and 121 amino acids (5Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Hypoxia potently stimulates VPF induction through stabilization of VPF mRNA as well as transcriptional activity (6Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar). Increases in VPF mRNA levels have also been described following stimulation by reactive oxygen intermediates (7Kuroki M. Voest E.E. Amano S. Beerepoot L.V. Takashima S. Tolentino M. Kim R.Y.

Moreover, there is evidence that in certain cell lines VPF is also translationally regulated (8Kevil C.G. Benedetti A.D. Payne D.K. Coe L.L. Laroux F.S. Alexander J.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Physiologically, VPF is a potent stimulus of angiogenesis, endothelial proliferation, and increased microvascular permeability (3Brown L.F. Detmar M. Claffey K. Nagy J.A. Feng D. Dvorak A.M.

VPF demonstrates high affinity binding to Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR on endothelial cells, which mediates endothelial cell proliferationin vitro (2Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N.

Science. 1989; 246: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vitro models of VPF-mediated endothelial permeability are lacking, as are data on the mechanisms and targets of VPF in permeability regulation. To date, most studies on VPF have mainly examined mitogenic effects of VPF-receptor interactions. Waltenberger et al. (11Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelium cells (HUVEC), suggested different signal transduction properties for each of the two VPF receptors. Flk-1/KDR expressing cells demonstrated changes in cell morphology, actin reorganization, chemotaxis, and mitogenic activity in response to VPF. Moreover, neither Flt-1 or Flk-1/KDR stimulation affected the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-kinase) or tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). Conversely, Xia et al. (12Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) demonstrated that VPF can cause the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), PLCγ, and PI3-kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by Flt-1 activation has also been demonstrated in trophoblast-like choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo (13Charnock-Jones D.S. Sharkey A.M. Boocock C.A. Ahmed A. Plevin R. Ferrara N. Smith S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, studies examining these signal transduction pathways in VPF-mediated increases in endothelial monolayer permeability are lacking. We investigated which signal transduction pathways are involved in the VPF-mediated endothelial permeability response and examined whether these pathways affect the structural organization of the endothelial adherens and occludens junctions as the basis for increased endothelial permeability. We observed that VPF appears to increase endothelial permeability through a MAP kinase-dependent pathway, which leads to disorganization of the cell-cell junctions and results in increased endothelial monolayer permeability. Primary cultures of HUVEC were harvested from fresh human umbilical cords using 0.25% type II collagenase, pooled, and propagated from passages 1 to 3 (14Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). They were grown to confluence in T-75 tissue culture flasks filled with 15 ml of EGM (Clonetics, San Diego, CA), trypsinized with 2 ml of trypsin-EDTA, and seeded at a density of 105 cells/ml onto fibronectin-coated 12-mm diameter polycarbonate filters (Snapwell, Costar, Cambridge, MA). Seeded filters were allowed to grow to confluence (5–7 days). Endothelialized filters were mounted into prewarmed diffusion chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA) filled with 6 ml/side warmed DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) without serum. A circulating water bath (model FJ, Haake, Saddlebrook, NJ) was used to maintain the diffusion chambers at 37 °C throughout the experiments. A bubble-lift system (5% CO2, balance room air) was used to stir each side of the filter, and the entire system was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min prior to initiation of experiments. 500 μl of 0.023 mg/ml [14C]albumin was added to the luminal (“hot”) chamber, and an equimolar amount of unlabeled albumin was added to the abluminal (“cold”) chamber. During the 1-h control period, 500-μl samples were removed from the abluminal chamber at 1, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min and replaced with equivalent amounts of warmed DMEM. At 1 and 60 min, 50-μl samples are taken from the luminal side and replaced with equivalent amounts of warmed DMEM. During the 1.5-h experimental period, VPF (vascular endothelial growth factor)165 (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) was added to each diffusion chamber (luminal and abluminal) to give a final concentration of 660 pm. Samples from the abluminal side were removed at 65, 75, 90, 105, 120, and 150 min and replaced with warmed DMEM. Samples from the luminal side were removed at 65 and 150 min. In the second series of experiments, various agents were added during the 1-h control period: 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma), 2.67 or 1 μm AG126 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 20 μm PD98059 (Biomol), 10 nm wortmannin (Sigma), or 10 nm Gö6976 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). DMEM was added to some chambers as a control. During the experimental portion of these series of experiments various concentrations of VPF were added to the chambers (660, 0.660, or 660 pm VPF heated to 100 °C for 30 min). All samples were placed in scintillation vials in 10 ml of scintillation fluid (Aquasol, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) and stirred gently. Samples were read for 10 min each in a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The flux of [14C]albumin across the monolayer was calculated by using the following formula (15Payne D.K. Ownes M.W. Grisham M. Free Radical Res. 1996; 25: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Papp=slope(cpm/min)×1 min60 s×A×(cpm/ml)hotEquation 1 where P app = apparent permeability in cm/s, slope = (cpm/ml) is y intercept at time + 0 min and is obtained by plotting cumulative total counts(cum tot) against time and performing linear regression to obtain an x coefficient, hot = hot or luminal chamber ([14C]albumin added), cum tot = [(cpm − bkg /sample volume)(total volume) + bak add ], cpm = counts/min,bkg = background cpm (of a blank sample), bak add = Σ (cpm − bkg ) att −1 (where t −1 is the cpm obtained at the previous time), A = membrane area (1.13 cm2), and (cpm/ml)hot = ((hot cpm − bkg )initial + (hot cpm − bkg )final)/2. HUVEC were grown on coverslips and exposed to 660 pm VPF with and without AG126 (2.67 μm) or PD98059 (20 μm). Samples were fixed according to Kevil et al. (16Kevil C.G. Okayama N. Trocha S.D. Kalogeris T.J. Coe L.L. Specian R.D. Alexander J.S. Microcirculation. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and stained for the junctional proteins VE-cadherin and occludin. Mouse anti-VE cadherin (Hemeris, Sassange, France) was used at a 1:300 dilution, whereas rabbit anti-occludin (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) was used at a 1:200 dilution. Cy3 goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., Westgrove, PA) were used at a 1:250 dilution. Photomicrographs were taken at 100× with 12-s exposure times using T-Max 400 film. All data are reported as “relative permeability” compared with controls and statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Instat software (San Diego, CA). Samples were compared using a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post-testing. Significance was determined for all treatments compared with control. Data are shown with standard error. VPF is angiogenic for endothelial cells and is a potent stimulant for increased vascular permeability (7Kuroki M. Voest E.E. Amano S. Beerepoot L.V. Takashima S. Tolentino M. Kim R.Y. Rohan R.M.

VPF has been shown to be released by monocytes and, more recently, by eosinophils and neutrophils. These observations suggest that VPF may participate in the acute and chronic phases of inflammation-associated permeability mediated by these cell types (21Gaudry M. Bregerie O. Andrieu V.

Although the role of VPF in angiogenesis is well documented, its role in endothelial permeability regulation remains more obscure (3Brown L.F. Detmar M. Claffey K. Nagy J.A. Feng D. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Regulation of Angiogenesis. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1997: 233-269Google Scholar). To date, we are aware of only one other study that has examined VPF-mediated changes in endothelial barrier in vitro (26Wang W. Merrill M.J. Borchardt R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1973-C1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study characterized permeability changes in brain-derived endothelial cells without investigating the signal transduction pathways responsible for these permeability changes. Moreover, this study only reported significant changes in [14C]sucrose permeability after 48 h of VPF exposure, long after VPF is reported to alter solute permeability in vivo (3Brown L.F. Detmar M. Claffey K. Nagy J.A. Feng D. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Regulation of Angiogenesis. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1997: 233-269Google Scholar, 17Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3428) Google Scholar). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1) examine VPF-mediated permeability to molecules that are typically responsible for edema formation (e.g. albumin) in vitro in time frames that correlate with VPF biological activity in vivo and to 2) determine the signal transduction pathways involved and possible mechanisms in VPF-induced permeability. It has been previously shown that VPF binds to and is readily internalized by HUVEC and that HUVEC contain both the Flt-1 and Flk-1 VPF receptors (27Bikfalvi A. Sauzeau C. Moukadiri H. Maclouf J. Busso N. Bryckaert M. Plouet J. Tobelem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used HUVEC to examine VPF effects on endothelial permeability to [14C]albumin. Fig.1 illustrates changes in [14C]albumin permeability after exposure to VPF for 90 min. 660 pm VPF-treated monolayers demonstrate a significant 3.4-fold increase in [14C]albumin permeability compared with control monolayers, whereas 0.66 pm VPF-treated monolayers failed to demonstrate significant increases in [14C]albumin permeability. Moreover, this increase in albumin permeability was not observed in monolayers treated with heat-inactivated VPF (Fig. 1). These data suggest that native, intact VPF is responsible for the observed increases in [14C]albumin flux across HUVEC monolayers. VPF stimulates several signal transduction pathways that could contribute to altered permeability. Previous studies have shown that VPF stimulates “classical” PKC isoforms through a phospholipase C/PLCγ-dependent pathway (12Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H.

Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) have shown that VPF-increased PKC-β activity is partially responsible for endothelial cell proliferation and may also stimulate migration. We therefore next determined the role of PKC-β in VPF-mediated endothelial permeability. Fig. 2 demonstrates that VPF-mediated increases in [14C]albumin permeability is not inhibited by co-incubation with 10 nm Gö6976, a specific inhibitor of classical PKC-α and -β isoforms (30Qatsha K.A.

Chaney E. Alexander J.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We also used staurosporine (1 μm), a general inhibitor of both classical and nonclassical PKC, to block VPF-mediated permeability. We found that PKC inhibition failed to block VPF-mediated increases in [14C]albumin permeability. These data strongly suggest that VPF does not appear to increase permeability through activation of PKC isoforms. VPF has also been shown to stimulate increased PI3-kinase activity (12Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar,29Guo D. Jia Q.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20254-20257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). VPF binding to Flt-1 activates PI3-kinase by binding through both of the Flt-1 p85 SH2 domains upon ligand binding. Additionally, Gou et al. (29Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) showed that VPF-stimulated bovine aortic endothelial cells contained greater amounts of active, phosphorylated PI3-kinase, which was correlated with increased endothelial proliferation. We therefore next examined whether the specific PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, could block VPF-mediated permeability in our model. Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of 10 nm wortmannin and VPF co-incubation on [14C]albumin permeability. Preincubation with wortmannin followed by co-administration with VPF failed to block increased albumin permeability across endothelial monolayers and suggests that PI3-kinase pathways are not involved in VPF-mediated permeability. Several studies have also demonstrated that VPF activates Ras GTPase-activating protein and subsequently activates the MAP kinase pathway primarily through Flk-1 and possibly through Flt-1 receptor interactions (11Waltenberger J.

These studies reported VPF-mediated increased endothelial cell proliferation associated with the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. We next determined whether MAP kinase activity may be involved in regulating VPF-mediated permeability. Fig. 4 illustrates the effect of AG126 and PD98059 on VPF-mediated endothelial permeability. AG126 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been demonstrated to block tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAP kinase in endothelial cells but does not inhibit EGF receptor, Her-2/neu receptor, or platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (37Kan H. Ruan Y. Malik K.U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1139-1147PubMed Google Scholar, 38Novogrodsky A. Vanichkin A. Patya M. Gazit A. Osherov N. Levitzki A. Science. 1994; 264: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Incubation of monolayers with 2.67 μm AG126 and VPF significantly prevented increased endothelial monolayer permeability produced by VPF compared with control. Furthermore, co-incubation of VPF with 1 μmAG126 also attenuated VPF-mediated permeability. Co-incubation of VPF and PD98059 (20 μm), a specific inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase-1 (39Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 40Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), also blocked VPF increases in permeability. This suggests that MAP kinase kinase activation and subsequent activation of ERK1/2 are critical for the VPF-mediated permeability effects in vitro. Control permeability measurements for PD98059 (1.93 × 10−5 ± 6.75 × 10−6 cm/s) or AG126 (7.25 × 10−6 ± 8.0 × 10−7 cm/s)versus media (1.45 × 10−5 ± 1.66 × 10−6 cm/s) did not demonstrate any significant differences, indicating that these compounds have no effect on albumin permeability alone. Importantly, at the concentrations used here, neither AG126 or PD98059 were toxic to the endothelium (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that activation of the MAP kinase pathway is involved in VPF-mediated permeability in vitro. Still, the molecular targets responsible for VPF-mediated permeability have not been identified. Endothelial solute permeability is maintained through the endothelial junctional proteins cadherin and occludin (16Kevil C.G. Okayama N. Trocha S.D. Kalogeris T.J. Coe L.L. Specian R.D. Alexander J.S. Microcirculation. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar,31Kevil C.G. Ohno N. Gute D.C. Okayama N. Robinson S.A. Chaney E. Alexander J.S. Free Radical Biol.

We have previously shown that pulmonary artery endothelial cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide show a loss of junctional pan-cadherin staining with concomitant gap formation that results in increased endothelial monolayer permeability (31Kevil C.G. Ohno N. Gute D.C. Okayama N. Robinson S.A. Chaney E. Alexander J.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The specific endothelial adherens junctional protein VE-cadherin has also been shown to maintain and perhaps regulate endothelial barrier properties (44Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In addition to VE-cadherin, we have shown that the tight junctional protein occludin significantly contributes to endothelial monolayer barrier properties (16Kevil C.G. Okayama N. Trocha S.D. Kalogeris T.J. Coe L.L. Specian R.D. Alexander J.S. Microcirculation. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a previous electron microscopic study demonstrated that VPF could induce gap formation at endothelial cell-cell junctions (45Roberts W.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2369-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that rearrangement of the junctional proteins occludin and VE-cadherin are the cause of increased endothelial monolayer permeability in response to VPF. Fig. 5 shows immunofluorescent staining for the adherens junctional protein VE-cadherin and the tight junctional protein occludin. Panels A and E show control HUVEC staining for occludin and VE-cadherin, respectively. Note in control monolayers that these proteins are primarily found at cell-cell junctions. Panels B and F illustrate HUVEC staining for occludin and VE-cadherin after exposure to 660 pm VPF for 1 h. Treatment with VPF resulted in significant loss of junctional staining of both VE-cadherin and occludin with the appearance of diffuse, punctate staining for both of these proteins. Gaps between adjacent endothelial cells (arrows ) can be seen where junctional protein staining is lost. Co-incubation of monolayers with both VPF and AG126 (2.67 μm) failed to show disorganization of occludin and VE-cadherin or promote the appearance of inter-endothelial gap formation (Panels C and G , respectively). PD98059 (20 μm) and VPF (660 pm) co-incubation also failed to demonstrate disorganization of occludin and VE-cadherin staining (Panels D and H ). These observations suggest that MAP kinase activity governs endothelial junction disorganization produced by VPF. Moreover, these data strongly suggest that VPF-mediated albumin permeability occurs through the loss of occludin and VE-cadherin at endothelial junctions, with concomitant gap formation and decreased barrier properties between adjacent endothelial cells. In conclusion, these data demonstrate for the first time a rapidly responding in vitro model of VPF-mediated albumin permeability with a similar time course as that reported in vivo (3Brown L.F.

Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3428) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that VPF-induced permeability is apparently mediated through the MAP kinase signal transduction cascade. Our data further indicate that endothelial junction proteins (e.g. VE-cadherin and occludin) become disorganized upon VPF administration and that inhibitors of MAP kinase attenuate this disorganization. VPF appears to increase permeability in vitro through activation of MAP kinase, with a subsequent loss of VE-cadherin and occludin from the endothelial cell-cell junctions. Experiments are currently under way to better determine the roles of MAP kinase and its related pathways in the structural regulation of the endothelial junctional proteins governing solute permeability.

https://openalex.org/W1968320638,"We showed before that in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes partial inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase by nontoxic concentrations of ouabain causes hypertrophic growth and transcriptional regulations of genes that are markers of cardiac hypertrophy. In view of the suggested roles of Ras and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as key mediators of cardiac hypertrophy, the aim of this work was to explore their roles in ouabain-initiated signal pathways regulating four growth-related genes of these myocytes,i.e. those for c-Fos, skeletal α-actin, atrial natriuretic factor, and the α3-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase. Ouabain caused rapid activations of Ras and p42/44 MAPKs; the latter was sustained longer than 90 min. Using high efficiency adenoviral-mediated expression of a dominant-negative Ras mutant, and a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK), activation of Ras-Raf-MEK-p42/44 MAPK cascade by ouabain was shown. The effects of the mutant Ras, an inhibitor of Ras farnesylation, and the MEK inhibitor on ouabain-induced changes in mRNAs of the four genes indicated that (a ) skeletal α-actin induction was dependent on Ras but not on p42/44 MAPKs, (b ) α3 repression was dependent on the Ras-p42/44 MAPK cascade, and (c ) induction of c-fos or atrial natriuretic factor gene occurred partly through the Ras-p42/44 MAPK cascade, and partly through pathways independent of Ras and p42/44 MAPKs. All ouabain effects required extracellular Ca2+, and were attenuated by a Ca2+/calmodulin antagonist or a protein kinase C inhibitor. The findings show that (a ) signal pathways linked to sarcolemmal Na+/K+-ATPase share early segments involving Ca2+ and protein kinase C, but diverge into multiple branches only some of which involve Ras, or p42/44 MAPKs, or both; and (b ) there are significant differences between this network and the related gene regulatory pathways activated by other hypertrophic stimuli, including those whose responses involve increases in intracellular free Ca2+ through different mechanisms."

Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). These modifications render otherwise hydrophilic proteins hydrophobic, promoting association with membranes. The relative contributions of prenylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation to membrane targeting are not well understood. Whereas neutralization of the negative charge on the α-carboxyl group by methyl esterification adds to overall hydrophobicity, particularly for farnesylated proteins, this modification contributes little to the affinity of geranylgeranylated proteins for membranes (3Parish C.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although processed CAAX proteins can associate with phospholipid vesicles in vitro (4Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it is not known whether membrane proteins participate in prenylcysteine membrane association in vivo . The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating pheromone, a-factor, is a CAAX -processed polypeptide, and both its secretion via the Ste6p transporter (5Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 20: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), some eukaryotic processes may be regulated by reversible carboxyl methylation.Because prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation cannot be abolished by mutation of the substrate without also eliminating prenylation, elucidation of the role of carboxyl methylation will require characterization and disruption of the methyltransferase. Until recently, the only prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (pcCMT) characterized at the molecular level was the STE14 gene product of S. cerevisiae (5Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Homologs inSchizosaccharomyces pombe and Xenopus laevis have now been reported (11Imai Y. Davey J. Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular cloning and preliminary characterization of the first mammalian pcCMT. In addition, using pcCMT tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) we show that pcCMT is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but excluded from the plasma membrane that is the target of many CAAX proteins, including Ras.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRepeated efforts to characterize mammalian pcCMT bySTE14 homology cloning and by enzyme purification and microsequencing were unsuccessful. However, we identified a partial murine cDNA (GenBank accession no. AA022288) in the EST data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information that has sequence homology to Ste14p. Using primers based on this sequence, reverse transcription-PCR was employed to amplify from human myeloid HL60 cells a 218-bp homologous sequence. Using this fragment an HL60 cDNA library was screened and a single clone identified that contained a 3.6-kb insert. Sequencing revealed a 3595-bp cDNA (GenBank accession no. AF064084) with an ORF that predicted a 284-amino acid protein that is 26% identical to Ste14p (Fig.1). Hydropathy analysis revealed six hydrophobic sequences that may represent membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the five or six putative membrane-spanning domains of Ste14p (5Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with recent data demonstrating that Ste14p is an integral membrane protein 2J. Romano, W. Schmidt, and S. Michaelis, submitted for publication. and with our observation that active pcCMT cannot be extracted from membranes with detergents but can be partially reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles (19Pillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1486-1492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first 65 amino acids of human pcCMT, containing the first two hydrophobic sequences, are 36% identical to amino acids 750–821 of the human band 3 anion transporter, which represent the 11th and 12th of 14 well characterized membrane-spanning domains, further supporting the hypothesis that human pcCMT is a multiple membrane-spanning protein. Comparison of human pcCMT with all related sequences in the GenBank (Fig. 1) revealed the highest degree of divergence in the N-terminal third of the molecule, suggesting that the catalytic domain is C-terminal. Sequences homologous to theS -adenosylmethionine binding regions described in aspartyl and glutamyl protein carboxyl methyltransferases (20Ingrosso D. Fowler A.V. Bleibaum J. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20131-20139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were not apparent, arguing against an evolutionary link.To determine whether the HL60 Ste14p homolog has prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase activity, the cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector and transiently overexpressed in COS-1 cells. Membranes prepared from these cells were used as a source of recombinant enzyme. Farnesylated Ras GTPases require detergent for extraction from membranes. Therefore geranylgeranylated neutrophil cytosolic Rho GTPases that remain soluble by virtue of association with an accessory protein, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), were utilized as endogenous substrates in an in vitro assay (Fig. 2). Untransfected COS-1 cell membranes had little pcCMT activity toward Rho proteins compared with that of membranes derived from human neutrophils (Fig. 2 a ). Transfection with the HL60 cDNA conferred pcCMT activity toward Rho GTPases on COS-1 membranes, and this activity was blocked by the competitive pcCMT inhibitor, AFC, with an ED50 (10 μm) identical to that for endogenous neutrophil pcCMT. Carboxyl methylation of Rac2 and RhoA by HL60 pcCMT-transfected COS-1 cell membranes was enhanced by GTPγS (Fig. 2 b ), similar to the activity observed in neutrophil membranes (7Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Carboxyl methyltransferase activity was quantitated in membranes of COS-1 cells transfected with HL60 pcCMT using prenylcysteine analogs as defined substrates (14Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Untransfected COS-1 cell membranes had 23 ± 10% (n = 5) of the pcCMT specific activity of neutrophil membranes toward AFC. Transfection of COS-1 cells with HL60 pcCMT resulted in an 18–53-fold increase in specific AFC carboxyl methyltransferase activity (3.0 ± 0.8 to 74.5 ± 6.8 pmol/mg·min, n = 5, p < 0.0005). Carboxyl methylation ofN -acetyl-S-all-trans -geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine (AGGC) was increased in parallel with methylation of AFC (18-versus 20-fold increase, n = 2), consistent with previous studies demonstrating that a single activity carboxyl methylated both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated substrates (21Volker C. Lane P. Kwee C. Johnson M. Stock J.B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Michaelis constants of the recombinant enzyme,K m = 7 μm for AFC and 0.6 μm for AGGC, were similar to those for the endogenous neutrophil enzyme (19Pillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1486-1492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cDNA described above encodes authentic human myeloid pcCMT.Figure 2Carboxyl methylation of Ras-related GTPases by COS-1 cell membranes expressing ectopic human pcCMT. a , neutrophil cytosol (CS ) containing a mixture of Rho GTPases complexed with Rho-GDI (lanes 2 ,3 , 6, 7, 10 , and 11 ) or RhoA-GDI complexes partially purified from neutrophil cytosol (lanes 4 , 8 , and 12 ) were incubated with the methyl donorS -adenosyl-l-[methyl- 3H]methionine and light membranes derived from nitrogen cavitation of human neutrophils (lanes 1–4 ) or COS-1 cells transiently transfected with either human pcCMT (lanes 5–8 ) or vector alone (lanes 9–12 ).

The HL60 pcCMT cDNA expressed from a plasmid in a Δste14 yeast strain partially restored the mating phenotype (Fig.3), indicating that a-factor could be carboxyl methylated by human pcCMT. Thus, HL60 pcCMT is a functional human homolog of S. cerevisiae Ste14p.Figure 3Complementation of S. cerevisiae ste14 . Strains of S. cerevisiae deficient in mating because of a deletion of ste14 were transformed with pG1 vector alone (a ) pSM1237 that drives plasmid expression of STE14 (b ), or pG1-hCMT that drives plasmid expression of human pcCMT (c ). Transformants were tested by the patch mating assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mating was scored as prototrophic growth of resulting diploids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of the human pcCMT gene was examined by Northern analysis. HL60 cells expressed two pcCMT mRNAs, a 3.6-kb transcript consistent with the isolated cDNA and a 5-kb transcript suggesting a related gene or an alternatively spliced message (Fig.4 a ). The level of expression of both transcripts was diminished by granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells induced by Me2SO, consistent with our observation that HL60 membranes have 5-fold greater specific pcCMT activity than membranes of mature, peripheral blood neutrophils. 3M.

Immunoblots of neutrophil and pcCMT-transfected COS-1 cell membranes using this antiserum revealed a 33-kDa protein (Fig. 4 c ) corresponding to the predicted size of the protein encoded by the HL60 pcCMT cDNA, confirming that this cDNA, which lacked a termination codon 5′ of the ORF is, in fact, full-length. The same antiserum immunoprecipitated a 33-kDa protein from HL60 cells (Fig.4 c ). Although the deduced amino acid sequence of pcCMT reveals a potential N -glycosylation site (Fig. 1), these data argue against glycosylation.Ras is constitutively carboxyl methylated (22Clarke S.

Papageorge A.G. Hubbert N.L. Lowy D.R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2581-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Like all CAAX proteins, Ras lacks a signal peptide, is synthesized in the cytosol, and modified immediately posttranslationally by a cytosolic prenyltransferase (25Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Because prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation is catalyzed by an intrinsic membrane protein and represents the last of the three posttranslational modifications of the CAAX cysteine that enhance the affinity of Ras for membranes, the simplest model of plasma membrane targeting predicts pcCMT expression in the target membrane. However, activities associated with the further processing of prenylated proteins, including pcCMT (26Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, one of the twoS -isoprenyl-CAAX proteases recently identified in yeast has a putative ER retention sequence (31Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 32Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and a double deletion of these genes led to mislocalization of yeast Ras2p to internal membranes and cytosol (31Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of these studies excluded expression of prenylcysteine-modifying activities from plasma membranes. Indeed, we have reported pcCMT activity in neutrophil subcellular fractions enriched for surface membrane (19Pillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1486-1492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To determine the subcellular localization of pcCMT we constructed a recombinant pcCMT tagged at the C terminus with GFP. In CHO (Fig.5, a–c ), COS-1 (Fig. 5,d–e ), and NIH3T3 (not shown) cells, CMT-GFP was visualized in the ER, Golgi, and nuclear membranes but not in the plasma membrane. This assay afforded a sensitivity and resolution that allowed visualization of individual ER canaliculi extending to the periphery of the cell (Fig. 5, c and d ) and was therefore definitive in exlcuding expression in the plasma membrane. ER expression was confirmed by colocalization with ribophorin I (Fig.5 f ), a component of the glycosyl transferase complex restricted to ER. Because the 27-kDa GFP added to the C terminus of pcCMT might alter its native subcellular localization, the CMT-GFP localization was confirmed with a pcCMT tagged at the C terminus with a 10-amino acid Myc epitope (Fig. 5 g ). Finally, an anti-peptide antiserum reactive with pcCMT was used to confirm these data by localizing endogenous pcCMT to ER and nuclear membranes in COS-1 cells (Fig. 5, h–i ). The absence of Golgi staining for endogenous pcCMT suggests that the Golgi localization of ectopically expressed pcCMT may result from gene overexpression.Figure 5Subcellular localization of human pcCMT. a–e , CHO cells (a–c ) and COS-1 cells (d and e ) were transiently transfected with GFP alone (a ) or GFP-tagged human pcCMT (b–e ) and examined unfixed.

Similar observations have recently been made in yeast. 4J. Romano, W. Schmidt, and S. Michaelis, submitted for publication. It is curious that proteins such as Ras, synthesized on free ribosomes, prenylated in the cytosol, and destined for the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, are diverted to the ER for processing. Moreover, the ER restriction of pcCMT suggests that an uncharacterized transport pathway must mediate the translocation of fully processed GTPases from internal membranes to the cell surface. Such a pathway could utilize the cytoplasmic surface of secretory vesicles, cytosolic accessory molecules analogous to GDI, or a novel transport system. Investigation of this aspect of Ras biology may open new approaches to the development of pharmacologic inhibitors of oncogenic Ras. A number of signaling molecules, including Ras and G proteins, are targeted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by a sequence of posttranslational modifications of a C-terminal CAAX 1The abbreviations used are: CAAX , tetrapeptide with sequence cysteine-(usually aliphatic amino acid)2-any amino acid; pcCMT, prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EST, expressed sequence tag; ORF, open reading frame; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AFC,N -acetyl-S -trans,trans -farnesyl-l-cysteine; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O -(thio)triphosphate; AGGC,N -acetyl-S-all-trans -geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide. 1The abbreviations used are: CAAX , tetrapeptide with sequence cysteine-(usually aliphatic amino acid)2-any amino acid; pcCMT, prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EST, expressed sequence tag; ORF, open reading frame; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AFC,N -acetyl-S -trans,trans -farnesyl-l-cysteine; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O -(thio)triphosphate; AGGC,N -acetyl-S-all-trans -geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide. motif that include prenylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation (1Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In some cases palmitoylation of an upstream cysteine is also required (2Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). These modifications render otherwise hydrophilic proteins hydrophobic, promoting association with membranes. The relative contributions of prenylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation to membrane targeting are not well understood. Whereas neutralization of the negative charge on the α-carboxyl group by methyl esterification adds to overall hydrophobicity, particularly for farnesylated proteins, this modification contributes little to the affinity of geranylgeranylated proteins for membranes (3Parish C.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although processed CAAX proteins can associate with phospholipid vesicles in vitro (4Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it is not known whether membrane proteins participate in prenylcysteine membrane association in vivo .

A cycle of prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation is associated with neutrophil activation (7Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B.

Chem. 1991; 20: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), some eukaryotic processes may be regulated by reversible carboxyl methylation. Because prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation cannot be abolished by mutation of the substrate without also eliminating prenylation, elucidation of the role of carboxyl methylation will require characterization and disruption of the methyltransferase. Until recently, the only prenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (pcCMT) characterized at the molecular level was the STE14 gene product of S. cerevisiae (5Sapperstein S. Berkower C. Michaelis S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Homologs inSchizosaccharomyces pombe and Xenopus laevis have now been reported (11Imai Y. Davey J.

Here we report the molecular cloning and preliminary characterization of the first mammalian pcCMT. In addition, using pcCMT tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) we show that pcCMT is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but excluded from the plasma membrane that is the target of many CAAX proteins, including Ras.

Together, these data suggest that SOX9 plays an important role in chondrogenesis, perhaps by directly activating Col2a1 expression. The accompanying paper (28Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) demonstrates that, in addition to the SOX9-binding site, other HMG-like sites are present in the 48-bpCol2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer. These sites participate in the formation of a large chondrocyte-specific protein complex that includes Sox9 and other proteins which appear to belong to the HMG domain protein family. The proteins forming this complex were tentatively designated CSEP (forchondrocyte-specificenhancer-binding proteins) (28Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mutations that inhibited binding of CSEP to the various HMG-like sites also abolished the chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity of the 48-bp element in DNA transfection experiments and in transgenic mice. This correlation between CSEP binding and enhancer activity suggests that the CSEP proteins may play a role in the tissue-specific expression ofCol2a1 and hence in chondrogenesis. Because Col11a2 has basically the same expression pattern asCol2a1 , we wondered if it might also share a similar tissue-specific regulatory mechanism. The goal of the present work was to determine whether the Col11a2 gene contains a chondrocyte-specific enhancer element analogous to the 48-bpCol2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer. Previous transgenic mouse experiments have demonstrated that the entireCol11a2 promoter from −742 bp to + 380 bp can direct expression to essentially all cartilaginous structures, whereas a truncated promoter showed no tissue-specific activity (17Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One interpretation of this result is that the region of Col11a2 eliminated in the truncation may be involved in regulating the tissue-specific expression of the gene. Examination of the sequence ofCol11a2 from the −742 bp to +380 bp revealed a consensus HMG domain protein-binding site that we show to be essential for the chondrocyte-specific activity of this promoter in transgenic mice. There are also additional sites with homology to the HMG consensus, reminiscent of the multiple HMG-like binding sites in theCol2a1 enhancer. We have identified two enhancer elements in the Col11a2 promoter which contain clusters of these sites and which both appear to bind proteins that are the same as or very similar to the CSEP proteins which bind the Col2a1 enhancer. These elements are located within the region that was eliminated by the inactivating truncation (17Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We identify by mutational analysis the HMG-like sites in each element that participate in CSEP binding, and we demonstrate that these sites are necessary for enhancer activity. Finally, we show that the elements are capable of directing chondrocyte-specific gene expression in transient transfection and in transgenic mice. The rat chondrosarcoma RCS cell line was obtained as described previously (18Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). BALB/3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and the 714 subline was used (19Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under 8% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Col11a2 probes were named by designating the putative HMG domain protein-binding sites in the region of interest A, B, C, D, and E, with A being most 5′ (Fig. 1,panel A ). When designing mutated probes (Fig. 1, panel B ), the likelihood that mutated sites in the A/B/C and D/E probes would be unrecognizable to HMG domain proteins was maximized by introducing mutations to give a total of 4 mismatches with the 7-bp consensus, by introducing mutations at the invariable sites in the consensus, and by substituting G or C for A or T residues to eliminate the overall A/T-rich nature of the consensus site. Dmut is the same as Dwt but with two mutations within the HMG site, representing a less severe change of the consensus than the other mutant probes contain. All DNA probes were made as complementary oligonucleotides (Genosys; The Woodlands, TX) with 5′ overhangs for radiolabeling and cloning. The oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before annealing. The pCXIwt plasmid was constructed exactly as described by Tsumaki et al. (17Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and named 742lacZ by them. Briefly, a 1,122-bp fragment between −742 and +380 of Col11a2 was amplified by PCR using a cosmid containing the entire mouse Col11a2 gene as template. (This cosmid was a kind gift of Dr. Darwin Prockop at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, Philadelphia, PA.) The PCR product was cloned into the Eco RI/Xho I polylinker region in the expression vector pNASSβ (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA), which contains a full-length Escherichia coli β-galactosidase reporter gene, and a splice donor/splice acceptor and polyadenylation signal from SV40, but no promoter of its own. The pCXImut plasmid is like pCXIwt except that it contains a 2-bp mutation (identical to that contained in probe Dmut) within the consensus HMG domain binding site D. This mutation was generated by PCR. The luciferase reporter plasmids (4 × ABC)p95Luc, (4 × DE)p95Luc, (4 × ABmCm)p95Luc, and (4 × DmEm)p95Luc were all constructed using the pLuc4 vector (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intermediate construction steps and multimerization of the enhancer elements were performed in the p89Col2a1Bs plasmid as described previously for other constructs (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These plasmids contain four tandem copies of the A/B/C, D/E, A/Bm/Cm, or Dm/Em Col11a2 elements (as described in Fig. 1) cloned directly upstream of a minimal 89-bpCol2a1 promoter (−89 to +6). The plasmids (4 × ABC)pgloblacZ and (4 × DE)pgloblacZ were constructed by cloning four copies of A/B/C or of D/E directly upstream of a minimal human β-globin promoter (−44 to +28) in the reporter plasmid placF as described previously for other constructs (20Zhou G. Garofalo S. Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Smith C.N. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3677-3684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA segments obtained by PCR or with synthetic oligonucleotides were verified by DNA sequencing. SOX9 antibodies were created by immunizing rabbits with a peptide (HSPQHWEQPVYTQLT), as described previously (21Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) (Genosys; The Woodlands, TX). The antibodies were affinity purified over a 3M Emphaze Biosupport Medium AB1 column (Pierce) coupled to the SOX9 peptide and were eluted at low pH (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 314-315Google Scholar). They were then diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% sodium azide and concentrated using Microcon-10 microconcentrators (Millipore; Bedford, MA). In electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments, the purified SOX9 antibodies completely and specifically supershifted a Sox9·DNA complex formed between crude RCS nuclear extracts and a probe called R2, which is an 18-bp subfragment of theCol2a1 48-bp enhancer containing the SOX9-binding site. This probe was previously shown to form a major protein-DNA complex with Sox9 in RCS nuclear extracts (7Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOX9 was synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation using the Single Tube Protein System 2, T7 kit from Novagen (Madison, WI) and a previously described expression plasmid containing the coding sequence for human SOX9 (7Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All probes (described above) were radiolabeled by end-filling with the Klenow fragment. Protein-DNA binding reactions were performed as described previously (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized SOX9 protein was assayed in the presence of 0.1 μg of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) as nonspecific competitor. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), and most assays were performed using 9 μg of protein and 1.0 μg of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC). When SOX9 antibodies were included, they were coincubated with the protein and probe. Electrophoretic gel separations were usually run for 2–3 h at 160 V. The very long separations were run for 6–7 h at 160 V. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 2 μg of DNA was used to transfect each 10-cm2 dish. Cellular extracts were prepared and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described (18Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Prior to microinjections to make transgenic mice, pCXIwt and pCXImut were digested with Eco RI and Pst I, and (4 × ABC)pgloblacZ and (4 × DE)pgloblacZ were digested with Asp-718 and Hin dIII to remove extraneous plasmid sequences. Microinjections were performed as described previously (20Zhou G. Garofalo S. Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Smith C.N. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3677-3684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Founder embryos were sacrificed at 14.5 days postcoitum (dpc). Embryos were fixed and stained with X-gal, photographed as whole mounts, and then embedded and sectioned for histological analysis as described previously (20Zhou G. Garofalo S. Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Smith C.N. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3677-3684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pCXIwt contains the 5′ region of Col11a2 from −742 bp to +380 bp, controlling a lacZ reporter gene. The pCXImut plasmid is identical in every way except that it contains a 2-bp mutation of the consensus HMG-binding site (site D, Fig.1). Transient transfections of these two plasmids revealed that pCXIwt was very active in RCS cells, but mutation of the HMG consensus site in pCXImut reduced reporter gene activity to approximately one-third of pCXIwt levels (Fig.2). Neither plasmid was active in BALB/3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that factors necessary for activation of this promoter may not be present in those cells. Cotransfection with a SOX9 expression vector did not measurably increase the activity of pCXIwt in fibroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that other factors besides SOX9 may be required to activate the −742 bp to +380 bpCol11a2 promoter in chondrocytes. DNA from the pCXIwt and pCXImut plasmids was used to generate transgenic mice. Founders were sacrificed at 14.5 dpc and stained with X-gal to identify embryos expressing lacZ . Of nine transgenic embryos harboring pCXIwt, seven displayed blue staining. In every positively stained mouse, the staining was primarily concentrated in the cartilage, including ribs, limbs, vertebrae, and chondrocranium, particularly the future petrous temporal bone (Fig. 3,top row ). Some weak staining of other tissues, including bone precursor and neural tissue in the brain, was occasionally present. The overall expression pattern and intensity observed here were comparable to that obtained by Tsumaki et al. (17Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with this same Col11a2 construct. Microinjection of the pCXImut construct produced seven 14.5 dpc transgenic embryos. Five of these showed weak promiscuous blue staining primarily in neural tissue or bone precursor, much like the weak nonspecific staining that was observed in addition to cartilage staining in pCXIwt mice. None of the pCXImut mice, however, had any staining in cartilage (Fig. 3, bottom row ). This result indicates that the consensus HMG domain protein-binding site in the 5′ region of Col11a2 is critical for the chondrocyte-specific activity of the promoter in vivo . Given that SOX9 has previously been shown to activate transcription by binding a site in the 48-bp Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer which is homologous to the HMG binding consensus (7Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EMSA experiments were performed to determine whether SOX9 could also bind to the Col11a2 HMG consensus site. The probe Dwt (Fig. 1) containing the consensus site and 10 bp of flanking DNA on either side was used for these assays. EMSAs showed thatin vitro transcribed and translated SOX9 bound to the Dwt probe, forming two distinct DNA-protein complexes (Fig.4, panel A ). In addition to the D site, the Dwt probe also includes the E site at its 3′ end. It is probable that the faster migrating band represents one molecule of SOX9 bound to the probe, whereas the slower band represents two molecules of SOX9 bound at the D and E sites. Mutation of 2 bp within the HMG site (probe Dmut) markedly reduced the monomeric and dimeric complexes, demonstrating that the consensus site participates in formation of both complexes (Fig. 4, panel A ). When crude nuclear extracts from RCS cells were used for EMSA, the position of the Sox9·DNA complex was obscured by a broad, nonspecific band which was present in both BALB/3T3 fibroblasts and RCS nuclear extracts. The addition of antibodies to SOX9, however, supershifted a complex from within this broad band in RCS but not BALB/3T3 extracts, demonstrating that Dwt binds Sox9 in crude nuclear extracts (Fig. 4, panel B ). Two imperfect HMG sites near the SOX9-binding site in the 48-bp Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer are important for the tissue specificity of that enhancer (28Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As outlined in Fig.1, the promoter region of Col11a2 also contains three 1-bp mismatch HMG sites (herein designated A, C, and E) near the perfect consensus site (D). Multiple 2-bp mismatch HMG sites were present within the promoter region, but one (site B) was of particular interest because of its proximity to site C. Two DNA probes were constructed, one included sites A, B, and C and the other included sites D and E (Fig. 1). They were used in EMSA analysis with in vitro synthesized SOX9, and both formed a major complex and a minor, faster migrating complex (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5, arrows ). Two complexes with the same mobility were observed when the Col2a1 48-bp enhancer probe was used, but the faster migrating complex was much stronger (Fig. 5, lane 1 ). Both complexes with all three probes were completely supershifted by antibodies to SOX9 (data not shown), and we postulate as with the Dwt probe that SOX9 forms both monomeric and dimeric complexes with the probes by utilizing the multiple HMG-like binding sites. In EMSA experiments with RCS cell nuclear extracts, the major DNA-protein complex formed by the Col11a2 A/B/C and D/E probes (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6 ,bracket ) was similar in mobility to the chondrocyte-specific complex formed with the 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer (Fig. 5,lane 2 ). The proteins in this complex have been tentatively designated CSEP by Zhou et al. (28Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the Col11a2 DNA-protein complexes contain very similar or the same proteins as the Col2a1 CSEP·DNA complex. First, very long separation (2–3 times longer than usual) EMSA experiments failed to reveal any differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of the three complexes (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 4 , and 6 ). Second, like the Col2a1 CSEP·DNA complex, the protein-DNA complexes formed with theCol11a2 A/B/C and D/E probes were eliminated by the use of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor in the EMSA experiments (Fig.6). Third, neither the Col2a1 nor the Col11a2 probes formed these complexes with nuclear extracts from BALB/3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 6). And fourth, the formation of the major complex between RCS cell nuclear extracts and each of the three probes was competed by a 10-fold excess of any of the other probes or of self, while other minor complexes formed by the three probes were not competed except by self (Fig.7). In summary, these experiments support the hypothesis that the proteins present in the Col11a2 DNA-protein complexes and in CSEP are very similar.Figure 7The Col2a1 48-bp enhancer probe and the Col11a2 A/B/C and D/E probes compete with each other for protein binding.

The broad bands produced by long separation of the complexes, however, indicate that Sox9 is probably not the only protein present. Zhou et al. (28Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have also concluded that the Col2a1 CSEP·DNA complex is heterogeneous. Inclusion of SOX9 antibodies in EMSA experiments with the Col11a2 probes and RCS cell nuclear extracts resulted in the appearance of a minor supershifted species, but the majority of each complex remained unmoved (Fig. 8). The experiment was performed under the same conditions in which the antibodies completely supershifted a Sox9 complex with an 18-bpCol2a1 probe (called R2) in RCS nuclear extracts (Ref. 7Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). These results support the conclusion that SOX9 may constitute the slower migrating portion of the CSEP-like complexes but is not the only protein in the complex. DNA probes were made that contained mutations designed to eliminate the potential HMG domain protein-binding sites in probes A/B/C and D/E (Fig. 1). In EMSAs with RCS nuclear extracts, mutation of sites C, D, or E completely eliminated formation of the CSEP-like complex. Mutation of site B greatly reduced complex formation, whereas mutation of site A had no effect (Fig.9). The observation that the single mismatch HMG site A was not involved in complex formation but that the double mismatch site B was necessary suggests that the position of the HMG-like sites in relation to each other plays an important role in protein binding. Sites B and C are separated by 4 bp and sites D and E are separated by 3 bp. Site A, conversely, is 18 bp upstream of B. The pla"
https://openalex.org/W2075610315,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in angiogenesis and blood vessel remodeling. Its expression is up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells by a number of conditions, including hypoxia. Hypoxia increases the transcriptional rate of VEGF via a 28-base pair enhancer located in the 5'-upstream region of the gene. The gas molecules nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are important vasodilating agents. We report here that these biological molecules can suppress the hypoxia-induced production of VEGF mRNA and protein in smooth muscle cells. In transient expression studies, both NO and CO inhibited the ability of the hypoxic enhancer we have previously identified to activate gene transcription. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated decreased binding of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) to this enhancer by nuclear proteins isolated from CO-treated cells, although HIF-1 protein levels were unaffected by CO. Given that both CO and NO activate guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP and that a cGMP analog (8-Br-cGMP) showed a similar suppressive effect on the hypoxic induction of the VEGF enhancer, we speculate that the suppression of VEGF by these two gas molecules occurs via a cyclic GMP-mediated pathway."

We recently identified a new mRNA variant that differs from the previously characterized form in that the encoded C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is almost completely different. In the present study, we demonstrate that the mRNAs for mouse SR-BI and SR-BII (previously termed SR-BI.2) are the alternatively spliced products of a single gene. The translation products predicted from human, bovine, mouse, hamster, and rat cDNAs exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity within the SR-BII C-terminal domain (62–67% identity when compared with the human sequence), suggesting that this variant is biologically important. SR-BII protein represents approximately 12% of the total immunodetectable SR-BI/II protein in mouse liver. Subcellular fractionation of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that SR-BII, like SR-BI, is enriched in caveolae, indicating that the altered cytoplasmic tail does not affect targeting of the receptor. SR-BII mediated both selective cellular uptake of cholesteryl ether from HDL as well as HDL-dependent cholesterol efflux from cells, although with approximately 4-fold lower efficiency than SR-BI. In vivo studies using adenoviral vectors showed that SR-BII was relatively less efficient than SR-BI in reducing plasma HDL cholesterol. These studies show that SR-BII, an HDL receptor isoform containing a distinctly different cytoplasmic tail, mediates selective lipid transfer between HDL and cells, but with a lower efficiency than the previously characterized variant."

A. 1977; 74: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), many different helicases have been identified with preferences for unwinding duplexes of DNA or RNA. In in vitro experiments, nearly all helicases require a single stranded region; some require a 3′ overhang region (3′ to 5′ helicases), whereas others require a 5′ overhang region (5′ to 3′ helicases). This single stranded region is proposed to provide an initiation site for unwinding duplex nucleic acids (6Amaratunga M. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6815-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli Rep DNA helicase, an extensively studied helicase, exhibited highly processive unwinding of replicative form of phage DNA in an in vitro experiment (7Yarranton G.T.

In order for a helicase to unwind duplex nucleic acids in a processive manner, the enzyme should destabilize the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs, translocate to the next base paired region, and repeat the cycle without fully dissociating (6Amaratunga M.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6815-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although Rep DNA helicase, for example, is a stable monomer in solution in the absence of DNA, a dimeric form of Rep is induced in the presence of DNA which is known as the functional form (6Amaratunga M.

Hepatitis C viruses (HCVs) are the major etiologic agents of non-A, non-B hepatitis that are estimated to have infected about 1% of the population worldwide. HCV belongs to flaviviridae, the positive-strand RNA virus family (10Rice C.M. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Schlesinger S. Schlesinger M.J. The Togaviridae and Flaviviridae. Plenum Press, New York1986Google Scholar). Its genome consists of about 9400 nucleotides with the gene order of N′-C-E1-E2-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-C′ (10Rice C.M. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Schlesinger S. Schlesinger M.J. The Togaviridae and Flaviviridae. Plenum Press, New York1986Google Scholar) encoding a viral polyprotein of about 3010 residues (11Kato N. Hijikata M. Ootsuyama Y.

The polyprotein is processed into functional proteins by host- and virus-encoded proteases. Among the processed proteins, NS3 is best characterized. The N-terminal one-third of NS3 is a serine protease domain (12Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which is known to cleave the NS3/4A, NS4A/4B, NS4B/5A, and NS5A/5B junctions (13Bartenschlager R. Ahlborn-Laake L. Mous J. Jacobsen H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Eckart M.R. Selby M. Masiarz F. Lee C. Berger K. Crawford K. Kuo C. Kuo G. Houghton M. Choo Q.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Virol. 1995; 69: 2534-2539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal two-thirds of NS3 is an RNA helicase domain exhibiting nucleotide triphosphatase/RNA helicase activity (16Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 654-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The domain was shown to unwind not only dsRNA but also RNA/DNA heteroduplex and dsDNA (18Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For its function the helicase domain strictly requires a 3′ overhang region, and it unwinds double stranded nucleic acids only in the 3′ to 5′ direction (18Tai C.L. Chi W.K. Chen D.S. Hwang L.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of many RNA helicases revealed four highly conserved sequence motifs, and in HCV RNA helicase they are conserved as G207SGKST, D290ECH, T322AT, and Q460RRGRTGRGRRG sequences. The G207SGKST sequence, known as Walker A motif, is found in nearly all NTP hydrolyzing enzymes and is responsible for NTP binding. The D290ECH sequence is a variant of Walker B motif (19Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Biochemical and mutational analyses showed that the T322AT sequence is important in unwinding of RNA, whereas the Q460RRGRTGRGRRG sequence is important in the RNA binding and the unwinding of RNA (20Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1997; 11: 2643-2654Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 21Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1706-1713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of the genotype 1b HCV RNA helicase domain and discuss in detail the structural features of the conserved motifs. Based on a modeling experiment we propose a mechanism of processive unwinding of the duplex RNA consistent with previously observed physicochemical properties of the enzyme. The HCV RNA helicase domain was isolated from an overexpressing E. coli strain (BL21 (DE3)) and purified using a Ni-NTA-agarose column (QIAGEN) and a poly(U)-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) successively as described previously (22Kang L.W. Cho H.S. Cha S.S. Chung K.M. Back S.H. Jang S.K. Oh B.H. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 121-123Google Scholar). Crystals were grown at 4 °C from a precipitant solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 0.2m ammonium acetate on micro batch plates under Al's oil (Hampton Research). The crystals belong to the space group P3121 with the unit cell dimensions of a =b = 93.3 Å, c = 104.6 Å. The crystals contain one molecule of the enzyme in the asymmetric unit. All diffraction data were measured from flash-frozen crystals on a DIP2020 area detector system with graphite monochromated CuKα x-ray generated by a MacScience M18XHF rotating anode generator operated at 90 mA and 50 kV. Data reduction, merging, and scaling were accomplished with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Proceedings of the CCP 4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993Google Scholar). Initial diffraction phases were obtained by multiple isomorphous replacement with three heavy atom derivatives. A difference Patterson map of an iridium derivative (K3IrCl6) and that of thimerosal derivative were calculated, respectively, with the fast Fourier transform of the CCP4 suite (1994). Heavy atom sites for the two derivatives were readily identified by strong Patterson peaks (>6ς) on Harker sections (Z = 1/3) and at general positions. The heavy atom positions were used to calculate MIR phases with the program MLPHARE (24Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. Science and Engineering Research Council, Warrington, UK1991Google Scholar). The MIR phases revealed relatively weak heavy atom positions for a gold derivative (KAu(CN)2). The MIR phases with all three derivative data had a mean figure of merit of 0.55 at 3.0 Å resolution (Table I) and were improved with real space density modification using the program DM in the CCP4 suite (1994). The final MIR map was of high quality showing virtually all side chain electron densities except in flexible regions. A nearly complete model of the helicase was built using the program O (25Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. O Version 6.0. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden1993Google Scholar) and was refined using X-PLOR program package (26Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). MIR phases were abandoned at this point, and electron density maps calculated with phases derived from the refined model allowed model building of loop regions. The N-terminal 39 residues including hexahistidine tag attached to the protein exhibited no electron density and were omitted in the final model. Only faint electron densities were observed for residues 416–420.Table ICrystal structure determination and refinement statisticsCrystalResolutionR symCompleteness (F > 1ς)Soaking concentrationSoaking timeR scaleSites (No.)Phasing power (acent/cent)R cullis (%, acent/cent)Figure of meritÅ%mmh%Native2.306.598.8Thimerosal2.805.585.2100.521.74(1.0 /1.4)(0.65 /0.62)K3IrCl62.804.489.42.5613.42(0.7 /1.0)(0.78 /0.71)KAu (CN)24.07.089.666919.33(0.5 /0.7)(0.88 /0.86)0.55Refinement (F < 1ς)Stereochemical qualityRstandard22.0Rmsd bond lengths (Å)0.011Rfree26.0Rmsd bond angles (degree)1.649Number of atoms3219Ramachandran plot (%)Water molecules140Most favored regions89.1Average B-factor (Å2)18.4Additional allowed regions10.9Disallowed regions0.0R sym = Σ ‖I obs −I avg‖/Σ I obs.R scale = Σ ∥F PH‖ − ‖F P∥/Σ ‖F P‖.

The structure of HCV RNA helicase consists of three nearly equal-sized domains that form a Y-shaped molecule (Fig. 1). The N-terminal one-third of the enzyme is a NTPase domain consisting of a typical central core of pleated sheet surrounded by helices (27Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The active site cleft for the NTP hydrolysis can be readily identified at the periphery of the domain by the G207SGKST sequence, the NTP binding motif. The second domain is an RNA binding domain containing the highly conserved Q460RRGRTGRGRRG sequence identified as an RNA binding motif (Fig. 1). The folding pattern of the RNA binding domain is similar to that of the NTPase domain, but it contains fewer α-helices. The C-terminal one-third of the enzyme is a helical domain composed of five α-helices and loops. The NTPase and the helical domain are more or less continuously linked with a shallow groove between the two, but the RNA binding domain is distinctly separated from the other two domains forming a deep interdomain cleft as shown in Fig. 1. The size of the interdomain cleft is adequate for binding ssRNA (or ssDNA) but too narrow for binding double stranded nucleic acids. The NTPase and the RNA binding domain are connected by two random coils (Fig. 1). In contrast, two antiparallel β-strands, unusually protruding from the RNA binding domain, are inserted into the helical domain like an anchor linking the two domains (Fig. 1). The turn region of the antiparallel β-strands is rich in hydrophobic amino acids and interact extensively with apolar residues of the helical domain. It remains a question why NS3 containing two completely different activities, protease and helicase activities, is not cleaved into two polypeptides in the processing of the viral polyprotein. In the crystal structure presented here, the electron density for the first 39 amino acid is not visible, indicating that the protease domain and the helicase domain of NS3 should be linked to each other by a highly flexible loop region. The visible N terminus of the helicase is at the back side of the molecule (opposite the interdomain cleft), and thus the enzyme activities of the protease and the helicase domain appear independent of each other (see below). The NTP binding site is located at the periphery of the NTPase domain. The G207SGKST and the D290ECH sequences are close to each other, lining part of the active site cavity (Fig. 2). The side chain of Asp290 is involved in an ionic interaction with Lys210 and a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser211. The D290ECH sequence is on an unusual loop structure which orients the side chains of Asp290, Glu291, and His293 toward the cavity and that of Cys292 in the opposite direction (Fig.3). The functional roles of Asp290 and Glu291 can be inferred from the structures of other NTPases. The crystal structures of Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA (28Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and E. coli Rep DNA helicases (29Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) were determined as complexes with ADP. It has been proposed that in the major domain of RecA, which exhibits similarity to the NTPase domains of the DNA helicases, the magnesium ion of Mg-ATP is coordinated by Asp144 (30Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). This residue corresponds to Asp223 and Asp214 in the DEXX motif of PcrA and Rep DNA helicase, respectively. Glu215 (in Rep) and Glu224 (in PcrA) of the DEXX motif are in the same relative position in space as Glu96 in RecA, which was proposed to activate the catalytic water molecule during the hydrolysis of ATP. When the NTPase domains of HCV RNA helicase and PcrA DNA helicase were superposed, Asp290 and Glu291of HCV RNA helicase occupy relatively the same space as do Asp223 and Glu224 of the DNA helicase (data not shown), although overall structures of the two enzymes are quite different. This observation implies that the two residues probably share the same functions in the hydrolysis of NTP with the corresponding residues in the DNA helicases and RecA. Consistently, studies of the related DEX H helicase from vaccinia virus demonstrated that substitution of Asp296 or Glu297 in the DEX H motif with alanine abolishes the NTPase activity and the helicase activity without affecting the RNA binding affinity (31Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4727-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The electron density for the NTP binding site is very strong showing detailed features including many bound water molecules (Fig. 2). However, it was not possible to predict a correct binding mode of NTP by simple model building due to severe steric clashes. Some conformational change in the active site cavity is expected to occur upon NTP binding.Figure 3Interaction of the D290ECH and the T322AT sequence of HCV RNA helicase. Note Asp290, Glu291, and His293 that form a part of the active site cavity are on a loop structure and point in the same direction. The backbones of the DECH motif and TAT sequence are in cyan and magenta , respectively, and the side chains are in green . The white dotted line indicates the hydrogen bond between His293 and Thr322.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the two loops connecting the NTPase and the RNA binding domain contains the invariant T322AT. In the structure presented here, the hydroxyl group of Thr322, located at the beginning of the loop (Fig. 1, 3), is involved in a hydrogen bond with the imidazole ring nitrogen of His293. In contrast, the hydroxyl group of Thr324, located toward the middle of the loop and about 4 Å apart from His292, is just exposed to the bulk solvent (Fig. 3). It is generally believed based on mutational studies that the T322AT sequence couples the NTP hydrolysis and the duplex unwinding by the enzyme (20Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1997; 11: 2643-2654Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In other experiments, H293A mutation in HCV RNA helicase and the corresponding mutation in vaccinia virus RNA helicase were shown to affect severely the duplex unwinding activity without affecting the NTP hydrolysis activity (31Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4727-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Heilek G.M. Peterson M.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6264-6266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, His293, Thr322, and Thr324 may function as a triad in coupling the NTP hydrolysis and the helicase activity. It is possible that His293 could switch its hydrogen bond to and from Thr322 and Thr324during the helicase function, which should require a small flexible hinge motion of the connecting loops considering the proximity of the three residues. As supporting evidence, in the crystal structure of highly homologous genotype 1a HCV RNA helicase which was determined very recently, two molecules in the asymmetric unit displaying 3–4° rigid body rotation of the RNA binding domain with respect to each other undergo a small hinge bending motion of the two loops (33Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The domain movement appears intrinsically small due to the presence of the two antiparallel β-strands which link the RNA binding and the helical domain. The “structured” strands, interacting heavily with the helical domain, are unlikely to undergo an appreciable conformational change. In the crystal structure of genotype 1a HCV RNA helicase, the β-strands of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit show a negligible twist with respect to each other. Consistently, despite the completely different crystal packing, the RNA helicase structure presented here (in the space group P3121) does not exhibit any noticeable closure or opening of the interdomain cleft compared with the structure of genotype 1a HCV RNA helicase (in the space group P212121). The RNA binding motif, Q460RRGRTGRGRRG sequence, shows unusually high occurrence of glycine and arginine. The first three residues constitute the end of an α-helix, and the rest of the residues forms a loop structure (Fig. 1, 4). The high occurrence of glycine on the loop structure strongly suggest that the sequence can easily undergo a conformational change necessary for the alignment of the arginine residues on the loop structure in favorable contacts with the phosphate backbone of RNA. It was noted that the side chains of the most conserved residues, Gln460, Arg461, Arg464, and Arg467, point to the interdomain cleft with an ∼7 Å spacing (Fig. 4). Entrapment of substrates within protein structures has been observed as a common theme for several proteins which possess a processivity in the interaction with nucleic acids, including β subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III (34Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and λ-exonuclease (35Kovall R. Matthews B.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A functional oligomeric state of HCV helicase is not known but has been proposed equivocally as a monomer or a dimer (36Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We examined crystal packing interfaces in the crystal structure and found that a symmetry-related monomer-monomer interaction could reflect interfaces of a functional form of the RNA helicase. The interfaces are formed by the interactions between the NTPase and the RNA binding domains of the two molecules and represent the most extensive crystal packing interactions (Fig.5). The interactions screen a total of 144 Å2 surface area of one molecule. In the middle of the dimer a channel is found that is helical in shape with a vertical length of about 29 Å and a horizontal length of about 10 Å on the front side and 12 Å on the back side. The RNA binding motif of each molecule is the major part shaping the surface of the channel. It was possible to model a canonic RNA (37Leonardo G.A. Mcauley-Hecht K.E. Ebel S. Lough D.M. Brown T. Hunter W.N. Structure. 1994; 2: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) into the interdomain cleft of one molecule and continuously through the channel at the dimer interface with the 3′ end hanging out of the channel. In the modeling experiment, the phosphate backbone of ssRNA was brought into contact with the RNA binding motifs of the two molecules with slight dihedral angle changes of the phosphate backbone. This was easily achieved because both the two RNA binding motifs and the two interacting phosphate groups are separated by ∼17 Å corresponding to a half-turn of RNA (Fig. 6). In this binding mode, one molecule of the RNA helicase interacts with ssRNA extensively, whereas the other molecule reacts less extensively using the RNA binding motif only. The phosphate backbone of the bound ssRNA, interacting with the RNA binding motifs at the channel, appears as a “glue” which stabilize the dimeric structure. Similar observations were made for the dimer or the trimer of the DNA polymerase β subunit, both of which are supposed to be stabilized by dsDNA entrapped in the middle of the oligomeric structures (34Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 38Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). It was noted that the interdomain cleft is slightly wider for the ssRNA modeled in the interdomain cleft. A small rotation of the RNA binding domain toward the NTPase and the helical domain is expected for an induced fit of ssRNA as a result of the hinge bending motion. It is known that ssRNAs increase the NTPase activity of HCV RNA helicase up to 27-fold (36Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas dsRNAs do not. The activity increase is likely due to the ssRNA binding to the interdomain cleft, which may also trigger some conformational change at the active site of the enzyme. In this regard, the RNA helicase with a bound ssRNA at the interdomain cleft can be considered as an activated molecule, whereas the RNA helicase without a bound ssRNA can be considered as a resting molecule. It is not known whether the RNA and the NTP binding to the enzyme are sequential or random. Our modeling experiment, which shows that the bound ssRNA dose not block the NTP binding site, cannot distinguish the two. Whether it is sequential or random, ATP hydrolysis would occur mainly on the activated molecule. Because of the expected small conformational change upon the ssRNA binding at the interdomain cleft, the asymmetric putative functional dimeric form composed of the activated molecule and the resting molecule would be slightly different from the symmetric dimer composed of the two resting molecules presented here. The dimer interface in the crystal structure does not involve any specific interaction such as ion pairs between charged amino acids. Thus, the slight rotation of the RNA binding domain at the dimer interface could easily occur upon the induced conformational change by the ssRNA binding. With this putative functional dimeric model, we propose a mechanism of processive unwinding of duplex RNA coupled with the NTP hydrolysis by HCV and related RNA helicases. ATP decreases the affinity of HCV RNA helicase for deoxyuracil 18 mer by 95% (36Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), indicating that the ATP hydrolysis results in the dissociation of RNA from the enzyme. Based on this observation, it can be hypothesized that the NTP hydrolysis causes a hinge bending motion which transforms the activated conformation of the enzyme to the resting conformation concomitant with the detachment of the bound ssRNA from the interdomain cleft. In the model presented here, the detached ssRNA can be closer to and bound by the interdomain cleft of the resting molecule of the putative functional dimer. This can be described as a rotation of the dimer relative to the bound ssRNA (Fig.7). In order for the dimer to translocate on the ssRNA by the rotational motion, a rotation axis should be toward the 5′ end of the bound RNA relative to the “pseudo-” 2-fold symmetry axis of the functional dimer. In the structure of the dimer, the front part of the RNA binding motif of one molecule is below the 2-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 6). It was shown that individual alanine substitutions of the conserved arginine residues in the RNA binding motif in vaccinia virus RNA helicase cause severe defects in RNA unwinding with slight reduction in RNA binding affinity (21Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1706-1713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutational study led to the conclusion that the motif must play an essential role in the helicase mechanism. The structural observation and the biochemical data suggest that a front part of the RNA binding motif serves as the pivoting region for the rotation in the context of the proposed model. About 60° rotation of the dimer along an axis passing the front part of the RNA binding motif of the activated molecule brings the resting molecule into contact with the ssRNA and results in a translocation of the dimer toward the 5′ direction as shown in Fig. 7. After this one cycle of the rotation and translation the conformations between the activated molecule and the resting molecule are exchanged, reproducing the same RNA binding mode of the functional dimer. Repeated cycles of the rotation and translation along the ssRNA containing the 3′ overhang can be described as “descending molecular see-saw” motion (Fig. 7). Since the size of the interdomain cleft is adequate only for ssRNA, duplex unwinding by the disruption of base pairings should occur at the ssRNA and dsRNA junction. Required energy can be provided by the favorable interaction between the interdomain cleft and the ssRNA. The translocation of the dimer along the ssRNA is the process of duplex unwinding because one strand of RNA passing through the channel is separated from the other strand hanging out of the dimer (Fig. 6, 7). The step size of duplex unwinding and translocation along the ssRNA is about 5 nucleotides when the dimer rotates along an axis at the front part of the RNA binding motif (about Arg462). This coincides with the step size of UvrD helicase obtained by kinetic measurement (39Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The proposed functional dimeric model satisfies the previously observed properties of the enzyme. First, the model requires a 3′ overhang region of RNA for the initial binding of one molecule the RNA and for the formation of the putative active dimer (Fig.8). This explains the requirement of an at least 11-base-long single stranded portion of the RNA substrates for the helicase function (36Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is the minimum length that spans the interdomain cleft and the channel of the dimer (Fig. 6). Second, the functional dimer moves along the ssRNA containing 3′ overhang in the 3′ to 5′ direction as previously observed (40Warrener P. Collett M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was not possible to insert ssRNA into the dimeric structure in the 5′ to 3′ direction simply due to severe steric clashes. Third, the model requires the pivoting motion around the RNA binding motif for the duplex unwinding. This explains that the RNA binding motif is necessary not only for the binding of RNA but also more importantly for the unwinding activity of the enzyme. Fourth, since the functional dimer translocates along only one strand of nucleic acids in this model, the dimer is able to unwind dsRNA, dsDNA, and DNA/RNA duplex as previously known. Besides, since the dimer uses only the front side of the molecules for the duplex unwinding and the flexible N terminus is located at the back side of the molecule, the protease domain linked to the helicase domain in NS3 would not interfere the movement of NS3 along RNA substrates in vivo . The proposed model is analogous in concept to the “rotary-type” mechanism of F1-ATPase. It is believed that a 120° rotation of γ subunit of F1-ATPase induces sequential conformational changes of the α3β3subunits. Each subunit alternates among three conformations, ADP and Pi bound, ATP bound, and none-bound (41Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Like the γ subunit of F1-ATPase, the bound ssRNA results in the asymmetric functional dimer, each molecule of which alternates between the activated and the resting conformation. Interestingly, it was proposed recently that hexameric T7 DNA helicase encircles only one strand of DNA (42Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In conclusion, the “descending molecular see-saw” model is presented consistent with the previously observed biochemical data for the RNA helicases. The model provides a plausible framework explaining how the enzymes achieve the duplex unwinding and the translocation along nucleic acids in a processive manner."

CL and its synthesis are localized predominantly to the mitochondrial inner membrane, and CL is generally thought to be an essential component of many mitochondrial processes. By using homology searches for genes potentially encoding phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, we have cloned the gene (CLS1 ) encoding CL synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Overexpression of the CLS1 gene under its endogenous promoter or the inducible GAL1 promoter in yeast and expression of CLS1 in baculovirus-infected insect cells resulted in elevated CL synthase activity. Disruption of theCLS1 gene in a haploid yeast strain resulted in the loss of CL synthase activity, no detectable CL, a 5-fold elevation in phosphatidylglycerol levels, and lack of staining of mitochondria by a dye with high affinity for CL. Thecls1 ::TRP1 null mutant grew on both fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources but more poorly on the latter. The level and activity of cytochrome c oxidase was normal, and a dye whose accumulation is dependent on membrane proton electrochemical potential effectively stained the mitochondria.

Due to its cellular distribution, CL is thought to be involved in critical cellular functions such as cytochrome c oxidase function (4Awasthi Y.C. Chuang T.F. Keenan T.W. Crane F.L. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition to basic cell functions, CL has been postulated to play a role in disease processes such as lipid peroxidation observed in reperfusion after ischemic injury and in cellular aging (13Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). A vast amount of literature details biochemical approaches to determine the role of CL in cell processes (2Hatch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 159: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Hoch F.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 71-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar); however, it has been difficult to correlate the in vitro experimental findings with in vivo cellular processes due to the absence of genetic evidence supporting CL involvement in these processes. The focus of the work in our laboratory is to characterize the genes and enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of CL and the role this anionic lipid plays in mitochondrial function. CL is synthesized by three sequential reactions (Fig.1) in all organisms and requires the biosynthetic intermediate, CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). The committed and rate-limiting step in CL biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is catalyzed by phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PG-P) synthase (step 1) yielding PG-P which is rapidly dephosphorylated (16Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells phosphatidylglycerol (PG) reacts in the final step (step 3) with another molecule of CDP-DAG to yield CL catalyzed by CL synthase (17Schlame M. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Schlame M. Brody S. Hostetler K.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli the synthesis of PG proceeds by an analogous set of reactions (20Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) except CL is synthesized by the condensation of two PG molecules with the release of glycerol (21Hirshberg C.B. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We recently isolated from S. cerevisiae and characterized the gene (PGS1 ) encoding the first enzyme in this pathway (22Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the isolation and characterization of the gene (CLS1 ) encoding the last enzyme in the pathway for CL biosynthesis. The gene was cloned and expressed in both yeast and baculovirus-infected insect cells and shown to encode CL synthase activity. Interruption of the CLS1 gene resulted in no detectable CL or CL synthase activity and elevated levels of PG. Mitochondrial function was not grossly perturbed as evidenced by growth on non-fermentable carbon sources and maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo . This is the first detailed report definitively establishing the isolation of a eukaryotic gene encoding CL synthase activity. A preliminary report of this work has appeared (23Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (abstr.)1299Google Scholar). All chemicals were reagent grade or better.

A list of strains and plasmids used in this work is given in TableI. Methods for E. coli growth and selection were described previously (25Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Strain ADC90/pDD72 was used to make radiolabeled PG. Strain DH5α was used to propagate plasmids and was grown in LB medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (200 μg/ml) was added to cultures carrying the appropriate plasmids.E. coli strain LE392 was used to propagate lambda phage (25Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Methods of yeast growth and selection were described previously (29Spencer J.F.T. Spencer D.M. Bruce I.J. Yeast Genetics: A Manual of Methods. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989Crossref Google Scholar, 30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). YPD medium consisted of 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose. In YPGly or YPGal medium, 2% glycerol or galactose, respectively, replaced dextrose as the carbon source. Complete synthetic media (CSM) were constituted as described previously (30Sherman F.

Yeast selection media contained the components of CSM except those noted for selection purposes (i.e. −Trp and −uracil). All the above media were supplemented with 2% agar (yeast) or 1.5% agar (E. coli ) for growth on plates.

For both analytical and preparative purposes, PCR was performed after optimizing conditions (31Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar). Amplification of the CLS1 gene from yeast chromosomal DNA employed primers based on the open reading frame YDL142c 2J. M. Cherry, C. Adler, C. Ball, S. Dwight, S. Chervitz, Y. Jia, G. Juvik, S. Weng, and D. Bostein,Saccharomyces genome data base http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/. SGDID: 0003358, now named CRD1 . as follows: primer 1, 5′-CGCAAGCTTACAATGATTCAAATGGTGC-3′ (the addedHin dIII site is underlined and the start codon for the open reading frame is in boldface), and primer 2, 5′-CGTTGTCTAGTGAAAGAGAGAG-3′ (priming beginning 500 bp 3′ of the stop codon). For Southern hybridization analysis DNA samples were digested with restriction endonuclease and prepared for hybridization with a digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled probe as described previously (22Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Template DNA for labeling by random priming using the GeniusTM 1 Kit and use in the above procedure was generated by Hin dIII andBam HI digestion of plasmid pYCLS10-1 which produced a fragment (982 kb) containing the CLS1 gene. All cell fractionation procedures were performed at 4 °C. Mitochondria-enriched membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (22Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown to late log phase in CSM with auxotrophic selection when appropriate and either 2% glucose or 2% galactose as carbon source. Cells were pelleted and washed with homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol) and frozen at −80 °C for later use. Cells were disrupted at 4 °C by mechanical shearing using a Mini-BeadBeaterTM8 and silica/zirconium beads (Biospec Products). A crude mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 27,000 × g and suspended in the above homogenization buffer. The yeastCLS1 gene was subcloned into plasmid pVL1392 for baculovirus expression. The Hin dIII-Xho I (1046 kb) fragment of plasmid pYCLS10-1 containing the CLS1 gene was subcloned into the Hin dIII-Xho I sites of pBluescript II KS, and the resulting plasmid was digested with Bam HI to generate a fragment containing the CLS1 gene flanked byBam HI sites. Next, the Bam HI fragment was subcloned into plasmid pVL1392, and orientation was verified for proper expression behind the polyhedrin promoter (PPH) for the resulting plasmid pVCLS1B (containing PPH -CLS1 ). Plasmid pVCLS1B was cotransfected, using the calcium phosphate technique, into the insect cell line, Sf9, with linearizedAutographa californica genomic DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen). The transfected cells were cultured in TNMFH medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 5 days. Culture supernatants were harvested and used as a source of mixed population virus for the following transfection. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 1 h and then incubated with TNMFH medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h at 27 °C. After 48 h the cells were harvested, washed twice with 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 15 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Control Sf9 cells without viral infection were prepared as above. Cells were frozen for subsequent CL synthase assays. After thawing on ice, cell suspensions were adjusted to 0.5–1 mg of protein per ml in a final concentration of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication for 30 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was assayed for CL synthase activity as described below. [32P]PG was synthesized in vivo using E. coli strain ADC90/pDD72 which is deficient in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis after a shift to growth at 42 °C and only makes trace amounts of CL. From a saturated culture grown at 30 °C, cells were inoculated at an 1:1000 dilution into 10 ml of M-56 medium (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.4% NH4SO4 w/v, 20 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mmK2HPO4, 0.4% vitamin-free casamino acids, 0.4% glucose) plus 400 mm sucrose and [32P]orthophosphate (final concentration of 20 μCi/ml); the culture was incubated at 42 °C overnight. The phospholipids were extracted as described previously (32Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spotted on a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate along with 5 μg of unlabeled CL. A one-dimensional thin layer chromatogram was developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:8, v/v). The32P-labeled PG was scraped from the plate, the silica gel extracted to isolate the lipids (33Shibuya I. Hiraoka S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the extracted lipid was subjected to a second purification using the above one-dimensional system. CL synthase activity was measured by the conversion of [32P]PG to CL as described previously (19Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 45 °C and in the presence of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CDP-DAG, 0.5 mm[32P]PG (specific activity of 5,000–10,000 cpm/nmol adjusted with E. coli PG as carrier), and 0.6 mmTriton X-100 in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was terminated with 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol, and the lipids were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform and 1.5 ml of 1 mMgCl2. A 0.7-ml aliquot of the chloroform phase was removed and taken to dryness. The labeled phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform, separated in one dimension on boric acid-impregnated Silica Gel 60 thin layer plates using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (60:37:5:3:1, v/v) as solvent (34Fine J.B. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 660-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and quantified using a Packard Instant Imager. A unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol of product per min under the assay conditions described above. Specific activity is defined as units/mg protein (determined using the BCA protein assay). PG-P synthase activity was measured as described previously (22Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cells grown in CSM plus 2% glucose with auxotrophic selection when appropriate were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for six generations, the phospholipids extracted in the presence of carrier lipid (30 μg of equal ratio of phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, PG, and CL) as described previously (22Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9829-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Isolated radiolabeled phospholipids (∼10,000 cpm) were analyzed on HPTLC Silica Gel plates by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (35Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the first dimension developed from right to left (see Fig. 4) with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v) and the second dimension developed from bottom to top with chloroform/methanol/88% formic acid (65:25:10, v/v). The position of each spot was determined both by authentic standards (visualized by iodine staining and ninhydrin spray) as well as comparison with previous reports (35Esko J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were visualized by exposure to x-ray film, and for quantitative results the radioactivity was counted using a Packard Instant Imager. Alternatively, one-dimensional thin layer chromatography was used (34Fine J.B. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 660-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid content is expressed as mol % of total phospholipid based on the radiolabel in each spot and its respective molar phosphate content. Activity of cytochrome c oxidase was measured at 22 °C with an oxygen electrode in 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ascorbate, 0.5 mm N,N,N ′,N ′-tetramethyl-p -phenylenediamine, 5 μm FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p -(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone), 2 μg of antimycin A, and mitochondria (0.05 mg of protein per ml) isolated as described above. To determine cytochrome aa 3content optical spectroscopy was performed with Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer at 22 °C using mitochondria (0.1 to 0.15 mg of protein per ml) in 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2. Either solid dithionite or 10 μm ferricyanide was added to either reduce or oxidize the cytochromes, respectively, and the visible difference spectrum (reduced versus oxidized) was determined. A Δεred-ox = 27 mm−1 cm−1 (36Wikstrom M. Morgan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10266-10273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the peak at 605 nm (minus the differential absorbency at 630 nm) was used to calculate the cytochrome aa 3 content. Exponentially growing strains DL1 and YCD4 in YPD or strains YPH98 and YCD2 in the CSM with 2% galactose were prepared for fluorescence microscopy by incubation with either 50 nm 10-N -nonyl acridine orange for 15 min (37Gallet P.F. Maftah A. Petit J.-M. Denis-Gay M. Julien R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or 20 μm DASPMI for 20 min (38Bereiter-Hahn J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 423: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) at room temperature; in the latter case addition of 50 μm FCCP prior to addition of DASPMI was used to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential. Similarly, strains DL1 and YCD4 grown in YPD were treated with DAPI at a final concentration of 1 μg per ml. Cells were viewed with an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100-watt HBO lamp, standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set, and a 100 × fluorite oil immersion objective. Images were captured with an Optronics DEI-750 video camera and manipulated in Adobe Photoshop version 3.0. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the products of pgsA genes (encoding PG-P synthase) from E. coli (39Usui M. Sembongi H. Matsuzaki H. Matsumoto K. Shibuya I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3389-3392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (40Dryden S.C. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a computer-based homology search of the S. cerevisiae genome data base yielded open reading frame YDL142c on Chromosome IV2 with a derived amino acid sequence showing 26 and 29% identity and 53 and 54% similarity, respectively, to the bacterial enzymes (Fig. 2). TheCLS1 gene is defined by an 849-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 283 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31,999 Da. Although sequence comparison suggested the gene encodes a PG-P synthase, subsequent biochemical and genetic analyses established the gene to encode CL synthase (see below). The CLS1 gene product also showed weaker homology (20% or less identity and less than 45% similarity) with other phosphatidyltransferases from bacteria and yeast. The characteristic CDP-alcohol/phosphatidyltransferase signature (41Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

This is consistent with absence of regulation of the level of CL synthase activity by inositol in the growth media (19Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence by PSORT (47Nakai K. Kanehisa M.

The CLS1 gene was obtained from DNA isolated from strain DL1 using PCR and primers which added a 5′ Hin dIII site. The PCR product was digested with Hin dIII and Nsi I (110 bp 3′ of the stop codon) and subcloned into the Hin dIII andPst I sites of the plasmid pUC19. Subsequently, the PCR-generated CLS1 gene was released from plasmid pUC19 by digestion with Hin dIII and Bam HI (vector site) and transferred to the Hin dIII and Bam HI sites of plasmid pYES2 generating plasmid pYCLS10-1 which placed theCLS1 gene under the regulation of the GAL1 promoter (PGAL1-CLS1 ). The PCR product was transferred to plasmid pBluescript II KS in the same manner, and its DNA sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The resulting DNA sequence matched that of open reading frame YDL142c at all nucleotides with the exception of the third position of codon 198 of the CLS1 gene which was not definitively assigned; the nucleotide at this position does not affect the encoded amino acid arginine. A genomic copy of the CLS1 gene with its endogenous promoter elements was obtained by subcloning theHin dIII-Bam HI fragment of λPM-5829 containing yeast genomic DNA into plasmid pYES2 generating plasmid pYCLS-1; this fragment contains 667 nucleotides 5′ to the start codon and 2446 nucleotides 3′ of the stop codon of the open reading frame and therefore should contain all upstream and downstream factors necessary for normal expression of CLS1 .

https://openalex.org/W2086445483,"DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol) cleaves the sugar-phosphate bond 3' to an intact apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site (i.e. AP lyase activity). The same bond is cleaved even if the AP site has been previously 5'-incised by AP endonuclease, resulting in a 5' 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate (i.e. dRP lyase activity). We characterized these lyase reactions by steady-state kinetics with the amino-terminal 8-kDa domain of beta-pol and with the entire 39-kDa polymerase. Steady-state kinetic analyses show that the Michaelis constants for both the dRP and AP lyase activities of beta-pol are similar. However, kcat is approximately 200-fold lower for the AP lyase activity on an intact AP site than for an AP endonuclease-preincised site. The 8-kDa domain was also less efficient with an intact AP site than on a preincised site. The full-length enzyme and the 8-kDa domain efficiently remove the 5' dRP from a preincised AP site in the absence of Mg2+, and the pH profiles of beta-pol and 8-kDa domain dRP lyase catalytic efficiency exhibit a broad alkaline pH optimum. An inhibitory effect of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate on the dRP lyase activity is consistent with involvement of a primary amine (Lys72) as the Schiff base nucleophile during lyase chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2114513729,"To understand the molecular mechanisms by which mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, we have used the gene for an early and abundant marker of chondrocytes, the mouse pro-α1(II) collagen gene (Col2a1 ), to delineate a minimal sequence needed for chondrocyte-specific expression and to identify the DNA-binding proteins that mediate its activity. We show here that a 48-base pair (bp) Col2a1 intron 1 sequence specifically targets the activity of a heterologous promoter to chondrocytes in transgenic mice. Mutagenesis studies of this 48-bp element identified three separate sites (sites 1–3) that were essential for its chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity in both transgenic mice and transient transfections. Mutations in sites 1 and 2 also severely inhibited the chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity of a 468-bpCol2a1 intron 1 sequence in vivo . SOX9, an SRY-related high mobility group (HMG) domain transcription factor, was previously shown to bind site 3, to bend the 48-bp DNA at this site, and to strongly activate this 48-bp enhancer as well as largerCol2a1 enhancer elements. All three sites correspond to imperfect binding sites for HMG domain proteins and appear to be involved in the formation of a large chondrocyte-specific complex between the 48-bp element, Sox9, and other protein(s). Indeed, mutations in each of the three HMG-like sites of the 48-bp element, which abolished chondrocyte-specific expression of reporter genes in transgenic mice and in transiently transfected cells, inhibited formation of this complex. Overall our results suggest a model whereby both Sox9 and these other proteins bind to several HMG-like sites in the Col2a1 gene to cooperatively control its expression in cartilage.

Elucidation of the transcriptional mechanisms that control the chondrocyte-specific expression of the Col2a1 gene should provide important insights into the molecular specifications of chondrocytes.

A multimerized 18-bp element located at the 3′ end of the 48-bp sequence also acted as a powerful chondrocyte-specific enhancer in transient transfection assays of rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells and mouse primary chondrocytes but not of fibroblasts (6Lefebvre V.

In situ hybridization during mouse embryogenesis showed thatSox9 is expressed in all chondroprogenitor cells;Sox9 expression generally parallels that ofCol2a1 even in some non-chondrocytic cells and increases together with that of Col2a1 when frank chondrocyte differentiation takes place (5Zhao Q. Eberspaecher H. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 18Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T.

Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The expression ofSox9 in gonadal ridges and later in the Sertoli cells of the testis presumably accounts for the sex reversal in CD patients (20da Silva S.M. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 62-68Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar,21Kent J. Wheatley S.C. Andrews J.E. Sinclair A.H. Koopman P. Development. 1996; 122: 2813-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the abnormal skeletal manifestations of CD patients and the pattern of expression of Sox9 during embryonic development suggest that Sox9 plays an important role in the pathway of chondrocyte differentiation. Recent experiments showed that the 48-bp Col2a1 element that confers chondrocyte specificity in transgenic mice is a direct target for Sox9. Indeed, Sox9 was able to bind to a sequence in this element that is essential for chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity, and SOX9 activated this element in cotransfection experiments of nonchondrocytic cells (22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of SOX9 in transgenic mouse embryos resulted in the activation of the endogenousCol2a1 gene in some but not all areas of ectopic SOX9 expression (23Bell D.M. Leung K.K.H. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Although four tandem copies of the 48-bp Col2a1 sequence and 12 tandem copies of an 18-bp element within this 48-bp sequence both acted as strong chondrocyte-specific enhancers in transient expression experiments, 12 tandem copies of the 18-bp element showed much weaker activity in cartilages of the transgenic mice than did the four tandem copies of the 48-bp enhancer (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the reporter gene in embryos harboring the multimerized 18-bp construct was also detected at low levels in skin and brain (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to confer high level chondrocyte-specific reporter gene expression in vivo , the entire 48-bp Col2a1 intronic fragment appeared to be needed. Although the 18-bp enhancer sequence included the SOX9-binding site of the 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer and was a strong target for SOX9 in transfection experiments (22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the above-mentioned transgenic mice results were consistent with the hypothesis that, to confer chondrocyte specificity in vivo , proteins other than Sox9 might be needed that interact with the 48-bp but not with the 18-bp enhancer sequence. The expression of Sox9 at high levels in Sertoli cells also favors the hypothesis that additional proteins are needed to differentiate the phenotype of chondrocytes from that of Sertoli cells (20da Silva S.M. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 62-68Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 21Kent J. Wheatley S.C. Andrews J.E. Sinclair A.H. Koopman P. Development. 1996; 122: 2813-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the purpose of the present study was to further identify sequences in the Col2a1 48-bp enhancer essential for its chondrocyte-specific activity and to determine whether chondrocyte-specific nuclear proteins bound to these sequences. Our results indicate that the 48-bp sequence in Col2a1 contains multiple cis -acting elements essential for chondrocyte-specific expression in vivo and that chondrocytes contain specific nuclear protein(s) in addition to SOX9 that bind to these cis -acting elements and might therefore be involved in chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity. All cell types were obtained as described previously and cultured under standard conditions (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S.

To generate i(8 × 48)pgloblacZ , eight tandem copies of the 48-bp enhancer Col2a1 element were cloned upstream of a minimal human β-globin promoter (−44 to +28) in the reporter plasmid placF, as described previously for other constructs (25Zhou G.

The 48-bp mutant intron 1 fragments (see Fig. 4 A ) were synthesized as double-stranded oligonucleotides containingBam HI- and Bgl II-cleaved sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. These oligonucleotides were cloned and multimerized in tandem as described previously for the wild-type 48-bp construct (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H.

Tetramers were cloned in either the p309Col2a1-βgeo vector or the p89Col2a1-luc vector as described previously (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p309Col2a1-βgeo vector contained a 309-bp Col2a1 promoter and the SA-βgeo-bpA cassette (25Zhou G. Garofalo S. Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Smith C.N. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3677-3684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant 468-bpCol2a1 intron 1 fragment (+1878 to +2345) was generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in the p309Col2a1-βgeo vector as described for the wild-type element (25Zhou G.

The sequences of all DNA fragments generated either with oligonucleotides or by polymerase chain reaction were verified by DNA sequencing. DNA transfections were performed by the modified DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (26Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Monolayers of RCS cells pre-established in 20-cm2dishes were cotransfected with 7.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids and 2.5 μg of pSV2βgal plasmid used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cell extracts were prepared 40–48 h after the start of transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z.

Transgenic founder embryos were sacrificed at 14.5 days postcoitum (dpc). Southern blot analysis, staining with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside), and histological analysis were performed as described previously (25Zhou G. Garofalo S. Mukhopadhyay K.

Nuclear extracts from all cell types were prepared as described previously (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol.

The wild-type and mutant 48-bp Col2a1 double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared as described above under “DNA Constructs.” Berenil and distamycin were purchased from Sigma. The OCT and HMG probes were prepared as described previously (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell.

All probes were end-labeled with [α-32P]dGTP or [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment. Protein-DNA binding reactions were carried out as described previously (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K.

Assays with nuclear extracts were performed with 10 μg of protein and 2 μg of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC). SOX9 synthesized in vitro was assayed in the presence of 0.1 μg of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC). Supershift experiments were performed with purified SOX9 antibodies as described previously (22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell.

RCS cell nuclear extracts were partially purified by passage through a DNA affinity column containing an R2 oligonucleotide containing an 18-bpCol2a1 enhancer sequence (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G.

The flow-through, which contained CSEP activity, was concentrated 10 times by precipitation with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation) and then subjected to 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions. Protein elution from gel slices and renaturation were performed as described (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 10-μl eluates were used in EMSA. We showed previously that a 48-bp sequence of intron 1 in the Col2a1 gene together with a 309-bpCol2a1 promoter conferred strict chondrocyte-specific expression in transgenic mice (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate further whether the 48-bp Col2a1 sequence by itself contained all thecis -acting elements needed for chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity in intact mouse embryos, we generated a transgenei(8 × 48)pgloblacZ in which eight tandem repeats of the 48-bp enhancer fragment were cloned upstream of a minimal human β-globin promoter (Fig.1 A ). Two of the five transgenic 14.5-dpc founder embryos harboring i(8 × 48)pgloblacZ stained positive for X-gal, a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase, whereas the other three did not. Moreover, the X-gal-positive embryos harboringi(8 × 48)pgloblacZ exhibited cartilage-specific staining similar to that seen at the same developmental stage (Fig. 1 B ) in embryos harboring transgenep309i(4 × 48)Col2a1, in which the same 48-bp fragment was driving a 309-bp Col2a1 promoter (Fig.6 B ). X-Gal staining was observed in the cartilages of the head, scapula, vertebrae, ribs, limbs, and shoulder and pelvic girdles. Histological analysis showed that X-gal staining was present in chondrocytes only; no promiscuous X-gal staining was detected in any nonchondrogenic tissues (examples are shown in Fig. 1, C andD ). Hence, these experiments demonstrated that in transgenic embryos the sequence of the 48-bp Col2a1 intron 1 element contained the essential elements required to target the activity of a minimal heterologous promoter specifically to chondrocytes.Figure 6Abolition of chondrocyte-specific expression in transgenic mouse embryos by mutations in the 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer element. A , schematic representation of the transgenes. Four tandem copies of wild-type (WT ) or mutant 48-bp elements (MA1 to MA7 , as shown in Fig. 4 A ) were cloned in the p309Col2a1-βgeo vector (25Zhou G. Garofalo S. Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Smith C.N. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3677-3684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p309Col2a1-βgeo vector contains the 309-bp Col2a1 promoter, exon 1 (+1 to +237) in which the translation start sequence has been mutated from ATG to CTG, and 5′ part of intron 1 (+238 to +308). The Col2a1 enhancer elements were inserted between +308 and the SA-βgeo-bpA cassette; this cassette includes a splice acceptor (SA ), theβgeo gene, which encodes a fusion protein withEscherichia coli β-galactosidase and neomycin resistance activities, and the bovine growth hormone gene polyadenylation signal (bpA).

Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the 48-bp Col2a1 element, which includes the 18-bp sequence, confers a much stricter chondrocyte specificity in transgenic embryos than does the 18-bp element, the 48-bp Col2a1 element was used as a probe in EMSA experiments to (a ) identify in chondrocytes unique nuclear factors that would specifically bind to the 48-bp enhancer and (b ) locate the DNA-binding sites for these factors. Formation of a major complex with the 48-bp enhancer probe was observed in reactions using extracts from primary chondrocytes and from two chondrocytic cell lines (MC615 and RCS cells) (Fig.2). This complex was absent in reactions with extracts from fibroblastic cell lines (10T1/2 and Balb/3T3) and all other nonchondrogenic cell lines tested. The protein (or proteins) forming the major complex was tentatively named CSEP forchondrocyte-specificenhancer-binding proteins. Interestingly, SOX9 synthesized in vitro formed a major complex with the 48-bp probe (Fig.3 A, lane 1 ) whose mobility was similar to that of the complex formed between the 18-bp probe and Sox9 present in crude chondrocyte extracts (22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet no complex with a similar mobility could be seen when the same chondrocyte extracts were incubated with the 48-bp probe under similar EMSA conditions (Fig.3 A, lane 2 ). The CSEP·DNA complex migrated more slowly than the major complex formed between SOX9 made in vitro and the 48-bp probe; a second complex that often formed between SOX9 synthesized in vitro and the 48-bp probe migrated at the trailing edge of the CSEP·DNA complex. To test whether Sox9 was part of the CSEP complex, we performed supershift experiments with SOX9 antibodies (22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies were able to completely supershift the major complexes and the second complexes formed between the 48-bp probe and SOX9 made in vitro (data not shown) as well as the complex between the 18-bp probe and Sox9 present in RCS cell nuclear extracts (22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When chondrocyte nuclear extracts were incubated with the 48-bp probe, we observed the formation of a supershift complex with SOX9 antibodies, but despite extensive efforts, the CSEP·DNA complex was always either unaffected or only slightly weaker than in control reactions without antibodies (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and4 ). We concluded that Sox9 could be part of the CSEP complex and hypothesized that CSEP might contain one or more other proteins. Efficient formation of a complex between CSEP and the 48-bp probe was seen in EMSA in which poly(dG-dC) was used as nonspecific competitor but not when poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC) was used (data not shown). Since poly(dI-dC) mimics A-T pairs in the minor but not the major groove of DNA (27Dailey L. Yuan H. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 14: 7758-7769Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28van de Wetering M. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3039-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), these data suggested that CSEP might interact with A-T pairs in the minor groove of the 48-bp probe. In support of this possibility, two A-T pair-selective minor groove DNA ligands distamycin or berenil (diminazene aceturate) (29French S.W. Schmidt M.C. Glorioso J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 5393-5399Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Wegner M. Grummt F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) inhibited CSEP binding to the 48-bp probe at concentrations as low as 1 μm (Fig. 3 B ). In control experiments (data not shown), concentrations of 1 μm distamycin and berenil had no effect on the binding to the 18-bp Col2a1 enhancer element of three POU-domain proteins (Oct-1, Brain-1, and Brain-2) previously identified in RCS cell nuclear extracts (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and known to bind DNA mainly in the major groove (31Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). HMG domain proteins are known to contact A-T pairs in the minor groove of the DNA helix, and their binding to DNA can be blocked by distamycin and berenil (29French S.W. Schmidt M.C. Glorioso J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 5393-5399Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Wegner M. Grummt F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This suggested, therefore, that the CSEP complex could involve HMG-like proteins. To test this hypothesis, we performed EMSA competition experiments between the 48-bp enhancer probe and an oligonucleotide containing a consensus heptamer-binding site for HMG domain proteins (HMG oligonucleotides) (22Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Harley V.R. Jackson D.I. Hextall P.J. Hawkins J.R. Berkovitz G.D. Sockanathan S. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Science. 1992; 255: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The HMG oligonucleotide competed about 10 times more efficiently than did the 48-bp element for the formation of a complex with CSEP (Fig.3 C ). In a control experiment, a 300-fold excess of a consensus octamer-binding site for POU domain proteins (6Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to compete with the labeled 48-bp probe for the formation of a complex with CSEP. To test whether other HMG-like proteins, in addition to Sox9, could be involved in CSEP·48-bp probe complex formation, we performed direct binding assays with the HMG probe (Fig. 3 D, lanes 2–11 ).

One asexual blood stage vaccine candidate, apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) of merozoite rhoptries has been shown to be the target of inhibitory, protective antibodies in both in vitro andin vivo studies. We have investigated heterologous (trans-species) expression of the human malaria Plasmodium falciparum AMA-1 (PF83/AMA-1) in the rodent parasitePlasmodium berghei . Transfected P. berghei expressed correctly folded and processed PF83/AMA-1 under control of both pb66/ama-1 and dhfr-ts promoters. Timing of expression was highly promoter-dependent and was critical for subsequent subcellular localization. Under control ofpb66/ama-1 , PF83/AMA-1 expression and localization inP. berghei was limited to the rhoptries of mature schizonts, similar to that observed for PF83/AMA-1 in P. falciparum . In contrast the dhfr-ts promoter permitted PF83/AMA-1 expression throughout schizogony as well as in gametocytes and gametes. Localization was aberrant and included direct expression at the merozoite and gamete surface. Processing from the full-length 83-kDa protein to a 66-kDa protein was observed not only in schizonts but also in gametocytes, indicating that processing could be mediated outside of rhoptries by a common protease. Trans-species expressed PF83/AMA-1 was highly immunogenic in mice, resulting in a response against a functionally critical domain of the molecule.

The protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a causative agent of malaria, one of the major human infectious diseases. In the search for new methods to combat the disease, the advent of transfection technology for Plasmodium species is critical, because it offers the opportunity to relate genotype to phenotype, and this will permit a more rational design of vaccines and drugs.

Deans J.D. Mitchell G.H. Alderson T. Cohen S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Expression and post-translational N-terminal proteolytic cleavage of AMA-1 are restricted to the final stages of schizogony (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem.

Here we report for the first time in a malaria parasite the development of drug-selectable trans-species expression of a second gene (in addition to the selectable marker) and its use to investigate the role of the promoter on subcellular localization of the trans-species expressed protein. P. falciparum AMA-1 (PF83/AMA-1) expression in the rodent malaria Plasmodium berghei was driven by the stage-specific P. berghei AMA-1 promoter (pb66/ama-1 ) or the more constitutive P. berghei dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) promoter. The type of promoter control determined the timing and subsequent subcellular localization of PF83/AMA-1, which markedly differed between the two promoters. In addition, the trans-species expressed protein proved to be highly immunogenic in mice, resulting in antibodies to a critical functional determinant of PF83/AMA-1.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Electroporated parasites (2 × 108) were injected intravenously into phenylhydrazine-treated naive Wistar rats, and pyrimethamine treatment was begun (1van Dijk M.R. Waters A.P. Janse C.J.

Parasites for analyses detailed below were derived from Swiss mice that had been infected with cryopreserved parasites and maintained under pyrimethamine pressure. Leukocytes were removed from infected blood (Plasmodipur, Eurodiagnostica, Apeldoorn, The Netherlands) that was then either used directly or cultured for a further 12–24 h in an atmosphere of 5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2 (21Janse C.J.

Parasite DNA and RNA was isolated (Gentra Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blots following reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Phast-system, 10–15% gradient gel, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) used parasite stages that had been enriched by Nycodenz centrifugation (21Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 11: 138-143Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. For purification of gametocytes, rats were infected with 108 in vitro matured, Nycodenz-purified schizont-infected red cells isolated from an infected rat at 1% parasitemia. 27 h after infection rats were bled, and gametocytes were Nycodenz purified (21Janse C.J.

The pan-specific AMA-1 rat mAb 28G2dc1 recognizes a linear determinant at the highly conserved C terminus and immunoprecipitates both the full-length 83-kDa and processed 66-kDa forms of PF83/AMA-1; rat mAb 58F8dc1 recognizes a linear determinant in the N-terminal region and only immunoprecipitates the 83-kDa form (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Additional mAbs were developed from rats that had been immunized with recombinant PF83/AMA-1 (22Narum D.L. Welling G.W. Thomas A.W. J.

Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For in vitro inhibition of invasion assays, purified IgG was incubated in triplicate with schizont-infected red blood cells at a parasitemia of 0.04% to 0.1% in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in a total volume of 100 μl (1.0–1.5% hematocrit) (T 0h). After two cycles of invasion (T 65h), 25 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% human serum, and [3H]hypoxanthine (Amersham International, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands) was added to each well to yield a final concentration of 20 μCi ml−1. Parasites were harvested (T 87h) onto glass fiber filters using a Skatron cell harvester (Suffolk, UK), and [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Parasite growth inhibition, reported as a percentage, was determined as follows: ((mean cpmcontrol − mean cpmexperimental)/mean cpmcontrol) × 100. The cpm for red blood cells alone was subtracted from all averages prior to determining the percentage of inhibition. All analyses of statistical significance were performed by Student's t test. Methanol-fixed thin films were prepared and used for IFA as described previously (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and in some experiments mAbs that had been directly succinamide-conjugated with fluorophores (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Slides were mounted in anti-fade (5% (w/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2 octane], 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 90% glycerol) to which 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (23Hyman B.C. Macinnis A.J. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 1.9 μm was added. Photographs were taken with a Photometrics CH250 cooled CCD camera mounted on a Leica DMRXA microscope. Digital images that were generated were all treated identically. IFA on fresh unfixed gametes was performed with a mixture of 28G2dc1, 58F8dc1, and 4G2dc1 mAb culture supernatants on homogenized mid-guts of Anopheles stephensi at various times after they had fed on infected Swiss mice (24Mons B. Boorsma E.G. van der Kaay H.J. Ann. Soc. Belge Med. Trop. 1985; 65: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy was performed on gametocytes and schizonts transfected with PF83/AMA-1 expressed under the P. berghei dhfr-ts promoter. Cells harvested as for IFA were fixed (20 min on ice in 0.1% (v/v) double-distilled glutaraldehyde in RPMI), washed four times in fresh ice-cold RPMI, then dehydrated in a series of ethanols cooled progressively from 0 to −20 °C, infiltrated with LR White Resin overnight, and polymerized at room temperature under indirect ultraviolet light for 48 h (25Bannister L.H.

Sectioned material was stained using mAb 58F8dc1 at 25 μg ml−1 and secondary goat anti-rat antibodies labeled with 10-nm gold. Grids were post-stained for 2 min in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Controls were parasites transfected with pf83/ama-1 ORF in the reverse orientation. ELISA plates (Greiner, Labortechnik, Solingen, Germany) were coated overnight at +4 °C with 100 ng ml−1 PF83-7G8-1 (22Narum D.L. Welling G.W. Thomas A.W. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 657: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline/0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. Dilutions of mouse sera in antibody buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0) were tested in triplicate, and bound IgG was detected by goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase as described previously (26Thomas A.W. Trape J.-F. Rogier C. Goncalves A. Rosario V.E. Narum D.L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1994; 51: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ELISA plates were prepared as above. Rat mAb 4G2dc1 was coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich N.V./S.A., Bornem, Belgium) (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 321-358Google Scholar). Duplicate mouse sera (diluted 1:100) and mAb 4G2dc1 (30 μg ml−1) in an optimized concentration of alkaline phosphatase coupled 4G2dc1 in antibody buffer were incubated in wells coated with PF83-7G8-1 (90 min, 37 °C). The plates were washed, substrate was added (2 h), and theA 405 was determined. Inhibition of 4G2dc1 binding was calculated using the average OD reading for each group of mice relative to the average OD reading for a pool of normal Swiss mouse serum. To assess specific antibody production in animals infected with transfected parasites, infected mice received regular pyrimethamine treatment to maintain plasmids in the parasite population. Parasitemia was controlled when it reached 1% by sulfadiazine treatment (10 mg/liter drinking water) for 2–4 days (28Eling W.M.C. Jerusalem C.R. Tropenmed. Parasitol. 1977; 28: 158-165PubMed Google Scholar) until parasites were barely detectable by Giemsa thin film. Mice were chloroquine-treated after 5 weeks to kill all remaining parasites and allow recovery and were reinfected with the same transfected parasites 3 weeks later (2 × 107 schizonts/mouse intraperitoneally). To counteract bone marrow suppression induced by pyrimethamine, these mice received folinic acid intraperitoneally once per week (400 μg/kg). The rodent malaria P. berghei was transfected with constructs that were designed to express PF83/AMA-1 controlled by two different promoters. The selection cassette was based on the ability to confer resistance to pyrimethamine, and for this an engineered T. gondii dhfr-ts gene was chosen because of its high resistance levels and the reduced likelihood of unwanted homologous integration (3van der Wel A.M. Tomás A.M. Kocken C.H.M. Malhotra P. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Thomas A.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To allow easier manipulation of the selection cassette T. gondii dhfr-ts was mutagenized to remove Eco RI andKpn I sites. This mutant T. gondii dhfr-ts was flanked by P. berghei dhfr-ts control regions. In addition to the selectable marker cassette, vectors pDB.DTm.DB./AB.AF.DB. (Fig. 1 A ) and pDB.DTm.DB./DB.AF.DB. (Fig. 1 B ) respectively employed the pb66/ama-1 promoter or the P. berghei dhfr-ts promoter to control PF83/AMA-1 expression. Transfection of P. berghei schizont-infected red blood cells with these constructs yielded pyrimethamine-resistant parasites. Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction, and plasmid rescue analyses showed that these parasites contained the T. gondii dhfr-ts gene, indicating that theT. gondii DHFR-TS is active in P. berghei and that the mutagenesis of T. gondii dhfr-ts had no detrimental effects on DHFR-TS expression (data not shown). Pyrimethamine-resistant transgenic P. berghei parasite populations obtained from mice were matured in vitro and analyzed for the presence of the AMA-1 protein of the human malariaP. falciparum. IFA with mAb 58F8dc1 specific for the N-terminal region of PF83/AMA-1 reacted strongly with recombinantP. berghei but not with control P. berghei parasites, indicating that PF83/AMA-1 was expressed. Northern blots of total RNA isolated from 1 × 107 rings, schizonts, or gametocytes and probed with pf83/ama-1 showed high levels of a 2.3-kb mRNA in schizonts and gametocytes of parasites transfected with the construct containing the P. berghei dhfr-ts promoter, whereas under control of the pb66/ama-1 promoter, transcription was only observed in schizonts (Fig.2 A , lanes 2 ,3 , and 5 ). The weak hybridization signal inlane 9 (gametocytes transfected with the pb66 promoter construct) can be accounted for by slight contamination of this preparation with mature schizonts (verified in Giemsa-stained thin films). No transcripts were detected in ring stage parasites nor in parasites transfected with pf83/ama-1 in the reverse orientation. Hybridization of these Northerns with a T. gondii dhfr-ts probe showed transcription of the selectable marker gene in all schizont and gametocyte lanes but not in the lanes from ring stage parasites. Western blot analysis using a pan-specific mAb (28G2dc1) that reacts with a linear determinant present in all Plasmodium AMA-1 molecules identified to date revealed expression of PF83/AMA-1 as a full-length 83-kDa protein in mature schizonts. No expression was detected in ring stage parasites, irrespective of the promoter used to drive expression (Fig. 2 B , lanes 2 and5 ). In addition, expression controlled by thedhfr-ts promoter was detected in gametocytes (Fig.2 B , lane 3 ). Analogous to the situation inP. falciparum (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), N-terminal proteolytic processing to a form of approximately 66 kDa was observed (Fig. 2 B ,lanes 2 and 5 ). This processed form migrated as the slightly larger molecule in a 66-kDa doublet, the other component of which was authentic P. berghei AMA-1, which was also reactive with mAb 28G2dc1 (Fig. 2 B , lanes 2 ,5 , and 8 ). As expected authentic P. berghei AMA-1 expression was restricted to schizonts. Confirmation of this expression profile for full-length PF83/AMA-1 expression was obtained through reactivity of the 83-kDa AMA-1 with the N-terminal mAb 58F8dc1, which does not react with P. berghei AMA-1 (data not shown). Interestingly,P. berghei gametocytes that express PF83/AMA-1 under control of P. berghei dhfr-ts also showed processing to the 66-kDa form (Fig. 2 B , lane 3 ). No PF83/AMA-1 expression was evident when P. berghei was transfected with constructs containing pf83/ama-1 in the reverse orientation (Fig.2 B , lanes 7 , 8 , and 9 ). The weak 66-kDa signal in the gametocyte lanes 6 and 9 can be accounted for by minor contamination of the gametocyte preparations with mature schizonts. AMA-1 contains multiple disulfide links (29Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Matthew M.L.S.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Anders R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29446-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) that generate species-specific epitopes that are critical to vaccine efficacy (11Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Crewther P.E. Matthew M.L.S.M. Flegg R.H. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protein function (30Deans J.A. Jean W.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 26: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rat mAbs capable of blocking P. falciparum AMA-1 function were selected from a panel of mAbs characterized by recognition of reduction-sensitive, native, parasite determinants present on both full-length and processed PF83/AMA-1. Thus all mAbs in this panel immunoprecipitated both full-length (83-kDa) and processed (66-kDa) forms of PF83/AMA-1 from Triton X-100 extracts of metabolically radiolabeled P. falciparum schizonts but were not reactive with Western blots ofP. falciparum schizonts. One of these mAbs, 4G2dc1 (IgG2a) consistently inhibited asexual P. falciparum multiplicationin vitro (by 60–70% compared with control mAbs of the same isotype). This mAb reacted by IFA with all ten P. falciparum strains of diverse geographical origin analyzed to date. Critically, 4G2dc1 also recognized transfected P. berghei parasites by IFA when PF83/AMA-1 was expressed under both pb66 andpb-dhfr promoter control. A more detailed analysis of PF83/AMA-1 protein expression in transgenicP. berghei was performed by IFA with mAb 4G2dc1. Parasites transfected with pDB.DTm.DB./AB.AF.DB., using the pb66/ama-1 promoter to control PF83/AMA-1 expression, expressed PF83/AMA-1 only in maturing schizonts with six or more nuclei (Fig. 3 A ). In contrast, in parasites obtained after transfection with pDB.DTm.DB./DB.AF.DB., using the dhfr-ts promoter to control expression, PF83/AMA-1 was initially observed in maturing trophozoites and during onset of schizogony and could be detected throughout schizont development (Fig.3 B ). PF83/AMA-1 expression in native conformation was also evident in gametocytes of both sexes when under control of thedhfr-ts promoter (Fig. 3 C ). IFA analysis of activated gametes in homogenized mosquito mid-gut revealed PF83/AMA-1 expression 1 h after a blood meal but not 24 h after feeding of the mosquitoes (data not shown). Parasites obtained after transfection with the construct containing the pb66/ama-1 promoter consistently failed to show expression of PF83/AMA-1 in gametocytes and gametes (data not shown). Quantitation of PF83/AMA-1 expression under control of the pb66/ama-1 promoter by counting fluorescence patterns in 1000 free merozoites yielded PF83/AMA-1 localization entirely to the apex of 95% of the merozoites (Fig. 3 D ). In contrast, expression under control of thedhfr-ts promoter yielded in 85% of the merozoites a strong circumferential and cytoplasmic staining in addition to occasional weak apical staining (Fig. 3 E ). This difference in localization is already evident in maturing schizonts (Fig. 3, A andB ), where the protein when expressed under ama-1 promoter control is apparently associated with developing organelles, whereas under dhfr promoter control, a much more diffuse localization is evident. Immunoelectron microscopy analysis of expression under thedhfr-ts promoter shows that PF83/AMA-1 is distributed patchily in the cytoplasm of merozoites, and in some rhoptries, it localizes to the rhoptry body but is not found in micronemes or dense granules (Fig. 3 F ). In maturing gametocytes the protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum network (not shown). IFA analyses of gametes performed on unfixed material 1 h after mosquito feeding revealed PF83/AMA-1 expression at the gamete surface. To determine whether P. berghei parasites that expressed PF83/AMA-1 could induce an immune response against PF83/AMA-1, two groups of Swiss mice were infected with P. berghei transfected either with mixed pDB.DTm.DB./DB.AF.DB. and pDB.DTm.DB./AB.AF.DB. (forward pf83/ama-1 ) or with mixed pDB.DTm.DB./DB.α AF.DB. and pDB.DTm.DB./AB.α AF.DB. (reverse pf83/ama-1 ). Sulfadiazine modulation of parasite growth was used to permit two sequential peaks of parasitemia of approximately 1% (28Eling W.M.C. Jerusalem C.R. Tropenmed. Parasitol. 1977; 28: 158-165PubMed Google Scholar). Parasitemia peaks were observed at the end of the first week after infection and at the beginning of the third week after infection. A second infection was given in week 9. Expression of PF83/AMA-1 was monitored by IFA on parasites that were obtained from infected mice and matured (18 h)in vitro and was evident throughout the experiment. Antibodies reactive with PF83/AMA-1 were already detected at week 4 as determined by ELISA on pooled sera (end point titer 1:20,000; data not shown), and by week 11 antibody titers were >1:100,000 (Fig.4), whereas in the control group titers of approximately 1:10,000 were observed. This control group reactivity can be explained by cross-reactive antibodies induced by P. berghei AMA-1. To unequivocally demonstrate the appearance of PF83/AMA-1 specific reactivity and determine whether the functional epitope defined by mAb 4G2dc1 was recognized, a competition ELISA was performed. Only antibodies of mice immunized with transfected P. berghei parasites that were expressing PF83/AMA-1 effectively competed with mAb 4G2dc1 (Fig. 4), demonstrating that components of the immune response were directed against a critical functional epitope of PF83/AMA-1. The development of transgene expression systems for malaria will allow detailed study of parasite cell biology. Mechanisms underlying drug resistance, protein trafficking, and molecular function can be explored in greater depth than previously possible, and manipulation of parasite phenotype for evaluation of attenuated vaccines, for example toward higher immunogenicity and lower pathogenicity, becomes feasible. Here we report on the first studies of trans-species expression of a human malaria vaccine candidate antigen and show (i) that the protein is expressed in a conformationally and functionally relevant form, (ii) that depending on the time of expression it is differentially routed within the developing parasite, and (iii) that it is highly immunogenic within the context of a rodent malaria parasite. These studies employed an asexual blood stage vaccine candidate, AMA-1, a single copy gene that has a well defined, tightly controlled, stage-specific expression pattern (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Crewther P.E. Culvenor J.G. Silva A. Cooper J.A. Anders R.F. Exp.

Parasitol. 1993; 57: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and contains targeting signals for the rhoptries, organelles involved in red cell invasion. Vaccine experiments to date have shown that deletion mutants of AMA-1 are not induced under immune pressure (15Collins W.E. Pye D. Crewther P.E. Vandenberg K.L. Galland G.G. Sulzer A.J. Kemp D.J. Edwards S.J. Coppel R.L. Sullivan J.S. Morris C.L. Anders R.F. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1994; 51: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Deans J.A. Knight A.M. Jean W.C. Waters A.P. Cohen S. Mitchell G.H. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1988; 10: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), indicating it is an essential molecule. As a prelude to AMA-1 knockout experiments, which we expect to be lethal because the parasite genome during asexual phase development is haploid, we have developed trans-species complementation capabilities for this molecule. In this study two promoters controlled PF83/AMA-1 expression, the authentic P. berghei ama-1 promoter, and the P. berghei dhfr-ts promoter. Both promoters induced expression of conformationally intact, full-length PF83/AMA-1. However, the time of appearance and the subcellular distribution of the protein were substantially different. PF83/AMA-1 conformation was assessed by reactivity with a mAb (4G2dc1) that inhibited P. falciparum invasion of erythrocytes in vitro . This mAb is reactive with an invariant, reduction-sensitive conformational and functional epitope and provides a new tool to assess the correct conformation of P. falciparum AMA-1 molecules. Trans-species PF83/AMA-1 expression under control of thepb66/ama-1 promoter was analogous to authentic PF83/AMA-1 expression in P. falciparum (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), restricted to schizonts with six or more nuclei. This demonstrates that the 1.5 kb of thepb66/ama-1 upstream region present in the expression construct contains sufficient information to drive stage-specific expression of PF83/AMA-1. Under P. berghei dhfr-ts promoter control, PF83/AMA-1 was expressed throughout schizogony as well as in gametocytes, coordinated with DHFR-TS expression from the genomic copy (32van Dijk M.R. Vinkenoog R. Ramesar J. Vervenne R.A.W. Waters A.P. Janse C.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in developmental stages where DNA synthesis is ongoing. Although, because eight male gametes are produced from each microgametocyte, it was not surprising that under dhfr-ts promoter control PF83/AMA-1 was expressed in male gametocytes, approximately 30% of PF83/AMA-1-expressing gametocytes were female. It remains to be determined whether these results indicate that DHFR-TS is also normally synthesized in female gametocytes (perhaps in preparation for post-fertilization DNA synthesis) or whether the dhfr-ts driven expression observed is a consequence of loss of transcriptional control because of incomplete 5′ elements or loss of chromosomal positioning. Despite prolonged exposure we found no evidence fordhfr-ts mRNA transcripts in ring stages, in contrast to a previous report (32van Dijk M.R. Vinkenoog R. Ramesar J. Vervenne R.A.W. Waters A.P. Janse C.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The timing of expression markedly influenced the subcellular localization of PF83/AMA-1. When expressed under the ama-1 promoter, the protein is routed to the rhoptries, as is authentic AMA-1 (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Crewther P.E. Culvenor J.G. Silva A. Cooper J.A. Anders R.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 70: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Thomas A.W. Bannister L.H. Waters A.P. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1990; 12: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression controlled by thedhfr-ts promoter during the onset of schizogony, when rhoptries are absent, as well as in gametes that do not contain rhoptries, results in targeting to the parasite surface as well as in a cytoplasmic localization, as is evident from both IFA and immunoelectron microscopy data. When rhoptries are being formed,dhfr-ts -controlled PF83/AMA-1 is also routed to the rhoptries but is notably localized to the rhoptry body (Fig.3 F ) rather than authentically localized in the rhoptry neck (14Crewther P.E. Culvenor J.G. Silva A. Cooper J.A. Anders R.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 70: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). At this stage cytoplasmic localization is also detected, but the fate of this cytoplasmically localized protein is not yet clear. Additional immunoelectron microscopy studies are currently being performed to more closely define the localization of authentic and trans-species expressed AMA-1 in relation to the promoter used to drive expression. Exchanging putative signal and targeting sequences in future transfection experiments will start to unravel the trafficking of rhoptry and other organellar proteins to their final destination. Proteolytic processing of PF83/AMA-1 from an 83- to a 66-kDa form occurred both in schizonts and in gametocytes, suggesting that the processing is mediated by a common parasite protease that is not restricted to the rhoptry. This processing event does not occur inP. berghei AMA-1 because it is synthesized de novo as a 66-kDa molecule, as are all other AMA-1 forms reported to date. This extra N-terminal region, present only in P. falciparum, is of unknown function, but its cleavage seems to be associated with capacity for merozoite invasion of red cells (13Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although there are significant obstacles to the development of vaccines based on the malaria parasite itself, it is possible that effective vaccines may ultimately be based upon attenuated parasites or upon nonpathogenic species that are genetically modified to carry heterologous target proteins. To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF83/AMA-1 expressed in the context of a P. berghei infection, mice were chronically infected with transgenic P. berghei parasites. The observed responses and the fine specificity thereof demonstrate that trans-species expression of the human P. falciparum antigen PF83/AMA-1 in P. berghei can elicit a strong immune response directed against a functionally important region of this molecule. Given the protection induced in primate models after AMA-1 vaccination (15Collins W.E. Pye D. Crewther P.E. Vandenberg K.L. Galland G.G. Sulzer A.J. Kemp D.J. Edwards S.J. Coppel R.L. Sullivan J.S.

(Oxf.). 1988; 10: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to evaluate whether trans-species expression can provide protection against a challenge with a heterologous parasite species. This is not possible in the system described here because rodents are not susceptible to infection with P. falciparum . However, as a prelude to such studies in other systems we have recently shown that expression of AMA-1 from other primate malaria species is feasible in P. knowlesi , 2C. H. M. Kocken, A. M. van der Wel, and A. W. Thomas, unpublished observation. a parasite of relatively broad host specificity. In summary, we have demonstrated drug-selectable trans-species expression of a second gene (in addition to the selectable marker) in a malaria parasite. P. falciparum AMA-1 expression in P. berghei under control of the stage-specific P. berghei pb66/ama-1 promoter or the more constitutive P. berghei dhfr-ts promoter resulted in a timing and subsequent subcellular localization of PF83/AMA-1, which markedly differed between the two promoters. In addition, antibodies to a critical functional determinant of PF83/AMA-1 were elicited in mice, emphasizing strong immunogenicity of the trans-species expressed protein. We thank Dr. W. Eling for advice on transmission experiments, Dr. A. Kent for immunolabeling for immunoelectron microscopy, Dr. G. Barker and Dr. M. Ponzi for help in cloning the P. berghei AMA-1 promoter region, and K. de Brouwer and M. van Bokhoven for excellent technical assistance."

J., Kaplan, J., and Eide, D. (1993) Mol. Gen. Genet. 241, 542–553). Since disruption of GEF2 , a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, leads to a similar phenotype, it was previously suggested that the chloride conductance provided by Gef1p is necessary for vacuolar acidification. We now show that gef1 cells indeed grow less well at less acidic pH. However, no defect in vacuolar acidification is apparent from quinacrine staining, and Gef1p co-localizes with Mnt1p in the medial Golgi. Thus, Gef1p may be important in determining Golgi pH. Systematic alanine scanning of the amino and the carboxyl terminus revealed several regions essential for Gef1p localization and function. One sequence (FVTID) in the amino terminus conforms to a class of sorting signals containing aromatic amino acids. This was further supported by point mutations. Alanine scanning of the carboxyl terminus identified a stretch of roughly 25 amino acids which coincides with the second CBS domain, a conserved protein motif recently identified. Mutations in the first CBS domain also destroyed proper function and localization. The second CBS domain can be transplanted to the amino terminus without loss of function, but could not be replaced by the corresponding domain of the homologous mammalian channel ClC-2.

Breiderhoff, T. Friedrich, and T. J. Jentsch, unpublished data. To explain the proteinuria observed with ClC-5 mutations, it was proposed that ClC-5 operates in vesicles of the endocytotic pathway of proximal tubules (8Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 9Hebert S. Nature. 1996; 379: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Functional expression is controversial for ClC-3, ClC-Ka and -Kb, and no plasma membrane currents were detected when ClC-6 and ClC-7 were expressed in Xenopus oocytes (1Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Pusch M. Schwappach B. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 19S-25SCrossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 10Brandt S. Jentsch T.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that some CLC proteins function as chloride channels in intracellular compartments. Many intracellular organelles such as the Golgi, lysosomes, synaptic vesicles, and endosomes contain chloride channels, which have not yet been identified at the molecular level. There is some evidence that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, the cystic fibrosis chloride channel, may play a role in vesicle trafficking (11Bradbury N.A. Jilling T. Berta G. Sorscher E.J. Bridges R.J. Kirk K.L. Science. 1992; 256: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Chloride channels of intracellular organelles are thought to facilitate intravesicular acidification by providing an electric shunt for the proton ATPase. An acidic lumenal pH is not only essential for enzymatic activities in lysosomes, but also for sorting in the endocytotic pathway. The pH gradient along the exocytotic pathway may be important for the retrieval of ER proteins (12Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the sorting of secretory proteins (13Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 14Sakaguchi T. Leser G.P. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 733-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the retrieval of certain TGN proteins from the cell surface requires endosomal acidification (15Chapman R.E. Munro S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In yeast, a genetic screen for an iron-suppressible petite phenotype identified a CLC gene dubbed GEF1 (forglycerol/ethanol Fe-requiring, (16Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); to comply with the CLC nomenclature, we have also called this gene ScCLC (17Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B. Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33632-33638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). Among four recently cloned plant CLCs fromArabidopsis , one could rescue the growth phenotype ofgef1 strains on low iron medium (17Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B. Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33632-33638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly,GEF2 , whose null mutation has a similar phenotype, encodes a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (16Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Eide D.J. Bridgham J.T. Zhao Z. Mattoon J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The strong homology of the GEF1 gene to CLC chloride channel genes suggests that its gene product might provide an electrical shunt for the H+-ATPase, thereby facilitating the acidification of a common compartment. Greene et al. (16Greene J.R. Brown N.H. DiDomenico B.J. Kaplan J. Eide D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) hypothesized that this mechanism may be relevant to the vacuole which is involved in iron storage in yeast (19Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We now show that Gef1p resides in the Golgi. Cytosolic NH2and COOH termini of the protein were subjected to alanine scanning mutagenesis. It revealed a 5-amino acid motif in the NH2terminus that is essential for proper function. In the COOH terminus, mutating a larger domain conserved in all eukaryotic CLC homologues caused mislocalization of the mutant proteins which no longer complemented the gef1 phenotype. Growth assays on titrated media revealed an increased sensitivity of gef1 cells toward neutral pH. These results are compatible with a role for the putative chloride channel Gef1p in compartmental acidification of the Golgi apparatus. Standard yeast media and genetic manipulations were as described (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 13.0.1-13.12.3Google Scholar). LIM50 low iron selection medium was prepared as described (21Eide D. Guarente L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pH-adjusted media for plates were titrated with free Tris base resulting in a Tris concentration between ≈1 mm for pH 5.5 and ≈6 mm for pH 6.5. Bromcresol purple (30 μg/ml) was added to these plates as a pH indicator. Methionine was generally omitted from the media to allow for maximal expression from plasmids pDR46 and p416MET25 (see below). TheGEF1 gene disruption was introduced into the strains K700α (Matα, HMLa, HMBα, ho, ade2-1, trp1-1, can1-100, leu2-3, 2-112, his3-11, 3-15, ura3, ssd1 ;(22Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar)) and DF5a (Mat a, lys2-801, leu2-3, 2-112, ura3-52, his3Δ200, trp1-1(am) (23Finley D. Özkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar)) by transforming the strains with a linear DNA fragment containing 375 base pairs of the 5′ and 450 base pairs of the 3′ portion of theGEF1 open reading frame with the HIS3 marker gene inserted between them. Gene disruption was verified by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction. Western blot analysis of the Gef1p GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein and corresponding ALA mutants was performed on strain GPY385 transformed with the corresponding plasmids (Mat a, leu2-3, 2-112, ura3-52, trp1-289, sst1-3, his4 or his6 pep4::LEU2 (24Berkower C. Loayza D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). All plasmids were derived from the wild-type GEF1 gene fused to the GFP cDNA (mutant S65T) via a Not I restriction site engineered in the place of theGEF1 stop codon. This construct was in pDR46, a yeast expression vector derived from pSEY8 (25Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It carries the URA3 marker gene and the MET3 promoter fragment (26Mountain H.A. Korch C. Yeast. 1991; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed by introducing windows of five alanines by polymerase chain reaction. Briefly, two fragments were amplified with primers containing the codons for the five alanines in an overlapping region and adjacent sequences that served to anchor the primer to the desired position in the GEF1 sequence. The fragments were joined by recombinant polymerase chain reaction, digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, and ligated into the backbone. Polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments and restriction sites used for ligation were sequenced. COOH-terminal domain swapping was based on aBgl II restriction site naturally occurring in rat ClC-2. ABgl II site was engineered in the same region of theGEF1 gene thereby causing the mutation M652L. The mutatedGEF1 gene behaved like wild-type in all assays. Since there is a methionine in position 653 the Bgl II site could also be used to transplant this part of the protein to the NH2terminus by ligating it to the Bam HI site of the 5′ polylinker sequence of pDR46. In these constructs the sameNot I site that was used for fusion of the GFP cDNA was used for linking the transplanted 3′ portion and the original 5′ portion of the GEF1 gene. To this end the Not I site was engineered on the original initiator ATG (actually deleting the methionine) in a way that allowed in-frame fusion of the COOH and NH2 terminus. Concatamers of different GEF1 mutants were constructed using the same Not I restriction site. Complementation of thegef1 phenotype, the inability to grow on iron-limited plates, was assayed in at least three independent transformations for each construct. The wild-type GEF1 GFP fusion construct was included in all experiments as a positive control. Equal aliquots from each transformation were spotted on synthetic complete selection plates lacking uracil and methionine as well as on LIM50 iron-limiting medium. Depending on the construct growth of all (wild type) or no (e.g. ALAN8, ALAC5, and ALAC7) transformants was observed on LIM50 medium. The evening before fluorescence microscopy a culture was inoculated from a stationary preculture in a dilution that resulted in early logarithmic growth the next day. Because formation of fluorescent GFP is more efficient at lower temperatures (27Lim C.R. Kimata Y. Oka M. Nomaguchi K. Kohno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) cultures were transferred to 4 °C for a period of 1 to 4 h. In control experiments it was ensured that this did not change the observed staining patterns. Either live cells were attached to concanavalin A-coated microscope slides (28Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) and viewed directly, or cells were fixed, the cell wall was digested with zymolyase (see “Immunostaining of Yeast Cells”), and spheroblasts were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The two treatments result in slightly different appearance of the GFP staining pattern but differences between constructs (e.g. wild-type and significantly changed localizations) were always much larger. GFP fluorescence was observed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot 1000 microscope and a FITC filter set. The styryl dye FM4-64 was used as described (28Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Basically, we looked at steady-state labeling of the vacuole. FM4-64 fluorescence was observed using the rhodamine filter set of the Zeiss Axiophot 1000 epifluorescence microscope. The fluorescence of the dye was also visible as bright orange when using the FITC filter set allowing for a direct comparison of the FM4-64-stained and the GFP-stained structures. Quinacrine staining was performed as described (29Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed and photographed using FITC optics. Cells were grown to early logarithmic phase, fixed at room temperature in freshly prepared fixative (29Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) for at least 8 h, washed in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 1.2 m sorbitol in this buffer (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The cell wall was digested with Zymolyase 100T (≈0.3 mg/ml; ICN) and spheroblasts were washed in 1.2 m sorbitol and permeabilized by a short incubation in 1% SDS in 1.2 msorbitol (29Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Subsequent staining with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (1 ng/μl, ABI), anti-Kar2 rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:5,000, a gift of M. Rose), anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (10 ng/μl, Boehringer) and affinity-purified rabbit anti-Kex2 polyclonal antibody (1:100, a gift of Robert Fuller) followed Robertset al. (29Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was a CY3- or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody raised in goat (1:1000, Jackson). Images of immunostained cells expressing GFP fusions of Gef1p and the mutants were recorded with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. 15 A 600 units of yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of TEA (7.5 g/liter triethanolamine, 0.38 g/liter EDTA, pH 8.9, supplemented with “Complete” protease inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim), and 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate). Cells were lysed by 5 × 30 s vortexing cycles with the help of glass beads. Extract of approximately 1 A 600unit was loaded per lane and resolved on a 10% SDS gel. Gels were blotted on nitrocellulose. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody and Amersham ECL reagents were used for detection. Strains to be assayed for Kar2p secretion were streaked on a plate of synthetic complete medium lacking the appropriate amino acids. Streaks were overlaid with pre-wetted nitrocellulose and incubated at 30 °C overnight. The membrane was removed, washed in distilled water, and subsequently probed by standard Western blotting techniques with an anti-Kar2p rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Chemiluminescent detection used the ECL system (Amersham). To assess the subcellular localization of Gef1p, we expressed an epitope-tagged version of the protein in K700αΔPst (gef1 ) cells. Immunofluorescence revealed multiple dot-like structures in the cytosol that were rather variable in size and number (Fig.1 A ). This pattern resembles the staining pattern observed for Golgi proteins (31Graham T.R. Seeger M. Payne G.S. MacKay V.L. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A similar pattern was observed with a construct in which the green fluorescent protein was fused to the carboxyl terminus of Gef1p (Fig.1 B ). Different expression levels (obtained by adding different concentrations of methionine to the growth medium) gave results varying only in signal intensity (data not shown). Thus, the expression pattern is unlikely to be an artifact of overexpression. Both the FLAG-tagged and the GFP-tagged constructs complemented the growth defect of gef1 strains on iron-limiting media as effectively as wild-type Gef1p, suggesting that they reach the compartment in which Gef1p is normally expressed (data not shown). The fluorescing dots did not overlap with the Nomarski-visible vacuole (Fig. 1, A and B ). To confirm a non-vacuolar localization we stained the vacuole with FM4-64 (28Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This styryl dye is endocytosed by yeast cells, and, after transiently labeling vesicles of the endocytotic pathway, it exclusively labels the vacuole. Qualitatively, gef1 cells endocytose FM4-64 as well as wild-type cells (data not shown). These experiments showed that the Gef1p-GFP fusion protein is localized in compartments distinct from the vacuole (Fig. 1 C ). In order to assess a possible defect in vacuolar acidification, K700αΔPst (gef1 ) cells were stained with quinacrine (Fig. 1 D ). Quinacrine accumulated normally in the vacuole of gef1 cells, excluding a gross defect of vacuolar acidification. The localization of Gef1p was compared with that of three marker proteins representing the early, medial, and late portion of the yeast Golgi apparatus, respectively: Emp47p, Mnt1p, and Kex2p. Emp47p is a protein with homology to intracellular lectins. It recycles between the Golgi and the ER and is found in the Golgi complex at steady state (32Schröder S. Schimmöller F. Singer-Krüger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mnt1p is a α1,2-mannosyl-transferase involved inO -glycosylation (33Häusler A. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6846-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Kex2 protease resides in a late Golgi compartment, probably the equivalent of the mammalian TGN (34Redding K. Holcomb C. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We expressed a myc -tagged version of Emp47p (35Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 201-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (180) Google Scholar) under the control of the native promoter from a CEN plasmid. GFP-tagged Gef1p was co-expressed from a CEN plasmid under the control of the MET25 promoter (36Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The two proteins were largely found in distinct structures (Fig.2 A ). However, occasional overlap was observed, especially in strongly labeled structures exceeding the average size of stained structures (white arrow in Fig. 2 A ). Mnt1p was expressed under the control of its native promoter from a high copy number plasmid. Mnt1p and Gef1p co-localized to a high degree (Fig. 2 B ). Among the three marker proteins analyzed, Mnt1p matched the distribution of Gef1p most closely. Since Golgi-retention of Mnt1p is saturable (37Chapman R.E. Munro S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4896-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the degree of co-localization may be overestimated by looking at cells that gave a good signal. Thus, it is important that co-localization was not restricted to strongly labeled structures but was also seen with small, weakly labeled structures (white arrows in Fig.2 B ). We expressed Kex2p from a CEN plasmid under the control of the TDH3 promoter, which leads to a roughly 25-fold overproduction and a partial saturation of its TGN localization (38Wilcox C.A. Redding K. Wright R. Fuller S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1353-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). There was a small degree of overlap between Kex2p and Gef1p, particularly in strongly labeled structures (white arrow in Fig. 2 C ). Thus, our data show that Gef1p is localized to the Golgi, with most of the protein probably residing in its medial portion. In a search for functionally important domains in the cytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini of Gef1p, we truncated the first 36 or the last 198 amino acids of the protein and made COOH-terminal fusions to GFP (Fig.3 A , constructs b and c ). These were expressed in gef1 strain K700αΔPst. Neither of the truncated proteins could complement the growth defect of the cells on the iron-limiting LIM50 selective medium (Fig. 3 B ). The GFP fluorescence pattern observed for the truncated proteins lacked the dot-like structures obtained with WT Gef1p (Fig. 3 C ). Instead, a strong perinuclear fluorescence and staining close to the cell periphery were observed. We conclude that both the amino and the carboxyl terminus of Gef1p are necessary for the protein to fulfill its normal function. These regions may contain residues important for correct localization. Alternatively, the truncated proteins may be misfolded and retained in an early compartment by a quality control mechanism. To narrow down the functionally important regions in the NH2 and COOH termini of Gef1p, we systematically moved a window of 5 alanine residues through the regions of interest. For the NH2 terminus, we scanned the whole region deleted in the experiment described above by constructing nine mutants in which 5 consecutive residues of the amino terminus were replaced by alanines (mutants ALAN1 to ALAN9, Fig.4 A ). For the carboxyl terminus, we analyzed 17 such constructs (mutants ALAC1 to ALAC17). From the 9 NH2-terminal ALA mutants seven could not be distinguished from wild-type by either the complementation or the GFP fluorescence assay (Fig. 4, A and C ). Mutant ALAN8 could not functionally substitute for the Gef1 protein and displayed an atypical GFP fluorescence. Mutant ALAN6 displayed weaker complementation than wild-type (transformants appeared 2 days later on LIM50 selective medium) and again showed an abnormal GFP fluorescence (Fig. 4 C ). The motif destroyed in mutant ALAN8 (36FVTID) complies with a consensus sequence of sorting signals containing aromatic amino acids (see “Discussion”). We therefore mutated the two most conserved residues within these motifs either singly (F36A and I39G) or in combination. The single point mutations had no discernible effect on either complementation or localization when expressed in thegef1 strain from the Met3 promotor at high levels (i.e. no methionine added). Decreasing the expression by increasing the methionine concentration to 25 or 250 μm, however, led to a decrease in complementation efficiency as compared with WT grown at the same concentrations of methionine (not shown). The double mutant, F36A/I39G, in contrast, led to the same loss-of-function phenotype as ALAN8, suggesting that FVTID may indeed function similarly as other sorting signals based on aromatic amino acids. From the 17 COOH-terminal ALA mutants 10 behaved like wild-type in every aspect tested. Five adjacent mutants could not functionally substitute for Gef1p (ALAC5 to ALAC9, Fig. 4, A andB ) and displayed an atypical GFP fluorescence (seee.g. ALAC5, Fig. 4 C ). Very weak complementation, however, was observed with ALAC6, resulting in a few, very slow-growing colonies. Two additional mutants gave an intermediate phenotype. For ALAC3, complementation was weak and GFP fluorescence appeared again changed. Mutant ALAC10 displayed only abnormal fluorescence while showing complementation. Some of the mutant proteins were expressed to lower steady-state levels as judged by a lower level of GFP fluorescence and by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antiserum (data not shown), an observation not uncommon in mutagenesis studies (39Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thinès D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,40Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There was no consistent correlation between expression levels and phenotypes. Thus, our alanine scan showed that a 5-amino acid motif in the NH2 terminus and a 25-amino acid domain in the COOH terminus could not be mutated without loss of function, which was always associated with an atypical GFP staining pattern. In yeast, retention-defective mutant forms of resident Golgi proteins are often sorted to the vacuole (41Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is clearly not the case for our mutants. Their often perinuclear localization is rather compatible with a localization in the ER. We therefore examined co-localization with Kar2p, a lumenal ER chaperone of the Hsp70 family (42Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). K700αΔPst (gef1 ) cells expressing either Gef1p-GFP or two defective mutants, ALAN8 and ALAC5, were co-stained with an anti-Kar2 antiserum (Fig. 5). The wild-type protein was always found in structures distinct from those stained for Kar2p (Fig. 5 A ), while both mutants co-localized with this ER protein (Fig. 5, B and C ). In addition to this typical perinuclear and submembraneous fluorescence, atypical structures were observed in cells expressing higher amounts of mutant Gef1 proteins, especially for ALAC5. This effect was the same in the corresponding GEF1"
https://openalex.org/W2069611627,"Proteolytically activated receptors (PARs) represent an emerging subset of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors that mediate cell activation events by receptor cleavage at distinct scissile bonds located within receptor amino termini. Differential genomic blotting using a yeast artificial chromosome known to contain the PAR-1 and PAR-2 genes identified the PAR-3 gene within a PAR gene cluster spanning ∼100 kilobases at 5q13. The PAR-3 gene is relatively small (∼12 kilobases); and, like the PAR-1 and PAR-2 genes, it displays a two-exon structure, with the majority of the coding sequence and the proteolytic cleavage site contained within the larger second exon. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region demonstrates that the promoter is TATA-less, similar to that seen with PAR-1, with the identification of nucleic acid motifs potentially involved in transcriptional gene regulation, including AP-1, GATA, and octameric sequences. PAR-3 transcripts were apparent in human vascular endothelial cells, although at considerably lower levels than those of PAR-1 and not significantly modulated by the endothelial cell stimulus tumor necrosis factor-α. Likewise, although PAR-3 mRNA was evident in human platelets, receptor cell surface expression was modest (∼10%) compared with that of PAR-1. Thus, although PAR-3 is postulated to represent a second thrombin receptor, its modest endothelial cell and platelet expression suggest that PAR-3 activation by α-thrombin is less relevant for physiological responses in these mature cells. Rather, given its disparately greater expression in megakaryocytes (and megakaryocyte-like human erythroleukemia cells), a regulatory role in cellular development (by protease activation) could be postulated.

Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar) and the proteinase-activated receptor (PAR-2) (4Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 5Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Unlike the former class of receptors in which cellular activation events are initiated by standard receptor-ligand binding interactions, both PAR-1 and PAR-2 are activated by cleavage at distinct Arg-Ser bonds located within the NH2-terminal extension of both receptors, and synthetic peptidomimetics representing the new NH2 terminus after receptor cleavage function as full receptor agonists irrespective of receptor cleavage. In addition to displaying similar molecular mechanisms of receptor activation, functional similarities between PAR-1 and PAR-2 have also been observed. Thus, both are expressed on vascular endothelial cells (6Mirza H. Yatsula V. Bahou W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and both mediate proliferative responses when activated by their protease agonists (7Mirza H. Schmidt V. Derian C. Jesty J. Bahou W. Blood. 1997; 90: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chambard J. Paris S. L'Allemain G. Pouyssegur J. Nature. 1987; 326: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) or synthetic peptide ligands (6Mirza H. Yatsula V. Bahou W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8Chambard J. Paris S. L'Allemain G. Pouyssegur J. Nature. 1987; 326: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These structure/function similarities also extend to the gene level; thus, both PAR-1 and PAR-2 genes are known to co-localize at 5q13, and both genes are organized similarly, suggesting evolution from a common ancestral gene (9Schmidt V.A. Vitale E. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given evolving evidence for protease activation of multiple cell types (2Hollenberg M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Mirza H. Schmidt V. Derian C. Jesty J. Bahou W. Blood. 1997; 90: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the corollary that some, if not all, of these cellular sequelae may be mediated by activation of novel PARs, we adapted a positional cloning approach as a strategy for the identification of other putative PARs that may co-cluster within this region of the genome. Interestingly, we identified the recently characterized PAR-3 gene (10Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) within this region of the genome and demonstrate that its structural organization is essentially identical to that of PAR-1 and PAR-2, reinforcing the concept of a gene family of receptors evolving from a common ancestral gene and emerging along a distinct evolutionary pathway. Furthermore, like PAR-1 and PAR-2, PAR-3 is also expressed on vascular endothelial cells, although at considerably lower levels; similar low level but detectable PAR-3 expression is also evident in human platelets; thus, although PAR-3 appears to be a second “thrombin receptor,” its comparatively modest expression in these cell types suggests a functional role distinct from PAR-1 in mediating cell activation events by α-thrombin. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Rockville, MD), and ExpandTMlong template polymerase was from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 381A single-channel synthesizer (G. D'Angelo, Molecular Biology Core, SUNY Stony Brook). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from pooled primary cultures of human umbilical veins and propagated as described previously (6Mirza H. Yatsula V. Bahou W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells were propagated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Total genomic DNA from normal human volunteers was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes as described previously (9Schmidt V.A. Vitale E. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and quantitated by absorption spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Approximately 5–10 μg of DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes for Southern blot analysis. The separation of large DNA fragments on agarose gels was completed using an inversion field gel electrophoresis apparatus (SwitchbackTM pulse controller, Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). Yeast artificial chromosomal (YAC) DNA was isolated as described previously (11Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Feldblyum T.V. Maglott D.R. Bahou W.F. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and human genomic fragments were separated from yeast chromosomes using a 1% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate-EDTA), run at 6.9 V/cm in 0.5 × TBE buffer at 10 °C with a pulse timer of 1–50 s and a forward/reverse ratio of 3:1 for 24 h. Gels were blotted onto nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized to 32P-radiolabeled cDNA probes. Blots were washed at high (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 10 mm sodium phosphate at 68 °C for 1 h) or low (0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium phosphate at 55 °C for 30 min) stringency and analyzed by autoradiography with Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 3–10 days. For some experiments, filters were stripped according to the manufacturer's recommendations and adequacy confirmed by overnight autoradiography. The PAR-3 cDNA was isolated from a HUVEC cDNA library cloned into the bacteriophage vector λgt11, essentially as described previously (6Mirza H. Yatsula V. Bahou W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Positive phage clones were plaque purified, and the DNA was purified from minilysates by standard methods (9Schmidt V.A. Vitale E. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The PAR-3 gene was isolated from a cosmid library generated from the ∼1.4-megabase YAC 798D11, shown previously in this laboratory to contain both PAR-1 and PAR-2 genes (11Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Feldblyum T.V. Maglott D.R. Bahou W.F. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A size-selected library ranging from ∼30 to ∼40 kb was generated by partial Mbo I digestion of 1 μg of YAC 798D11 DNA followed by ligation to SuperCos-1 vector (Stratagene) containing flanking Bam HI sites. Ligation products were packaged using 25 μl of Gigapack III XL packaging extract for 2 h at 25 °C followed by titering and amplification using Escherichia coli host strain XL1-Blue. The titer of the unamplified library was ∼1 × 105 colony-forming units/ml, consistent with a ∼103-fold representation of nucleotide sequences. Library screening was completed using the32P-radiolabeled PAR-3 cDNA as probe, and DNA from individual cosmids was characterized further by extensive restriction mapping. Discrete genomic fragments were gel purified and ligated into pBluescript (Stratagene) for DNA sequence analysis using dideoxy chain termination. Exon-intron boundaries were defined by comparison of the genomic DNA sequence with that of the published cDNA (10Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed using the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group Package (12Pustell J. Kafatos F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The identification of PAR-3 promoter nucleotide motifs potentially involved in transcriptional gene regulation was characterized using TRANSFAC software (13Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Genetic mapping within the PAR gene cluster was completed using both the Stanford G3 (∼500-kb resolution) and TNG3 (∼100-kb resolution) RH mapping panels (11Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Feldblyum T.V. Maglott D.R. Bahou W.F. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Cox D.R. Burmeister M. Price E.R. Kim S. Myers R.M. Science. 1990; 250: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). PCR screening was completed using the following PAR-3-specific oligonucleotide primers: PAR2064 (5′–3′: TCCATCCTTTCACCTACCGGG, bp 731–751) and PAR2065 (5′–3′: TAGCAGTAGATGATAAGCACA, bp 989–969) (10Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). PAR-1, PAR-2, and microsatellite-specific primers encompassing this region of the genome were as described previously (11Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Feldblyum T.V. Maglott D.R. Bahou W.F. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were optimized for individual primer pairs, but the thermal profile generally included a 1-min 95 °C denaturation step, a 2-min 55 °C annealing step, a 3-min 72 °C primer extension step, with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C; after 25 cycles in a thermocycler (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI), products were analyzed by Southern blot analysis in a 3% ethidium-stained agarose gel and scored as present or absent. Retention patterns were submitted for two-point linkage analyses to the server maintained by the Stanford Human Genome Center 2Stanford Human Genome Center (http://shgc.www.stanford.edu/rh) (1996). or analyzed using RHMAP (version 2.02), a software package for multipoint radiation hybrid mapping (16Boehnke M. Lange K. Cox D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 1174-1188PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent HUVEC in second to fifth passage were harvested directly with a rubber policeman, and total cellular RNA was isolated by immediate solubilization in guanidine hydrochloride and serial ethanol precipitation (6Mirza H. Yatsula V. Bahou W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Alternatively, poly(A) mRNA was isolated from solubilized HUVEC (or HEL cells) by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (Invitrogen, San Diego). For some experiments, 3 × 107 HUVEC were stimulated with 100 units/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (17Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2753-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) for 4 or 24 h followed by RNA isolation. Transcript expression of murine tissues was completed using 1 μg of poly(A) RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Northern blot analysis was completed by size fractionation in a 1% denaturing agarose gel, and equivalent RNA loading was confirmed by reprobing with a γ-actin cDNA probe (18Ponte P. Gunning P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR was completed by incubating ∼1 μg of total cellular RNA with 1 μg of a 14-mer oligo(dT) primer at 41 °C for 1 h using 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μm individual dNTPs in a final volume of 50 μl. 10 μl was subsequently adjusted to PCR conditions using approximately 0.01 OD unit of each PCR primer and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase; Perkin-Elmer). Oligonucleotide primers included the reverse primer PAR2065 (see above) and the forward primers PAR2066 (5′–3′: ATAACGTTTAAGAGACGGGACT, bp 111–132). PCR conditions included a 1-min 15-s denaturation step at 94 °C, a 1-min 55 °C annealing step, and a 3-min primer extension step at 72 °C. Amplifications consisted of 35 rounds using a DNA thermocycler, and insert sizes were determined by electrophoresis in a 1% ethidium-stained agarose gel. Platelet PCR was completed in a similar manner, except for minor modifications, essentially as described previously (19Newman P. Gorski J. White G. Gidwitz S. Cretney C. Aster R. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A 17-mer peptide encompassing the PAR-3 cleavage site with an added NH2-terminal cysteine and COOH-terminal amide (PAR-332–48, Ac-CKPTLPIKTFRGAPPNS-amide) was custom synthesized by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkington, MA) and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. For antibody generation, the peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or to BSA using the hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagent mal-sac HNSA, and the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugate was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. Immunoreactivity of the anti-PAR-3 antibody to the BSA conjugate was confirmed by solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Preimmune and immune rabbit IgGs were purified by protein G affinity chromatography. For immunofluorescent studies, the immunopurified IgG was labeled directly with FITC (0.2 mg of FITC/mg of IgG) in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, for 2 h at 25 °C, and unbound FITC was removed by gel filtration on a Bio-Rad 10-DG column developed with degassed PBSA (10 mmsodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.4). Immunofluorescent staining of confluent HUVEC was completed in eight-well chamber slides after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C (for determination of cell surface staining) or fixation and permeabilization using ice-cold 100% acetone for 60 s. Fixed HUVEC were then washed extensively with PBS followed by incubation with 100 μg/ml FITC-conjugated anti-PAR-3 IgG or a 1:100 dilution of the FITC-conjugated IgG alone for 60 min at 4 °C. After the last of five washes in PBS, cells were mounted in Aquamount, and fluorescent images were obtained using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with fluorescent optics (Nikon, Garden City, NY). Images were frame averaged to 256 frames with Image I software (Universal Imaging, Media, PA) using laser light excited at 529 nm and a blocking filter of 550 nm. Flow cytometric analysis of HUVEC was completed by detaching adherent cells using PBS and 10 mmEDTA and resuspending the cells to a final concentration of 5 × 105/ml PBS and 0.1% BSA. 200-μl aliquots were then incubated with 100 μg/ml FITC-conjugated anti-PAR-3 IgG for 60 min at 4 °C in PBS and 0.1% BSA, and cells were washed twice and then fixed in 1% formalin before analysis. Platelet cell surface PAR-1/PAR-3 expression was completed as described previously (20Bahou W. Coller B. Potter C. Norton K. Kutok J. Goligorsky M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelet-rich plasma was prepared in 10 mm EDTA from healthy human donors by differential centrifugation and adjusted to 3 × 108 platelets/ml TSE (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, pH 7.4). 400-μl aliquots were then incubated with 100 μg/ml FITC-conjugated anti-PAR-3 IgG, 100 μg/ml anti-PAR-1 IgG (20Bahou W. Coller B. Potter C. Norton K. Kutok J. Goligorsky M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or 100 μg/ml nonimmune rabbit IgG for 30 min at 25 °C. For PAR-1 expression, platelets were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of the FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 secondary antibody (Tago, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 20 min at 25 °C; samples were then washed three times in TSE, fixed in 1% formalin, and analyzed in a FACStar flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson and Co., Rutherford, NJ). Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that human PAR-1 and PAR-2 genes are contained within YAC 798D11 and separated maximally by ∼100 kb (11Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Feldblyum T.V. Maglott D.R. Bahou W.F. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify additional PARs that potentially may be clustered in this region of the genome, differential genomic blotting was adapted using a series of cDNA probes encompassing distinct regions of the PAR-1 or PAR-2 genes. Using such an approach, PAR-1-specific probes failed to identify any novel cross-hybridizing fragments (not shown). In contrast, a PAR-2-specific probe encompassing the 5′-region of the cDNA identified a novel band at low stringency which was not evident when the blot was washed at higher stringency (Fig.1). By inversion field gel electrophoresis, this Eco RI fragment was estimated to be ∼16 kb and could not be resolved by the known genomic organization of PAR-2 (5Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this band was not present within a P1 genomic clone (P1142) shown previously by Nystedt and colleagues (5Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) to contain the entire PAR-2 gene (not shown), again strongly suggesting that it represented a previously uncharacterized, homologous PAR or a processed pseudogene. Concomitant with these initial observations, a routine BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72062) Google Scholar) homology search using PAR-2 sequences identified a highly homologous expressed sequence tag (EST) AA177828, partially characterized from a murine splenic cDNA library, as part of the Washington University/HHMI Mouse EST project. This expressed sequence tag was purchased from Research Genetics, fully sequenced, and found to contain a 1,238-bp insert encoding a 283-amino acid open reading frame (representing an incomplete cDNA) demonstrating highest homology to PAR-1 and PAR-2. This 32P-radiolabeled insert was then used to screen empirically a HUVEC cDNA library using low stringency screening to maximize hybridization cross-species, with the isolation of three cDNA clones, the longest of which (λ2B1A, 2,566 bp) was characterized more fully (see below). As demonstrated in Fig.1 D , this cDNA (now known to be identical to PAR-3) (10Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), cross-hybridized to the novel ∼16-kb Eco RI fragment recognized by the 5′-PAR-2 probe (Fig. 1 C ), thereby establishing its identity as the human PAR-3 gene. To establish more precisely distances among the PAR genes within this genomic segment, we completed genetic mapping using radiation hybrid mapping panels (11Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Feldblyum T.V. Maglott D.R. Bahou W.F. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Cox D.R. Burmeister M. Price E.R. Kim S. Myers R.M. Science. 1990; 250: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Using the lower resolution G3 panel, the amplification (and retention) patterns for all three genes were indistinguishable (no breaks were observed in the 83 hybrids typed), establishing that the closest framework marker to all three PARs was D5S424 (22Dib C. Faure S. Fizame C. Samson D. Dourot N. Vignal A. Millasseau P. Marc S. Hazan J. Seboun E. Lathrop M. Gyapay G. Morissette J. Weissenbach J. Nature. 1996; 380: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar), with significant linkage as well to D5S1977, D5S2529, and D5S2596 (in order of decreasing log of odds scores, see Fig.2). Thus, all three PARs were linked tightly to the identical microsatellite markers and were at least as close to each other as the resolution power of this panel (360–500 kb).2 To establish further interorder assignments and distance, we determined amplification patterns from a second radiation hybrid panel TNG3 with a higher lengthwise resolution of ∼100 kb (11Schmidt V.A. Nierman W.C. Feldblyum T.V. Maglott D.R. Bahou W.F. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).2 The amplification patterns obtained using this RH panel were analyzed using RH2PT (16Boehnke M. Lange K. Cox D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 1174-1188PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrated that the three genes could now be resolved, with the likely ordercentromere –D5S424–PAR-2–PAR-1–PAR-3–telomere (Fig. 2). Although physical conversions are not available for the TNG3 RH panel, if one assumes an average resolution of 3–6 kb/centiRad throughout the panel,2 this initial analysis suggested that the three PARs are separated by ∼110 to ∼220 kb, which was confirmed subsequently by inversion field gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis. DNA digests of YAC 798D11 were completed using various restriction endonucleases (including rare-cutting enzymes) in an attempt to resolve the three genes within single large genomic fragments. As revealed in Fig. 3, Southern blot analysis demonstrated that all three cDNAs were contained within restriction fragments of ∼90 kb (Xho I) or ∼120 kb (Not I), consistent with a distance among the genes of less than 100 kb.Figure 3Characterization of the PAR gene cluster by inversion field gel electrophoresis. Panel A , 1 μg of YAC 798D11 DNA was digested with Eco RI (first lane from left ), Not I (second lane ),Pvu I (third lane ), Xho I (fourth lane ), or Xba I (fifth lane ) for Southern blot analysis using the 32P-radiolabeled PAR-3 cDNA (λ2B1A) as probe followed by high stringency wash and overnight autoradiography. The table (panel B ) delineates the restriction fragment sizes when the blot was stripped and sequentially hybridized with the cDNAs for PAR-1 (20Bahou W. Coller B. Potter C. Norton K. Kutok J. Goligorsky M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and PAR-2 (6Mirza H. Yatsula V. Bahou W.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As demonstrated, all three genes are contained within the identicalNot I (∼120 kb) or Xho I (∼90 kb) fragments. Note the different sized restriction patterns with Xba I orEco RI, excluding the possibility that the cDNAs are cross-hybridizing to other genes within the cluster.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the genomic structure of PAR-3, a cosmid library was constructed using YAC 798D11 DNA. Approximately 7 × 103 independent clones from the unamplified library were screened using the PAR-3 cDNA, with the identification of 10, three of which (COS3–2, COS2–1, and COS7–1) were characterized further. Only one of the three clones (COS3–2) contained the entire PAR-3 gene, whereas COS2–1 and COS7–1 lacked the 5′-coding region (Fig. 4). PAR-3 exons, intron/exon boundaries, and portions of the flanking introns were sequenced bidirectionally for further analysis. Not unexpectedly, PAR-3 displayed a genomic organization similar to that of the PAR-1/PAR-2 genes (5Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt V.A. Vitale E. Bahou W.F. J. Biol.

The single intronic splice site occurs after the second nucleotide of the Gly22 codon, indicative of a type II splice site, although the splice junction sequences are somewhat atypical (24Mount S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). Nucleotide analysis of the entire coding sequence was identical to that described initially (10Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), with the identification of an additional 1,451 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence in the cDNA clone λ2B1A. This sequence has been deposited into the GenBank data base and assigned the accession number AF053124. The size of the PAR-3 first intron was estimated at ∼4 kb, utilizing restriction mapping and long range PCR from YAC 798D11, COS3–2, and total human genomic DNA. Thus, although genomic rearrangements/deletions are not uncommonly found in YACs, the identical sizes of restriction fragments and PCR fragments confirm these size estimates and determinations. A ∼5-kb Xba I fragment containing the first exon and 5′-untranslated region (see Fig. 4) was sequenced bidirectionally to characterize fu"
https://openalex.org/W2002609528,"Western blots of Xenopus oocyte membrane preparations showed that the apparent molecular mass of the wild type P2X2 receptor (about 65 kDa) was reduced by pretreatment with endoglycosidase H. Mutagenesis of one or more of three potential asparagines (N182S, N239S, and N298S) followed by Western blots showed that each of the sites was glycosylated in the wild type receptor. Functional channels were formed by receptors lacking any single asparagine, but not by channels mutated in two or three positions. Artificial consensus sequences (N-X -S/T) introduced into the N-terminal region (asparagine at position 9, 16, or 26) were not glycosylated. Asparagines were glycosylated when introduced at the C-terminal end of the first hydrophobic domain (positions 62 and 66) and at the N-terminal end of the second hydrophobic domain (position 324). A protein in which the C terminus of one P2X2 subunit was joined to the N terminus of a second P2X2 subunit (from a concatenated cDNA) had twice the molecular mass of the P2X2 receptor subunit, and formed fully functional channels. The experiments provide direct evidence for the topology originally proposed for the P2X receptor, with intracellular N and C termini, two membrane-spanning domains, and a large extracellular loop. Western blots of Xenopus oocyte membrane preparations showed that the apparent molecular mass of the wild type P2X2 receptor (about 65 kDa) was reduced by pretreatment with endoglycosidase H. Mutagenesis of one or more of three potential asparagines (N182S, N239S, and N298S) followed by Western blots showed that each of the sites was glycosylated in the wild type receptor. Functional channels were formed by receptors lacking any single asparagine, but not by channels mutated in two or three positions. Artificial consensus sequences (N-X -S/T) introduced into the N-terminal region (asparagine at position 9, 16, or 26) were not glycosylated. Asparagines were glycosylated when introduced at the C-terminal end of the first hydrophobic domain (positions 62 and 66) and at the N-terminal end of the second hydrophobic domain (position 324). A protein in which the C terminus of one P2X2 subunit was joined to the N terminus of a second P2X2 subunit (from a concatenated cDNA) had twice the molecular mass of the P2X2 receptor subunit, and formed fully functional channels. The experiments provide direct evidence for the topology originally proposed for the P2X receptor, with intracellular N and C termini, two membrane-spanning domains, and a large extracellular loop. The extracellular signaling properties of nucleotides are mediated through two distinct families of membrane proteins. These are the P2Y receptors, coupled to G proteins and second messenger pathways, and the P2X receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels (1North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Seven subunits of the P2X receptor family (P2X1–7) have been characterized at the molecular level (reviewed in Refs. 2Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar and 3North R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These show a broad expression pattern compared with other ligand-gated channels, with the various forms being found in central and peripheral nervous system, different types of immune cells, glands, and smooth and skeletal muscles (4Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P2X receptor subunits can form channels as homomultimers or, in some cases, as heteromultimers (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 6Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of subunits in each channel molecule is not known. P2X receptor subunits are 36–48% identical to one another at the amino acid level. All seven proteins have similar hydrophobicity profiles, with only two hydrophobic regions sufficiently long to span the plasma membrane. These regions display the features often seen in transmembrane segments such as aromatic residues at interfacial regions, and they have an excess of positively charged amino acids at their presumed cytoplasmic ends (7Von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 97: 175-181Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Together with the absence of signal peptide sequence after the initiating methionine, this suggests that P2X receptors may have intracellular N and C termini, and two transmembrane domains separated by a large extracellular loop (8Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 9Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). This proposed topology differs from that of the nicotinic and glutamate superfamilies of ligand-gated ion channels (reviewed in Ref. 10Dani J.A. Mayer M.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but resembles that shown for the pore-forming subunits of epithelial sodium channels (11Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: 1682-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is, however, no detectable similarity of amino acid sequence between P2X receptors and epithelial sodium channels (3North R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). There are other experimental results that are consistent with this topological model of P2X receptor subunit. First, P2X1receptors are activated by the ATP analog αβmeATP, 1The abbreviations used are: αβmeATP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate trimethylammonium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: αβmeATP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate trimethylammonium; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. whereas P2X2 receptors are not; transferring the putative extracellular loop (approximately residues 50–320) from the P2X1 receptor into the P2X2 receptor confers αβmeATP sensitivity (13Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, changing one amino acid within the loop of the P2X4 receptor (E249K) causes a large increase in the blocking action of the slowly reversible antagonist pyridoxal-5-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′-4′-disulfonic acid (14Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 26-55Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Third, the difference in sensitivity to pyridoxal-5-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′-4′-disulfonic acid between human and rat P2X4 receptors can be transferred by exchange of a segment within the first half of this loop (15Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Lund P.-E. Stuhmer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Fourth, evidence forN -glycosylation of Asn184 of the P2X1 receptor has been obtained, indicating that this must be located extracellularly (16Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R.J. Gos A. Antoarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). The recent identification of residues contributing to the pore of the P2X2 receptor has also provided evidence for an intracellular location for the C-terminal part of the protein (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Amino acids in and around the second hydrophobic domain of the P2X2 receptor (residues 316–354) were mutated individually to cysteine, the proteins were expressed, and ATP-activated currents were measured. Inhibition of the current by polar methanethiosulfonate derivatives was then used to determine whether the residue was likely exposed to the aqueous solution. One substitution was identified (D349C) at which extracellularly applied methanethiosulfonate ethylamine inhibited the ATP-evoked current. However, the inhibition required channel opening. Because methanethiosulfonate ethylamine can permeate the open channel, these results indicate that Asp349 normally lies internal to the channel “gate.” The residue is close to the C-terminal end of the second hydrophobic region; this therefore implies that the C terminus of the protein is within the cytoplasm, because there is no further hydrophobic domain long enough to span the plasma membrane. These results are consistent with the topology for P2X receptors initially proposed (8Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 9Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), but alternative models are also possible. For example, the data generated so far on cloned P2X receptors might as well be explained with a model in which only the second hydrophobic domain spans the plasma membrane, placing the entire N-terminal part of the protein extracellularly. Therefore, we have used theN -glycosylation site tagging approach to determine the precise topology of P2X2 receptors. During protein biosynthesis, extracellular domains of the protein are facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where they are able to be glycosylated. Due to the strict compartmentalization of N -glycosylating enzymes at the luminal face of the endoplasmic reticulum, it is possible to assess the extracellular location of different region of a given protein by N -glycosylation site tagging. This approach has been used to determine the topology of other membrane proteins including channels and transporters (18Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 19Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We first identified the endogenous N -glycosylation of P2X2 receptor, and then by mutagenesis obtained a form in which no natural N -glycosylation of the protein remained. The cDNA for this modified form of the receptor was then used as a background plasmid to engineer artificial N -glycosylation sites at different locations in the protein, with respect to the two hydrophobic domains. The extent of N -glycosylation was assayed by gel shift assay after functional expression of epitope-tagged forms of the P2X2 receptor inXenopus oocytes. Finally, we concatenated cDNAs and expressed the tandem constructs to show that the N and C termini reside on the same side of the plasma membrane. In all experiments, a P2X2receptor cDNA was used that carried a C-terminal epitope (DPGLNEYMPME), cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20Kawashima E. Estoppey D. Fahmi D. Virginio C. Rees S. Surprenant A. North R.A. Receptors Channels. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations in P2X2 receptor cDNA were introduced by full-length polymerase chain reaction amplification of plasmid DNA with sense and antisense mutated primers.Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used to reduce the rate of contaminating mutations. Parental (wild type) DNA was digested with 10 units of Dpn I (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C; 2.5 μl of the reaction was then directly used for transformation of Escherichia coli DH5α strain. DNA fragments carrying the mutation were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned in a background vector that had not been amplified. All mutants were sequenced on both strands. A concatenated tandem P2X2 receptor cDNA was constructed in pBluescript vector. Briefly, two P2X2 cDNAs were modified by in-frame addition of an Eco RI site either at the 5′ or 3′ end of the coding sequence, respectively. These two cDNAs were ligated through the Eco RI site and a unique site from the backbone of the vector. The resulting construct contains two P2X2 subunits linked from the C terminus of one (-KGLAQL) to the N terminus of another (MVRRLA-); the deduced amino acid sequence at the junction site is -KGLGIRLA-. The mutant subunit P2X2-T336C (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was also constructed in pcDNA3; it also had the C terminus tag. To create the wild type-mutant dimer, a fragment from the Bluescript dimer was obtained by Bst EII digestion and subcloned into the Bst EII site of P2X2-T336C. The resulting plasmid encodes a wild type subunit followed by a mutant subunit and has the C-terminal epitope tag. Stage V-VI oocytes were removed from ovaries of anesthetized Xenopus laevis as described (21Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). Ovarian lobules were treated with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature in calcium-free solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mmHepes, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 units/ml streptomycin). Healthy oocytes were selected and allowed to recover overnight prior to injection. Plasmid DNA was directly injected into oocyte nuclei. All plasmids were co-injected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-containing plasmid (pEGFP, Life Technologies, Inc.). From 24 to 48 h after injection, EGFP-positive oocytes were sorted using a fluorescent microscope. Crude membrane fractions were prepared from batches of 12 oocytes; oocytes were homogenized in 240 μl of buffer H (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml benzamidine hydrochloride, 200 μg/ml pepstatin A, 250 μg/ml aprotinin, 260 μg/ml α1-antitrypsin, 100 ng/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 200 μg/ml bestatin). Homogenates were shaken for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. After denaturation, membrane-containing supernatants were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 8% Tris glycine gel (Novex). Separated proteins were electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (2 h, 25 V, 4 °C). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk, 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Monoclonal antibody against EYMPME (22Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was added at 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C, in 2.5% milk, phosphate-buffered saline solution. A secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added at a 1:1000 dilution in 2.5% milk and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were detected by a chemiluminescent assay (ECL detection kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane extracts (15 μl) were incubated with 10 μl of endoglycosidase H for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.2% SDS and 0.4% 2-β-mercaptoethanol. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells, and electrophysiological recording from oocytes and HEK cells has been described previously (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). HEK cells were co-transfected with EGFP cDNA (0.5 μg/ml;CLONTECH) and the relevant P2X2receptor cDNA (1 μg/ml), and recordings were made 18–48 h later. All EGFPpositive (i.e. fluorescent) cells exhibited ATP-evoked current. We determined if it was possible to detect tagged P2X2 protein by Western blot from a crude oocyte membrane preparation. As shown in Fig.1, when oocytes were injected with the wild type P2X2 cDNA, the anti-EE antibody recognized a protein of apparent molecular mass around 65 kDa. The calculated size of the P2X2 receptor protein is 52.6 kDa; the observed difference is due to N -glycosylation because a mutated subunit lacking all three asparagines found at consensus glycosylation sites (N-X -S/T) migrated at approximately 50 kDa. The broad smear of the wild type Western blot may result from the fact that crude membrane preparations were used; these would include not only plasma membrane but also the membrane of intracellular organelles (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) in which the identity and length of sugars added to proteins might be variable. Uninjected or EGFP-injected oocytes showed no staining or very weak bands (Fig.1 B ). The P2X2 receptor primary sequence contains three consensus sites for N -glycosylation (N-X -S/T); these are Asn182, Asn239, and Asn298. To determine if any or all of these were glycosylated, we constructed a series of mutants in which one, two, or three sites were removed. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D ), all three sites were glycosylated in Xenopus oocytes. This was evidenced by the progressive reduction of the apparent molecular mass of P2X2 protein as the number of N -glycosylation sites decreases (Fig. 1 C ). No differences were obvious among the three single mutants (N182S, N239S, and N298S) or among the three double mutants (N182S/N239S, N182S/N298S, and N239S/N298S), suggesting that all three asparagines are modified (Fig. 1 C ). This was further demonstrated by the effect of endoglycosidase H (Endo H). Membrane preparations of oocytes expressing wild type P2X2receptors and the three double mutants were treated with Endo H; in each case, this led to the appearance of a band that co-migrated with the triply mutant receptor (Δ3N-P2X2) (Fig.1 D ). A fraction of the protein in each case was resistant to Endo H; this may be because Endo H only hydrolyzes high mannose oligosaccharides specific to the endoplasmic reticulum and does not affect sugars added in other compartments such as the Golgi. Higher concentrations of enzyme or longer incubation times did not change the pattern of action of Endo H. In the case of the Δ3N-P2X2receptor, Endo H had no effect on the apparent molecular mass of the protein (data not shown). Mutants lacking one, two, or three N -glycosylation sites were transfected in HEK293 cell and tested electrophysiologically for the presence of ATP-induced currents. In HEK293 cells expressing each of the single mutants, ATP (30 μm) evoked inward currents that were not obviously different from those observed in cells expressing wild type receptors (Fig. 2). These results indicate both that full glycosylation is not required for normal function, and that the point mutations introduced do not critically disrupt the overall structure of the protein. However, in cells expressing the double mutations ATP evoked only very small currents, and on the triple mutant receptor (Δ3N-P2X2) ATP had no detectable effect. We introduced three point mutations resulting in consensus sites forN -glycosylation into the Δ3N-P2X2 receptor between the initiating methionine and the beginning of the first hydrophobic regions (C9N, Y16N, and R28T) (Fig.3 A ). Fig. 3 B shows that the protein had the same apparent molecular weight as Δ3N-P2X2, indicating that this N-terminal region is not accessible to the glycosylating enzymes. Thus, this experiment failed to provide any evidence for an extracellular location of the N terminus. The Δ3N-P2X2 receptor was next used as a background construct to insert mutations at the extracellular aspects of the putative transmembrane regions, as deduced from the hydrophobicity plots. In the first experiments, five asparagines were individually introduced close to the end of the first hydrophobic domain (Fig.4 A ) (Q52N, Q56N, S58N, P62N, and I66N). Two of these (P62N and I66N) had a higher molecular weight than Δ3N-P2X2; two bands were seen in the case of the P62N mutant, one corresponding to Δ3N-P2X2 and one at the same position as that seen with I66N. The size of the mobility shift corresponded to that expected from a single glycosylation, and for both P62N and I66N the shift could be prevented by pre-incubation of the membrane preparation with Endo H (Fig. 4 C ). The lack of N -glycosylation observed at position Q52N, Q56N and S58N might result from suboptimal consensus sequences (N-K-S, N-D-S, and N-E-T, respectively). The sequence N-F-T was therefore introduced at these positions, because this occurs at two of the three naturally occurring sites in the P2X2 receptor. However, these mutant receptors were also not glycosylated (Fig.4 D ). This suggests either that this portion of the protein lies too close to the plasma membrane (23Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or thatN -glycosylation is prevented for other structural reasons. We introduced the same mutations into the P2X2 receptor in which the three naturally occurring sites were left intact, and we tested for expression electrophysiologically in HEK293 cells. Q52N, S58N, and P62N gave apparently normal currents in response to ATP, whereas cells transfected with the Q56N and I66N forms did not respond to ATP. The lack of response to ATP with I66N could be accounted for by the structural change resulting from Asn in place of Ile, or it could be because the attached sugar moiety prevents receptor function (e.g. ATP binding). The latter possibility is favored by the observations that I66S, I66L, and I66C all provided functional channels with normal responses to ATP (currents were 3.6 ± 0.7 nA, 3.9 ± 0.4 nA, and 4.1 ± 0.6 nA, respectively;n = 6 in each case). Close to the second hydrophobic domain, the mutations K324N, I328N, and A335T were made so as to introduce consensus sequences N-F-S, N-P-T, and N-L-T (Fig. 5). Only K324N displayed a shift in mobility; as for P62N, two bands were seen, with one migrating at the same size as the Δ3N-P2X2 receptor (Fig.5 B ). The higher molecular weight band resulted from a glycosylated receptor because it was abolished by preincubation of the membrane preparation with Endo H (Fig. 5 C ). The lack of glycosylation of I328N might reflect the introduction of the sequence N-P-T; it has been previously shown that a proline at positionX in the consensus sequence N-X -T/S strongly reduces the likelihood of N -glycosylation (24Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We made the double mutant I328N/P329F, which creates the sequence N-F-T. This was also not glycosylated, but a shorter form of the protein was consistently observed (Fig. 5 D ). When the double mutation I328N/P329F was introduced in the P2X2 receptor, which carried the three native glycosylation sites, no functional expression was obtained (data not shown). However, the mutation A335T in this “wild type” background resulted in apparently normal responses to ATP. The failure to observe glycosylation when consensus sequences were introduced into the region N terminus to the first hydrophobic domain is unhelpful with respect to assignment of this domain to one or other side of the membrane, because not all consensus sites are used (24Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether the N and C termini were located on the same side of the membrane by expressing a concatenated cDNA (25Stoop R. Thomas S.L. Buell G. North R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 376Google Scholar). Fig. 6 B shows a Western blot from oocytes injected with the dimeric construct. A single band was observed at a molecular mass of about 120 kDa, indicating that the intact dimeric protein is expressed. Recordings made from the same oocytes, prior to membrane preparation for Western blotting, showed inward currents evoked by ATP (30 μm) which were not obviously different from those seen in oocytes expressing the monomeric wild type protein (data not shown). We have previously shown that substitution of Cys for Thr at position 336 in the P2X2receptor produces a channel in which methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET) almost completely blocks the current evoked by ATP (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). MTSET inhibited the currents by about 50% when the Cys to Thr substitution was made in either the first or second (Fig.6 C ) domain of the dimeric construct, and by close to 100% when the mutation was in both domains (25Stoop R. Thomas S.L. Buell G. North R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 376Google Scholar). These experiments show that the P2X2 receptor is a glycoprotein, in which all three consensus sequences forN -linked glycosylation (N-X -S/T) are used. Among the seven P2X receptor subunits, the number of such consensus sequences ranges from three (P2X2, P2X5, P2X6) to seven (P2X4), and in no case is the consensus sequence found at a corresponding position in all seven sequences. However, the sequence around Asn182 of the P2X2 receptor (N-F-T) is present in all except the P2X5 receptor, and it is also found within a region of the protein showing relatively high homology among all seven subunits. This suggests that it may be glycosylated in them all (except P2X5); indeed, the corresponding residue in the P2X1 receptor provides the only previously known glycosylation site in the P2X receptor family (16Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R.J. Gos A. Antoarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that fully functional ATP-gated channels are found with the point mutation N182S is consistent with the inference from the P2X5receptor sequence that glycosylation at this position is not essential for channel assembly and function. The second of the two sites identified in the present study (Asn239 of N-F-T) also occurs in a relatively highly conserved region of the protein, but in this case the consensus sequence is found only in the P2X2 and P2X7receptors. The third of the three sites found to be glycosylated is the Asn298 of N-G-T; the consensus sequence is found at this position also in the P2X1 and P2X3 receptors but not in the other receptors. A further conserved consensus site that is missing in the P2X2 receptor is found in receptors P2X4–7 (corresponding to Asn255 in the P2X4 receptor), and it will be interesting to determine whether this is also glycosylated. We found that the currents induced by ATP in HEK293 cells expressing P2X2 receptors lacking any one of the three asparagines were essentially normal (Fig. 2), suggesting that none of the attached sugars play a significant role in agonist recognition and binding. On the other hand, receptors in which two or three asparagines were substituted by serine responded to ATP either very poorly or not at all (Fig. 2). We have visualized the cells immunohistochemically using standard fluorescent or confocal laser microscopy: all showed a pattern of plasma membrane localization similar to that seen in the wild type, but the fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced in the receptors lacking two or three (but not one) glycosylation sites. 2A. Newbolt, R. Stoop, C. Virginio, A. Surprenant, R. A. North, G. Buell, and F. Rassendren, unpublished observations. This finding implies that full glycosylation is not necessary for correct protein folding and transport to the plasma membrane. However, further immunohistochemical studies of these receptors tagged in the extracellular domain would be useful to examine whether the unglycosylated protein is correctly inserted in the plasma membrane. The main aim of the present work was to delineate the boundaries of the putative transmembrane domains. We interpret the finding of glycosylation at residues P62N, I66N, and K324N to indicate that these positions are exposed at the extracellular aspect of the membrane; Pro62 is the 11th amino acid residue following the final hydrophobic residue of the first hydrophobic domain (Val51). The failure to observe glycosylation at sites closer to the hydrophobic domain (Q52N, Q56N, and S58N) might be because they are situated within the interfacial region and inaccessible to glycosylating enzymes (23Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), or because these mutations prevent normal folding and membrane expression. The latter interpretation seems less likely in view of the finding of normal functional responses in the wild type P2X2 receptor carrying mutations Q52N, S58N, or P62N. The residues corresponding in position to Gln52, Ser58, and Pro62are highly variable among the seven P2X receptor subunits, and may be presumed to tolerate asparagine. The lack of functional responses in the case of mutations Q56N and I66N indicates that these substitutions are not tolerated; the residues in these positions are identical (all glutamine) or highly conserved (six valine, one isoleucine) among the seven subunits. Altogether, the results are consistent with the interpretation that Q52N and S58N are not glycosylated because they are located too close to the plasma membrane, although other structural reasons can not be excluded. The second hydrophobic domain probably begins with Ile331, although residues at positions 327 and 328 are conserved hydrophobic amino acids in all seven P2X receptor subunits. The present finding that K324N was glycosylated shows clearly that this position is located on the extracellular surface of the cell. In the P2X2receptor in which the three native glycosylation sites were left intact, K324C functions normally and appears not to contribute to the ion permeation pathway (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This Lys residue occurs within a completely conserved motif (G-X -X -G-K-F), which might be thought to resemble that observed in some ATP-binding proteins (26Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar); the finding that Lys324 can be replaced by Cys without obvious change in function argues against any such critical role. In the case of Ile328, substitution by Cys results in a channel which is sensitive to block by MTSET (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). One interpretation of that result is that Ile328 is situated within the outer vestibule of the channel; such close proximity to the membrane could be the reason why no glycosylation was observed when asparagine was introduced at this position. The failure to observe any glycosylation in the case of three engineered Asn residues in the region of the molecule preceding the first hydrophobic domain N terminus is consistent with an intracellular location for this segment. However, direct evidence that both the N and the C termini are located on the same aspect of the membrane was obtained by the construction and expression of a concatenated dimeric cDNA (25Stoop R. Thomas S.L. Buell G. North R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 376Google Scholar). Taken together with previous work, which suggested that the C terminus should be intracellular (17Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that both N and C termini are located within the cell. The observation that the substitution T336C confers responsiveness to MTSET when introduced into either the first or second domain of concatenated subunits is consistent with both subunits of the dimer contributing to the pore (25Stoop R. Thomas S.L. Buell G. North R.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 376Google Scholar). Further quantitative experiments on dimers, trimers, and larger multimers might be interpretable with respect to the channel stoichiometry and are presently in progress. The main conclusion of the present work is that each subunit of the P2X2 receptor, and presumably the other homologous family members, has intracellular N and C termini, two hydrophobic domains (approximately residues 31–51 and 331–353), and a large extracellular loop (52–330). We cannot exclude the possibility that regions of this long loop fold back into the plasma membrane, although we note that any such regions that are predominately hydrophobic are only six or seven amino acids in length. The identification of the natural glycosylation sites indicates that residues 184, 239, and 298 are extracellular. This overall topology is thus similar to that described for the α subunit of the epithelial sodium channels (11Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: 1682-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence homology between the epithelial sodium channels and the FMRFamide-activated (27Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and proton-activated (28Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) channels makes it likely that these other ligand-gated channels share the same overall pattern of membrane insertion, with two transmembrane domains and a large, cysteine-rich extracellular loop. This contrasts clearly with the other large families of ligand-gated ion channels which have either three (glutamate family) or four (nicotinic acetylcholine family) membrane-spanning segments per subunit (see Ref. 10Dani J.A. Mayer M.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2077883613,"Regulated changes in cell volume represent a signal that modulates a broad range of cell and organ functions. In HTC hepatoma cells, increases in volume are coupled to membrane ion permeability through a pathway involving (i) ATP efflux, (ii) autocrine stimulation of P2 receptors, and (iii) increases in anion permeability and Cl− efflux, contributing to recovery of volume toward basal values. Based on recent evidence that cell volume increases also stimulate phosphoinositide kinases, the purpose of these studies was to determine if phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) modulates these pathways. Exposure of cells to hypotonic buffer (20 or 40% less NaCl) caused an initial increase in cell volume and stimulated a rapid increase in ATP release. Subsequent opening of Cl− channels was followed by recovery of cell volume toward basal values, despite the continuous presence of hypotonic buffer. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with wortmannin (K i = 3 nm) significantly inhibited both the rate of volume recovery and activation of Cl−currents; similar results were obtained with LY294002 (10 μm). Additionally, current activation was inhibited by intracellular dialysis with antibodies specific for the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. Since release of ATP is a critical element in the volume-regulatory pathway, the role of PI 3-kinase on volume-stimulated ATP release was assessed. Both wortmannin and LY294002 decreased basal and volume-stimulated ATP permeability but had no effect on the current response to exogenous ATP (10 μm). These findings indicate that PI 3-kinase plays a significant role in regulation of cell volume and suggest that the effects are mediated in part through modulation of cellular ATP release.

Polyphosphoinositides and their metabolites represent novel intracellular signaling molecules recently shown to mediate cellular responses to a number of hormones and growth factors (1Schliess F.

The 3-phosphorylated lipids rapidly increase upon growth factor stimulation, suggesting that they may act as second messengers mediating PI 3-kinase signals (2Kapeller R. Cantley L.C.

PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer composed of a 110-kilodalton catalytic peptide and an 85-kilodalton regulatory peptide, which are tightly associated (1Schliess F. Schreiber R. Haussinger D. Biochem.

Recently, physiologic increases in cell volume have also been shown to be a potent stimulus for PI 3-kinase activation (23Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Regulation of cell volume is mandatory for maintenance of cellular integrity; in addition, the hydration state may represent a means of coupling changes in membrane transport to other organ level functions. In hepatocytes, for example, cell volume increases reproduce many of the metabolic effects of insulin, including stimulation of bile acid secretion, glycogen, and protein synthesis, and gene expression (24Lang F. Busch G.L. Volkl H. Haussinger D. News Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 18-21Google Scholar, 25Al-Habori M. Peak M. Thomas T.H. Agius L. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These and other observations have led to the concept that changes in cell volume per se may represent a signal regulating liver function (26Haussinger D. Lang F. Gerok W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E343-E355PubMed Google Scholar, 27Haussinger D. Boyer J.L. Ockner R.K. Progress in Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 29-53Google Scholar). In model liver cells, increases in cell volume stimulate an adaptive response that involves opening of membrane Cl− channels through an ATP-dependent mechanism (Fig.1). The resulting efflux of Cl− favors water loss and recovery of cell volume toward basal values. Interestingly, liver cell volume increases stimulate parallel activation of multiple kinases, including PI 3-kinase, tyrosine kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (1Schliess F. Schreiber R. Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol.

However, little is known regarding the cellular site(s) of action of these kinases, and the cellular signals involved in volume-dependent Cl− channel regulation in liver have not been defined. Consequently, the purpose of these studies was to assess the potential role of PI 3-kinase in recovery from cell swelling and in cell volume-dependent changes in membrane ion permeability. All studies were performed in HTC cells, a model rat hepatoma cell line that expresses ion channels and purinergic receptors similar to those found in primary rat hepatocytes. Increases in HTC cell volume stimulated by uptake of alanine (29Lidofsky S.D. Roman R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G849-G853PubMed Google Scholar) or exposure to hypotonic buffer (30Bodily K.

Cells on a coverslip were mounted in a chamber (volume ∼400 μl) and perfused at 4–5 ml/min with a standard extracellular solution containing 140 mmNaCl, 4 mmKCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmglucose, and 10 mmHEPES/NaOH (pH ∼7.40). The standard intracellular (pipette) solution for whole-cell recordings contained 130 mmKCl, 10 mmNaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mmHEPES/KOH, 0.5 mmCaCl2 and 1 mmEGTA (pH 7.3), corresponding to a free [Ca2+] of ∼100 nm (37Chang D. Hsieh P.S. Dawson D.C. Comput. Biol. Med. 1988; 18: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning 7052 glass and had a resistance of 3–10 megaohms. Recordings were made with an Axopatch ID amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were digitized (1 kHz) for storage on a computer and analyzed using pCLAMP version 6.0 programs (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (36Lidofsky S.D.

Current-voltage relations were measured between −120 and +100 mV in 20-mV increments (400-ms duration, 2 s between test potentials). In the whole-cell configuration, pipette voltage corresponds to the membrane potential, and upward deflections of the current trace indicate outward membrane current. Changes in membrane Cl− permeability were assessed at a test potential of −80 mV (E k) to minimize any contribution of K+ currents (30Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R.M. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mean cell volume was measured in cell suspensions by electronic cell sizing (Coulter Multisizer, Accucomp software version 1.19, Hialeah, FL) using an aperture of 100 μm. Cells in subconfluent culture were harvested with 0.05% trypsin, suspended in cell culture medium, centrifuged for 1 min at ∼1000 × g , resuspended in 3 ml of isotonic buffer, and incubated with gentle agitation for 30–45 min. Aliquots (∼500 μl) of cell suspension were added to 20 ml of isotonic or hypotonic (40% less NaCl) buffer. Measurements of ∼20,000 cells at specified time points after exposure to isotonic or hypotonic buffer were compared with basal values (time 0). Changes in values are expressed as relative volume normalized to the basal period. As a measure of volume recovery, the percentage of regulatory volume decrease was calculated as (peak relative volume at 3 min − relative volume at measured time point)/(peak relative volume − 1) × 100. Experimental reagents were added as indicated. Cells were grown to confluence in a 35-mm dish, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium plus luciferase-luciferin reagent (2 mg/ml, lyophilized reagent; Sigma). The dish was placed on a platform, lowered into the recording chamber of a Turner model TD20/20 luminometer, and studied immediately in real time. Since background luminescence (cells and medium without luciferase-luciferin reagent) is less than 0.1 arbitrary light unit (ALU), ATP released from cells into the media catalyzes the luciferase-luciferin reaction. Bioluminescence was measured in continuous 15-s photon collection intervals. To induce cell volume increases, the extracellular buffer was diluted 20 or 40% as indicated by the addition of water. In control studies, an equal volume of isotonic buffer was added to assess possible ATP release due to mechanical stimulation (39Grygorczyk R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small changes in bioluminescence associated with isotonic exposures were <10% of values associated with hypotonic exposure (data not shown). Wortmannin (Sigma) and LY294002 (Calbiochem) were used as PI 3-kinase inhibitors (40Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 41Vlahos C.J.

For all studies with wortmannin and LY294002, cells were preincubated with the respective inhibitor for 10 min prior to hypotonic exposure. In separate patch clamp studies, PI 3-kinase was inhibited by intracellular dialysis with a purified rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing a sequence corresponding to residues 1054–1068 of the 110-kilodalton α-catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) (43Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9113: 9185-9189Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibody to β-galactosidase was utilized as a control antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). ATP and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E., with n representing the number of cells for patch clamp studies and the number of culture plates or repetitions for other assays. Student's paired or unpaired t test was used to assess statistical significance as indicated, and p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Exposure of cells to hypotonic buffer (40% decrease in NaCl, ∼205 mosm), caused a rapid initial increase in relative volume to 1.18 ± 0.01 (n = 5,p < 0.001) within 3 min. The increase was followed by gradual recovery toward basal values despite the continued exposure to hypotonic buffer (Fig. 2). To evaluate whether PI 3-kinase contributes to cell volume recovery, analogous studies were performed in the presence of wortmannin. Preincubation with wortmannin (50 nm) resulted in a greater initial volume increase to 1.24 ± 0.01 immediately after hypotonic exposure and caused significant inhibition of volume recovery at all subsequent time points. The relative volume of 1.14 ± 0.01 at 30 min in the presence of wortmannin significantly exceeded control values of 1.07 ± 0.01 (n = 5, p < 0.001, Fig. 2). These findings indicate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase impairs recovery from cell swelling. In HTC cells, cell volume recovery from swelling depends in part upon opening of Cl− channels in the plasma membrane. To assess whether PI 3-kinase contributes to channel opening, whole-cell currents were measured under basal conditions and following cell volume increases induced by hypotonic exposure. ICl− was measured at a test potential of −80 mV and values were reported as current density (pA/pF) to normalize for differences in cell size as recently described (30Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R.M. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Results are compared with control studies (basal and swelling-induced ICl−) measured on the same day to minimize any effects of day-to-day variability in current amplitude. Under basal conditions with standard intra- and extracellular buffers, ICl− was small (<100 pA, ≤ 5 pA/pF). Exposure to hypotonic buffer (20% decrease in bath NaCl, ∼230 mosm), resulted in activation of currents in > 90% of cells within 2–4 min (representative trace shown in Fig.3), increasing current density from −4.6 ± 0.4 pA/pF to −28.1 ± 3.8 pA/pF at −80 mV (p < 0.001, n = 10). Swelling-activated currents exhibited characteristic biophysical features, with reversal near 0 mV ( ECl−), outward rectification, and time-dependent inactivation at depolarizing potentials above +60 mV, as described previously (30Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R.M. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cl− currents were sustained for the duration of hypotonic exposure and were fully reversible within 5 min of return to isotonic perfusate (Fig.3 A ). In the presence of wortmannin (50 nm), the response to hypotonic exposure was completely inhibited: the maximum Cl− current density was −1.2 ± 0.2 pA/pF (n = 9, p < 0.001, Figs. 3 A and 4 A ). Similar results were obtained with LY294002 (10 μm), a structurally unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor (−1.7 ± 0.1 pA/pF, n = 4,p < 0.001, Fig. 4 A ).Figure 4PI 3-kinase inhibitors prevent activation of Cl− currents by cell volume increases. A , exposure of HTC cells to hypotonic buffer (20% less NaCl) increased Cl− current density from −4.6 ± 0.4 pA/pF to −28 ± 3.8 pA/pF (n = 10,p < 0.001). Both wortmannin (50 nm,n = 9, p < 0.001) and LY294002 (10 μm, n = 4, p < 0.001) inhibited this response. Wortmannin had no effect on the response to exogenous ATP (10 μm, n = 5,p < 0.05).

Currents were measured in the presence of wortmannin, and values were normalized to peak currents measured in the absence of wortmannin and expressed asI /I max. Inhibition was concentration dependent, with no effect at values < 0.5 nm and nearly complete inhibition at concentrations ≥ 5 nm. The apparent K i for wortmannin inhibition of swelling-activated Cl− currents was ∼3 nm(n = 6 for each point, Fig. 4 B ). Both wortmannin and LY294002 are thought to be selective inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, but the potential for inhibition of other kinases cannot be fully excluded. Consequently, an alternative strategy was used to assess the specificity of PI 3-kinase using intracellular dialysis with antibodies to the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. This antibody has been shown to inhibit growth factor-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in cultured fibroblasts (43Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9113: 9185-9189Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For these studies, the antibodies were delivered to the cell interior by inclusion in the patch pipette. Intracellular dialysis with anti-PI 3-kinase antibody (5 μg/ml) completely inhibited Cl− currents in response to hypotonic exposure with a maximal average current density of −2.9 ± 1.0 pA/pF. In contrast, currents during intracellular dialysis with antibodies to β-galactosidase (5 μg/ml) were similar to controls (−42.1 ± 5.6 pA/pF, n = 6,p < 0.001; Fig. 5). These findings support a specific role of PI 3-kinase in volume-stimulated Cl− channel activation. As depicted in Fig. 1, PI 3-kinase could potentially modulate current activation and cell volume recovery through stimulation of ATP release, modulation of P2 receptors, or coupling receptor binding to channel opening. To assess the site of action of PI 3-kinase, two strategies were utilized. First, the effect of wortmannin on the current response to ATP was assessed. For these studies, cells in hypotonic buffer were exposed to exogenous ATP in the presence of wortmannin (50 nm). If PI 3-kinase modulates P2receptors or couples receptor binding to Cl− channel opening, the presence of wortmannin would be expected to inhibit ATP-dependent current activation. In the presence of wortmannin, hypotonic exposure failed to activate Cl−currents. However, the subsequent addition of ATP (10 μm) to the perfusate resulted in instantaneous activation of Cl− currents (representative trace, Fig. 3 B ), increasing current density from −1.2 ± 0.4 pA/pF to −37.4 ± 13.1 pA/pF (n = 5, p < 0.05, Fig.4 A ). Second, both removal of extracellular ATP and inhibition of PI 3-kinase with wortmannin delay cell volume recovery from swelling in Coulter counter studies. To assess whether these effects are related, additional studies were performed to assess the rate of recovery from swelling (percentage of regulatory volume decrease) under control conditions in the presence of wortmannin to inhibit PI 3-kinase and in the presence of wortmannin plus exogenous ATP added to the extracellular bath. The presence of exogenous ATP (10 μm) bypassed the inhibitory effects of wortmannin and restored volume recovery with values no different from controls at all subsequent time points (n = 5 for each time point,p < 0.01; Fig. 6). These findings indicate that PI 3-kinase is likely to function more proximally in the signaling pathway by modulating local ATP concentrations outside of the cell. To assess this possibility more directly, the effects of PI 3-kinase inhibition on ATP efflux were evaluated as shown in Figs.7 and 8. In Fig. 7, results are expressed as a change from base line by subtraction of values observed in parallel control studies where cells were exposed to isotonic buffer rather than hypotonic buffer. In Fig. 8, values are presented in absolute numbers without correction for basal release. Cells in isotonic buffer demonstrated spontaneous release of ATP under basal conditions (18.59 ± 2.91 ALU). Exposure of cells to hypotonic perfusate to stimulate cell swelling stimulated ATP efflux (29.11 ± 5.58 ALU at 20% dilution and 35.7 ± 8.06 ALU at 40% dilution), as shown in Fig. 8. Values remained elevated above basal levels for the duration of hypotonic exposure (4 min). Basal values were decreased significantly by both wortmannin (9.67 ± 1.16 ALU) and LY294002 (9.96 ± 1.44 ALU, n = 5 for each; p < 0.05; Fig. 8). Similarly, the response to hypotonic exposure was also inhibited by both wortmannin (12.84 ± 1.42 ALU at 20% dilution, and 15.8 ± 2.04 ALU at 40% dilution) and LY294002 (13.82 ± 2.21 ALU at 20% dilution and 13.43 ± 2.26 ALU at 40% dilution, n = 5 for each; p < 0.05; Fig. 8). These findings indicate that PI 3-kinase activity contributes to regulation of both basal and swelling-activated ATP release.Figure 8PI 3-kinase inhibition attenuates basal and volume-stimulated ATP release. Peak values (expressed as ALU) of ATP released from cell monolayers into media under basal and hypotonic conditions are shown. Preincubation (5 min) of cells with either wortmannin (50 nm) or LY294002 (10 μm) significantly decreased basal ATP permeability (n = 5 for each, p < .05). Exposure to hypotonic buffer (20 or 40% dilutions) stimulated an increase in ATP release from control cells, which was significantly inhibited by both wortmannin and LY294002 (n = 5 for each; p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In hepatocytes and other epithelial cells, physiologic changes in cell volume are closely coupled to membrane ion permeability and directly modulate a broad range of cell and organ functions (44Meng X.J. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C112-C120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, increases in cell volume produced by hypotonic exposure mimic many of the effects of insulin, stimulating protein and glycogen synthesis, bile flow, and exocytosis through selective effects on gene and protein expression (1Schliess F.

The present studies indicate that PI 3-kinase may play a critical intermediary role in this process and suggest that the effects of PI 3-kinase are mediated in part through regulation of electrodiffusional movement of ATP across the plasma membrane. PI 3-kinases catalyze phosphoinositol at the D-3 position of the inositol ring, leading to formation of at least three phosphoinositides that are presumed to function as intracellular second messengers (3Carpenter C.L.

Tyrosine kinase-regulated PI 3-kinase is composed of a 110-kilodalton catalytic subunit that binds ATP, and its function is modified by interactions with a separate 85-kilodalton regulatory subunit. Both wortmannin and LY294002 effectively inhibit kinase activity (40Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 41Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F.

In liver cells, the lipid products of PI 3-kinase are not present under basal conditions. However, exposure to insulin or increases in cell volume lead to rapid kinase activation (23Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin or LY294002 prevents the increases in glycogen synthase activity, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and bile acid excretion normally caused by cell volume increases, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activation represents one of the signals coupling changes in cell volume to cell metabolism and transport (23Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 45Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinricj S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, results in different models have implicated PI 3-kinase as a modulator of vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and bile formation, processes also directly influenced by physiologic changes in cell volume (46Folli F. Alvaro D. Gigliozzi A. Bassotti C. Kahn C.R. Pontiroli A.E. Capocaccia L. Jezequel A.M. Benedetti A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 954-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In these studies of HTC cells, observations using a variety of techniques support a broader role for activation of PI 3-kinase as an early and important step coordinating changes in cell volume and membrane Cl− permeability. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase significantly impairs cell volume recovery after hypotonic exposure and uncouples cell volume from changes in membrane Cl−permeability. These findings appear to be specific for PI 3-kinase. The inhibitory effects of wortmannin are detectable in low nanomolar concentrations (K i ∼3 nm) and in individual cells are partially reversible. Moreover, similar inhibitory effects are caused by LY294002, a structurally unrelated compound that also inhibits the ATP binding activity of p110 (41Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Brown R.F. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Heyworth P.G. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Marder P. Schelm J.A. Rothfuss K.J. Serlin B.S. Simpson P.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2413-2422PubMed Google Scholar, 47Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the potency of these compounds, it is acknowledged that inhibitors can have unanticipated effects on other signaling pathways as well; wortmannin, for example, has recently been shown to inhibit a separate PI 4-kinase in higher concentrations (48Nakanishi S. Catt J.K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 49Wong K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28878-28884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, an alternative strategy was utilized to inhibit PI 3-kinase by intracellular dialysis with antibodies that bind selectively to the p110 catalytic subunit. These antibodies have previously been shown to block growth factor-stimulated PI 3-kinase effects in cultured fibroblasts (43Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9113: 9185-9189Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). When antibodies were allowed to equilibrate with the cell interior by inclusion in the patch pipette, current activation following hypotonic exposure was inhibited. Antibodies unrelated to PI 3-kinase had no effect. These findings are likely to reflect specific inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity through antibody binding to a critical functional site on the cell interior. Several observations indicate that the effects of PI 3-kinase are mediated in part through modulation of cellular ATP release. Previous studies of HTC cells indicate that increases in cell volume lead to electrodiffusional release of ATP. The localized increase in extracellular ATP is thought to activate P2 receptors in the plasma membrane coupled to Cl− channels, and the resulting Cl− efflux contributes to restoration of cell volume toward basal values (31Roman R.M. Wang Y. Lidofsky S.D. Feranchak A.P. Lomri N. Scharschmidt B.F. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21970-21976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 33Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In individual cells, exposure to exogenous ATP (added to the bathing solution) bypasses the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on swelling-induced current activation; and in cell suspensions, supplemental ATP partially reverses the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on cell volume recovery from swelling. Thus, wortmannin is not likely to modulate volume regulatory responses through inhibition of P2 receptors or blockade of membrane Cl− channels. To assess whether PI 3-kinase is functioning at a more proximal site in the signaling cascade, the effect of cell volume on release of ATP from cells into the supernatant was assessed by a sensitive and specific luminometric assay. This approach has a number of advantages over electrophysiologic methods that are based on detection of currents carried by high (100 mm) concentrations of ATP (33Wang Y. Roman R.M. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Specifically, luminometry studies are performed using intact cells maintained in conventional media under conditions where signaling mechanisms are intact, minimizing the potential adverse effects of intracellular dialysis with unphysiologic solutions. In addition, the marked increase in sensitivity of this assay permits detection of ATP in the absence of nucleotidase inhibitors or other agents that might modify ATP availability. Under basal conditions in isotonic buffer, low levels of ATP were always detectable in supernatant media. Increases in cell volume caused a rapid increase in ATP release, and the magnitude of the response was proportional to the transmembrane osmolar gradient. ATP release was not related to apparent cytotoxicity, since the same maneuvers had no effect on trypan blue exclusion, propidium iodide staining, or lactate dehydrogenase release (data not shown). Moreover, ATP release was inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, supporting a specific process mediated by signaling events. In the presence of wortmannin or LY294002, both basal release and the response to hypotonic exposure were significantly diminished. The most direct interpretation is that cell volume-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase is necessary for increases in membrane ATP permeability. These findings are of interest in light of recent evidence that diverse cellular processes are directly regulated by ATP release, metabolism, and binding. Indeed, more than 10 purinergic receptors responding to different nucleotides have been defined by pharmacologic and molecular techniques (32Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 541-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of nucleotide release by changes in cell hydration may provide one mechanism for autocrine/paracrine signaling coupling changes in cell volume and other cell and organ functions. If so, several points merit further investigation. First, it is notable that PI 3-kinase inhibitors failed to completely suppress basal or swelling-induced ATP release and did not completely prevent recovery from cell swelling (Fig. 2). These observations imply that additional PI 3-kinase-independent mechanisms are operative as well. Given the important role for PI 3-kinase in regulation of endocytic and transcytotic pathways (46Folli F. Alvaro D. Gigliozzi A. Bassotti C. Kahn C.R. Pontiroli A.E. Capocaccia L. Jezequel A.M. Benedetti A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 954-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is attractive to speculate that ATP release may involve two separate pools of transporters, including transporters in the plasma membrane and those in submembrane vesicles. By interference with vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal organization, wortmannin could decrease cellular ATP release by preventing insertion of new transporters from submembrane vesicles. Thus, wortmannin would be expected to delay but not eliminate the adaptive responses to cell volume increases. While the present studies do not address these possibilities directly, the findings are consistent with emerging observations in other models. Second, the initial events that couple cell volume increases to activation of PI 3-kinase remain to be identified. Indeed, identifying the proximal signal(s) mediating volume-dependent cellular processes represents a critical focus for many laboratories, and cell volume is known to cause rapid activation of multiple kinases as well as sustained biochemical and genetic effects (1Schliess F. Schreiber R. Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Haussinger D. Boyer J.L. Ockner R.K. Progress in Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 29-53Google Scholar). Since PI 3-kinase utilizes membrane constituents as a substrate, it is possible that changes in the substrate availability or presentation associated with volume may contribute to kinase activity. However, alternative signals including other kinases or stretch-activated ion channels must be considered as well. It is notable, for example, that tyrosine kinases and other G-protein-coupled receptors have also been shown to regulate PI 3-kinase (2Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Third, there are quantitative differences in the time course and/or magnitude of the wortmannin-sensitive parameters involved in cell volume recovery. Wortmannin completely inhibits Cl−current activation in isolated cells, but only partially inhibits ATP release and cell volume recovery. These differences may be related in part to the different experimental techniques used. For example, dialysis of the intracellular space during whole-cell recordings is likely to alter signal transduction and may prevent actual cell volume recovery since the volume of the pipette solution is orders of magnitude greater than the volume of individual cells. While it will be important to address the relationship between ATP release and volume recovery in a more quantitative manner, the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on ATP release, current activation, and volume recovery, measured using different experimental approaches, supports an important role for PI 3-kinase in cell volume regulation. Therefore, PI 3-kinase may be an early and essential signal coupling changes in cell volume to membrane Cl− permeability through effects on cellular ATP release. Given the tissue-specific expression of multiple P2 receptor subtypes, further definition of the mechanisms linking cell volume and ATP release represents an attractive and previously unrecognized target for modulation of the diverse cellular processes regulated by PI 3-kinase."

We discovered that rustmicin inhibits inositol phosphoceramide synthase, resulting in the accumulation of ceramide and the loss of all of the complex sphingolipids. Rustmicin has potent fungicidal activity against clinically important human pathogens that is correlated with its sphingolipid inhibition. It is especially potent against Cryptococcus neoformans , where it inhibits growth and sphingolipid synthesis at concentrations <1 ng/ml and inhibits the enzyme with an IC50 of 70 pm. This inhibition of the membrane-bound enzyme is reversible; moreover, rustmicin is nearly equipotent against the solubilized enzyme. Rustmicin was efficacious in a mouse model for cryptococcosis, but it was less active than predicted from its in vitro potency against this pathogen. Stability and drug efflux were identified as two factors limiting rustmicin's activity. In the presence of serum, rustmicin rapidly epimerizes at the C-2 position and is converted to a γ-lactone, a product that is devoid of activity.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycetous fungus that infects immunocompromised patients, initiating in the lungs and migrating to the central nervous system, where it results in meningoencephalitis. Over 80% of cryptococcosis cases are found in advanced stage human immunodeficiency virus patients, and C. neoformans is one of the most common opportunistic infections in this population. In recent years, the incidence has declined (1Mundy L.M. Powderly W.G. Semin. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 18: 249-257Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 2Graybill J.R. Clin. Infect. Diseases. 1996; 22: S166-S178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decline has been attributed to the widespread use of fluconazole, a fungistatic agent that is effective but requires lifelong suppressive therapy to prevent relapse in AIDS patients. Fluconazole has also been used successfully to treat fungal infections caused by Candida albicans and other Candida species, but a worrisome development is the emergence of species that are intrinsically resistant to azoles, such as Candida glabrata andCandida krusei , as well as the appearance of a variety ofCandida isolates that have acquired resistance.Aspergillus and Fusarium species are mycelial fungi that are also relatively resistant to fluconazole; these pathogens are particularly aggressive and the incidence of mortality from aspergillosis is very high (2Graybill J.R. Clin. Infect. Diseases. 1996; 22: S166-S178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased use of prophylactic antifungal therapy will probably exacerbate the resistance problem; thus, new treatments are urgently needed.We have been investigating the sphingolipid pathway as a novel target for antifungal therapy. Serine palmitoyltransferase, the first committed enzyme of sphingolipid synthesis in mammalian and fungal cells, condenses serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form the long chain sphingoid base, ketodihydrosphingosine. Several structurally diverse natural product inhibitors of this enzyme with antifungal activity have been discovered including sphingofungins (3Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W.

Ketodihydrosphingosine is reduced to dihydrosphingosine and can be further modified to phytosphingosine in fungi and sphingosine in mammals.

IPC is further modified by the addition of mannose and a second inositol phosphate group to make mannosyl inositol phosphoceramide and mannosyl diinositol diphosphoceramide (15Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the only phosphosphingolipid is sphingomyelin, which contains phosphocholine at the C-1 hydroxyl of ceramide. There is, however, an enormous class of glycosylated sphingolipids containing a variety of complex modifications of the carbohydrate moiety. Some fungi, including pathogenic species of Aspergillus , have been reported to make glycosphingolipids (16Boas M.H.S.V. Egge H. Pohlentz G. Hartmann R. Bergter E.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 70: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the major sphingolipids of C. albicans and C. neoformans have the phosphoinositol moiety (15Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar, 17Vincent V.L. Klig L.S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, two antifungal agents that inhibit inositol phosphoceramide synthase were described, aureobasidin A1 (18Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and khafrefungin (14Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Rosenbach M. Milligan J. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G. Kurtz M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32709-32714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Khafrefungin was found to be selective at inhibiting sphingolipid synthesis in fungi, whereas compounds that affect earlier steps in the pathway also inhibit mammalian enzymes.During the course of our studies on inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis, we discovered that rustmicin selectively inhibits fungal sphingolipid synthesis. Rustmicin is a macrolide antifungal agent that was isolated over 10 years ago by two independent groups. It was isolated from fermentations of Micromonospora chalcea and named rustmicin for its activity against wheat stem rust fungus (Puccinia graminis ) (19Takatsu T. Nakayama H. Shimazu A. Furihata K. Ikeda K. Furihata K. Seto H. Otake N. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1985; 38: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Almost simultaneously, the same structural compound was reported as galbonolide A fromStreptomyces galbus culture broths, with potent activity against Botrytis cinerea and several other phytopathogens (20Achenbach H. Muhlenfeld A. Fauth U. Zahner H. Tet. Lett. 1985; 26: 6167-6170Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Fauth U. Zahner H. Muhlenfeld A. Achenbach H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mode of action studies indicated that rustmicin did not destabilize the membrane or inhibit the synthesis of chitin, DNA, or RNA, but the mechanism of fungal growth inhibition was not determined (22Achenbach H. Muhlenfeld A. Fauth U. Zahner H. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 544: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have discovered that rustmicin has extraordinarily potent antifungal activity against several human pathogens, especiallyC. neoformans . Moreover, its antifungal activity is due to inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis at the IPC synthase, where rustmicin demonstrates inhibition at picomolar levels. The sphingolipid inhibitory activity and the in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of rustmicin are presented in this paper.DISCUSSIONSphingolipids comprise a small but essential fraction of fungal phospholipids. Differences between mammalian and fungal sphingolipid biosynthesis, especially at later steps in the pathway, make this an attractive new target for antifungal therapy. Many natural products have been discovered as inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis; these compounds, which are primarily produced by fungi, have potent, fungicidal activity against a broad spectrum of clinical pathogens (3Zweerink M.M.

Our studies in this area led to the rediscovery3 of an actinomycete product known as rustmicin or galbonolide A (19Takatsu T. Nakayama H. Shimazu A. Furihata K. Ikeda K. Furihata K. Seto H. Otake N.

This compound is a 14-membered macrolide, previously isolated for its antifungal activity against phytopathogens but whose mechanism of fungal growth inhibition was not determined. Taxonomic studies on our actinomycete culture indicated that the producing organism was Micromonospora but differed from 12 described species, including M. chalcea , which is known to produce rustmicin. 4J. M. Sigmund and C. F. Hirsch, submitted for publication. Here we demonstrate that rustmicin inhibits fungal sphingolipid synthesis at the transfer of phosphoinositol to ceramide. Cells treated with rustmicin accumulate ceramide, fail to synthesize all of the complex sphingolipids, and die. In mammalian cells, ceramide has been proposed to be a key intermediate in lipid signal transduction pathways leading to apoptosis and stress response (31Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 32Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.-M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 33Pena L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Spiegel S. Milstein S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A similar pathway appears to operate in S. cerevisiae where ceramide induces G1 arrest via a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (35Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and promotes cell death in an IPC synthase mutant that responds to the addition of phytosphingosine by accumulating ceramide (18Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of a ceramide death response may confer the observed fungicidal activity to inhibitors of IPC synthase. If so, then ceramide toxicity is a slow process, since the loss in viability required several generations to manifest itself.Alternatively, depletion of IPC or one of its further metabolites by rustmicin may induce cell death, and arguments can be made for the involvement of complex sphingolipids in several essential processes. Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored mannoproteins constitute a major component of fungal cell walls; initially, they are synthesized with PI as the lipid moiety, but many are subsequently remodeled to IPC (36Conzelmann A. Puoti A. Lester R.L. Desponds C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The sphingolipid intermediate that is used for replacement has not yet been established, so it is not clear whether inhibitors of IPC synthase would block this process. Sphingolipids have also been shown to be important for the processing of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins through the secretory pathway (37Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recently, another role for sphingolipids in vesicular secretion has been proposed, based on studies of suppressors of the sec14 mutant encoding the phosphatidylinositol:phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (38Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These studies point to a requirement for diacylglycerol in vesicular budding from the Golgi and indicate that the rate of sphingolipid synthesis is important in regulating diacylglycerol concentrations due to the two biosynthetic steps that generate diacylglycerol: IPC and mannosyl diinositol diphosphoceramide synthesis, both of which transfer phosphoinositol from PI to the sphingolipid backbone. Rustmicin inhibits the synthesis of all of the complex sphingolipids and would be predicted to reduce diacylglycerol production at the ER, where IPC is thought to be synthesized, and at the Golgi, where the mannose-containing sphingolipids are made (39Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Yet another function for sphingolipids in vesicular secretion and/or endocytosis has been proposed, due to the presence of the very long chain fatty acids (C24 and C26 species) that are complexed with sphingoid bases to form ceramide. In yeast, most of the very long chain fatty acids are found in the sphingolipid fraction; these fatty acids have been suggested to be important for providing physical stability to highly curved membranes, thereby allowing membranes to undergo budding and fusion (40Schneiter R. Kohlwein S.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For any of these potential roles, dilution of the existing pools of sphingolipids would be required before cell death and would be consistent with the kinetics of rustmicin's fungicidal activity and requirement for actively growing cultures to induce cell death.In addition to its activity in Saccharomyces , where the role of sphingolipids is beginning to be elucidated, rustmicin also has potent antifungal activity against clinically important human pathogens, suggesting that the requirement for sphingolipids is conserved among these fungi. A. fumigatus is one of the few human pathogens that is insensitive to any of the known IPC synthase inhibitors (14Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Rosenbach M. Milligan J. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G. Kurtz M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32709-32714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Takesako K. Kuroda H. Inoue T. Haruna F. Yoshikawa Y. Kato I. J. Antibiotics. 1993; 46: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The reason for this resistance is not known, since inhibitors of earlier steps in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway do inhibit the growth of A. fumigatus . Khafrefungin, which is composed of an aldonic acid esterified to a linear C22polyketide, is most potent against IPC synthase of C. albicans (14Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Rosenbach M. Milligan J. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G. Kurtz M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32709-32714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, the cyclic depsipeptide compound, aureobasidin A, which has been shown to inhibit IPC synthase inS. cerevisiae (18Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), is most potent as an antifungal agent against C. albicans (29Takesako K. Kuroda H. Inoue T. Haruna F. Yoshikawa Y. Kato I. J. Antibiotics. 1993; 46: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), presumably due to its sphingolipid inhibition.Among the three structurally diverse IPC synthase inhibitors, rustmicin is unique in its remarkable activity against C. neoformans, where it is an exceptionally potent inhibitor of IPC synthase. Rustmicin inhibits the enzyme from C. neoformans with an IC50 of 70 pm, and is a low nanomolar inhibitor of the enzymes from C. albicans and S. cerevisae . The complexity of the system, which consists of a membrane-bound enzyme operating on membrane components, precluded determining the kinetic mechanism of inhibition, but simple wash-out experiments clearly showed that rustmicin is a reversible inhibitor. In addition, it was possible to show that potent inhibition extends to the solubilized enzyme fromC. neoformans, establishing that inhibition by rustmicin is specific to the enzyme and not due to possible effects on its membrane environment. Recovery of active enzyme from the supernatant required the inclusion of PI during solubilization. We attribute this effect either to stabilization of the enzyme by binding one of its substrates, a property common to many enzymes, or to preservation of a membrane-like environment in the mixed detergent/phospholipid micelles. Solubilization of IPC synthase from S. cerevisae did not require the addition of PI, a difference that may be due to the use of a 5-fold higher ratio of membrane-protein to detergent, in which the cellular phospholipids may obviate the need for exogenous PI, or the inclusion of glycerol during solubilization (41Ko J. Cheah S. Fischl A.S. J. Food. Biochem. 1995; 19: 253-267Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Rustmicin's affinity for the C. neoformans enzyme contributes, but cannot fully account for, the large differential in antifungal activity between C. neoformans and C. albicans , which is 4–5 orders of magnitude. Two factors that limit rustmicin's whole cell activity, instability and multidrug efflux pumps, may have more influence on rustmicin's activity againstC. albicans and S. cerevisiae over the extended time period of the fungal growth assays. Both of these yeasts have active plasma membrane H+-ATPases that rapidly acidify the media of growing cultures (42Monk B.C. Kurtz M.B. Marrinan J.A. Perlin D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rustmicin is degraded within minutes at low pH (Fig. 5), and buffering the media at pH 5.5 to promote stability improved rustmicin's anti-Saccharomyces and anti-Candida activity by 2–8-fold (data not shown). Perhaps of greater impact on whole cell activity is the activity of efflux pumps. Several multidrug efflux pumps have been identified in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae and one of the mechanisms for fluconazole resistance in C. albicans has been shown to be via drug efflux pumps (24Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 43Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Ischer F. Pagani J.-L. Monod M. Bille J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2378-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). We found that disruption ofPDR5 dramatically improved rustmicin's potency againstS. cerevisiae . Multidrug efflux mechanisms and plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity have not been characterized inC. neoformans , but rustmicin's equal potency of growth inhibition and in vitro enzyme inhibition suggest that these factors are not important for this pathogen, at least in the laboratory. However, we believe that the conversion of rustmicin to the inactive γ-lactone that occurs rapidly in serum, compromises in vivo efficacy and best accounts for the relatively weak activity that rustmicin has in reducing cryptococcal load in mice, compared with its in vitro potency.Multidrug efflux affects the activity of many structurally and mechanistically unrelated inhibitors in yeast, and in mammalian cells is one of the major obstacles to successful chemotherapy. In S. cerevisiae , disruption of PDR5 increases sensitivity to a number of compounds (24Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), while mutations in PDR1 that result in transcriptional activation of several genes, includingPDR5 , have been found to confer resistance to over 30 compounds (28Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, the response we obtained to rustmicin with these mutants was not surprising, but the magnitude of the effect was far more dramatic than any of the other antifungals we examined. In mammalian cells, a special relationship between multidrug efflux and glycosphingolipid synthesis was proposed due to the observed accumulation of glucosylceramides in multidrug-resistant tumor and cancer cell lines (44Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and the discovery that compounds that reverse multidrug resistance inhibit glucosylceramide synthesis (30Lavie Y. Cao H. Volner A. Lucci A. Han T. Geffen V. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1682-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to consider that sphingolipid synthesis in yeast may also contribute to drug resistance via the efflux pumps. For instance, the global transcriptional activation seen in PDR1 mutants may also include up-regulation of sphingolipid synthesis, and/or inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis may regulate the activity of the yeast efflux pumps. We have found that yeast cells with reduced levels of sphingolipids, either by mutation or drug treatment, are hypersensitive to many unrelated antifungals. However, drug hypersensitivity is also found in sterol synthesis mutants and has been attributed to changes in membrane fluidity and permeability (26Gaber R.F. Copple D.M. Kennedy B.K. Vidal M. Bard M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This explanation could account for the sphingolipid effect, and the differential activity of rustmicin against the drug-resistant strains may simply reflect affinity for Pdr5p. The multidrug resistance network has been well developed in yeast (28Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and provides the genetic tools that, in combination with the lipid biosynthetic inhibitors and mutants, could help define the interactions between lipid synthesis and drug efflux pumps. Rustmicin, despite its in vivo limitations, is a highly potent IPC synthase inhibitor and will be an important tool to study the role of the inositol sphingolipids in yeast and fungal cell physiology. Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycetous fungus that infects immunocompromised patients, initiating in the lungs and migrating to the central nervous system, where it results in meningoencephalitis. Over 80% of cryptococcosis cases are found in advanced stage human immunodeficiency virus patients, and C. neoformans is one of the most common opportunistic infections in this population. In recent years, the incidence has declined (1Mundy L.M. Powderly W.G. Semin. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 18: 249-257Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 2Graybill J.R. Clin. Infect. Diseases. 1996; 22: S166-S178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decline has been attributed to the widespread use of fluconazole, a fungistatic agent that is effective but requires lifelong suppressive therapy to prevent relapse in AIDS patients. Fluconazole has also been used successfully to treat fungal infections caused by Candida albicans and other Candida species, but a worrisome development is the emergence of species that are intrinsically resistant to azoles, such as Candida glabrata andCandida krusei , as well as the appearance of a variety ofCandida isolates that have acquired resistance.Aspergillus and Fusarium"
https://openalex.org/W2130570164,"In many nonexcitable cells, depletion of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive store activates Ca2+ influx, a process termed store-operated Ca2+ entry. In rat basophilic leukemia cells, emptying of the stores activates a highly selective Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ current (CRAC),I CRAC. We have recently found thatI CRAC activates in an essentially all-or-none manner when the current is evoked by receptor stimulation, dialysis with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate via the patch pipette, or through the Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (Parekh, A. B., Fleig, A., and Penner, R. (1997) Cell 89, 973–980). Regulatory mechanisms must therefore operate to control the overall amount of Ca2+ that enters through CRAC channels. Such mechanisms include membrane potential and protein kinase C. In the present study, we have investigated additional inhibitory pathways that serve to determine just how much Ca2+ can enter throughI CRAC. We have directly measured the current using the whole cell patch clamp technique. We report the presence of a slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation mechanism that curtails Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels. This inactivation mechanism is switched on by Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels, and therefore constitutes a slow negative feedback process. Although it requires a rise in intracellular Ca2+ for activation, it maintains CRAC channels inactive even under conditions that lower intracellular Ca2+ levels. The inactivation mechanism does not involve store refilling, protein phosphorylation, G proteins, nor Ca2+-dependent enzymes. It accounts for up to 70% of the total inactivation ofI CRAC, and therefore appears to be a dominant inhibitory mechanism. It is likely to be an important factor that shapes the profile of the Ca2+ signal in these nonexcitable cells.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). This mechanism was originally proposed by Putney (2Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar) and called capacitative Ca2+ influx. Patch-clamp experiments have identified a variety of Ca2+-permeable channels in the plasma membrane that seem to underlie capacitative Ca2+ influx (reviewed in Ref. 3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). These channels differ in their biophysical properties and are generically referred to as store-operated Ca2+ channels (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Of the store-operated Ca2+ currents, the best characterized is I CRAC, which was originally discovered in mast cells (5Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). I CRAC has subsequently been shown to exist in several different nonexcitable cells including basophils, T cells and megakaryocytes (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). CRAC channels are remarkably selective for Ca2+ ions and have a low single-channel conductance (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Just how depletion of the stores activates CRAC channels is still unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed but the signal has not been unequivocably identified (reviewed in Refs. 3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

One interesting aspect of I CRAC is that the current activates in an essentially all-or-none manner, irrespective of whether activation is evoked by dialysis with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, receptor stimulation, or thapsigargin (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One consequence of this is that, if I CRAC activates in an all-or-none manner, mechanisms must exist that control the amount of Ca2+ entering the cell through CRAC channels. This is required in order to achieve graded activation of Ca2+-dependent processes like secretion that correlate with the level of cell stimulation by receptors. We have recently reported that Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells can be graded, despite all-or-none activation, because of several regulatory mechanisms that serve to control CRAC channel activity (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One way is by changing the membrane potential. Hyperpolarization increases the electrical gradient for Ca2+ entry, thus favoring further Ca2+influx, whereas depolarization decreases the driving force and hence reduces Ca2+ entry (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). I CRAC is also regulated by protein kinase C. Stimulation of this enzyme inactivates I CRAC. Since protein kinase C will be activated by diacylglycerol, which is produced following stimulation of receptors that engage the phosphoinositide pathway, it constitutes an important negative feedback mechanism on Ca2+ influx (7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In mast cells and jurkat T lymphocytes, I CRAC is subjected to a fast inactivation process operating on a milliseconds time scale. This arises from Ca2+ ions entering the cell through CRAC channels and then binding to sites probably located on the channels themselves (5Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Here we report an additional mechanism that serves to regulate CRAC channels. We find that Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels exerts a slow feedback inhibition that curtails further Ca2+ entry and which is dependent on a rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Slow inactivation accounts for up to 70% of the inhibition of I CRAC. Once activated, this slow inactivation mechanism can maintain CRAC channels in an inactivated state for several minutes, even after intracellular Ca2+ levels have been reduced. Hence slow inactivation appears to be a dominant inhibitory mechanism that determines the time course of Ca2+ influx following store depletion in RBL cells. It also provides an additional mechanism whereby the amount of Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels can be regulated despite all-or-none Ca2+ entry. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) cells were kindly supplied by Michael Pilot, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen, Germany, and were cultured essentially as described previously (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Patch-clamp experiments were conducted in the tight seal whole cell configuration at room temperature (18–25 °C) as described previously (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg), sylgard-coated, and fire-polished. Pipettes had d.c. resistances of 2.5–4 megohms when filled with standard internal solution that contained (in mm): cesium glutamate 145, NaCl 8, MgCl2 1, MgATP 1, InsP3 0.03, EGTA 1.4, HEPES 10, pH 7.2, with CsOH. A correction of +10 mV was applied for the subsequent liquid junction potential. In some experiments, the EGTA concentration was raised to 14 mm (indicated in text) or substituted with BAPTA. Drugs were added to this internal solution as described in the text. Extracellular solution contained (in mm): NaCl 145, KCl 2.8, CaCl2 10, MgCl2 2, CsCl 10, glucose 10, HEPES 10, pH 7.2 (NaOH). CsCl was present to block the activity of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel. High resolution current recordings were acquired by a computer-based patch-clamp amplifier system (EPC-9, HEKA Electronics, Germany). Capacitative currents were canceled before each voltage ramp using the automatic compensation of the EPC-9. Series resistance was between 5 and 15 megohms. Currents were filtered using an 8-pole Bessel filter at 2.5 kHz and digitized at 100 μs. I CRAC was measured using either voltage ramps (−100 to +100 mV in 50 ms) or voltage steps (pulses to −80 mV for 200 ms) applied every 2 s using PULSE software (HEKA Electronics) on a 9500 PowerMac. Cells were held at 0 mV between pulses. All currents were leak subtracted by averaging the first two to four ramps/steps after breaking in and then subtracting this from all subsequent traces. Several parameters (capacitance, series resistance, holding current) were displayed simultaneously on a second monitor at a slower rate (2 Hz) using the X-Chart display (HEKA Electronics). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., and statistical evaluation was carried out using Student's unpaired t test. Previous work has demonstrated that I CRAC inactivates partially when RBL cells are dialyzed with a patch pipette solution containing a high concentration of the slow Ca2+ chelator EGTA (10 mm), and this is due to a kinase-mediated phosphorylation (7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the effects of more moderate calcium buffering on the properties ofI CRAC by including 1.4 mm EGTA in the recording pipette. Fig.1 A (i ) shows an experiment in which the internal solution contained 30 μmInsP3 (a supramaximal concentration) (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and 1.4 mm EGTA. Cells were voltage clamped at 0 mV andI CRAC was monitored using voltage ramps applied every two seconds (shown in Fig. 1 A (ii )). The current was measured at −80 mV. Fig. 1 A (i ) depicts the time course of the current during the experiment. Following the onset of whole cell recording, I CRACactivated as InsP3 diffused into the cell from the recording pipette and depleted the stores. The time constant for activation (τ) was 15.2 ± 1.6 s, similar to our previous measurements (19.4 ± 1.2 s) (9Parekh A.B. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The current peaked after 50–80 s and then inactivated substantially with time. For the cell shown in Fig. 1 A (i ), the current had fallen by 70% (relative to the peak amplitude) after 300 s. Fig.1 A (ii ) shows I–V relationships for the two time points indicated in Fig. 1 A (i ) (a andb ). The current measured in the ramps exhibited the classic features of I CRAC: voltage-independent activation, inward rectification, and a reversal potential close to +60 mV. We also monitored activity of I CRAC by applying voltage steps to −80 mV for 200 ms every 2 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. In Fig. 1 B (i ), the time course of I CRAC is plotted using this protocol, and Fig. 1 B (ii ) shows the inward current measured during these hyperpolarizing pulses. During the step,I CRAC inactivated by up to 40% with a time constant in the range of 50 ms (Fig. 1 B (ii )). This fast inactivation has been described in detail in T cells and arises from local feedback inactivation by Ca2+ ions in the vicinity of the channel pore (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We measured the steady-state current during the step (indicated by the arrow in 1B (ii )), and this amplitude is plotted against time in Fig. 1 B (i ). As with the ramp protocol employed in Fig. 1 A , I CRACinactivated substantially during the experiment. For the cell shown in Fig. 1 B , the current amplitude at 300 s had fallen by 68% relative to the peak value. Fig. 1 C plots the time course ofI CRAC measured using either the ramp or step methods (six cells each). These experiments were carried out such that ramps or steps were applied to alternate cells on the same coverslips (henceforth referred to as paired experiments). There was no significant difference between ramp or step protocols with respect to τactivation (15.2 ± 1.6 versus 17.7 ± 2.0 s, respectively) peak amplitude (−2.98 ± 0.24versus −2.58 ± 0.19 pA/pF) or in the extent of steady-state inactivation (fallen by 53.4 ± 8.9%versus 56.1 ± 9.3%, respectively, Fig.1 C ). This inactivation in the presence of moderate Ca2+buffering will henceforth be referred to as slow inactivation to distinguish it from the fast inactivation seen during the hyperpolarizing step. In some cells, slow inactivation was very prominent and contributed to an almost complete inactivation ofI CRAC. Typical examples of this type of response are shown in Figs. 3 B and 5 A . In some other cells, slow inactivation contributed to around a 50% decrease in the amplitude of I CRAC (e.g. Fig.5 C ). Overall, there was little difference between preparations, with the average decrease being 64.8 ± 7.9% (n = 35, measured using the step protocol after 300 s).Figure 5Slow inactivation is not affected by a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. A , dialysis with the broad kinase inhibitor H-7 (200 μm) did not affect slow inactivation relative to a control cell from the same coverslip. See also Table II. B , preincubation for 30 min with the broad phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (1 μm) was ineffective on slow inactivation. Okadaic acid was also included in the recording pipette. Okadaic acid enhanced Ca2+ influx inXenopus oocytes after application of lysophosphatidic acid (n = 2), as described in Petersen and Berridge (19Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 432: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hence okadaic acid was active. C , dialysis with the nonhydrolyzable GDP analogue GDPβS (300 μm) did not interfere with slow inactivation relative to control cells. GDPβS prevented activation of I CRAC by the adenosine receptor agonist NECA in two cells, indicating it was active (7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).D , pretreatment with the Ca2-activated protease inhibitor calpeptin (2 μm), as well as its inclusion in the recording pipette, failed to alter slow inactivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In experiments where drugs were used to interfere with slow inactivation, control responses were always obtained from the same preparation and the data were compared with these controls. To confirm that slow inactivation is dependent on a rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels, we dialyzed cells with a pipette solution in which the EGTA concentration had been increased 10-fold (to 14 mm). Pooled data from 10 cells in 14 mm EGTA and eight cells in 1.4 mm EGTA are summarized in Fig. 1 D (paired recordings). Slow inactivation was reduced by almost 2-fold in the presence of the higher EGTA concentration and appears therefore to require a rise in intracellular free Ca2+ because it can be suppressed by increasing the concentration of a slow mobile Ca2+ buffer in the cytosol. The inset of Fig. 1 D shows current traces taken from the voltage steps from two cells dialysed with 1.4 and 14 mmEGTA. Fast inactivation was the same in both cells, yet slow inactivation was less pronounced in the presence of higher EGTA. Fast and slow inactivation therefore reflect distinct processes. To assess the contribution of Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels to the slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation, we carried out a series of experiments in which the electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ influx was altered. First, we modified the electrical gradient by applying voltage pulses to potentials that either reduced Ca2+ entry (−40 mV) or enhanced it (−120 mV), relative to the responses obtained on pulsing to −80 mV. Typical results are shown in Fig. 2 A , and the data are summarized in Table I. Stepping the voltage to −40 mV reduced the rate and extent of inactivation almost 2-fold (Fig. 2 A (i ) and Table I). The current at −40 mV in Fig. 2 A (i ) has been scaled so that it has the same amplitude as that at −80 mV in order to clearly show the slower inactivation. Voltage pulses to −120 mV, however, did not increase the level of steady-state inactivation compared with that seen on stepping to −80 mV (Fig. 2 A (ii ), where the current at −80 mV has been scaled, see also Table I), which might suggest that sufficient Ca2+ enters at −80 mV to maximally activate the inhibitory process.Table IEffect of changing the electrochemical gradient for calcium entry on slow inactivationTreatmentNormalizedI maxSteady-state currentτactivationNo. of cellspA/pF% peaks1.4 BAPTA, −80 mV−1.90 ± 0.1748.9 ± 8.617.6 ± 1.261.4 EGTA, −40 mV−1.20 ± 0.0765.3 ± 3.818.6 ± 4.441.4 EGTA, −80 mV−1.60 ± 0.0535.7 ± 6.716.8 ± 1.841.4 EGTA, −120 mV−2.81 ± 0.3042.0 ± 5.813.9 ± 1.741.4 EGTA, 4 Ca2+ −80 mV−1.20 ± 0.1762.0 ± 6.518.6 ± 4.13In all experiments, 30 μm InsP3 was included in the recording pipette. 1.4 mm BAPTA/EGTA refers to 1.4 mm of total chelator. The voltage represents the potential to which the cells were stepped. All experiments were carried out in 10 mm external Ca2+, except the last row in which the bath solution contained 4 mm instead. The difference in steady-state current between 1.4 EGTA, −40 mV and 1.4 EGTA, −80 mV was significant (p < 0.02), whereas the difference between 1.4 EGTA, −80 mV and 1.4 EGTA, −120 mV was not (p > 0.4). The difference between 1.4 EGTA, −80 mV and 1.4 BAPTA, −80 mV was also not significant (p > 0.2). There were no significant differences between the τactivation values. Open table in a new tab In all experiments, 30 μm InsP3 was included in the recording pipette. 1.4 mm BAPTA/EGTA refers to 1.4 mm of total chelator. The voltage represents the potential to which the cells were stepped. All experiments were carried out in 10 mm external Ca2+, except the last row in which the bath solution contained 4 mm instead.

The difference between 1.4 EGTA, −80 mV and 1.4 BAPTA, −80 mV was also not significant (p > 0.2). There were no significant differences between the τactivation values. In a second set of experiments, we reduced the concentration gradient for Ca2+ influx, while leaving the electrical driving force unchanged. This was accomplished by lowering the external Ca2+ concentration in the bath to 4 mm (from 10 mm). A typical example is shown in Fig. 2 B , in which the cell was hyperpolarized to −80 mV at 2-s intervals. Steady-state inactivation was less pronounced (22% for this cell, see also Table I). The fact that slow inactivation was reduced following a decrease only in the concentration gradient for Ca2+ entry while the electrical gradient was unchanged suggests that it is predominantly a Ca2+-dependent rather than a voltage-dependent phenomenon. The preceding results demonstrate that I CRAC is subject to a negative feedback mechanism in which Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels induces a slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Fast negative feedback inactivation of CRAC channels operates on a milliseconds time-scale and can be substantially reduced by inclusion of the fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA in the recording pipette, whereas it is not altered by increasing the concentration of the slower Ca2+ chelator EGTA (8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Replacing EGTA with the fast chelator BAPTA (both at 1.4 mm) did not significantly affect the rate or extent of inactivation (six cells, Fig. 2 C and Table I). However, rapid inactivation of I CRAC was slightly slowed by this concentration of BAPTA (1.2–1.4-fold, data not shown), reinforcing the notion that the inactivation we observe is distinct from the fast inactivation process. Although Ca2+ entry is important for initiating slow inactivation, we set out to determine whether slow inactivation still required Ca2+ entry even after the inactivation process had started to develop. Fig.3 describes two types of experiment which were designed to address this. In Fig. 3 A , hyperpolarizing steps to −80 mV were repetitively applied every 2 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. Once inactivation had clearly developed (at 200 s), the cell was held continuously at +20 mV for 30 s. At this positive potential, very little Ca2+ enters through CRAC channels (6Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After 30 s, the cell was held again at 0 mV and hyperpolarizing steps were resumed. The amplitude ofI CRAC increased only slightly relative to the level it had reached prior to clamping the cell at +20 mV (four of nine cells). In the other five cells, no recovery was observed at all. Fig. 3 B shows an experiment in whichI CRAC had inactivated fully by 300 s. Hyperpolarizing pulses were stopped and the cell was held at 0 mV for 120 s. Hyperpolarizing pulses were then resumed. No recovery ofI CRAC occurred (three of four cells). In one cell, the amplitude of I CRAC recovered by 9%. Taken together, these results suggest that, once initiated, Ca2+-dependent slow inactivation ofI CRAC is sustained despite using maneuvers that reduce Ca2+ influx. The following set of experiments were aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism that gave rise to the slow inactivation ofI CRAC. In the presence of moderate concentrations of EGTA, it is conceivable that Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels might enable the intracellular Ca2+ stores to refill, a process that would turn off I CRAC. If such a mechanism were responsible for the inactivation of I CRAC, then one would predict that maneuvers directed toward reducing Ca2+ uptake into the stores should prevent slow inactivation from occurring. Thapsigargin is a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+ATPase on the endoplasmic reticulum and prevents store refilling (10Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out paired recordings in which six control cells were dialyzed with internal solution containing InsP3 and 1.4 mm EGTA, whereas six other cells from the same preparations were dialyzed with this solution supplemented with 2 μm thapsigargin. Fig.4 A shows the averaged results. Slow inactivation was only slightly reduced by thapsigargin, but this was not statistically significant. Thapsigargin is lipophilic, so it is possible that the drug diffuses out of the cell into the bath solution. Because we included a high concentration of thapsigargin in the pipette (2 μm), one would be surprised if the steady-state cytoplasmic concentration was less than a few hundred nanomolar, a concentration that is sufficient to reduce Ca2+ATPase activity in a variety of cell types (10Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). In two cells, we applied thapsigargin (1 μm) from the outside just after the onset of I CRAC (thapsigargin was also included in the recording pipette). The current still inactivated (by 53 and 61%). Nevertheless, we sought additional ways to probe the effects of compromised store refilling on slow inactivation. One method would be to employ the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Ionomycin increases the permeability of the store membrane to Ca2+, and this would enable any Ca2+ that had been pumped into the stores to diffuse back into the cytosol thereby preventing stores from refilling. We included 2 μm ionomycin in the recording pipette together with InsP3 and 1.4 mm EGTA. Fig. 4 B shows the effects of ionomycin.I CRAC activated slightly faster in ionomycin-treated cells (τ of 16.1 ± 1.7 sversus 22.7 ± 3.0 s in control paired cells), which might indicate that ionomycin is diffusing into the cells rather quickly and accelerating store depletion in combination with InsP3. Slow inactivation of I CRACwas still apparent in the presence of ionomycin, and the current declined to a value similar to that seen in the absence of ionomycin in paired recordings (six cells for ionomycin, five for controls). We tested the possible involvement of a kinase-mediated phosphorylation reaction in the Ca2+-dependent slow inactivation in RBL cells in two independent ways. First, we examined the effects of removing ATP from the pipette solution and then replacing it with ATPγS, and second, we tested the effects of broad kinase and phosphatase inhibitors on the inactivation process. Slow inactivation was still present when ATP was omitted from the pipette solution (three cells, not shown), suggesting that global ATP levels are probably not important for the inactivation process. We then replaced ATP with ATPγS in the pipette solution. ATPγS is a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP that is readily used by a variety of protein kinases resulting in “irreversible phosphorylation” of the target (11Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Slow inactivation was slightly increased by ATPγS (TableII). Importantly, it was not reduced, which one might have expected if recovery from inactivation required a phosphorylation (12Lewis R.S. Dolmetsch R. Zweifach A. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E.

Various l-DEXs exhibiting very similar sequences have been isolated from different bacterial sources. Of all the enzymes, l-DEX YL, isolated from a 2-chloroacrylate-utilizable bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. YL, is an unusual l-DEX, in that it is relatively thermostable even though it is derived from a mesophilic bacterium (1Hasan A.K.M. Takada H. Koshikawa H. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1599-1602Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is a dimeric enzyme formed by two identical subunits of 232 amino acid residues. We have already reported the crystallization ofl-DEX YL (2Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and its crystal structure determined by a 2.5-Å resolution x-ray analysis (3Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The enzyme has a core domain of α/β-structure, which differs topologically from those of the α/β hydrolase fold family proteins (4Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar), along with a subdomain having a four-helix-bundle structure. Our ion spray mass spectrometric study showed that the dehalogenation of the l-2-haloacid catalyzed by l-DEX YL proceeds in the two-step mechanism through an ester intermediate (5Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the proposed reaction mechanism, the nucleophile Asp-10 first attacks the C2 atom of the substrate to form an ester intermediate and a halide ion, and, subsequently, a water molecule hydrolyzes the intermediate by attacking the Cγ atom of Asp-10 to produce ad-2-hydroxyacid, restoring the side-chain carboxyl group of Asp-10. This mechanism has been further investigated by mass spectral analyses of the enzyme paracatalytically inactivated by hydroxylamine (6Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Tsunasawa S. Nishihara M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3363-3368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); the enzyme forms an adduct of the dehalogenated substrate moiety and hydroxylamine specifically at the Asp-10 position. We replaced each of the charged or polar amino acid residues (total 36 residues) ofl-DEX YL, which are conserved in most of thel-DEXs, with another residue and found that, in addition to Asp-10, the residues of Thr-14, Arg-41, Ser-118, Lys-151, Tyr-157, Ser-175, Asn-177, and Asp-180 probably play an essential role in catalysis (7Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography revealed that all the residues except Arg-41 are located around the putative active site, nucleophile Asp-10, and that nine water molecules in this region form a complicated hydrogen bond network with the functionally important residues. All of the residues are thought to be involved in the catalytic process, which comprises selective recognition of the l-enantiomer of the 2-haloacid, binding of the carboxyl group of the substratel-2-haloacid, capture or withdrawal of the halide ion liberated from the l-2-haloacid upon nucleophilic attack by the side-chain carboxylate of Asp-10, formation of the ester intermediate, and activation of a water molecule for hydrolysis.

Haloalkane dehalogenase, epoxide hydrolase, and 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase each represent individual families of proteins that differ from the l-DEX family. The x-ray crystallographic studies of haloalkane dehalogenase showed that the enzyme is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold family, which includes acetylcholinesterase, carboxypeptidase, and lipase (4Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). Members of the family have a common fold comprising an eight-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices, where the catalytic triad residues are located at topologically equivalent positions on particular turns and loops. In the haloalkane dehalogenase (9Verschueren K.H.G. Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), Asp-124 carries out a nucleophilic attack on the C1 atom of substrates such as 1,2-dichloroethane to give an ester intermediate that is subsequently hydrolyzed by a water molecule activated by His-289. The halogen atom released from the substrate is captured by Trp-125 and Trp-175. In l-DEX YL, however, no histidine residue is present in the putative active site. His-19, which is the only histidine residue conserved of all l-DEXs, is not essential for the catalysis of l-DEX YL (16Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that l-DEX YL utilizes a residue other than histidine to activate a water molecule for hydrolysis. Like the haloalkane dehalogenase, a conserved tryptophan residue, Trp-179, is located in the vicinity of the nucleophile Asp-10 in l-DEX YL, but it is not essential for the catalysis of the enzyme. The other three conserved tryptophan residues, Trp-40, Trp-49, and Trp-193, are located outside the active site. It is therefore assumed that in the case of l-DEX YL, the abstraction of the halogen is performed by residues other than tryptophan. In order to elucidate the mechanism of catalysis and stereoselectivity of l-DEX YL by identifying the amino acid residues involved, it is indispensable to study tertiary structures ofl-DEX YL complexed with its substrate in each step of the catalysis. We crystallized several mutants of l-DEX YL that are suitable for this purpose. Of these mutants, the S175A mutant provided good crystals, which allowed us to perform a high resolution x-ray crystallographic study. We prepared crystals of the S175A mutant complexed with various kinds of substrates and to analyze their crystal structures by x-ray diffraction techniques. Four kinds of complexes gave electron density maps that unequivocally showed the formation of ester intermediates. Here we report the crystal structures of MCA, CBT, CMB, and CMV intermediates at 2.2–1.83-Å resolutions. The structures of these intermediates are essential not only for the identification of amino acid residues participating in each step of the catalysis but also for the elucidation of the mechanism of catalysis and stereoselectivity of l-DEX YL. The wild-type and mutant enzymes of l-DEX YL were overproduced in recombinantEscherichia coli cells and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by DEAE-Toyopearl chromatography (7Kurihara T.

Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants Y12F and S175A of l-DEX YL were prepared as described previously (7Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the Y12A (GTA → GGC), Y12L (GTA → GAG), and Y12W (GTA → CCA) mutants were prepared by the method of Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar), using the synthetic mutagenic primers (Biologica, Nagoya, Japan). The activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes for halide release was assayed with 25 mm MCA, CPA, CBT, CMB, and CMV as substrates. The reagentsdl-(RS )-2-chloro-n -butyrate,l-(S )-2-chloro-3-methyl-n -butyrate, andl-(S )-2-chloro-4-methyl-n -valerate (Tokyo Kasei) were used as the substrates for CBT, CMB, and CMV, respectively. Polyethylene glycol 400 was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 15% (v/v) to increase the solubility of these reagents. The amount of chloride ion released from the substrate was spectrophotometrically determined according to the method of Iwasaki et al. (19Iwasaki I. Utsumi S. Hagino K. Ozawa T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1956; 29: 860-864Crossref Google Scholar). One enzyme unit of halide release activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of halide ion/min. The amount of d-lactate produced from 25 mml-2-chloropropionate was determined by measuring the amount of NADH produced by the reaction ofd-lactate dehydrogenase with d-lactate in terms of absorbance at 340 nm. In a typical assay, the reaction was started at 30 °C by adding 0.141 nmol of the wild-type enzyme or 13.0 nmol of the S175A mutant to a 1-ml reaction mixture of 0.1 mTris-H2SO4 solution (pH 9.5) containing 25 mm CPA and 5 mm NAD, and then 18.2 units of thed-lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma) were immediately added to the solution. The enzyme activity producing d-lactate froml-2-chloropropionate was estimated from the ratio of the initial velocity to the molar absorption coefficient of 6,220m−1 cm−1 for NADH; 1 unit was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to produce 1 μmNADH/min. The amount of enzyme was estimated with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The activities of the wild-type enzyme and the S175A mutant are listed in Table I. Our ion-spray mass spectrometric study suggests that the production of d-hydroxyacid by hydrolysis after the halogen abstraction is the rate-determining step in the dehalogenation of l-2-haloacids catalyzed byl-DEX YL. 2Y.-F. Li, manuscript in preparation. These results suggest that the S175A mutant could be virtually inactive toward MCA, CBT, CMB, and CMV in the crystal at pH 5.5, although the mutant does display detectable activity toward these substrates in the solution at optimum pH.Table IRelative activities of wild type and S175A toward various substratesSubstrateCl− 1-aThe activity was measured in terms of the amount of chloride released from substrates.NADH1-bThe activity to produce d-lactate was estimated in terms of the amount of NADH produced from d-lactate by a coupling assay method described under “Materials and Methods.” The enzyme activity to produce d-hydroxyacids from MCA, CBT, CMB, and CMV has not been estimated because any appropriate method for the activity assay has not been developed for these substrates.Wild typeS175AWild typeS175A%Monochloroacetate73.60.07—1-c—, not determined.—l-2-Chloropropionate1000.201000.37l-2-Chloro-n -butyrate13.20.03——l-2-Chloro-3-methyl-n -butyrate9.20.01——l-2-Chloro-4-methyl-n -valerate18.40.01——Values shown are percent ratios to the wild-type activity in each step against l-2-chloropropionate.1-a The activity was measured in terms of the amount of chloride released from substrates.1-b The activity to produce d-lactate was estimated in terms of the amount of NADH produced from d-lactate by a coupling assay method described under “Materials and Methods.” The enzyme activity to produce d-hydroxyacids from MCA, CBT, CMB, and CMV has not been estimated because any appropriate method for the activity assay has not been developed for these substrates.1-c —, not determined. Open table in a new tab Values shown are percent ratios to the wild-type activity in each step against l-2-chloropropionate. Crystals of the S175A mutant were grown by a method similar to that for the wild-type enzyme reported previously (2Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Rhombohedral crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion of a 15 mg/ml enzyme solution against a reservoir solution (pH 5.5) consisting of 50 mm potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (approximate M r8000), and 1% (v/v) n -propanol at 4 °C. The typical crystal size was approximately 0.6 mm × 0.5 mm × 0.2 mm. The crystals belong to space group C 2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 92.47 Å, b = 62.78 Å, c = 50.99 Å, and β = 122.7°, contain one subunit of the dimer molecule in the asymmetric unit, and are isomorphous with those of the wild type. They are of good quality suitable for high resolution x-ray analysis and diffract to better than 1.8-Å resolution. Crystals of the S175A mutant complexed with each of the substrates MCA, CBT, CMB, and CMV were prepared by a soaking method. All of the substrates except MCA were dissolved in the reservoir solution containing 15% polyethylene glycol 400. The S175A crystals soaked in the reservoir solution containing 5 mm MCA diffracted well and gave diffraction intensities significantly different from those of the S175A crystals, which implied the formation of a complex. However, most of the S175A crystals were dissolved within 10 min in the reservoir solution with a concentration as low as 10 μmCPA, and cracked in reservoir solutions containing 1 mmCPA, CBT, CMB, or CMV. Therefore, a technique of cross-linking with glutaraldehyde was applied to reinforce the crystals before soaking them in the solutions containing each of the substrates except for MCA. The cross-linking conditions for the crystals were investigated in solutions containing 10 mm CBT, CMB, or CMV by changing the concentration of glutaraldehyde and the soaking time. Finally, the crystals were cross-linked in 5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 5 h at 4 °C. However, even the cross-linked crystals cracked in the 1 mm CPA solution. CPA is best among all the substrates of the enzyme and has the lowest K m value (7Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is the case with the S175A mutant, as shown in TableI. Binding of CPA to the enzyme may induce such large structural changes of the molecules in the crystal as to destroy the crystal packing. Efforts to prepare CPA-complexed crystals failed completely. Consequently, the complex with CPA was excluded from the present analysis. The unit cell dimensions of all the complexed crystals are shown in Table II. The crystal of the MCA complex is isomorphous with that of the S175A mutant, although the crystallographic c axis is shortened by 0.51 Å (1.0%). However, the unit cell dimensions of the CBT-, CMB-, and CMV-complexed crystals shrunk by about 1.1–1.5 Å (1.2–1.6%) and a maximum of 0.7 Å (1.3%) in the directions of the crystallographic a andc axes, respectively. These phenomena indicate that the molecules in these crystals must have moved closer together, compared with their corresponding positions in the wild-type and S175A mutant crystals. These rearrangements of the molecules may have been caused by a combination of the effects of cross-linking and conformational changes induced by the substrate binding.Table IISummary of data collection statisticsS175AMCACBTCMBCMVSoaking conditionsConcentration (mm)5101010Soaking time (days)3665Cell parametersa (Å)92.4792.0890.4391.3590.96b (Å)62.7862.7462.9262.6862.86c (Å)50.9950.4851.6750.3650.31β (°)122.7122.1122.8121.9121.7Data statisticsResolution (Å)2.001.831.801.801.80No. of reflections observed40,09254,76437,22141,53751,737Unique15,30117,91814,45418,04818,081Completeness (%)93.995.087.192.992.4R merge(%)2-aR merge (%) = 100 · ∑‖I i − 〈I 〉‖/∑‖I i‖, whereI i is the intensity of individual measurements, and 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity over all measurements.5.585.788.304.886.312-a R merge (%) = 100 · ∑‖I i − 〈I 〉‖/∑‖I i‖, whereI i is the intensity of individual measurements, and 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity over all measurements. Open table in a new tab Diffraction data for the S175A mutant and all of the complex crystals were collected at 20 °C with a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC imaging plate detector system using graphite or double focusing mirror-monochromated CuKα radiation, produced by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode x-ray generator operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The data collection for each of the five kinds of crystals was performed with one crystal sealed in a glass capillary. The crystal-to-detector distance was set to 80.0 mm. Each frame of 2.6° crystal oscillation data was collected for 10 min. Data processing was accomplished at 2.2–1.8-Å resolution with the R-AXIS IIC data processing software package. All of the frames of diffraction data were merged for every data set and scaled together. Data collection and processing are summarized in Table II. First of all, the subunit structure of the S175A mutant was analyzed using the structure of the wild-type subunit containing Tyr-3–Ile-222, or 220 out of 232 residues, which has previously been reported at 2.5-Å resolution (3Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and further refined at 2.0-Å resolution to an R -factor of 19.1% with the program X-PLOR (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The mutant structure refined with X-PLOR was virtually identical to the wild-type structure, with an average r.m.s. deviation of 0.2 Å between the corresponding Cα atoms of the two structures. Therefore, structural comparisons between the S175A mutant and its complexes allowed us to study the reaction mechanism of the enzyme on the basis of molecular structures. The structure determination of all the complexes except that with MCA required some modification in position and orientation of the starting model, because the complex crystals lacked isomorphism with the S175A mutant crystal. Therefore, the model of the S175A subunit was first positioned in the asymmetric unit of the CBT-complex crystal by rigid-body refinement in X-PLOR at 8.0–3.5-Å resolution; this required translations of −0.89, +0.01, and −0.05 Å in thex , y , and z directions, respectively, and rotations of −0.73°, −1.30° and −0.11° in the Eulerian angles, respectively. Each subunit of the CMB and CMV complex molecules was located by means of a rigid-body refinement using the CBT complex as a starting model; for the CMB (or CMV) complex, the translations were −0.14 (−0.24), −0.02 (+0.01), and −0.05 (−0.04) Å, respectively, in the x , y , and z directions, and the rotations were −0.11° (−0.22°), +0.43° (+0.45°), and +0.12° (+0.17°) in the Eulerian angles, respectively. After the subunit for each complex was located in its asymmetric unit, the regions that had changed their conformations were checked for each complex using the 2F o −F c and F o −F c difference electron density maps. These maps showed that the region of Asp-10–Ser-20 in the MCA complex, and the regions of Asp-10–Ser-20, Tyr-91–Asp-102, and Leu-117–Arg-135 in the other three complexes had moved away from their initial positions. Therefore, the conformations of these regions were manually modified on a computer workstation IRIS INDIGO-Elan with the program TURBO-FRODO (21Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) based on the 2F o − F c andF o − F c omit maps. The structures were refined with the simulated annealing protocol in X-PLOR. The refinement of each structure was initiated at 2.5-Å resolution using the modified coordinates and the individual temperature factors of the wild-type structure. In the initial stage of refinement, the structures of the protein regions were refined in all of the complexes. Some residues without any significant peaks corresponding to their side chains were set to Ala in the first several cycles until their peaks appeared. During the course of the refinement, water molecules were rebuilt on the basis of the 2F o− F c and F o −F c maps. In the final stage of refinement, a model of substrate moiety was added to the protein structure of each complex based on the 2F o − F c omit map. In the map, the electron density corresponding to the substrate moiety was connected to that of the Asp-10 side chain in each complex, as shown in Fig. 1. The density map clearly showed that the substrate moiety has no chlorine atom and has a d-configuration at the asymmetric C2 atom. These findings indicated that in each crystal, the complex turned to an ester intermediate, where the C2 atom of the unchlorinated substrate is covalently bonded to the carboxyl oxygen atom of the Asp-10 side chain and has ad-configuration in all but the MCA intermediate. Each of the ester intermediate structures was further refined to convergence.

Open table in a new tab The structure of each ester intermediate contains the polypeptide chain of amino acid residues 3–222, the substrate moiety, and 66, 51, 40, or 34 water molecules in the MCA, CBT, CMB, or CMV intermediates, respectively. The overall structure of the polypeptide chain in each intermediate is similar to those of the wild type and the S175A mutant, although there are significant structural differences in the Asp-10–Ser-20, Tyr-91–Asp-102, and Leu-117–Arg-135 regions. The conformational change in Asp-10–Ser-20 seems to be caused by an esterification with the substrate-derived moiety. The high quality of the appropriate omit-maps of all the intermediate structures allowed us to precisely locate the alkanoic acid moiety covalently bound to the carboxyl oxygen Oδ2 of Asp-10 in each intermediate crystal, as shown in Fi"

(i) Extracellular Ca2+, coupled to phospholipase C activation via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein, induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cAMP content (1.25 mm Ca2+ eliciting 50% inhibition) resulting from both stimulation of cAMP hydrolysis and inhibition of cAMP synthesis; this latter effect was mediated by capacitive Ca2+ influx as well as release of intracellular Ca2+. (ii) Angiotensin II, coupled to the same transduction pathway, also decreased cAMP content; however, its inhibitory effect on cAMP was mainly accounted for by an increase of cAMP hydrolysis, although angiotensin II and extracellular Ca2+ can induce comparable release of intracellular Ca2+. (iii) Prostaglandin E2, coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, inhibited the same pool of adenylyl cyclase units as extracellular Ca2+ but by a different mechanism. The functional properties of the adenylyl cyclase were similar to those described for type 6. The results establish that the co-expression of a Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase and of a Ca2+-sensing receptor in a same cell allows an inhibition of cAMP accumulation by physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+-sensing receptor protein and the Ca2+-inhibitable type 6 adenylyl cyclase mRNA are present in a defined segment of the rat renal tubule leading to the hypothesis of their possible functional co-expression in a same cell and thus to a possible inhibition of cAMP content by extracellular Ca2+.

A new type of G protein-coupled membrane receptor that is activated by increasing concentrations of extracellular ionized calcium ([Ca2+]e) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]e, extracellular free concentration of Ca2+; AC, adenylyl cyclase; AVP, arginine vasopressin; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free concentration of Ca2+; CTAL, cortical portion of the thick ascending limb; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; IP, inositol phosphates; PDE, phosphodiesterase; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PTX, Bordetella pertussis toxin; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; Ro 20-1724, 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone. and polyvalent cations has been cloned recently from bovine parathyroid cells (BoPCaR1, Ref. 1Brown E.M.

Increasing [Ca2+]e also stimulates phospholipase C activity in parathyroid cells (3Hawkins D. Enyedi P. Brown E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Kifor O. Diaz R. Butters R. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and inhibits hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation (5Chen C.J. Barnett J.V. Congo D.A. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but, so far, no interaction between these two transduction pathways has been established. The presence of BoPCaR1 in parathyroid cells explains the crucial role of [Ca2+]e to elicit a negative feedback on parathyroid hormone secretion (6Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 7Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Bone (NY). 1997; 20: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In rat kidney, a predominant expression of RaKCaR mRNA has been localized in the cortical portion of the thick ascending limb (8Riccardi D. Lee W.-S. Lee K. Segre G.V. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F951-F956PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yang T. Hassan S. Huang Y.G. Smart A.M. Briggs J.P. Schnermann J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F751-F758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a segment which ensures cAMP-stimulated paracellular Ca2+ reabsorption, from the lumen of the renal tubule to the extracellular fluid compartments (10Morel F. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 377-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A functional Ca2+ receptor is expressed in the plasma membrane of the rat and mouse cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL) as evidenced by the properties of the dose-dependent increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) as a function of peritubular [Ca2+]e (11Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Paulais M. Baudoin-Legros M. Teulon J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1052-F1060PubMed Google Scholar). High [Ca2+]e (5 mm) in the mouse CTAL decreases hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation, an effect which has been ascribed to a direct inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity (13Takaichi K. Kurokawa K. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1986; 12: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have shown that the rat CTAL also expresses the Ca2+-inhibitable type 6 AC mRNA (14Chabardès D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All the Gαs-coupled receptors studied so far in this segment activate a single pool of AC catalytic units (15Morel F. Chabardès D. Imbert-Teboul M. Le Bouffant F. Hus-Citharel A. Montégut M. Kidney Int. 1982; 21: S55-S62Google Scholar, 16Morel F. Imbert-Teboul M. Chabardès D. Kidney Int. 1987; 31: 512-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and in addition, electron microscopy studies describe a single cell type in this epithelium (17Kriz W. Kaissling B. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 707-777Google Scholar). These observations lead to the hypothesis that the functional expression of the type 6 AC mRNA accounts for the hormone-dependent cAMP synthesis in the rat CTAL. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the functional expression of the AC present in the rat CTAL and the consequences of the possible co-localization in a same cell of a Ca2+-inhibitable AC and of a Ca2+-sensing receptor on the regulation of cAMP synthesis and/or hydrolysis. In order to study the regulation of cAMP levels elicited by potentially similar or different mechanisms of action, we compared the effect of extracellular Ca2+ to those of two agents also active in this segment. The first agent, angiotensin II, induces [Ca2+]i increases in the rat CTAL (11Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Bouby N. Hus-Citharel A. Marchetti J. Bankir L. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1658-1667PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of the responses observed demonstrates that a same intracellular Ca2+ pool is released by angiotensin II and extracellular Ca2+ (11Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The second agent, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), inhibits hormone-dependent cAMP synthesis (19Torikai S. Kurokawa K. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F58-F66PubMed Google Scholar) likely as a result of the interaction of the PGE2 receptor with a GTP-dependent, pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαiprotein as demonstrated in the medullary portion of the rat thick ascending limb (20Firsov D. Aarab L. Mandon B. Siaume-Perez S. de Rouffignac C. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on rat CTAL isolated by microdissection, and the results establish that PGE2 (coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi protein), angiotensin II, and extracellular Ca2+ (both coupled to phospholipase C pathway) are effective in a same cell to decrease arginine vasopressin-dependent cAMP accumulation. [Ca2+]e, in the physiological range, decreases hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation by more than 50%, an effect which results from both an inhibition of cAMP synthesis and an increase of cAMP hydrolysis. Angiotensin II also regulates both mechanisms, but its ability to inhibit cAMP synthesis is much smaller. The adenylyl cyclase present in this segment has the functional properties previously described for the Ca2+-inhibitable type 6 AC (21Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Fagan K. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); in particular, AC activity is inhibited by both Gαi and phospholipase C pathways by different mechanisms. Accordingly, in situ hybridization shows a homogeneous distribution of type 6 AC mRNA in CTAL cells. Taken together, the results establish that the co-expression of a Ca2+ sensing receptor and of a Ca2+-inhibitable AC in the rat CTAL cell allows a specific inhibition by physiological [Ca2+]e of hormone-stimulated cAMP intracellular content. Unless otherwise specified, the compounds were from Merck (Damstardt, Germany), Sigma, and Calbiochem. A probe specific of type 6 AC was chosen in the most divergent region of AC cDNA sequences. A 376-bp fragment (Pvu II-Sph I, nucleotides 3766–4143) of the type 6 AC cDNA, located in the 3′-untranslated region, was subcloned in pGEM3Zf(+) in the corresponding sites (Sma I-Sph I). This sequence was included in the region previously used for RT-PCR experiments (14Chabardès D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A 1080-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1205 (Eco RI) to 2285 (Pvu II) of the type 5 AC cDNA coding region was subcloned in BSSK+. Sense and antisense cRNA probes were transcribed in vitro with T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions, in the presence of α-35S-UTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ulis, France). Adult rat kidneys were fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Kidney slices were post-fixed overnight in the same solution and then dehydrated with graded series of ethanol and butanol. Tissues were paraffin-embedded, and sections of 5–7 μm were mounted on silane-coated slides. In situ hybridization was performed as described by Shanmugam et al. (23Shanmugam S. Llorens-Cortes C. Clauser E. Corvol P. Gasc J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F922-F930PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were deparaffinized in toluene and then rehydrated by a graded series of ethanol (100 to 30%). Pretreatment was continued by boiling in a solution of 0.01 m citric acid in a microwave oven and then treated with 0.1% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline. These modifications have been shown to increase specific signal. After a second run of fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline, and a proteinase K treatment, slides were covered with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 21% dextran sulfate (50%), 11% salmon sperm DNA, 11% 20× SSC (1× SSC is equal to 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), and 7% 1 m dithiothreitol) containing 0.5 to 1.106 cpm of probe per tissue section. Hybridization was performed overnight at 50 °C in a humidified chamber. Slides were rinsed in 5× SSC, 10 mmdithiothreitol followed by an incubation in 50% formamide, 1× SSC, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol. They were further treated by RNase A (20 μg/ml) and then dehydrated in ethanol containing 300 mm ammonium acetate and dried. The slides were exposed for 3 to 4 weeks to Kodak NTB2 liquid emulsion, counterstained with Evans blue, and examined under the microscope. The experimental conditions used to perform microdissection of intact segments have been detailed previously (20Firsov D. Aarab L. Mandon B. Siaume-Perez S. de Rouffignac C. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Aarab L. Montégut M. Siaume-Perez S. Imbert-Teboul M. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 423: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats (120–150 g of body weight, Iffa-Credo, France) that were maintained on a standard diet with free access to water. After anesthesia, the left kidney was perfused with microdissection medium containing 0.16% collagenase (Serva, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). After hydrolysis of the kidney (20 min at 30 °C in 0.12% collagenase solution), single CTALs (0.3–1.5 mm length) were microdissected at 4 °C. The standard microdissection medium was composed of the following (in mm): NaCl, 137; KCl, 5; MgSO4, 0.8; Na2HPO4, 0.33; KH2P04, 0.44; MgCl2, 1; NaHCO3, 4; CH3COONa, 10; CaCl2, 0.5; glucose, 5; HEPES, 20, pH 7.4, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, protease-free, minimal fatty acid content, Pentex, Miles Inc., Kankakee, IL). This medium was supplemented with 10 μm ibuprofen and 0.5 unit/ml adenosine deaminase (Boehringer Mannheim) to prevent the synthesis of prostaglandins and the release of adenosine, agents known to interact with the regulation of cAMP content in the rat kidney (20Firsov D. Aarab L. Mandon B. Siaume-Perez S. de Rouffignac C. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Aarab L. Montégut M. Siaume-Perez S. Imbert-Teboul M. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 423: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A nominally Ca2+-free medium used in some of our protocols had the same composition except that calcium was omitted; Ca2+-chelating agents were not added to this medium because they have been described to modify the sensitivity to Ca2+ of the Ca2+-inhibitable AC isoforms (25Smith J.A. Griffin M. Mireylees S.E. Long R.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The concentrations of free Ca2+ present in the media were measured by using an electrode sensitive to Ca2+ (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). The relationship between the theoretical concentrations of Ca2+ added (0.5–5.0 mm) and those measured in the medium was as follows: y = 1.05x −0.07,r = 1.0. The experimental conditions used to measure hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation on an intact single segment (20Firsov D. Aarab L. Mandon B. Siaume-Perez S. de Rouffignac C. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Aarab L. Montégut M. Siaume-Perez S. Imbert-Teboul M. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 423: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) will be recalled briefly. Microdissected pieces of CTAL were transferred in 2 μl of incubation medium onto glass slides (1 or 2 pieces per slide) and photographed in order to measure their length. Unless otherwise specified, each sample was preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 0.5 mm [Ca2+]eand, after addition of 2 μl of incubation medium containing the agonists to be tested, incubated for a further 4 min at 35 °C. Adenylyl cyclase activity was stimulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP) which binds to V2 receptor in the rat CTAL, the only AVP receptor expressed in this segment (26Firsov D. Mandon B. Morel A. Merot J. Le Maout S. Bellanger A.C. de Rouffignac C. Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 429: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Due to the small number of cells per tubular sample (from about 100 to 600 cells), hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation can be measured only in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Either 50 μm Ro 20-1724, a specific inhibitor of the lowK m cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (27Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 28Hoey M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or 1 mm IBMX, inhibitor of all phosphodiesterases in the rat kidney (28Hoey M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was added to the incubation medium. The concentrations of the different agents given in the results are those present during the incubation step. For longer preincubation periods, in experiments performed with Bordetella pertussis toxin and bisindolylmaleimide I, all media were supplemented with essential and nonessential amino acids as well as vitamins (minimum Eagle's medium, Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). The amounts of cAMP were measured on acetylated samples by radioimmunoassay (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes-La-Coquette, France). The micromethod used allows the determination of 2–80 fmol of cAMP per reaction tube. In our conditions, the basal level of cyclic AMP present in a single piece of tubule is close to, or below, the sensitivity threshold of the assay (20Firsov D. Aarab L. Mandon B. Siaume-Perez S. de Rouffignac C. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 636-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Aarab L. Montégut M. Siaume-Perez S. Imbert-Teboul M. Chabardès D. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 423: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results were calculated in femtomoles of cyclic AMP accumulated per mm of tubular length per 4 min incubation time (fmol·mm−1·4 min−1). The first experiments carried out to study the effect of [Ca2+]e showed that AVP-stimulated cAMP levels were similar either in the Ca2+-free medium or in 0.5 mm [Ca2+]e but decreased in 1 mm [Ca2+]e incubation medium. The control incubation medium therefore contained 0.5 mm[Ca2+]e, a concentration previously used in experiments performed on parathyroid cells (3Hawkins D. Enyedi P. Brown E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Kifor O. Diaz R. Butters R. Brown E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Chen C.J. Barnett J.V. Congo D.A. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In each experiment, different experimental conditions were tested on replicate CTAL samples microdissected from a same rat kidney (6–9 samples per condition). The mean of the cAMP values obtained in each condition was taken as one single data point, and the results were expressed in absolute value or in percentage of the response to AVP or in percentage of inhibition calculated from the corresponding AVP value. Results are given as the mean values ± S.E. calculated from n different experiments. Unless otherwise indicated, the statistical evaluation of the data was assessed by unpaired Student's t test. Assays were performed by using the microtechnique developed for proximal tubule fragments (29Meneton P. Imbert-Teboul M. Bloch-Faure M. Rajerison R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F382-F390PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, in each experiment, CTAL (150–200 mm of total length) were microdissected from a collagenase-treated kidney. The medium used was supplemented with vitamins and amino acids as described above but contained 2 mm [Ca2+]e. CTAL pieces were radiolabeled in 50 μl of this medium containingmyo -[3H]inositol (1 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 30 °C. After this labeling period, tubules were extensively rinsed in 0.5 mm[Ca2+]e medium, and tubule samples (4–7 mm length each) were incubated at 37 °C during 15 min in 0.5 mm [Ca2+]e medium supplemented with lithium. The reaction was stopped, and the radioactivity associated with phosphoinositides, free inositol, inositol phosphates (IP), and glycerophosphoinositol was separated and counted as described previously (29Meneton P. Imbert-Teboul M. Bloch-Faure M. Rajerison R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F382-F390PubMed Google Scholar). In several experiments, it was checked that there was a good correlation between inositol phosphate formation expressed either per unit of tubule length or as a percentage of the total radioactivity counted (r = 0.93 ± 0.03, n = 4), an observation in agreement with that previously observed with proximal tubule fragments (29Meneton P. Imbert-Teboul M. Bloch-Faure M. Rajerison R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F382-F390PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, IP production was expressed as percentage of the total radioactivity counted. In each experiment, different experimental conditions (5 replicate samples each) were tested, and the mean of the IP values measured in each condition was taken as one single data point. The results are given as the mean values ± S.E. calculated from n different experiments. The statistical evaluation of the results was assessed by paired Student's t test. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured in single CTAL samples microdissected from collagenase-treated kidneys by using the calcium-sensitive fluorescence probe fura-2 as described previously (11Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, CTAL were loaded for 60 min with 10 μm fura-2 AM. Each CTAL was then transferred to a superfusion chamber fixed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss IM 35, Oberkochen, Germany). The tubule was superfused at 37 °C at a rate of 10–12 ml/min, corresponding to about 10 exchanges per min. The composition of the superfusion medium was similar to that used in cAMP experiments, except that serum albumin, ibuprofen, and adenosine deaminase were not added since the superfusion medium was flushed continuously. After a 5- to 10-min equilibration period, agonists were added to either the 0.5 mm [Ca2+]e medium or to the Ca2+-free medium and superfused over tubule. Due to the dead space of the superfusion set up, the time necessary to achieve a full equilibration of agonist concentration in the chamber was of 15–20 s. The tubular portion selected for fluorescence measurement included about 30 cells. Double wavelength measurements of fura-2 fluorescence were recorded every 2 s. Calculations of [Ca2+]i were performed as described previously (11Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results obtained from different tubules microdissected from several rats were expressed as mean values ± S.E. The localization of type 6 AC mRNA in the rat kidney was examined by in situ hybridization at the light microscope. The most intense labeling in the kidney cortex was found in thick ascending limb, including CTAL (Fig. 1), collecting duct, and glomeruli (not shown). Fig. 1 shows strong labeling of CTALs (a, c, and arrowheads ), whereas proximal tubules (a , c , and *) are weakly labeled. In CTAL, labeling was equally intense in all cells. No labeling was observed when the sense cRNA probe was used (Fig. 1,b and d ). In contrast to type 6 AC, no significant labeling for type 5 AC was found in CTAL (not shown). This is consistent with previous quantitative RT-PCR results showing that the type 6 AC mRNA was more abundant in CTAL than in proximal tubule and that type 5 AC mRNA was not detected in CTAL (14Chabardès D. Firsov D. Aarab L. Clabecq A. Bellanger A.C. Siaume-Perez S. Elalouf J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19264-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). AVP was used at 10 nm, a concentration that induces a maximal stimulation of cAMP accumulation in intact cells (Ref. 19Torikai S. Kurokawa K. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F58-F66PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown) and thus allows us to study the maximal amount of functional AC proteins present in the rat CTAL. AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation was about 2-fold higher in the presence of 1 mm IBMX, which reflects AVP-stimulated cAMP synthesis only, than in the presence of 50 μm Ro 20-1724, which allows the measurement of cAMP accumulation that integrates both the synthesis and a partial catabolism of cAMP (Fig.2, left panel ). In the presence of increasing [Ca2+]e, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of AVP-dependent cAMP levels with half-maximal inhibition of about 1.2 and 2.0 mm [Ca2+]e in the presence of Ro 20-1724 and IBMX, respectively (Fig. 2, right panel ). With Ro 20-1724, a steep inverse relationship was observed, and thus a small variation of [Ca2+]e induced a high variation of hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation. The shape of the curve obtained with either IBMX or Ro 20-1724 shows that [Ca2+]e below 1.5 mm had a small effect on cAMP synthesis but increased cAMP hydrolysis; conversely, at higher [Ca2+]e the inhibition was mediated mainly by a decrease of cAMP synthesis. Altogether in this study, the inhibition induced by 1.25 mm[Ca2+]e in the presence of Ro 20-1724 was of 63.3 ± 3.9% (p < 0.001 versus 10 nm AVP, n = 11) and that induced by 1.5 mm [Ca2+]e in the presence of IBMX was of 30.5 ± 3.5% (p < 0.01 versus 10 nm AVP, n = 8). The implication of the Ca2+ receptor RaKCaR to explain the inhibitory effect of [Ca2+]e was supported by the results obtained with an agonist of this receptor, neomycin (1Brown E.M. Gamba G.

In 0.5 mm [Ca2+]e, 100 μmneomycin inhibited by 82.2 ± 5.8% (n = 3) and 43.5 ± 5.7% (n = 5) cAMP accumulated by 10 nm AVP in the presence of Ro 20-1724 and IBMX, respectively. In the presence of IBMX, 2.5 mm[Ca2+]e inhibited cAMP synthesis stimulated by either 10 μm forskolin or 10 nm AVP with a comparable efficiency (62.3 ± 7.2% of inhibition and 73.5 ± 2.5% in forskolin and AVP experimental groups, respectively,n = 3). These results suggest that [Ca2+]e inhibited AC activity at post-receptor sites. In our experimental conditions, no detectable [Ca2+]i variations were obtained with 1.25 mm [Ca2+]e (TableI), and the response to 1.5 mm [Ca2+]e was characterized in most tubules by a low but sustained [Ca2+]i increase without a clear-cut peak phase (Fig. 3and Table I). With 2.5 mm [Ca2+]e, the response was a transient peak followed by a lower sustained plateau (Fig. 3) that reflects Ca2+ entry (11Champigneulle A. Siga E. Vassent G. Imbert-Teboul M. J. Membr.

Unlike the peak, the plateau was blocked by nonspecific Ca2+ channel blockers such as La3+ and Ni2+, whereas addition of voltage-sensitive channel blockers, i.e. verapamil and nifedipine, did not modify [Ca2+]i (Ref. 11Champigneulle A.

We demonstrate that peptides corresponding to the last 11 residues of Gαi1/2 or Gαo1 impair agonist binding to A1 adenosine receptors, whereas Gαs or Gαt peptides have no effect. Previously, by using a combinatorial library we identified a series of Gαtpeptide analogs that bind rhodopsin with high affinity (Martin, E. L., Rens-Domiano, S., Schatz, P. J., and Hamm, H. E. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 361–366). Native Gαi1/2 peptide as well as several analogs were tested for their ability to modulate agonist binding or antagonist-agonist competition using cells overexpressing human A1 adenosine receptors. Three peptide analogs decreased the K i, suggesting that they disrupt the high affinity receptor-G protein interaction and stabilize an intermediate affinity state. To study the ability of the peptides to compete with endogenous Gαiproteins and block signal transduction in a native setting, we measured activation of G protein-coupled K+ channels through A1 adenosine or γ-aminobutyric acid, type B, receptors in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Native Gαi1/2, peptide, and certain analog peptides inhibited receptor-mediated K+ channel gating, dependent on which receptor was activated. This differential perturbation of receptor-G protein interaction suggests that receptors that act on the same G protein can be selectively disrupted. The carboxyl terminus of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits plays an important role in receptor interaction.

This differential perturbation of receptor-G protein interaction suggests that receptors that act on the same G protein can be selectively disrupted. Hormones and neurotransmitters that bind to G protein-coupled receptors control a myriad of physiological functions. Transduction of these extracellular signals involves receptor-mediated activation of specific G proteins by catalysis of GDP/GTP exchange. These receptors are the target for many pharmaceutical products and are the focus of intense drug discovery efforts. Traditionally, the agonist binding site is the point of intervention, but in some cases receptor subtype-selective drugs have been difficult to achieve. Another possible target for inhibition is the receptor-G protein interface, which has been defined in some detail and involves the intracellular loops of the seven-transmembrane helix receptors with several regions on heterotrimeric G proteins (1Konig B.

It is important to assess whether inhibitors of this interface can be found or designed and whether specific inhibition can be achieved. The carboxyl-terminal region of the Gα subunits represents an important site of interaction between heterotrimeric G proteins and their cognate receptors. Within this region mutations (4Osawa S.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) all uncouple G proteins from their receptors. In particular, the last 4 residues of the Gα carboxyl terminus play an important role in determining the fidelity of receptor activation (9Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 10Conklin B. Herzmark P. Ishida S. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Sun Y. Farfel Z. Bourne H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 885-890PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, synthetic peptides from various portions of the Gαs carboxyl terminus inhibit β-adrenergic receptor-Gs coupling (11Palm D. Munch G. Malek D. Dees C. Hekman M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Rasenick M.M. Watanabe M. Lazarevic M.B. Hatta S. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these peptides, Gαs-(384–394) and Gαs-(354–372), also stabilize the high affinity state of the receptor (12Rasenick M.M. Watanabe M. Lazarevic M.B. Hatta S. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 11 residues of Gαt, Gαt-(340–350), both inhibits rhodopsin Gtcoupling and mimics Gt by stabilizing the active metarhodopsin II conformation (13Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). By screening a combinatorial peptide-on-plasmid library based on the carboxyl terminus of Gαt, we previously identified numerous peptides that can also mimic the effects of heterotrimeric G protein with a much greater affinity than the native sequence by both binding to rhodopsin and stabilizing it in its active conformation, metarhodopsin II (14Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The similarity between the carboxyl terminus of Gαt and Gαi led us to test the Gαt peptide analogs, which bound to rhodopsin, for their ability to bind other Gi-coupled receptors. In this study we have investigated whether these peptides can 1) bind to Gi-coupled A1 adenosine receptors and induce the high affinity binding of the receptor; 2) block the ability of Gi proteins to stabilize the high affinity state of agonists; or 3) inhibit signal transduction through Gi by two different Gi-coupled receptors, A1 adenosine and GABAB 1The abbreviations used are: GABAB, γ-aminobutyric acid, type B; ABA,N 6-(3-iodo,4-amino)benzyladenosine; ADA, adenosine deaminase; CHA, (cyclohexyl)adenosine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DPCPX, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine; GIRK, G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O -(3-thio)triphosphate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MBP, maltose-binding protein; R-PIA, (R )-N 6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine. receptors.

The extracellular nucleoside adenosine regulates a variety of metabolic functions through the activation of specific cell membrane receptors. Adenosine receptors, which exhibit the presumed seven transmembrane-spanning topography typical of almost all G protein-coupled receptors, are currently classified into four subtypes, A1, A2a, A2b and A3, based on the pharmacological profile for agonist and antagonist ligands and their effects on intracellular cAMP accumulation (reviewed in Refs.20Stiles G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6451-6454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Palmer T. Stiles G. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22Olah M.

The A1 adenosine receptor is widely distributed in several tissues such as heart, kidney, epididymal fat, and testis, and it is especially prominent in the central nervous system (24Weaver D. Reppert S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F991-F995PubMed Google Scholar, 25Reppert S. Weaver D. Stehle J. Rivkees S. Mol.

In the brain, the highest expression is observed in cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and thalamus (25Reppert S. Weaver D. Stehle J. Rivkees S. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). In the cortex it represents a primary signaling target for adenosine and is thought to tonically inhibit neuronal activity. In the hippocampus the highest density is in the dendritic region of the CA1 area (28Rivkees S. Price S. Zhou F. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 29Fastbom J.

Originally, signaling through the A1 adenosine receptor subtype was linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in a pertussis-sensitive manner (33Van Calker D. Muller M. Hamprecht B. J.

In reconstituted systems, human and bovine A1 adenosine receptors appear to interact preferentially with recombinant Gαi rather than Gαo (43Freissmuth M. Schutz W. Linder M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17778-17783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,44Figler R.A. Lindorfer M.A. Graber S.G. Garrison J.C. Linden J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16288-16299Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The bovine A1 adenosine receptor couples selectively to the Gαi3 subunit, whereas the human receptor is able to activate each Gαi subtype with similar potency (45Jockers R. Linder M. Hohenegger M. Nanoff C. Bertin B. Strosberg A. Marullo S. Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32077-32084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other researchers (46Munshi R. Pang I. Sternweis P. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22285-22289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using purified bovine brain G proteins, have shown that Gi2 is more potent than Gi1 or Go at restoring high affinity agonist binding to bovine brain A1 adenosine receptors. However, the ability of A1 adenosine receptors to preferentially interact with a specific Gα subunit does not preclude their ability to interact with other G protein subunits in an intact system. Here, we study the effect of synthetic peptides corresponding to the last 11 residues of Gαi1/2, Gαo, Gαt, and Gαs or the Gαtpeptide analogs on agonist binding to the A1 adenosine receptor in rat cortical membranes or CHO-K1 cell membranes overexpressing the human receptor. Our findings indicate that in contrast to other receptors (12Rasenick M.M. Watanabe M. Lazarevic M.B. Hatta S. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffmann K.P.

Nature. 1993; 363: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the carboxyl-terminal region of the Gαi1/2 subunit was not capable of stabilizing the high affinity state of A1 adenosine receptors either in rat cortex membranes or CHO-K1 cell membranes overexpressing the human receptor. However, the native peptide Gαi1/2-(344–354) as well as some Gαtpeptide analogs can negatively modulate agonist binding and compete with heterotrimeric G protein for binding to the A1adenosine receptor. Moreover, Gαi carboxyl-terminal peptides blocked signal transduction to activation of K+channels. Depending on whether the activation was through the A1 adenosine or GABAB receptor, different Gαt peptide analogs were most effective. Thus, it appears that certain Gαt peptide analogs can selectively disturb the molecular interface that occurs between Gi proteins and Gi protein-coupled receptors. [3H]N 6-(cyclohexyl)adenosine (CHA) (27.7 Ci/mmol) and [3H]1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) (80–120 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and [125I]N 6-(3-iodo,4-amino)benzyladenosine (ABA) (2000 Ci/mmol) was synthesized by Dr. J.

Res. 1985; 56: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adenosine deaminase (ADA) and (R )-N 6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA) were purchased from Sigma, and GTPγS was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Other reagents were from standard commercial sources. Peptides were purchased from Peptidogenics (Livermore, CA). The native Gα peptides tested for their effect on agonist binding to rat cortical membranes had a free amino terminus, whereas all other peptides were synthesized with an acetyl group at the amino terminus. All peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their purity was checked by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, analytical HPLC, and amino acid analysis. Plasmid pELM3 (provided by P. J. Schatz, Affymax Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA) was used for expression of maltose-binding protein (MBP) and fusion proteins as described by Martin et al. (14Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The controls were the vector alone, which expressed the TGGG linker only fused to MBP (pELM 6), and pELM 17, which expressed the peptide Gαt-(340–350K341R) with the TGGG linker fused to MBP. All frozen cell stocks were kept in 25% glycerol at −80 °C. The brain cortices from young male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) that had been subjected to cervical dislocation were rapidly removed and homogenized in 10 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 100 μg/ml bacitracin). The membrane homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 46,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2 (TEM1 buffer) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 100 μg/ml bacitracin), and the homogenate was centrifuged again. The pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of TEM1 buffer containing protease inhibitors and 2 units/ml ADA and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to remove endogenous adenosine. The membrane homogenate was centrifuged, and the final pellet was stored as aliquots at −80 °C until needed. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (49Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Young male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–220 g) were decapitated and the brains rapidly removed. The hippocampi were cut into 400-μm thick transverse slices on a Sorvall tissue chopper. Slices were submerged in a recording chamber and continuously perfused with artificial cerebral spinal fluid containing 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 25.9 mmNaHCO3, 126 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.4 CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably overexpressing the human A1 adenosine receptor were grown to confluence in Ham's F12 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Sigma) in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and subcultured after detachment with trypsin/EDTA (0.05%, 0.5 mm). Confluent CHO-K1 cells were lysed with hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA) and scraped from the plate. The lysates were homogenized, centrifuged, and washed twice in washing buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmEDTA). The homogenized lysates were then stored at −80 °C in storage buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose) until needed. Protein concentration was measured using the Coomassie Blue binding method (50Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Rat cortical membranes (100–150 μg of proteins) and [3H]CHA (1.3 nm) were incubated in 0.5 ml of TEM1 buffer containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2.7 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 unit/ml ADA for 60 min at 25 °C. Binding reactions were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters (Hillsboro, OR) under reduced pressure using a Millipore apparatus (Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 15 μm R-PIA. Specific binding was 85–90% of total binding for all experiments. For saturation studies, membranes were incubated in TEM1 buffer containing protease inhibitors and ADA with eight different concentrations of [3H]CHA ranging from 0.1 to 46 nm. For studying the effect of GTPγS, rat cortical membranes and [3H]CHA (1.2 nm) were incubated in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of the guanine nucleotide ranging from 1 nm to 100 μm. The effects of the following Gα peptides were tested as follows: Gαi1/2-(344–354), Gαo1-(344–354), Gαt-(340–350), and Gαs-(384–394). The Gαi1/2, Gαo1, and Gαtpeptides were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and the Gαs peptide was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Solubility of peptides was checked as described by Raricket al . (51Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The effect of Gα peptides was investigated by incubating rat cortical membranes and [3H]CHA (∼1.3 nm) in TEM1 buffer containing protease inhibitors and ADA with different concentrations of the peptide (0.1 to 300 μm). Membranes (10 μg/ml proteins) from CHO-K1 cells overexpressing the human A1 adenosine receptor were added to tubes containing HEM buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2), 2.5 units/ml ADA, [125I]ABA (0.5 nm) and either the MBP fusion proteins (50 μm) or synthetic peptide (100 μm). The Gαt peptide analogs were dissolved in HEM buffer, and their solubility was checked as described by Raricket al . (51Rarick H.M. Artemyev N.O. Mills J.S. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 2 h. The bound and free radioligands were separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filter paper (soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine) using a Brandel tissue harvester. Filters were washed twice with ice-cold TEM2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA). Binding assays were performed in duplicate, and nonspecific binding was determined by adding 15 μm R-PIA at the same time as the radioligand to some samples. Specific binding was 85–90% of total binding for all experiments. For the competition assays, CHO-K1 cell membranes (10 μg/ml proteins) were added to tubes containing HEM buffer, 2.5 units/ml ADA, 0.8 nm [3H]DPCPX, and increasing concentrations of R-PIA (0 to 10 μm) in the presence and absence of peptide analogs (100 μm). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 2 h. Then the reaction mixtures were filtered through Whatman GF/C filter paper using a Brandel tissue harvester. Filters were washed twice with ice-cold TEM2 buffer. Binding assays were performed in duplicate, and nonspecific binding was determined by adding 15 μm R-PIA at the same time as the radioligand. Specific binding was 85–90% of total binding for all experiments. Dilution and saturation experiments using either the agonist, [125I]ABA, or the antagonist, [3H]DPCPX, were performed in order to determine the binding parameters (B max and K D) and thus to estimate the number of G protein-coupled receptors in CHO-K1 cell membranes overexpressing the human A1 adenosine receptor. Based on the binding of [125I]ABA and [3H]DPCPX the number of coupled receptors was approximately 4.5 pmol/mg protein (K D = 1 nm), and the total number of receptors was approximately 10 pmol/mg protein (K D = 2.5 nm). Recording electrodes for whole cell recording were pulled from borosilicate glass (outer diameter 1.5 mm and inner diameter 0.86 mm, with filament; Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) on a Flaming/Brown Micropipette puller (Sutter) and had tip resistances of 5–10 MΩ when filled with a solution containing 125 mm potassium gluconate, 11 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm K-EGTA, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.3 mm Tris-GTP, 10 mmHEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2–7.3 with KOH, osmolarity adjusted to 280–290 mOsm. Peptides were dissolved directly into the electrode filling solution to obtain a final concentration of 1 mm. Whole cell electrophysiological recordings were made using the “blind” patch recording technique (52Blanton M. Lo Turco J. Kriegstein A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1989; 30: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Briefly, the patch pipette was attached to a hydraulic microdrive and advanced into the stratum pyramidal layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus in 2-μm steps. Positive pressure was applied while the electrode was advanced through the slice, and once contact between the electrode and a cell body was achieved (indicated by a small increase in the electrode resistance), suction was then applied to the electrode to form a gigaohm seal with the membrane. Further suction was used to rupture the membrane patch, providing low resistance access between the electrode filling solution and the cytoplasm of the cell. Neurons were voltage-clamped at −65 mV immediately upon rupturing the membrane using the continuous single electrode voltage clamp mode of an Axoclamp-2A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). The average membrane potential of the cells was approximately −70 mV after correction for the liquid junction potential. To ensure that the peptides had adequate time to diffuse into the cells, experiments were begun a minimum of 15 min following patch rupture. During the experiment, the holding current necessary to maintain the voltage clamp was sampled every 15 s, and membrane resistance was determined every 30 s by the current response to a −4-mV voltage command step. The access resistance between the electrode and the cytoplasm of the cell was continually monitored by observation of the cell membrane capacitive currents in response to a brief voltage step and was below 30 MΩ in all experiments. All responses were digitized with an R.C. Electronics ISC-16 analog-to-digital card and analyzed by computer with software developed in our laboratory. Bath-applied drugs were delivered into the superfusion line by a syringe pump (Razel Scientific Instruments, Inc., Stamford, CN) from stock solutions that were 100 × the final concentration of drug. Nearly all neurons were tested with both adenosine and baclofen, and when possible, cells were retested with either one or both drugs (e.g. Fig. 3 C ). A nonlinear multipurpose curve-fitting computer program (GraphPad Prism, version 2.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for analysis of saturation and competition binding data. A partial F test evaluated whether the data were best fit by a one- or two-site model. The IC50 values calculated from the competition curves were converted to K i values by the Cheng and Prusoff equation (53Cheng Y. Prusoff W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12326) Google Scholar). The dose-response curves for the Gα peptides were fit using nonlinear regression analysis and IC50 values were derived (GraphPad Prism, version 2.0). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments, unless otherwise noted. The statistical differences were determined using the unpaired t test (GraphPad Prism, version 2.0). Table I shows the amino acid sequences of all peptides used for the experiments and indicates the EC50 values of their ability to stabilize rhodopsin in its active conformation, metarhodopsin II. Synthetic or MBP-fused peptides were tested for their ability to modulate agonist binding to A1 adenosine receptors from two different species, rat and human. The human receptor was expressed in stably transfected cells, whereas the rat receptor was in its native cellular background.Table IAmino acid sequences of native Gα peptides and analogs and their ability to stabilize metarhodopsin IIAmino acid sequenceMeta II stabilization EC50μmGαi1/2-(344–354)IKNNLKDCGLFNDGαs-(384–394)Q R MHLR QYELLNDGαo1-(344–354)IANNLR GCGLYNDGαt-(340–350)IKENLKDCGLF8071-aS.

https://openalex.org/W1978120045,"An affinity resin for the F1sector of the Escherichia coli ATP synthase was prepared by coupling the b subunit to a solid support through a unique cysteine residue in the N-terminal leader.b 24–156, a form of b lacking the N-terminal transmembrane domain, was able to compete with the affinity resin for binding of F1. Truncated forms ofb 24–156, in which one or four residues from the C terminus were removed, competed poorly for F1binding, suggesting that these residues play an important role inb -F1 interactions. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that removal of these C-terminal residues from b 24–156 resulted in a disruption of its association with the purified δ subunit of the enzyme. To determine whether these residues interact directly with δ, cysteine residues were introduced at various C-terminal positions ofb and modified with the heterobifunctional cross-linker benzophenone-4-maleimide. Cross-links between b and δ were obtained when the reagent was incorporated at positions 155 and 158 (two residues beyond the normal C terminus) in both the reconstituted b 24–156-F1 complex and the membrane-bound F1F0 complex. CNBr digestion followed by peptide sequencing showed the site of cross-linking within the 177-residue δ subunit to be C-terminal to residue 148, possibly at Met-158. These results indicate that theb and δ subunits interact via their C-terminal regions and that this interaction is instrumental in the binding of the F1 sector to the b subunit of F0.

In the process of oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation, the electron transport chain generates a transmembrane proton gradient. The ATP synthase, or F1F0-ATPase, allows protons to flow down this electrochemical gradient and uses the energy obtained to synthesize ATP (for reviews, see Refs. 1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 2Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem.

Under appropriate conditions ATP synthase can hydrolyze ATP to pump protons. The enzyme is composed of two sectors; the F0 sector is membrane-integral and is responsible for proton translocation, and the F1 sector is attached to the membrane via F0 and houses the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis. F1 is easily detached from the membrane and can be purified as a soluble protein with ATPase activity. ATP synthases contain at least eight types of subunits. In the relatively simple enzyme from Escherichia coli , the F1 sector has the stoichiometry α3β3γ1δ1ε1, whereas F0 is composed of three subunits of stoichiometrya 1 b 2 c 9–12. The a and c subunits, but not b , contain residues essential for the translocation of protons across the membrane (3Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The 156-residue b subunit is believed to span the membrane once at its hydrophobic N terminus, whereas the remainder of the protein is very hydrophilic. b is thought to exist as a dimer in the complex (5Schairer H.U. Hoppe J. Sebald W. Friedl P. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Aris J.P. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Removal of two residues from the C terminus of b disrupts normal assembly of the complex (10Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as does mutation of Gly-131 to aspartate (11Jans D.A. Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 420-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus theb subunit is essential for linking the F1 and F0 sectors and likely plays a key role in the coupling of energy from proton translocation to ATP synthesis. The crystal structure of the mitochondrial F1 has shown that the α and β subunits alternate in a hexagonal ring structure, with two long α-helices from γ extending into a hole in the center of the ring (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Recent evidence strongly suggests that γ and probably ε rotate relative to α and β during catalysis (13Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several studies have implied that the δ subunit is located near the top of the αβ cluster (17Dunn S.D. Heppel L.A. Fullmer C.S. J. Biol.

Membranes of mutant E. coli strains expressing truncated forms of δ showed little ATPase activity (21Jounouchi M. Takeyama M. Chaiprasert P. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that F1cannot bind to the membrane in the absence of δ.

The only subunit of F0 able to span the distance from the membrane to the top of F1 is b . The hydrophilic portion of b is dimeric, highly α-helical, has an elongated shape, and binds to F1 (25Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although chemical cross-linking of E. coli ATP synthase has failed to revealb -δ cross-links, such products have been obtained with the chloroplast (26Beckers G. Berzborn R.J. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial (27Joshi S. Burrows R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14518-14525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enzymes. In the chloroplast work, the cross-link produced by 1-ethyl-3,3-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide was mapped to the C-terminal part of b . The site in δ was determined to be within the cyanogen bromide fragment encompassing residues Val-1 to Met-165 of the 187-residue polypeptide. Recent studies (28Collinson I.R. van Raaij M.J.

In the present work we examine the interaction between E. coli b and F1. An F1 affinity resin has been generated by linking the hydrophilic portion of b to a solid support. By using binding assays based on this resin, analytical ultracentrifugation, and chemical cross-linking, we have gathered evidence to demonstrate an interaction between residues at the C terminus of b and the C-terminal region of δ. Molecular biological procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pMR2, which was used as an intermediate during the construction of pJB2, was generated from pSD80 (33Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) by elimination of anNde I site outside of the multiple cloning region, followed by insertion of the PCR-amplified uncF gene from pSD51 (25Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the Eco RI and Hin dIII sites. The PCR primer was designed such that the initiating ATG codon is part of anNde I site. Plasmid pJB2, encoding the b MERC protein, was constructed as follows. pDM3 (34McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used as the template for PCR, using the mutagenic primer 5′-GCGCATATGGAACGTTGCTCGAATTCCCACTACG-3′, the 5′ end contains an Nde I site and the 3′ end is complementary to the beginning of the gene encoding b 24–156. The initial ATG codon is underlined . The second primer for PCR was the M13 forward sequencing primer. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the Nde I and Hin dIII sites of pMR2 to encode a protein beginning with the amino acid sequence MERCSNSH followed by residues Tyr-24 through Leu-156 of the b sequence. The entire open reading frame was sequenced to ensure that no mutation had arisen during the PCR. Plasmids expressing other variants of b 24–156(b 24–155, b 24–152, and the mutations D150C, K151C, E155C, and 158C) were based on pDM3 (34McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In general, mutagenic PCR primers were designed to encode the desired mutation and were cloned into pDM3 using unique restriction endonuclease sites. Correct incorporation of the desired mutations into all of the above plasmids was determined by DNA sequencing. To introduce mutations into the full-length b protein, appropriate restriction endonucleases were used to cut the desired fragment from the pDM3-based plasmid and transfer it to pDM8 (34McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmid pSD114 encoding b 34–156has been described previously (34McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). b 24–156 andb 34–156 were expressed and purified as described (34McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cysteine-containing and truncated forms ofb 24–156 as well as b MERCwere expressed and purified in the same manner asb 24–156, except that proteins containing cysteine residues were purified in the presence of 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT). Plasmids encoding wild type or mutated full-length b were transformed into the uncF E. coli strain KM2 (35McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the proteins and preparation of membranes were performed as described (34McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The δ subunit was expressed and purified as described previously (31Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). F1 was purified by standard methods (36Dunn S.D. Tozer R.G. Antczak D.F. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10418-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DTT was removed from b MERC by passing it through a Sephadex G-25 size exclusion column equilibrated with 50 mmtriethanolamine HCl (TEA-HCl), pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Sulfo-link Coupling gel, obtained from Pierce, was washed with 8 volumes of 50 mm TEA-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA before addition of 2.5 mg of b MERC per ml of resin. The mixture was incubated at room temperature with agitation for 1 h, and then excess buffer was removed and assayed for protein. Based on the amount of protein remaining in the solution, the amount ofb MERC bound to the resin was inferred to be 2.2 mg per ml of resin. The resin was then incubated at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA containing 50 mm cysteine to block any unreacted thiol-binding sites. After 1 h, excess buffer was removed; the resin was washed with 1m NaCl, and it was resuspended to its original volume in buffer at pH 7.4. The resin was stored at 4 °C. A control resin was prepared by incubating the Sulfo-link Coupling gel with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA containing 50 mm cysteine instead of the b MERCprotein. Two assays for F1 binding were used. In the “soluble ATPase activity” assay, 31.3 μg of F1 supplemented with 0.8 μg of the δ subunit was incubated with 20 μl of the affinity resin in a final volume of 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and 0.15 mg/ml BSA (binding buffer). The δ subunit was added to the assay to make up for any deficiency of that subunit in the F1-ATPase, since a fraction of δ is easily lost during purification of the complex (37Futai M. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After gentle agitation for 1 h at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged to pellet the resin. The ATPase activity of the supernatant was assayed as described (37Futai M. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the “SDS-PAGE” assay, F1, δ, and the affinity resin in the amounts described above were mixed in 250 μl of the binding buffer. After the 1-h incubation and centrifugation, the supernatant solution was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT. After heating at 100 °C for 10 min, the mixture was centrifuged to sediment the resin, and 10 μl of the supernatant solution were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out using a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge at 20 °C. Buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (centrifugation buffer) was used. In sedimentation velocity experiments the rotor speed was 60,000 rpm, and scans were taken at 10-min intervals. During analysis of δ, 1 mm DTT was added to the centrifugation buffer; the buffer used during experiments in which δ and forms of b were mixed contained 0.5 mmDTT. The data were analyzed with the Beckman software using the time derivative method of Stafford (38Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 161: 70-79Google Scholar). The values of Cohn and Edsall (39Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides. Reinhold, New York1943: 157-161Google Scholar) were used to calculate partial specific volumes. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C and 20,000 rpm usingb 24–152 at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg of protein per ml in centrifugation buffer. Three molecular weight determinations were done at each concentration. Membranes containing F1F0 complexes including either wild type or mutated b were diluted to 0.25 mg of total protein per ml with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Benzophenone-4-maleimide (BPM) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. Controls were performed in which only DMF was added to the membranes. The treated membranes were exposed to long wave ultraviolet light from an Ultra-Violet Products model TM-36 transilluminator for 5 min. As a control some BPM-modified samples were placed on the transilluminator but were removed before it was turned on. After illumination, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the samples, which were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Purified F1 and wild type or cysteine-containingb 24–156 were passed separately through 1-ml centrifuge columns (40Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) containing Bio-Gel P-10 resin (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to all b 24–156 samples in a 1.1-fold molar excess to ensure the reduction of any disulfide bonds. BPM in DMF was added in a 5-fold molar excess overb 24–156; in control samples DMF alone was added. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, an excess of DTT was added to consume unreacted BPM. Theb 24–156 was then mixed with the column-centrifuged F1 at a molar ratio of 1.2 F1 per b 24–156 dimer, in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2. Cross-linking and analysis was carried out as described above for the membrane samples. Cross-linkedb 24–156E155C-F1 andb 24–158158C-F1 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained briefly with Coomassie Blue. After destaining for 10 min with 10% acetic acid, gel slices containing bands to be cleaved were excised from the gel and were dried by lyophilization. The dried gel slices were then treated with 2% CNBr in 70% formic acid. After 30 min the slices had swollen back to their original sizes. At this time the excess CNBr solution was removed, and the tubes containing the gel slices were sealed and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The pH of the slices was then adjusted by three successive 15-min incubations in 150 μl of 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by 15-min incubations in 150 μl of 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 μl of 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 150 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT. The slices were placed in the wells of a second SDS-polyacrylamide gel that had been pre-electrophoresed for 1 h at 100 V in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, containing 0.1 mm sodium thioglycolate to scavenge free radicals in the gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in the presence of 0.1 mm thioglycolate. The gel was either stained with Coomassie Blue or Western blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After blotting, the membrane was stained briefly with Coomassie Blue and destained with 30% methanol before the bands of interest were excised and analyzed by peptide sequencing. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) using 15% separating gels. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein blotting onto PVDF membranes was carried out using carbonate blot buffer (42Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The anti-b monoclonal antibodies 10-1A4 and 10-6D1 were generous gifts of Drs. Karlheinz Altendorf and Gabriele Deckers-Hebestreit of Universität Osnabrück, Germany. Anti-δ polyclonal antiserum was raised against purified δ subunit (43Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4020-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the anti-δ antibodies were affinity purified on a column containing immobilized recombinant δ (31Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Antibodies were labeled with125I by the IODO-GEN method (44Fraker F.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) or Lowry et al. (46Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing was performed at the Laboratory for Macromolecular Structure at Purdue University (West Lafayette, IN) using an Applied Biosystems 470A sequencer. To characterize better the binding between the F1 sector and the hydrophilic portion of b , we coupled this region of b to a solid matrix to form an affinity resin for F1. The Sulfo-link coupling gel from Pierce, to which proteins can be coupled specifically via thiol groups, was chosen as a matrix. Since the hydrophilic region of b has no cysteine residues, the site of coupling to the resin can be specified by site-directed mutagenesis of b . Because the C-terminal region was thought most likely to be involved inb -F1 contacts, we introduced a cysteine residue near the N terminus of the hydrophilic region. A construct encoding the polypeptide sequence MERCSNSHY24-L156(b MERC) was produced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first four amino acids of this sequence were taken from the E. coli enzyme 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase I, because of the polar nature of the sequence and the high expression of this enzyme in a recombinant system (47Sakumi K. Nakabeppu Y. Yamamoto Y. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15761-15766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified b MERC was coupled to the Sulfo-link resin as described under “Experimental Procedures,” at a final concentration of 2.2 mg per ml of resin. Upon incubation of the modified resin with the F1 complex followed by centrifugation, a significant amount of F1 sedimented with the resin, as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A, first lane ). Only a small amount of F1 co-sedimented with the resin that had been modified with cysteine (Fig. 1 A, last lane ). The F1 present in this pellet was probably not bound specifically to the resin but rather was trapped between and within the resin particles. As a control for the volume of trapped liquid, BSA was included in all incubations; similar amounts of BSA were observed to co-sediment with both resins under all conditions used (Fig. 1). Thus the b MERC-modified resin is able to bind F1 specifically. The faint band migrating at the position of b 24–156 in the first lane represents a trace of b MERC eluted from the resin during the incubation in SDS sample buffer. Most likely this arose from instances in which only one subunit of the dimer became covalently coupled to the resin. To test the ability of the hydrophilic portion ofb to compete with the resin for binding to F1, the resin was incubated with F1 in the presence of increasing amounts of b 24–156 (formerly known as b syn; Ref. 33Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After centrifugation and analysis of the pellet by SDS-PAGE, the amount of F1 bound to the resin was observed to decrease as the concentration ofb 24–156 increased, until essentially no F1 was bound by the resin at 6.5 μm ofb 24–156 dimer (Fig. 1 A ). Note that the amounts of soluble b 24–156 trapped within the pelleted resin provide an internal representation of the amount of competitor added. These experiments demonstrate thatb 24–156 is able to compete with theb MERC-modified resin for binding to F1, establishing a simple competition assay for determining the relative affinity of any mutant form of b for F1. Such experiments were carried out using b 24–155and b 24–152, which lack one and four residues from the C terminus, respectively. It was found that these forms ofb competed very poorly, relative tob 24–156, with theb MERC-modified resin (Fig. 1 B ). At a dimer concentration of 10 μm,b 24–155 showed a small amount of competition, whereas at the same concentration b 24–152showed no detectable competition by the SDS-PAGE assay. It is evident, however, that very weak competition is difficult to detect in this manner, as it requires seeing a small difference in band intensity. To determine weak competition more reliably and in a quantifiable way, the assay was modified such that soluble ATPase activity, rather than bound ATPase protein, was measured. Under the conditions used in these assays, more than 90% of the added enzyme was bound by the resin. Competition for F1 binding byb 24–156, b 24–155, andb 24–152 was determined by the increase in ATPase activity remaining in the supernatant solution when these forms of b were added to the incubations. As expected, the amount of F1 in the supernatant solution increased sharply with increasing concentration of b 24–156, whereas the ability of b 24–155 andb 24–152 to compete with theb MERC-modified resin was far weaker, although still detectable (Fig. 2). These results show that the C-terminal residues of b are essential for its proper interaction with F1-ATPase. The preparations of soluble b were tested directly for ATP hydrolysis activity to make certain that trace contamination with an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase could not account for the increase in soluble ATPase activity. In no case could such a contaminant account for more than 2% of the observed soluble activity. Recent ultracentrifugation results from this laboratory have provided evidence for the formation of an elongated complex by two molecules of the hydrophilic region ofb and one molecule of the δ subunit (31Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We performed further centrifugation experiments to determine whether the reduced binding of the C-terminal truncations of b to F1could be due to loss of contacts with δ. The isolatedb 24–156 and δ subunits showed sedimentation coefficients (Table I) which were similar to those previously reported for b sol (25Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and δ (31Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The increase in the s 20,w upon mixture of equimolar amounts of dimeric b 24–156and δ is confirmation that these proteins form a complex in solution. Mixtures of δ with b 24–155 or withb 24–152 resulted in s values only slightly above the weighted averages of the two components, indicating tha"

Insulin elegantly regulates a variety of metabolic responses. The actions of insulin at the cellular level are initiated by insulin binding to its plasma membrane receptor. Following ligand-induced autophosphorylation of the receptor, phosphorylation of endogenous substrates occurs to mediate the transmission of an insulin signaling pathway (1Kahn C.R. White M.F.

IRS-1 and IRS-2 contain common functional units but are thought to regulate unique signaling pathways in part to their distinct cellular distribution. IRS-1 and IRS-2 appear in all tissue; however, IRS-2 predominates in cells of myeloid lineage. A great deal of study has concentrated on IRS-1, and it has been found that activated IRS-1 recognizes and binds to Src homology 2 domains of various signal transduction proteins such as PI 3-kinase, SH-PTP-2, Grb2, and Nck (4Skolnik E.Y.

The critical role of PI 3-kinase in diverse actions of insulin has been established in a number of independent studies. One report demonstrates that PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 cells is required for insulin stimulation of pp70 S6 kinase, DNA synthesis, and glucose transporter translocation (5Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J.

In addition to the IRS family and the PI 3-kinase pathway, another set of proteins has been identified as a proximal target for several growth factor tyrosine kinases including the insulin receptor (19Pronk G.J.

In the liver, the pentose phosphate pathway is a primary pathway responsible for the insulin-influenced fate of carbohydrate, since up to 50% of the glucose 6-phosphate can be shuttled through. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; EC 1.1.1.49), the key rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, controls the flow of carbon through this pathway and also produces NADPH needed for maintenance of reduced glutathione and reductive biosynthesis. G6PDH has not been extensively characterized with regard to insulin action, since in most tissues and organisms it has been considered to have a “housekeeping” role (38Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K.W. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). While the housekeeping role of G6PDH is not disputed, the insulin induction of G6PDH activity and mRNA (38Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K.W. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 39Stumpo D.J. Kletzien R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Fritz R.S. Stumpo D.S. Kletzien R.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 637-640Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) has been studied bothin vivo and in vitro . Recently, we have cloned the promoter region of the G6PDH gene (41Rank K.B. Harris P.K. Ginsberg L.C. Stapleton S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 90-92Google Scholar). In transient expression studies in primary rat hepatocytes, we show that a chimeric construct containing 935 base pairs of the G6PDH promoter region responds to insulin similarly to endogenous G6PDH. Few studies have utilized primary cells in culture for elucidation of signal pathways, since they are not easily experimentally manipulated or conducive to dominant negative or overexpression approaches. They are, however, an ideal model for elucidating mechanisms utilized for gene expression, since they can be maintained in a chemically defined, serum-free medium and since the metabolic responses to hormones or nutrients generally mimic those observed in vivo . For these reasons, we have utilized primary hepatocytes in culture, a representative cell population from a primary target tissue of insulin, to investigate the role of insulin signal proteins in the induction of G6PDH expression. To determine which signal proteins are necessary for transmission of the message from the insulin receptor to the G6PDH gene, we have completed studies using well characterized inhibitors of insulin signal proteins. We show, using inhibitors of Ras farnesylation (B581 and lovastatin) as well as an inhibitor of MEK (PD 98059), that the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway is not utilized in the insulin induction of G6PDH. Wortmannin and LY 294002, two mechanistically distinct inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, however, completely block the insulin-induced activation of G6PDH expression, demonstrating a role for PI 3-kinase in the regulation of this gene. In rat hepatocytes in culture, we find that S6 kinase is activated by insulin in a rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive way. Results from double immunoblot analysis suggest that the rapamycin-insensitive pathway for insulin activation of S6 kinase is mediated via Akt. Unlike previous studies that have found genes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to be rapamycin-insensitive and possibly mediated downstream of PI 3-kinase via Akt, we find the insulin induction of G6PDH to be rapamycin-sensitive. PD 98059 was generously provided by Dr. Alan Saltiel (Parke-Davis). Lovastatin, was a gift from Merck. B581 and LY 294002 were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories. Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma. Rapamycin was obtained from Calbiochem. Insulin was a gift from Lilly. Hepatocytes were isolated using collagenase, hyaluronidase perfusion as described by Stapleton et al. (42Stapleton S.R. Stevens G.J. Teel J.F. Rank K.B. Berg E.A. Wu J-Y. Ginsberg L.C. Kletzien R.F. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Kalamazoo, MI) weighing 200–300 g were food-deprived 48 h prior to the isolation procedure. After collagenase perfusion, the liver was excised and forced through four layers of sterile gauze. The cells were washed two times with serum-free Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and pelleted for 3 min at 4 °C and 50 ×g . The pellet was gently resuspended in medium, and an aliquot of cells was counted with a hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Collagen-coated 60-mm tissue culture dishes were plated with 3.0 × 106cells/plate. The cells were incubated in serum-free Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium supplemented with gentamicin (10 μg/ml) under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After about 4 h of incubation, the cells were washed, and fresh medium was applied. When used in the subsequent studies, the inhibitors PD 98059, B581, wortmannin, and LY 294002 were added 1 h prior to the addition of insulin. Lovastatin, however, was added 24 h prior to insulin addition. It has previously been shown that shorter preincubation times with lovastatin had little to no effect on the insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity (22Reusch J.E-B. Bhuripanyo P. Carel K.

Total RNA was extracted using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). Total RNA (25 μg) was treated with formaldehyde and subjected to electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels (46Fourney R.M. Miyakoshi J. Day R.S. Paterson M.C. Focus. 1988; 10: 5-6Google Scholar). The separated RNAs were transferred to GeneScreen (NEN Life Science Products) and hybridized with [32P]dCTP random-primed (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) labeled cDNA for G6PDH (47Kletzien R.F.

Biochimie. 1993; 75: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C with Kodak XAR-5 film and intensifying screens. The exposed films were quantitated by densitometric scanning. The amount of G6PDH mRNA was normalized to the control probe, β-actin (48Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. MacDonald R.J. Cowan N.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1980; 15: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). After 5 min of insulin treatment (80 nm), cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were flash frozen and then scraped and processed in a buffer as described previously (49Stapleton S.R. Garlock G. Foellmi-Adams L. Kletzien R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The total cell extracts were used to determine the association of PI 3-kinase with Akt using the dual immunoprecipitation method. Akt was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts using the Akt C-terminal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunocomplex was washed with PBS and suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and subsequently subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 8% acrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the directions provided by the manufacturer of the apparatus, NOVEX. The membrane was blocked overnight in blocking buffer with 5% milk in PBS containing 1% Tween 20 (PBST). It was then incubated with the primary antibody, anti-PI 3-kinase (N-terminal) (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h, after which the gel was washed three times with the PBST. Secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to the membrane, after which the gel was washed again with PBST. The reactive bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence-detecting system as described by the manufacturer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Analysis of MAP kinase activity was carried out using a myelin basic protein in-gel activity assay (50Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hara K. Gotoh Y. Kosako H. Matsuda S. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Akanuma Y. Nishida E. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21089-21097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed in a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.53 mg/ml bovine myelin basic protein (Life Technologies, Inc.). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed sequentially in solutions containing 20% isopropyl alcohol in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), buffer B, and 6 m guanidine HCl in buffer B. After the denaturation step, the gel was washed with 0.04% Triton X-100 in buffer B and then in 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2. Finally, the gel was incubated with 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP, rinsed in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Results were quantitated by a scanning densitometer. PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates with anti-PI 3-kinase N-Src homology 2 (Upstate Biotechnology) as described by the supplier. The immunoprecipitate was trapped with 50% Sepharose in PBS. The precipitate was washed first with a PBS solution containing 1% Tween 40 and 100 μmvanadate. Subsequent washes contained 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 500 mm LiCl2 and finally 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm vanadate. The assay for PI 3-kinase activity was then carried out as described previously (51Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 271: 77-79Google Scholar). The phosphorylated product was extracted with a 1:1 chloroform/methanol mixture. The sample was then applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate coated with 1% potassium oxalate. After development, the plates were exposed to x-ray film. The radioactivity incorporated during the PI 3-kinase reaction was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. S6 kinase assay was carried out following the directions supplied by the manufacturer of the S6 kinase kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Basically, S6 Kinase antibody was incubated with the protein A-agarose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and cell lysate containing 200–300 μg of total protein was added to the beads and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Kinase reaction using [32P]ATP was carried out on the beads for 10 min at room temperature. Product was purified on phosphocellulose paper, and the amount of radioactivity was quantitated using a scintillation counter. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Significance was evaluated by one-tailed Student'st test. Significance was tested at p < 0.05. The role of Ras in the insulin regulation of G6PDH gene expression was studied by transiently transfecting the 935G6PDH-LUC into hepatocytes and then assessing luciferase activity in the presence of insulin plus inhibitors of Ras farnesylation. The effect of the Ras farnesylation inhibitors was also tested on the insulin induction of endogenous G6PDH mRNA. Two structurally different farnesylation inhibitors, lovastatin and B581, have been proven to be effective in a variety of cell types (18Lefebvre V. Mechin M.-C. Louckx M.P. Rider M.H. Hue L. J.

Cells pretreated with varying concentrations of either lovastatin or B581 showed concentration-dependent decreases in insulin-stimulated MAPK activity. Preincubation with either 25 μm lovastatin or 50 μm B581 completely blocked the 2–3-fold insulin stimulation of MAP kinase activity (Fig.1 A ). Neither inhibitor at concentrations effective at blocking the insulin-stimulated MAPK activity, however, had an effect on the insulin-induced expression of 935G6PDH-LUC (Fig. 1 B ), suggesting that Ras is not utilized in the insulin-induced expression of G6PDH. These same results were also observed when the inhibitors were tested for their ability to block the insulin induction of endogenous G6PDH mRNA (Fig.2).Figure 2Effect of signal protein inhibitors on insulin regulation of endogenous G6PDH mRNA levels.

Isoproterenol and forskolin increased maxi-K potassium channel currents in voltage-clamped oocytes expressing the receptor and both channel subunits by 33 ± 5% and 35 ± 8%, respectively, without affecting current activation or inactivation. The percentage of stimulation by isoproterenol and forskolin was not different in oocytes coexpressing the α and β subunits versus those expressing the only the α subunit, suggesting that the α subunit is the target for regulation. The stimulatory effect of isoproterenol was almost completely blocked by intracellular injection of the cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) regulatory subunit, whereas injection of a cyclic GMP dependent protein kinase inhibitory peptide had little effect, indicating that cellular coupling of β2-adrenergic receptors to maxi-K channels involves endogenous cAMP-PK. Mutation of one of several potential consensus cAMP-PK phosphorylation sites (serine 869) on the α subunit almost completely inhibited β-adrenergic receptor/channel stimulatory coupling, whereas forskolin still stimulated currents moderately (16 ± 4%). These data demonstrate that physiological coupling between β2 receptors and maxi-K channels occurs by the cAMP-PK mediated phosphorylation of serine 869 on the α subunit on the channel.

Hormones and neurotransmitters alter cellular excitability in part through the modulation of plasmalemmal ion channel function. Two prominent mechanisms by which hormone/neurotransmitter receptor occupation results in the modulation of membrane ion channels are the phosphorylation of one or more residues of the target channel protein(s) (for review see Ref. 1Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and the binding of a heterotrimeric G protein subunit to a modulatory channel domain (for review see Ref.2Wickman K.

Both the human α (hSlo) and β (hKv,Caβ) subunit genes encode several consensus cAMP-PK, although the site(s) associated with physiological regulation have not been determined. We examined β-adrenergic receptor/maxi K coupling by coexpression of hSlo and hKv,Caβ and the human β2-adrenergic receptor gene (hβ2AR) inXenopus laevis oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. We demonstrate that isoproterenol and forskolin increase maxi-K currents in voltage-clamped oocytes, that this action is mediated by PKA phosphorylation of the α subunit, and that mutation of Ser-869 almost completely eliminates β2receptor/channel coupling.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates the reconstitution of β2-adrenergic receptor stimulatory coupling to maxi-K channels by heterologous expression of receptor and channel RNAs inX. laevis oocytes. Isoproterenol and forskolin increased maxi-K currents in oocytes expressing either the pore-forming α subunit alone, or co-expressing the α and regulatory β subunits (Figs. 1 and 2, Table I). The stimulated currents were not endogenous oocyte currents since there was no augmentation of outward current in oocytes expressing β2 receptors but not maxi-K channels, and since forskolin, but not ISO, stimulated currents in oocytes expressing maxi-K channels, but not β2 receptors (TableI). Moreover, virtually all of the outward current was inhibited by iberiotoxin (Figs. 1 and 2), a selective peptidyl inhibitor of maxi-K channels (36Galvez A. Gimenez-Gallego G. Reuben J.P.

Since heterologous expression avoids complications associated with expression of multiple receptor or channel subtypes in target tissues, the present results clearly establish stimulatory coupling between human β2 receptors and maxi-K channels. Further, since stimulation was achieved with expression of only the β2 receptor and the α subunit and the degree of stimulation was similar with or without the regulatory β subunit (Table I), these studies localize the modulatory site to the channel α subunit. It should be noted that the degree of stimulation observed (30–35%) is somewhat less than reported in mammalian cells.

Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). We used the heterologous expression system and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the mechanism of β adrenergic stimulatory coupling to maxi-K channels and to identify the relevant channel modulatory site. Our data clearly implicate cAMP-PK in β2 receptor/channel stimulatory coupling since injection of the regulatory subunit of cAMP-PK disrupts β2 receptor/maxi-K channel stimulatory coupling (Fig. 3). In addition to disrupting stimulatory coupling, injection of oocytes with the cAMP-PK regulatory subunit also consistently reduced the amplitude of the basal current before application of isoproterenol (Fig. 3 B ), suggesting that phosphorylation by cAMP-PK regulates maxi-K channel activity under resting conditions. Conversely, a semi-selective (6-fold) cGMP-PK inhibitory peptide only slightly reduced ISO current stimulation, consistent with the predicted inhibition of cAMP-PK. Further evidence suggesting functional modulation of maxi-K channels by cAMP-PK was the finding that heterologously expressed maxi-K channels are stimulated by forskolin, and that this stimulation occurs with or without expression of the β2 receptor (Fig. 2, Table I).dSlo, the Drosophila maxi-K channel gene, contains a single optimal consensus sequence for PKA phosphorylation in the C-terminal region of the protein (RRGS at 959–962; Ref. 24Atkinson N.S. Robertson G.A. Ganetzky B. Science. 1991; 253: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and mutations at this site were later found to prevent channel activation by exogenous PKA in inside-out patches (42Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of dSlo contain a less cAMP-PK -specific phosphorylation site at approximately the same position (RQPS at 866–869, e.g. GenBank accession no. U11058), which is conserved in mammalian genes, and which occupies a similar position upstream of a highly conserved region, aspartate-rich region that is a likely calcium-binding site (43Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, as many as 10 other potential cAMP-PK consensus phosphorylation sites exist throughout the coding region of the α subunit (37Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To ascertain the physiologically relevant phosphorylation site, we mutated serine 869 to alanine, and coexpressed the mutant α subunit with the wild type β subunit and the β2receptor. This single mutation markedly reduced, but did not abolish, β2 receptor stimulation of the current (from 33.3 ± 5.1% to 5.5 ± 1.3%, Table I), strongly implicating serine 869 in receptor/effector coupling. The low degree of current stimulation consistently observed in the mutant may relate to a slight role for additional cAMP phosphorylation sites, coupling through other kinases, or direct G protein interactions. Moreover, forskolin stimulation was only decreased by about half in mutant channels, suggesting that additional sites of channel modulation exist. It is possible that the dominant mechanism of stimulatory coupling observed in our experiments relates to factors unique to the Xenopus oocyte, such as cell size or endogenous G proteins, and that other regulatory mechanisms may be more prominent in mammalian cells. However, our results are consistent with the major mechanism of β2receptor/maxi-K channel stimulatory coupling occurring by cAMP-PK phosphorylation of serine 869.Finally, the stimulatory effect of both the β2 receptor agonist ISO and forskolin was an increase in current amplitude at all voltages, without a change in current kinetics, similar to the modulatory action of β2 receptor stimulation on cardiac sodium channel α subunits heterologously expressed inXenopus oocytes (44Schreibmayer W. Frohnwieser B. Dascal N. Platzer D. Spreitzer B. Zechner R. Kallen R.G. Lester H.A. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, mutation of all consensus cAMP-PK sites on the sodium channel failed to remove channel stimulation, leading to the suggestion that modulation might occur by phosphorylation of an unrelated protein resulting in a redistribution of channels to the plasma membrane (44Schreibmayer W. Frohnwieser B. Dascal N. Platzer D. Spreitzer B. Zechner R. Kallen R.G. Lester H.A. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar). ISO stimulation of sodium currents was quite slow (approximately 10 min to maximum stimulation), which could be consistent with a redistribution of membranes within the oocyte. In the present study, however, stimulatory coupling occurred quite rapidly (approximately 1 min to maximum), which would be consistent with a direct effect on channel gating.In summary, we have used a heterologous expression system to demonstrated β2-adrenergic receptor/maxi-K channel stimulatory coupling. Coupling involves a cAMP-PK-dependent phosphorylation of the channel α subunit; mutation of one consensus cAMP-PK phosphorylation site (serine 869) almost eliminates β2-adrenergic modulation of the maxi-K current. These findings do not rule out other modulatory mechanisms, but do confine the physiologically relevant molecular mechanisms associated with β2 receptor/maxi-K channel coupling. Hormones and neurotransmitters alter cellular excitability in part through the modulation of plasmalemmal ion channel function. Two prominent mechanisms by which hormone/neurotransmitter receptor occupation results in the modulation of membrane ion channels are the phosphorylation of one or more residues of the target channel protein(s) (for review see Ref. 1Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and the binding of a heterotrimeric G protein subunit to a modulatory channel domain (for review see Ref.2Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Stimulation of β2 receptors relaxes smooth muscle by modulating the activity of several protein targets (3Bulbring E. Tomita T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 49-96PubMed Google Scholar). One prominent target of β2 adrenergic signaling in smooth muscle is the large conductance, calcium-activated potassium (maxi-K) 1The abbreviations used are: maxi-K, large conductance, calcium-activated potassium; cAMP-PK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; cGMP-PK, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; ISO, isoproterenol. 1The abbreviations used are: maxi-K, large conductance, calcium-activated potassium; cAMP-PK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; cGMP-PK, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; ISO, isoproterenol. channel, the activity of which is markedly increased following receptor binding (4Sadoshima J.

Modulation of maxi-K channel activity appears to be a functionally important component of β-adrenergic relaxation of smooth muscle, since charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin, selective peptide inhibitors of maxi-K channels, markedly inhibit the relaxant ability of isoproterenol and other β-adrenergic agents (8Jones T.R.

However, as many as 10 other potential cAMP-PK consensus phosphorylation sites exist throughout the coding region of the α subunit (37Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To ascertain the physiologically relevant phosphorylation site, we mutated serine 869 to alanine, and coexpressed the mutant α subunit with the wild type β subunit and the β2receptor. This single mutation markedly reduced, but did not abolish, β2 receptor stimulation of the current (from 33.3 ± 5.1% to 5.5 ± 1.3%, Table I), strongly implicating serine 869 in receptor/effector coupling. The low degree of current stimulation consistently observed in the mutant may relate to a slight role for additional cAMP phosphorylation sites, coupling through other kinases, or direct G protein interactions. Moreover, forskolin stimulation was only decreased by about half in mutant channels, suggesting that additional sites of channel modulation exist. It is possible that the dominant mechanism of stimulatory coupling observed in our experiments relates to factors unique to the Xenopus oocyte, such as cell size or endogenous G proteins, and that other regulatory mechanisms may be more prominent in mammalian cells. However, our results are consistent with the major mechanism of β2receptor/maxi-K channel stimulatory coupling occurring by cAMP-PK phosphorylation of serine 869.Finally, the stimulatory effect of both the β2 receptor agonist ISO and forskolin was an increase in current amplitude at all voltages, without a change in current kinetics, similar to the modulatory action of β2 receptor stimulation on cardiac sodium channel α subunits heterologously expressed inXenopus oocytes (44Schreibmayer W. Frohnwieser B. Dascal N. Platzer D. Spreitzer B. Zechner R. Kallen R.G. Lester H.A. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, mutation of all consensus cAMP-PK sites on the sodium channel failed to remove channel stimulation, leading to the suggestion that modulation might occur by phosphorylation of an unrelated protein resulting in a redistribution of channels to the plasma membrane (44Schreibmayer W. Frohnwieser B. Dascal N. Platzer D. Spreitzer B. Zechner R. Kallen R.G. Lester H.A. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar). ISO stimulation of sodium currents was quite slow (approximately 10 min to maximum stimulation), which could be consistent with a redistribution of membranes within the oocyte. In the present study, however, stimulatory coupling occurred quite rapidly (approximately 1 min to maximum), which would be consistent with a direct effect on channel gating.In summary, we have used a heterologous expression system to demonstrated β2-adrenergic receptor/maxi-K channel stimulatory coupling. Coupling involves a cAMP-PK-dependent phosphorylation of the channel α subunit; mutation of one consensus cAMP-PK phosphorylation site (serine 869) almost eliminates β2-adrenergic modulation of the maxi-K current. These findings do not rule out other modulatory mechanisms, but do confine the physiologically relevant molecular mechanisms associated with β2 receptor/maxi-K channel coupling. The present study demonstrates the reconstitution of β2-adrenergic receptor stimulatory coupling to maxi-K channels by heterologous expression of receptor and channel RNAs inX. laevis oocytes. Isoproterenol and forskolin increased maxi-K currents in oocytes expressing either the pore-forming α subunit alone, or co-expressing the α and regulatory β subunits (Figs. 1 and 2, Table I). The stimulated currents were not endogenous oocyte currents since there was no augmentation of outward current in oocytes expressing β2 receptors but not maxi-K channels, and since forskolin, but not ISO, stimulated currents in oocytes expressing maxi-K channels, but not β2 receptors (TableI). Moreover, virtually all of the outward current was inhibited by iberiotoxin (Figs. 1 and 2), a selective peptidyl inhibitor of maxi-K channels (36Galvez A. Gimenez-Gallego G. Reuben J.P. Roy-Contancin L. Geigenbaum P. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11083-11090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since heterologous expression avoids complications associated with expression of multiple receptor or channel subtypes in target tissues, the present results clearly establish stimulatory coupling between human β2 receptors and maxi-K channels. Further, since stimulation was achieved with expression of only the β2 receptor and the α subunit and the degree of stimulation was similar with or without the regulatory β subunit (Table I), these studies localize the modulatory site to the channel α subunit. It should be noted that the degree of stimulation observed (30–35%) is somewhat less than reported in mammalian cells. In smooth muscle cells, current stimulation varies from approximately 50% to 100%, and is somewhat dependent on the step voltage and [Ca2+]i (7Song Y. Simard J.M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). We used the heterologous expression system and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the mechanism of β adrenergic stimulatory coupling to maxi-K channels and to identify the relevant channel modulatory site. Our data clearly implicate cAMP-PK in β2 receptor/channel stimulatory coupling since injection of the regulatory subunit of cAMP-PK disrupts β2 receptor/maxi-K channel stimulatory coupling (Fig. 3). In addition to disrupting stimulatory coupling, injection of oocytes with the cAMP-PK regulatory subunit also consistently reduced the amplitude of the basal current before application of isoproterenol (Fig. 3 B ), suggesting that phosphorylation by cAMP-PK regulates maxi-K channel activity under resting conditions. Conversely, a semi-selective (6-fold) cGMP-PK inhibitory peptide only slightly reduced ISO current stimulation, consistent with the predicted inhibition of cAMP-PK. Further evidence suggesting functional modulation of maxi-K channels by cAMP-PK was the finding that heterologously expressed maxi-K channels are stimulated by forskolin, and that this stimulation occurs with or without expression of the β2 receptor (Fig. 2, Table I). dSlo, the Drosophila maxi-K channel gene, contains a single optimal consensus sequence for PKA phosphorylation in the C-terminal region of the protein (RRGS at 959–962; Ref. 24Atkinson N.S. Robertson G.A. Ganetzky B. Science. 1991; 253: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and mutations at this site were later found to prevent channel activation by exogenous PKA in inside-out patches (42Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of dSlo contain a less cAMP-PK -specific phosphorylation site at approximately the same position (RQPS at 866–869, e.g. GenBank accession no. U11058), which is conserved in mammalian genes, and which occupies a similar position upstream of a highly conserved region, aspartate-rich region that is a likely calcium-binding site (43Schreiber M.

These results describe a unique biosynthetic pathway for T. cruzi surface mucin-like molecules, with potential chemotherapeutic implications. Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, a multisystemic disorder endemic in much of Latin America. This protozoan has a complex life cycle involving morphologically distinct stages in mammalian and insect hosts. Blood-sucking triatomine bugs transmit infective trypomastigotes to the mammalian host, which multiply intracellularly as amastigotes prior to differentiation into trypomastigotes, which, after rupture of the host cell, enter the blood stream, enabling infection of fresh cells or ingestion by a feeding triatomine bug, thus completing the biological cycle of transmission (1Brener Z. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1973; 27: 347-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Antigenic glycoconjugates, including the highly O -glycosylated sialoglycoproteins, known as mucin-like molecules, have been strongly implicated in the molecular mechanism of attachment to and invasion of mammalian host cells (2Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The sialic acid residues present in these molecules are derived from host sialoglycoconjugates (3Previato J.O. Andrade A.F.B. Dos Reis G.A. Mendonça-Previato L. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1991; 86: 53-54Google Scholar) and are transferred to the T. cruzi surface glycoproteins by a unique trans -sialidase (4Previato J.O. Andrade A.F.B. Pessolani M.C.V.

The first evidence forO -glycosylation of serine and/or threonine in trypanosomal glycoproteins came from studies of T. cruzi GP-25 (5Mendonça-Previato L. Gorin P.A.J. Braga A.F. Scharfstein J.

The GlcNAc-Thr core can be extended by addition of Galp , Galf , and sialic acid residues. These were the firstO -GlcNAc-linked oligosaccharides reported in surface glycoproteins. Previously, single O -GlcNAc units linked to Ser and/or Thr have been described on nuclear and cytosolic glycoproteins (13Hart G.W. Kreppel L.K. Comer F.I. Arnold C.S. Snow D.M. Ye Z. Cheng X.

This post-translational modification on the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins is catalyzed by a cytosolicO- GlcNAc-transferase (14Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

The unusual addition of O- GlcNAc to T. cruzi surface glycoproteins prompted us to investigate this post-translational modification in more detail. In this paper, we describe a novel UDP-GlcNAc:polypeptide α-N -acetylglucosaminyltransferase from T. cruzi and specify the optimal conditions for its activity. We have also characterized the in vitro glycosylation products and have established the anomeric configuration of GlcNAc O -linked to Thr. Radioactively labeled UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (40–60 Ci/mmol), UDP-[6-3H]GalNAc (5–15 Ci/mmol), NaB[3H]4 (100–500 mCi/mmol), and [1-3H]glucose (10–30 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.

N -[1-3H]acetylgalactosaminitol ([3H]GalNAcO), Galp β1→4GlcNAcO[3H], and Galp β1→6(Galp β1→4)[3H]GlcNAcO were prepared by reduction of 10 μmol of saccharides with 10 μCi of NaB[3H]4 in water for 1 h at room temperature, followed by addition of 100 μmol of unlabeled NaBH4. Borate salts were removed by repeated addition of methanol and evaporation, passage through a mixed-bed ion exchange resin, and gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-4 (extra fine). The radioactive monosaccharides [6-3H]GlcN and [6-3H]GalN were prepared by hydrolysis of radioactive sugar nucleotides in 3m HCl at 100 °C for 4 h. Unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc, SP Sephadex (SP-C25–120), and β-N -acetylglucosaminidase from jack beans were obtained from Sigma.

Hart, respectively. All other reagents were of the highest available quality. The Y strain of T. cruzi was used in all enzymatic experiments. Native sialoglycoproteins were purified from epimastigotes of the Y, CL-Brener, and Dm28c strains. Epimastigotes were cultured at 28 °C in brain-heart infusion medium supplemented with hemin and 5% of fetal calf serum, and harvested in the exponential phase of growth (15Previato J.O. Gorin P.A.J.

Trypomastigotes were obtained from LLC-MK2 cells infected with tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes for 6 days, maintained at 37 °C in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, under 5% CO2 (8Almeida I.

Pellets of 2 × 1011 epimastigotes or 1.12 × 109cell-derived trypomastigotes were ground in liquid nitrogen. The homogenate was diluted with 10–20 ml of 250 mm sucrose and 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 (Tris/sucrose buffer), and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g . The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 120,000 × g , and the resulting pellet was resuspended in Tris/sucrose buffer with a glass-Teflon homogenizer and ultracentrifuged as above. The pellet was then resuspended in Tris/sucrose buffer and appropriately diluted for protein assay (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

The standard assay contained, in a final volume of 50 μl, 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (40–60 Ci/mmol), and 6.8 nmol of synthetic peptide acceptor substrate (KPPTTTTTTTTKPP). The reaction was initiated by addition of microsomal membranes (250 μg of protein). Control assays without the acceptor peptide were used to correct for endogenous activity. The mixture was incubated at 28 °C for 30 min, and the reaction terminated by addition of 950 μl of 50 mm formic acid. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 1-ml sulfopropyl-Sephadex column (SP-C 25–120) equilibrated in 50 mm formic acid. The column was washed with 5 ml of 50 mm formic acid, and the peptide and labeled glycopeptide were eluted with 4 ml of 0.5 m NaCl. Incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into peptide was determined on aliquots of the eluate by liquid scintillation counting after addition of Bray solution (5 ml). In experiments to increase radiolabel incorporation, the reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2, 15 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, 6.8 nmol of acceptor peptide, and microsomal membranes (1 mg of protein). Other conditions and the method for the isolation of the labeled peptide were as described above. For testing of trypomastigote microsomal fraction, the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2, 1.5 μCi of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, 3.4 nmol of acceptor peptide, and 25 μg (protein) of the microsome preparation. Other conditions were as described above. Incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc was measured at different temperatures (4, 20, 28, and 37 °C), different incubation times (10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min), and in the presence of increasing concentrations of Triton (0.01–0.5%), the peptide substrate (0–34 nmol), and microsomes (100–300 μg of protein). The effect of pH on GlcNAc-transferase activity was assayed in Tris-MES buffer at pH 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 (final concentration in the reaction mixture, 50 mm) under standard incubation conditions. The synthetic peptide YSDSPSTST was used at 450 nmol and at 20 or 28 °C. Incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into synthetic peptide was confirmed by RP-HPLC on a C18 column (5 μm, 4 × 250 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with an H2O/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid gradient. Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was 0.089% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The linear gradient was started 5 min after injection from 0 to 15% solvent B over 40 min (held until 50 min). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 0.8- or 1.0-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots were mixed with 5 ml of Bray solution, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Elution of unlabeled peptide was monitored by absorbance at 206 nm. [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptide fraction obtained by RP-HPLC was rechromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4 (extra fine) (120 cm × 0.5 cm) at 0.6 ml/h with 0.2 m ammonium acetate as the eluent. The column was calibrated using bovine serum albumin and [3H]glucose as marker for the void (v o) and included volumes, respectively. The elution positions of authentic standards of [3H]GlcNAcO, Galp β1→4[3H]GlcNAcO, and Galp β1→6(Galp β1→4)[3H] GlcNAcO were also determined. Fractions of 300 μl were collected and assayed for radioactivity. The labeled peptide fraction was desalted, lyophilized, and dissolved in 10 mm NaOH, containing 0.3m NaBH4, at 37 °C for 48 h to β-eliminate and reduce saccharides linked to threonine (17Yen P.H. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The solution was neutralized with 2 m acetic acid and passed through Dowex 50W-X8 (25–50 mesh H+ form). Boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation with methanol. The residue was dissolved in distilled water and analyzed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-4 column (as described above) and by descending paper chromatography in ethyl acetate:pyridine:water (8:2:1) for 48 h (18Do K.-Y. Do S.-I. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The distribution of radioactivity on the paper chromatogram was determined by cutting the paper strips into 1-cm sections and liquid scintillation counting. In the experiment using a microsome preparation from trypomastigote forms, the [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptide was submitted to acid hydrolysis in 3 m HCl, at 100 °C for 4 h; the HCl evaporated in vacuo , and the radiolabeled product was analyzed by descending paper chromatography in butanol:pyridine:0.1m HCl (5:3:2) for 18 h (19Got R. Cheftel R.-I. Font J. Moretti J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 136: 320-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for jack bean β-N -acetylglucosaminidase digestion contained HPLC-purified [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptide (approximately 5 × 104 cpm), 50 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0, and 0.8 units of enzyme in a final volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h (20Holt G.D. Snow C.M. Senior A. Haltiwanger R.S. Gerace L. Hart G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1157-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 21Hanover J.A. Cohen C.K. Willinghan M.C. Park M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9887-9894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the reaction was terminated by addition of 900 μl of 50 mm formic acid, and the solution was loaded onto a 1-ml SP-Sephadex (25–120) column equilibrated in 50 mm formic acid. Released [3H]GlcNAc was eluted with 50 mm formic acid (5 ml), lyophilized, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting.p- NitrophenylN -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide was used as substrate control. As a further positive control, 100 μmol of the unlabeled synthetic glycopeptide YSPTSPSK, with theO -β-GlcNAc on the serine at position 5 (kindly provided by G. W. Hart) was digested under identical conditions. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 mm formic acid, and the liberated GlcNAc was recovered on SP-Sephadex as above and quantified using the Morgan-Elson reaction (22Dische Z. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1962; 1: 507-512Google Scholar). A standard curve was constructed using d-GlcNAc similarly chromatographed on SP-Sephadex. Sialoglycoproteins from epimastigote forms were purified as described by Previato et al. (4Previato J.O. Andrade A.F.B. Pessolani M.C.V. Mendonça-Previato L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The sialoglycoproteins from T. cruzi CL-Brener strain were subjected to partial acid hydrolysis (0.2 mtrifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 100 °C). The GlcNAc-rich glycopeptides were recovered by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G25 SF (1 × 10 cm). Also, GlcNAc-rich glycopeptides were obtained from Y, CL-Brener, and Dm28c sialoglycoproteins by Smith degradation (23Goldstein I.J. Hay G.W. Lewis B.A. Smith F. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 361-370Google Scholar). Briefly, to 2 ml of a solution containing 30 mg of T. cruzi sialoglycoproteins in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6), an equal volume of 0.2 m NaIO4 was added. After 24 h at 4 °C, oxidation was terminated by addition of glycerol. The oxidized products were recovered by gel filtration on Sephadex G25 SF (1 × 10 cm) column, using water as eluent, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The oxidized glycoproteins were reduced with sodium borohydride for 3 h at room temperature. Boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation with methanol. The material, oxidized and reduced, was partially hydrolyzed with 20 mmtrifluoroacetic acid for 30 min at 100 °C. The resulting GlcNAc-rich glycopeptides were recovered by gel filtration on Sephadex G25 SF as above. NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Unity 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm PFG (pulsed field gradient) triple resonance probe and at indicated probe temperatures of 30 or 40 °C. Standard pulse sequences were used except for the introduction of an echo sequence into the ROESY and TOCSY spectra and WHSQC pulse sequence, which is an implementation of the method of Wider and Wüthrich (24Wider G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 239-241Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mixing time in the TOCSY spectra was 80 and 150 ms in the ROESY spectra. Presaturation of the residual water signal was achieved using a low power pulse from the transmitter. In the WHSQC spectra, obtained at 500 MHz, heteronuclear decoupling was achieved using the GARP sequence. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to internal 3-(trimethylsilyl)tetra-deuteropropionic acid at zero ppm (1H) and −1.8 ppm (13C, to tetramethylsilane at zero) (25Wishart D.

An assay forO -GlcNAc-transferase activity was developed using microsomal membranes prepared from epimastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi . To measure the transfer of GlcNAc in vitro , UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc was used as the GlcNAc donor and the synthetic peptide KPPTTTTTTTTKPP as acceptor. This peptide was chosen due to its similarity with a common motif in the peptide sequence of deglycosylated sialoglycoproteins from the Y strain 2J. O. Previato and L. Mendonça-Previato, unpublished results. and the MUC gene family products from T. cruzi (26DiNoia J.M. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). KPPTTTTTTTTKPP proved to be successful as a substrate for T. cruzi GlcNAc-transferase activity. As shown in Fig. 1, the incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into the peptide was time dependent for a period up to 2 h (Fig. 1 A ) and was proportional to increasing amounts of protein (using a microsomal membrane preparation as the enzyme source) (Fig. 1 B ) and of the peptide acceptor (Fig. 1 C ). The standard assay was performed at 28 °C, although a similar rate was observed at 20 °C. At 37 °C, the activity was slightly less than that observed at 4 °C (Fig. 1 A ). Addition of 5 mm UDP reduced incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into the synthetic peptide by 90%. Transferase activity was not reduced in the presence of tunicamycin or amphomycin, even when added at 10 μg/ml. The transferase was inactive in the absence of metal ions, but activity was regained by adding Mn2+. Table I shows that among seven divalent cations tested, Mn2+ was the most effective in restoring activity. Co2+ and Ca2+were able to restore 20 and 15% of the activity observed in the presence of Mn2+. The O -GlcNAc-transferase activity had a pH optimum between 7.5 and 8.5, with maximum activity at pH 8.5. Activity decreased gradually below pH 7.0 and above pH 8.5, with only 50% of the activity at pH 8.5 present at pH 9.0 (Fig.1 D ).Table IEffect of divalent cations on the activity of T. cruzi O-α-GlcNAc transferaseMetal cation1-aAll metal ions were added as the chloride salt at 5 mm concentration in the conditions used for a standard assay.Transferred to peptidecpmNo added metal cations150Mn2+16,925Co2+3033Ca2+2616Mg2+1308Cu2+308Ni2+308Zn2+1751-a All metal ions were added as the chloride salt at 5 mm concentration in the conditions used for a standard assay. Open table in a new tab The radiolabeled material recovered from the SP-Sephadex column was characterized by several techniques. A single peak of radioactivity was obtained after reversed phase HPLC on a C18 column with an elution volume distinct from that of the unlabeled peptide acceptor substrate (Fig. 2 A ). Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography of this radiolabeled material indicated that its apparent molecular mass was greater than that of the unlabeled peptide acceptor (Fig. 2 B ). After base-catalyzed β-elimination and reduction of the purified radiolabeled glycopeptide, radioactive material eluted at the same volume as authenticN -acetylhexosaminitol on the P-4 column (Fig.2 C ), and its identity was confirmed as [3H]GlcNAcO by descending paper chromatography (Fig.2 D ). In assays using larger amounts of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, two radiolabeled fractions were observed in RP-HPLC (Fig. 3 A) and on the P-4 column (Fig. 3 B ). One fraction showed a chromatographic profile identical with that of the glycopeptide obtained under standard conditions (Fig. 2, A andB ). The other fraction was assumed to be a glycopeptide substituted with more than one GlcNAc residue (Fig. 3,A and B ), as both fractions liberated [3H]GlcNAcO (identified by descending paper chromatography) on reductive β-elimination (Fig. 3 C ).Figure 3Product characterization of two glycosylation sites into the peptide KPPTTTTTTTTKPP.

Other experimental details are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether cell-derived trypomastigotes of T. cruzi also express the O -GlcNAc-transferase activity, a microsomal preparation from 109 trypomastigotes was tested. This fraction catalyzed the synthesis of SP-Sephadex-retained radioactive material, which coeluted with the “epimastigote” glycopeptide in RP-HPLC (Fig.4 A ). After acid hydrolysis, the radioactive product was identified as [3H]GlcN by descending paper chromatography (Fig. 4 B ). The anomeric configuration of the GlcNAc-Thr linkage was determined by enzymatic and NMR experiments. Treatment of the HPLC-purified [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptide with β-N -acetylglucosaminidase from jack beans failed to release [3H]GlcNAc from the glycopeptide, indicating that GlcNAc is not β-linked to Thr. A glycopeptide YSPTSPSK with theO -β-GlcNAc on the Ser at position 5 was used as a positive control and liberated between 50 and 55% GlcNAc when digested under identical conditions. The anomeric configuration of the GlcNAc O -linked to Thr in glycopeptide prepared from the purified mucin by dilute acid hydrolysis (CL-Brener strain) or Smith degradation (Y, CL-Brener, and Dm28c strains) was determined by high field NMR spectroscopy. The spectra from all these samples were effectively identical. Fig.5 shows expansions of the TOCSY (Fig.5 A ) and ROESY (Fig. 5 B ) of the GlcNAc-rich glycopeptide from Y strain. The resonances between 4.4 and 5.4 ppm (Fig. 5 A ) were assigned to saccharide anomeric protons. The most intense of these originate from the O -linked glycans. Those between 4.44 and 4.53 ppm displayed a pattern of cross-peaks in the TOCSY spectrum typical of β-Galp spin systems, (3JH3,H4 small and H-4 at low field) (9Previato J.O. Jones C. Gonçalves L.P.B. Wait R. Travassos L.R. Mendonça-Previato L. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The anomeric protons from the GlcNAc O -linked to Thr resonated between 4.75 and 4.95 ppm, with the most intense at 4.75 ppm. This chemical shift dispersity is presumably attributable to heterogeneous substitution by GlcNAc on the peptide backbone and to the presence of galactosylation of some GlcNAc residues. Because glycopeptide from strain Dm28c was available in greatest quantity, WHSQC spectra with and without heteronuclear decoupling were recorded from this material (Fig. 6), which enabled partial assignment of the 13C spectrum and determination of the value of one bond proton carbon-coupling constants (1JC1,H1). N -Acetyl amino sugars are easily recognized by the high field positions of the C-2 resonance in their 13C spectra, which are observed at approximately 51.4 and 56.1 ppm for the methyl glycosides of GlcNAc and GalNAc, respectively (27Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-66Crossref Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). In the WHSQC spectrum of the GlcNAc-rich glycopeptide from Dm28c, the resonance at 54.6 ppm was assigned as C-2 of GlcNAc and was correlated to an H-2 resonance at 3.85 ppm, which in turn was correlated to anomeric proton resonances between 4.75 and 4.95 ppm in the TOCSY (Fig. 5 A ) and COSY spectra, which were thus unambiguously assigned as H-1 of GlcNAc. The corresponding anomeric carbons resonated between 99.5 and 99.9 ppm (from the same WHSQC spectrum) (Fig. 6, A and B ). In the ROESY spectrum (Fig. 5 B ), NOEs were observed from the most intense GlcNAc H-1 resonance at 4.75 ppm and theN -acetyl methyl resonances to Hβ and methyl resonances of Thr, indicating linkage of the GlcNAc to Thr in the peptide backbone. Some minor resonances, not attributable to the O -linked glycans, were also present. One set had chemical shifts for the H-1, C-1, and other structural reporter groups consistent with those reported for high mannose chains (28Lu J. Van Halbeek H. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 296: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Kamerling J.P. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-373Crossref Scopus (797) Google Scholar), although only a Man2(GlcNAc)2 stub was present in the Smith-degraded samples (Fig. 5 A ). The anomeric configuration of the GlcNAc residue was assigned from the values of the 3JH1,H2 and1JH1,C1 coupling constants, the pattern of intra-residue NOEs, and the proton and the carbon shifts of the GlcNAc residues. The value of 3JH1,H2 in the GlcNAc residue was estimated as 3–4 Hz from resolved cross-peaks observed in the ROESY spectrum (Fig. 7 C ). This is consistent with the α-configuration (H-1 and H-2gauche ) (30Dabrowski J. Croasmun W.R. Carlson R.M.K. Two Dimensional NMR Spectroscopy Applications for Chemistry and Biochemistry. VCH, New York1994Google Scholar), as a value of 8 Hz would be expected for GlcNAcβ1→O Thr (in which H-1 and H-2 have atrans diaxial orientation), as was observed for the GlcNAcβ→Asn present in the stub of the high mannose oligosaccharide chain (Fig. 7 A ). The value of1JH1,C1 for the GlcNAc1→O Thr was determined from the WHSQC spectrum, obtained at 600 MH"

The β1 integrin subunit is widely expressed in vivo and is represented by four alternatively spliced cytoplasmic domain isoforms. β1D is a muscle-specific variant of β1 integrin and a predominant β1 isoform in striated muscles. In the present study we showed that expression of the exogenous β1D integrin in C2C12 myoblasts and NIH 3T3 or REF 52 fibroblasts inhibited cell proliferation. Unlike the case of the common β1A isoform, adhesion of β1D-transfected C2C12 myoblasts specifically via the expressed integrin did not activate mitogen-activated protein kinases. The β1D-induced growth inhibitory signal was shown to occur late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, before the G1-S transition.

However, an interleukin-2 receptor-β1D chimera containing the cytoplasmic domain of β1D still efficiently inhibited cell growth, showing that the ectodomain and the ligand-binding site in β1D were not required for the growth inhibitory signal. Together, our data showed a new specific function for the alternatively spliced β1D integrin isoform. Since the onset of β1D expression during myodifferentiation coincides with the timing of myoblast withdrawal from the cell cycle, the growth inhibitory properties of β1D demonstrated in this study might reflect the major function for this integrin in commitment of differentiating skeletal muscle cells in vivo .

These opposite responses are possible due to redundant and overlapping expression of integrins and are mediated by ligation of different integrin αβ heterodimers on the cell surface (1Hynes R.O.

This allows various integrin αβ heterodimers to transduce distinct signals from the ECM to the cell interior, including positive and negative growth signals in response to adhesion. β1 integrin, the most ubiquitous β subunit, pairs with at least 10 different α subunits to comprise receptors for a wide variety of ECM proteins.

Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The other two minor β1 integrin variants with the alternatively spliced cytoplasmic domains, β1B and β1C, were identified several years ago (18Altruda F. Cervella P. Tarone G. Botta C. Balzac F.

Unlike β1D integrin, these two isoforms are always coexpressed at low levels with the major β1A isoform (18Altruda F. Cervella P. Tarone G. Botta C. Balzac F. Stefanuto G. Silengo L. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Balzac F. Belkin A.M. Koteliansky V.E. Balabanov Y.V. Altruda F. Silengo L. Tarone G. J.

Recently, the β1C isoform has been shown to inhibit strongly cell growth upon transient expression in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (23Meredith Jr., J. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L.R. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A short amino acid sequence Gln795-Gln802 within the cytoplasmic domain is essential for β1C-mediated growth arrest and is apparently unique for this integrin (24Fornaro M. Zheng D.-Q. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24666-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Striated muscle myoblasts become irreversibly withdrawn from the cell cycle early in myodifferentiation before cell fusion occurs. The timing of cell cycle withdrawal (commitment to myodifferentiation) coincides with the appearance of muscle-specific β1D integrin in myocyte cultures and is in accordance with its increased expression in postmitotic growth-arrested myoblasts (16Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that β1D might transmit a growth inhibitory signal in normal myoblasts in vivo . Here we demonstrate an inhibition of cell proliferation by β1D integrin when it is expressed transiently in normal myoblasts and fibroblasts. Thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and mouse anti-BrdUrd mAb were from Sigma. Mouse mAb TS2/16 against human β1 integrin was provided by Dr. Martin Hemler (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) and used to detect the injected or transfected β1A and β1D integrins. Hamster anti-mouse β1 mAb HMβ1-1 for visualization of the endogenous β1 integrin was received from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-MAP kinase rabbit polyclonal antibody sc-93 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and was used for MAP kinase immunoprecipitation. Antibody against active (dually phosphorylated) MAP kinases was from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies reacting with mouse cyclins A and E were obtained from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Mouse mAb 7G7B6 against interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) extracellular domain was from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Hamster mAbs reacting with mouse α1, α2, and α5 integrins were obtained from PharMingen. Antibody against α3 integrin cytoplasmic domain was kindly provided by Dr. Guido Tarone (University of Torino, Italy). Isoform-specific anti-β1A and anti-β1D antibodies were characterized previously (16Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J.

The cells were selected for 10 days by which time all the cells in a control mock-transfected dish were dead. NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Ha-(12R)Ras or (Δ22W)Raf-1 displayed very similar highly transformed phenotype as detected by cell morphology, inhibited spreading, colony formation in soft agar, and profound cytoskeletal changes (26Oldham S.M.

Rat embryo fibroblast line REF 52 was described previously (29Burridge K. Turner C. Romer L.H. J.

The cDNAs for human β1A and β1D cytoplasmic domain isoforms in pECE vector were described previously (16Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E.

The sequences of the four mutant β1A/β1D integrin cDNAs were verified by dideoxy termination sequencing. IL2R (interleukin 2 receptor) cDNA and IL2R-β1A chimera (30LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.E. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Susan LaFlamme (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY). IL2R-β1D chimera was generated using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 3′ end of the β1D cDNA (16Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J.

The polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with Hin dIII endonuclease, and the resulting fragment encoding the β1D cytoplasmic domain was inserted in the Hin dIII site of the IL2R-β1A plasmid (30LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.E. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) to generate a plasmid encoding the IL2R-β1D chimera. The structure of the IL2R-β1D construct was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis using a primer upstream of the cloning site (5′-AGCGTCCTCCTCCTGAGTG-3′). For nuclear microinjections the β1A and β1D integrin cDNAs were used at 0.5 mg/ml to inject C2C12 myoblasts, REF 52 fibroblasts, or NIH 3T3 cells growing on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (23Meredith Jr., J. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L.R. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Transfection of C2C12 myoblasts, REF 52 fibroblasts, and NIH 3T3 cells, either wild-type or expressing Ha-(12R)Ras or (Δ22W)Raf-1, was performed using SuperfectTM Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Cells at 40–60% confluency were incubated with the transfection complexes in regular serum-containing growth medium for 3–5 h. 5 μg of DNA and 30 μl of SuperfectTM was used for 60-mm dishes and 12 μg of DNA and 75 μl of SuperfectTM for 100-mm dishes. Four independent transient transfections were performed for each set of experiments. As judged by immunofluorescence with TS2/16 mAb, 28 ± 9% C2C12 myoblasts, 19 ± 6% REF fibroblasts, and 31 ± 14% NIH 3T3 cells (either wild-type or transfected with activated Ha-Ras or Raf-1) expressed the exogenous human β1A or β1D integrins 24 h after transfection. The expression levels of the transfected human β1A and β1D integrins were determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with TS2/16 mAb which reacts identically with these two β1 cytoplasmic domain variants (16Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Belkin A.M. Retta S.F.

The transfectants were incubated with 10 μg/ml of TS2/16 mAb for 1 h at 4 °C followed by fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. After the staining, cells were analyzed in a FACScan® flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The cell proliferation assay based on BrdUrd incorporation into the nuclei was described earlier (23Meredith Jr., J. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L.R. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with β1A, β1D cDNAs, β1A/β1D chimeras, or IL2R-β1A and IL2R-β1D constructs were trypsinized on the day after transfection and were plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The next day, the growth medium was replaced for DMEM with 0.5% FBS and cells were kept in low serum for 24 h. After that, cells were switched to the medium containing 10% FBS and 50 μm BrdUrd. 24 h later, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Before the immunostaining, cells were incubated first with DNase (0.1 units/μl, Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C. To determine which phase of the cell cycle is affected by β1D integrin, NIH 3T3 cells on coverslips were starved in DMEM with 0.5% FBS for 2 days and then injected with β1A or β1D cDNA 0, 4, 8, 12, or 16 h after the addition of DMEM with 10% FBS. At least 250 cells were injected with each cDNA. More than 70% of the injected cells expressed the exogenous β1A or β1D proteins. In preliminary experiments, maximal protein expression was achieved 1–1.5 h after cDNA injection. 50 μm BrdUrd was added 18 h after the switch to 10% FBS, and the cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 6 h more. After BrdUrd treatment, cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized as described above. To visualize simultaneously the transfected (injected) β1integrins and nuclear incorporation of BrdUrd, fixed, permeabilized, and DNase-treated cells were coincubated with mAb TS2/16 against human β1 integrins and anti-BrdUrd mAb (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C. Rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used as secondary antibody to visualize the expressed β1 integrins at focal adhesions and accumulation of BrdUrd in the nuclei. Coverslips were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Micrographs were taken on T-max 400 film. 200 untransfected cells or cells expressing β1A, β1D, or β1A/β1D chimeras were counted and the nuclear staining for BrdUrd assessed. BrdUrd-labeled C2C12 cells expressing IL2R-β1A and IL2R-β1D chimeric receptors were detected with mAb 7G7B6 against the extracellular domain of IL2 receptor (30LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.E. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) in combination with anti-BrdUrd mAb. 120 cells expressing IL2R construct, IL2R-β1A, or IL2R-β1D chimera were scored for the nuclear BrdUrd staining. To detect nuclear localization of cyclins A and E in β1A- and β1D-transfected NIH 3T3 cells, they were initially treated as described above (see “Cell Proliferation Assay”). The cells were double-stained with mouse mAb TS2/16 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cyclins A and E, followed by a mixture of rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon). 120 β1A- and β1D-expressing NIH 3T3 cells were counted for both cyclin E and cyclin A expression. In some experiments, intracellular localization of the endogenous β1A integrin was examined in NIH 3T3 cells expressing human β1D. In this case cells were incubated first with a mixture of mouse mAb TS2/16 against human β1 integrin, mouse mAb against BrdUrd, and hamster mAb HMβ1-1 specific for mouse β1 integrin (PharMingen). This was followed by coincubation with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein-labeled donkey anti-hamster IgG (Chemicon). Activation of MAP kinases in β1A- and β1D-transfected C2C12 cells was studied as reported earlier (6Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells transfected with human β1A and β1D cDNAs were trypsinized on the day after transfection. The remaining trypsin was inhibited with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and cells were washed several times in serum-free medium. Cells in DMEM, containing 2% bovine serum albumin, were plated on bacterial Petri dishes, precoated with purified TS2/16 mAb against the transfected β1 integrins, for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound cells were washed out, and the adherent cells expressing human β1A or β1D integrins were lysed either in 1% SDS or in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm p -nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 nm calyculin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration in the samples was determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent. Samples in 1% SDS (25 μg each) were used directly for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblotting with polyclonal antibody against activated (dually phosphorylated) MAP kinases (Promega). 0.5 mg of cell lysates in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate buffer were used for immunoprecipitation withsc-93 anti-MAP kinase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immune kinase reaction with [γ-32P]ATP and the exogenous substrate myelin basic protein (MBP). Phosphorylated MBP bands were analyzed by SDS electrophoresis and autoradiography (6Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Cultured NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (wild-type or expressing exogenous Ha-(12R)Ras) were metabolically labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in methionine- and cysteine-free medium for 12 h at 37 °C. After the labeling, cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 3 min with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). α1, α2, α3, α5, and the endogenous mouse β1 integrins were immunoprecipitated using the specific antibodies against these subunits. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. Cultured Ha-(12R)Ras-NIH 3T3 cells expressing human either β1A or β1D integrins were lysed in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against the endogenous mouse α subunits or TS2/16 mAb against the transfected human β1 integrins. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed and boiled in SDS sample buffer. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, β1A and β1D isoforms were detected in the immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with the isoform-specific antibodies (16Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I.

In our preliminary experiments we were not able to obtain stable expression of β1D in normal myoblasts, including mouse C2C12 cells or normal fibroblasts, such as REF 52 or NIH 3T3 cell lines, suggesting that this integrin might directly affect cell growth. To examine this possibility, we first microinjected either β1A or β1D cDNAs into the nuclei of these cells. The injected cells were serum-starved, then treated for 24 h with BrdUrd in serum-containing medium, and finally stained for both human β1 integrin and BrdUrd incorporation (Fig.1). No nuclear staining was seen in β1A- and β1D-injected cells with anti-β1 integrin TS2/16 mAb alone (not shown). Whereas the majority of untransfected and β1A-transfected cells displayed bright nuclear staining with anti-BrdUrd mAb (Fig. 1,A and C , arrows ), most β1D-transfected C2C12, REF 52, and NIH 3T3 cells did not incorporate BrdUrd into the nuclei (Fig. 1, B , D , and E , arrowheads ). This indicated that β1D caused growth arrest in these cell types. In the injected cells, β1D colocalized with the endogenous β1A integrin at focal adhesions but did not cause a displacement or relocalization of β1A from these sites (Fig. 1, E and F ). Therefore, we concluded that the observed inhibition of cell proliferation in β1D-transfected cells was caused by the expression of β1D integrin rather than the lack of the common β1A isoform at cell-matrix contacts. Transient transfection of β1A and β1D cDNAs in C2C12, REF 52, and NIH 3T3 cells resulted in similar expression levels of these integrins on the cell surface as determined by flow cytometry with TS2/16 mAb (TableI).

https://openalex.org/W2067124950,"The α isoform of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) is a transcription factor that regulates expression of genes linked to adipose differentiation and hepatic nutrient metabolism. Recently, our laboratory has characterized a role for C/EBPα in mediating hormonal responsiveness. For example, the cAMP responsiveness of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene promoter in liver requires synergism among the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), C/EBPα, and activator protein-1. In the present study, we show that C/EBPα can functionally substitute for CREB in this cAMP response unit, i.e. cAMP responsiveness can occur in the absence of CREB. This observation is physiologically relevant since both CREB and C/EBPα have been shown to bind with high affinity to the cAMP response element in this particular promoter. Structure/function analysis of C/EBPα identified specific mutations that differentially affected its constitutive and protein kinase A-inducible activities. This finding suggests that the mechanism whereby C/EBPα mediates constitutive transactivation is distinct from that whereby it mediates cAMP responsiveness. These data support the hypothesis that C/EBPα plays a critical role in metabolism, in part by participating in the hormonal regulation of expression of metabolically important genes.

A number of studies indicate that C/EBPα is necessary and sufficient to induce adipocyte differentiation (4Umek R. Friedman A. McKnight S.L.

Antisense inhibition of C/EBPα expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was shown to prevent accumulation of triacylglycerol (7Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and adipocytes from C/EBPα knockout mice are devoid of lipid (11Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Besides this important role in adipose differentiation and lipid metabolism, C/EBPα also appears to be a critical player in hepatic nutrient metabolism. It transactivates genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (12Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), serum albumin (13Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and alcohol dehydrogenase (14van Ooij C. Snyder R.C. Paeper B.W. Duester G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and C/EBPα knockout mice display reduced expression of glycogen synthase and low levels of liver glycogen as well as delayed expression of PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase genes (11Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mice die shortly after birth from hypoglycemia and other complications.Most of the studies performed to date characterize C/EBPα as a constitutive transactivator (15Pei D. Shih C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Structure/function analyses of C/EBPα have demonstrated that the amino-terminal region contains motifs that allow for protein-protein interactions with TATA-binding protein and TFIIB, with mutational analysis indicating that these interactions are important for the constitutive activity of C/EBPα (18Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, in studies examining the regulatory properties of the PEPCK promoter, our laboratory uncovered a role for C/EBPα in mediating hormonal responsiveness via mechanisms that appear to be distinct from those utilized to confer constitutive transactivation. The PEPCK gene, which is expressed at the highest levels in liver and kidney, is transcriptionally responsive to cAMP, but shows tissue-specific response patterns; in liver, the gene is robustly activated by cAMP, whereas in kidney, the response is weak (19Meisner H. Loose D.S. Hanson R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The explanation for this difference appears to reside in the presence of C/EBP-binding sites in the PEPCK promoter. The cAMP response unit in this promoter, which is functional only in liver-derived cells, consists of a typical cAMP response element (CRE), an AP-1-binding site, and three C/EBP-binding sites (20Roesler W.J. Simard J. Graham J.G. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14276-14283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All five of thesecis -elements are required for maximal responsiveness to cAMP. We have shown that the α isoform, but not the β isoform, of C/EBP functions in this cAMP response unit (21Roesler W.J. Crosson S.M. Vinson C. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8068-8074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Another critical player in this cAMP response unit is the CRE-binding protein (CREB), which participates through its binding to the CRE (22Roesler W.J. Graham J.G. Kolen R. Klemm D.J. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8225-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the CRE in the PEPCK promoter is rather unique in that it also binds C/EBP proteins with high affinity (23Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Roesler W.J. McFie P.J. Puttick D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that C/EBPα can substitute for CREB in the cAMP response unit,i.e. that cAMP responsiveness can occur in the absence of CREB.DISCUSSIONWhile the PEPCK promoter is regulated by a number of hormones (reviewed in Ref. 34Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar), the induction by cAMP has been intensively investigated due to the strong and rapid nature of the response and its tissue-specific characteristics (19Meisner H. Loose D.S. Hanson R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Lamers W.H. Hanson R.W. Meisner H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5137-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The CRE in this promoter was the first of its kind to be identified (26Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9721-9726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and from it arose the discovery that many promoters contain this cis -element (36Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A transcription factor that bound to the CRE, termed CREB, was subsequently identified, and it contains a serine residue that is phosphorylated by PKA, resulting in its activation (37Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). This initial simplified model of how cAMP responsiveness occurs has become significantly more complex with the discovery of a coactivator for CREB (38Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar) and the finding that CREB is but one member of a large protein family (reviewed in Ref. 39de Groot R.P. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the PEPCK promoter, an additional layer of potential complexity was uncovered when it was shown that members of the C/EBP protein family can also bind to this CRE with high affinity (12Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E. Hakimi P. Cao Z. Moorman A. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although their affinity for perfect consensus CREs in other promoters is relatively weak (24Roesler W.J. McFie P.J. Puttick D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3791-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Not only can C/EBP bind to the CRE in the PEPCK promoter, but it also produces transactivation, thereby creating a controversy as to whether CREB or a C/EBP protein is the physiologically relevant transcription factor at this site.Several previous studies addressing this issue have produced conflicting data. For example, in support of a role for CREB at this site, our laboratory showed that (i) mutation of the CRE to a perfect consensus sequence, which resulted in a significant decrease in C/EBP binding affinity but had no effect on CREB binding affinity (24Roesler W.J. McFie P.J. Puttick D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3791-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not alter the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK promoter; and (ii) a Gal4-CREB fusion protein, when tethered to the PEPCK promoter by replacement of the CRE with a Gal4-binding site, was able to reconstitute the cAMP responsiveness of the promoter (22Roesler W.J. Graham J.G. Kolen R. Klemm D.J. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8225-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Conversely, in support of a role for a C/EBP protein, it was shown that (i) mutation of the CRE to a C/EBP-binding site, which reduced CREB binding affinity without affecting C/EBP binding affinity, did not reduce the cAMP responsiveness of the promoter (23Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (ii) mice that contain a targeted inactivation of the CREB gene have no detectable alterations in PEPCK gene expression or any apparent abnormalities in glucose homeostasis (40Nitsch D. Boschart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present data that suggest that the binding of either CREB or C/EBPα to the CRE allows the promoter to retain its cAMP responsiveness (Fig. 2 B ), i.e. that C/EBPα can functionally substitute for CREB, which provides an explanation for the apparent contradictory data summarized above. The fact that C/EBPβ can also bind to this CRE, but with a detrimental effect on cAMP responsiveness (Fig. 2 B ), suggests that the prevailing responsiveness of this promoter to cAMP can be exquisitely regulated depending on the in vivo concentrations of CREB, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ. An additional level of regulation has been suggested by the observations that both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ can have their DNA-binding activity modulated by phosphorylation of specific serine residues lying within the basic region leucine zipper domain (41Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.-C. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19396-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).We also presented experimental data to support the hypothesis that C/EBPα may function independently as a modest cAMP-inducible regulator. One criticism of these data could be that we demonstrated cAMP-inducible activity for C/EBPα only on promoters containing multiple binding sites for either the intact protein or the Gal4 fusion counterpart. Indeed, we were able to detect only a residual amount of PKA responsiveness when a single C/EBP site was linked to a minimal promoter.2 However, it should be noted that similar observations have been made with promoters containing a single CREB molecule tethered to the promoter. Our laboratory has previously shown that the PEPCK promoter CRE, when tested independently, is essentially devoid of PKA-inducible activity, as is a single molecule of a Gal4-CREB molecule when recruited to a promoter (22Roesler W.J. Graham J.G. Kolen R. Klemm D.J. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8225-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Roesler W.J. McFie P.J. Puttick D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3791-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, it takes the multimerization of three CRE cis -elements before detectable activity of the CRE manifests itself (24Roesler W.J. McFie P.J. Puttick D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3791-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reviewed recently (43Roesler W.J. Park E.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 178: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it is in fact a common observation that cAMP responsiveness (and responses to other hormones) is often mediated by the synergistic interactions of several cis -elements within a promoter, even those that contain typical CREs. Employing several different cis -elements in the hormonal responsiveness of a promoter may offer unique regulatory opportunities, including an expansion of the range of responses and the coordination of information from several signaling pathways into an integrated transcriptional response.If C/EBPα is a cAMP-activated nuclear regulator, what is the molecular mechanism whereby it mediates this activity? While we do not have an answer to this question at present, it is known that C/EBPα is not phosphorylated by PKA to any significant extent (41Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.-C. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19396-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that some as yet unidentified coactivator for C/EBPα, which itself can be phosphorylated and activated by PKA, allows C/EBPα to display this hormone-inducible activity. Recently, the CREB-binding protein (CBP), which is a coactivator for CREB (38Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), was implicated as a possible coactivator for C/EBPα (44Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although no direct protein-protein interaction between CBP and C/EBPα has been reported. Interestingly, the transactivation potential of CBP can apparently be induced by PKA (38Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Thus, CBP may fit the role of this putative C/EBPα coactivator that mediates the PKA-inducible activity. Arguing against this hypothesis, however, is that C/EBPβ, which does not function as a cAMP-inducible transcription factor (see Figs. 1,2 B , and 4 (B and C ) and Table I), also appears to utilize CBP as a coactivator (38Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). How CBP could confer PKA inducibility to one isoform and not the other is not readily obvious, although one could speculate that the nature of the protein-protein interaction could differ, in one case allowing the expression of the inducible activity and in the other instance masking it. Answers to these questions should be forthcoming as the coactivator role of CBP for these two C/EBP isoforms is solidified and the molecular nature of the protein-protein interactions is characterized.Any model developed to define the mechanism whereby C/EBPα is able to mediate cAMP responsiveness must incorporate the observation that the constitutive and PKA-inducible transcriptional activities of this factor appear to be exerted via at least partially independent mechanisms. The first evidence for this came from experiments where we observed that Gα2, when expressed in the choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cell line (i.e. non-hepatoma cells), exhibited PKA-inducible activity, but little if any constitutive activity (21Roesler W.J. Crosson S.M. Vinson C. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8068-8074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have presented additional data in support of this hypothesis by showing that the C/EBPα mutant Y67A,F77A,L78A remained fully competent as a cAMP-dependent transactivator even though its constitutive transcriptional activity was significantly inhibited (Table II). Deletion analysis (Fig. 5) also provided some indication of the distinct nature of the constitutive and inducible activities of this factor. While our analysis cannot identify a precise “domain” that confers the inducible activity, our data do allow us to conclude that this activity is fully contained within amino acids 6–124 since N124 remains fully functional with respect to this activity. Since N96 lost all inducible activity, it was interesting to speculate that region 96–124 was the PKA-inducible domain. However, our attempts to analyze this region in isolation were unsuccessful since the presence of amino acids 6–50 was absolutely required to detect any activity of the Gal4 fusion proteins. We also recognize that the lack of activity of N96 does not necessarily indicate the lack of involvement of any of the remaining amino acids in the PKA-inducible activity since the loss of activity could be due solely to alterations in tertiary structure as a result of the deletion. Another conclusion that we can make is that the sole conserved transactivation motif among C/EBP family members, which lies between amino acids 55 and 86 (18Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), is likely not involved in the PKA-inducible activity of C/EBPα. The triple mutant that we tested contained mutations in three conserved amino acids found in all C/EBP isoforms, and the amino acids at positions 77 and 78 are part of the homology box 2 core (18Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nerlov and Ziff (18Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) demonstrated that these residues are involved in the constitutive activity of C/EBPα, apparently exerting their effects by participating in protein-protein interactions with the TATA-binding protein and TFIIB. Since C/EBPβ also contains these conserved amino acids but does not act as a cAMP-inducible factor, one would predict that this conserved motif, which is found in all C/EBP isoforms, does not participate in the cAMP-inducible activity of C/EBPα. Indeed, our data support this hypothesis, allowing us to conclude that cAMP-inducible activity is not mediated via interactions with the TATA-binding protein or TFIIB, but via interactions with an associated coactivator and/or another target within the preinitiation complex.There is ample evidence to indicate that C/EBPα has several important biological roles, beyond being simply a constitutive transactivator. As evidenced in this paper, C/EBPα can function as an effector molecule in the cAMP signaling pathway, leading to the alteration of expression of target genes. Additionally, we have recently shown that C/EBPα can participate in mediating triiodothyronine responsiveness (45Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Given its tissue-limited expression pattern (3Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschultz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), it also contributes to the tissue-specific pattern of gene expression and tissue differentiation, particularly adipose. Since the expression of C/EBPα is temporally regulated, with no accumulation occurring until just prior to birth (3Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschultz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), it also appears to function as a developmental transcription factor. Its involvement in the activation of the PEPCK gene at parturition (46Croniger C. Trus M. Lysek-Stupp K. Cohen H. Liu Y. Darlington G.J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26306-26312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) plays a particularly critical role in providing the newborn with the capacity for glucose synthesis, as this gene codes for the enzyme generally thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway. Many of these important biological roles were highlighted by examination of mice that contained a targeted deletion of the C/EBPα gene or of adult mice with the gene conditionally disrupted. The knockout mice died within hours after birth of hypoglycemia; displayed no ability to store liver glycogen or adipocyte lipid; and had reduced expression of genes for glycogen synthase, PEPCK, glucose-6-phosphatase, and uncoupling protein of brown adipose tissue (11Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Similar alterations in gene expression were observed in the conditional knockout mice (47Lee Y.-H. Sauer B. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings of the present paper emphasize an additional role of this transcription factor, that of a hormone-responsive activator, and provide further evidence of the important role it plays as a central regulator of energy homeostasis (48McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins are a family of transcription factors that all possess a nearly identical basic region leucine zipper DNA-binding motif, but differ significantly in their amino-terminal transactivation domain (1Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 2Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F.

Besides this important role in adipose differentiation and lipid metabolism, C/EBPα also appears to be a critical player in hepatic nutrient metabolism. It transactivates genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (12Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2042917117,"A 45-kDa serpin secreted by a murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line, colon26, was isolated, purified, and characterized. It was found to bind specifically to type I collagen with high affinity and to type III collagen with lower affinity. Immunohistochemical studies of murine embryonic tissues showed a specific distribution of this collagen-associated serpin, named caspin, in relation to the formation of bone, cartilage, teeth, and basement membrane. The expression of caspin in high and low lung metastatic subclones of colon26 cell lines was inversely correlated with their metastatic capacity: low lung metastatic cells secreted higher amounts of caspin than their high lung metastatic counterparts. Caspin also demonstrated high homology with human pigment epithelium-derived factor/early population doubling level cDNA-1, which reportedly induces neuronal differentiation of human retinoblastoma cells and is expressed in association with G0 growth arrest. These findings suggest that caspin/pigment epithelium-derived factor/early population doubling level cDNA-1 is a novel factor that might play a crucial role in embryogenesis and tumor metastasis through binding to the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2076397950,"The αM subunit of integrin Mac-1 contains several distinct regions in its extracellular segment. The N-terminal region has been predicted to fold into a β-propeller domain composed of seven β-sheets each about 60 amino acid residues long, with the I-domain inserted between β-sheets 2 and 3. The structure of the C-terminal region is unknown. We have used monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as probes to study the dependence of the structure of different regions of the αM subunit on association with the β2 subunit in the αM/β2 heterodimer. All of the mAbs to the I-domain immunoprecipitated the unassociated αM precursor and reacted with the αM subunit expressed alone on the surface of COS cells. By contrast, four mAbs to the β-propeller domain did not react with the unassociated αM precursor nor with the uncomplexed αM subunit expressed on COS cell surface. The four mAbs were mapped to three subregions in three different β-sheets, making it unlikely that each recognized an interface between the α and β subunits. These results suggest that folding of different β-propeller subregions is coordinate and is dependent on association with the β2 subunit. The segment C-terminal to the β-propeller domain, residues 599–1092, was studied with nine mAbs. A subset of four mAbs that reacted with the αM/β2 complex but not with the unassociated αM subunit were mapped to one subregion, residues 718–759, and five other mAbs that recognized both the unassociated and the complexed αM subunit were localized to three other subregions, residues 599–679, 820–882, and 943–1047. This suggests that much of the region C-terminal to the β-propeller domain folds independently of association with the β2 subunit.

Our data provide new insights into how different domains in the integrin α and β subunits may interact. The integrin family of adhesion molecules participate in important cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions in a diverse range of biological processes (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Integrins are noncovalently associated α/β heterodimers, with each subunit consisting of a large extracellular domain (>100 kDa for α subunits and >75 kDa for β subunits), a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail (50 amino acids or less, except for the β4 subunit) (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). The adhesiveness of integrins is dynamically regulated in response to cytoplasmic signals, termed “inside-out” signaling (2Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin.

The leukocyte integrin subfamily consists of four members that share the common β2 subunit (CD18) but have distinct α subunits, αL (CD11a), αM (CD11b), αX (CD11c), and αd for LFA-1, Mac-1, p150, 95, and αd/β2, respectively (5Springer T.A.

The leukocyte integrins mediate a range of adhesive interactions that are essential for normal immune and inflammatory responses (5Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (5852) Google Scholar). Although the overall structure of integrins is unknown, several structurally distinct domains in the extracellular portions of both α and β subunits have been predicted or identified. The N-terminal region of the integrin α subunits contains seven repeats of about 60 amino acids each (8Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Connor K. Larson R.S. Springer T.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and has recently been predicted to fold into a β-propeller domain that consists of seven β-sheets, with each β-sheet containing four anti-parallel β-strands (9Springer T.A.

The three-dimensional structure of the I-domain from the Mac-1, LFA-1, and α2β1 integrins has been solved and shows that it adopts the dinucleotide-binding fold with a unique divalent cation coordination site designated the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (14Lee J.-O.

The integrin β subunits contain a conserved domain of about 250 amino acids in the N-terminal portion. This domain has been predicted to have an “I-domain-like” fold (14Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 18Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Electron microscopic images of integrins reveal that the N-terminal portions of the α and β subunits fold into a globular head that is connected to the membrane by two rod-like segments about 16 nm long corresponding to the C-terminal portions of the α and β extracellular domains (20Nermut M.V.

Previous studies using mAbs 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; hu, human; mo, mouse. as probes have shown that the structure of specific domains in LFA-1 requires association of the αL and β2 subunits. mAbs to the β2 subunit conserved domain do not react with the unassociated β2 subunit, whereas mAbs to the regions preceding and following this domain do, indicating that the structure of the conserved domain is dependent on association with the αL subunit (23Huang C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). mAbs to the I-domain react with the unassociated αL subunit (24Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This finding together with the fact that the I-domain can be expressed as an isolated domain (14Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

By contrast, two mAbs (S6F1 and TS2/4) mapped to the N-terminal region of the β-propeller domain, and one mAb (G-25.2) that maps to a region of 212 amino acids with 159 amino acids located in the β-propeller domain and the remainder in the C-terminal region, do not recognize the αL subunit in the absence of association with the β2 subunit (24Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another mAb (CBRLFA-1/1) that maps to a region overlapping the I-domain and β-propeller domain reacts weakly with the uncomplexed αL subunit. These results indicate that at least one region in the β-propeller domain is dependent on association with the β2 subunit for mAb reactivity, and it has been suggested that the most likely explanation is that folding of the β-propeller domain is not completed until after association with the β subunit (24Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since mAbs specific for the region of the αL subunit C-terminal to the β-propeller domain have not been described, it is not known whether folding of this region is dependent on association with the β subunit. In this study, we have used mAb probes to study the structure of the Mac-1 α subunit in the presence and absence of association with the β2 subunit. We have studied the β-propeller domain, the I-domain, and the extensive region C-terminal to the β-propeller domain. Compared with the previous studies on LFA-1, our studies on the β-propeller domain are more definitive, since mAb specificity is defined to individual amino acid substitutions between mouse and human, and mAb to epitopes that are widely separated in the predicted β-propeller structure all show a dependence on β subunit association for reactivity. Furthermore, we employ a panel of mAbs that defines four different subregions within the C-terminal region of the α subunit. The results show that epitopes in three of these regions have a native structure in the absence of β subunit association, whereas a fourth epitope is dependent on association with the β subunit. Thus, much of the C-terminal region of the αM subunit appears to assume a native fold independently of association with the β2 subunit. U937, a human monoblast-like cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (complete medium).

The human wild-type αM subunit cDNA was subcloned in the expression vector pCDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described. 3C. Oxvig and T. A. Springer (1998)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95,4870–4875. For generating human-mouse αM chimeras, a Sac II site was created immediately after the stop codon (nucleotides 3532–3534). By specifically primed reverse transcription of murine spleen mRNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) from approximately 50 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon, the first strand of the mouse αM cDNA (33Pytela R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was generated with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). By using this as a template for PCR, a 2-kilobase pair mouse αM cDNA fragment covering nucleotides from the Sfi I site (nucleotide 1688) to the stop codon and having a Sac II site immediately after the stop codon was made. This mouse αM Sfi I-Sac II fragment was used to replace the corresponding human αMSfi I-Sac II fragment to generate the initial chimeric αM cDNA encoding the N-terminal 529 residues of human sequence and the remaining C-terminal sequence from mouse. Using this initial chimeric construct as template, eight human-mouse αM chimeras with a variable mouse C-terminal portion were generated by overlap extension PCR (34Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar, 35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Briefly, outer primers for overlap PCR were just 5′ to the Sfi I site and 3′ to the Sac II site, and the first set of reactions was carried out using the human wild-type αM and the initial chimeric construct as templates. After the overlap extension reaction, the chimeric products were digested with Sfi I and Sac II, and theSfi I-Sac II fragments were swapped into the human wild-type αM in vector pCDNA3.1+. Human to mouse individual amino acid substitutions in the region from amino acids 718–759 of human αM were made by overlap extension PCR (34Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Briefly, the overlapping primers contained the desired mutations, and the outer primers were 5′ to the Sfi I site and 3′ to theNde I site, respectively. The overlap extension PCR products were digested with Sfi I and Nde I and swapped into human wild-type αM in expression vector pEFpuro (36Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). For mapping mAb epitopes in the β-propeller domain of the human αM subunit, 32 different chimeric αM subunits were made in which a short segment of mouse sequence comprising a predicted loop or a strand 4 was inserted in the human sequence. Mutagenesis was done by inverse PCR on plasmid pBluescript II containing Mac-1 αM cDNA fragments that included the Not I site 5′ to the coding region and theBsp EI site at amino acid residue 180 or included theBsp EI-Bbs I fragment from 180 to 672, as described elsewhere.3 The mutated cDNA fragments were excised with Not I and Bsp EI or Bsp EI andBbs I and swapped into wild-type αM cDNA contained in plasmid pCDNA3.1+. Mutants were named after the sheet (W) and the loop (L) or the strand (S) that was exchanged, e.g. hu(W7L3–4)mo has mouse sequence in the loop between strands 3 and 4 of W7, and hu(W1S4)mo contains mouse sequence in strand 4 of W1. In the following list, the amino acid segment or individual amino acid residue that was of murine origin is indicated for each mutant in the numbering system for the mature human α subunit.

All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. At least two independent clones of each mutant were used for transfection, and identical results were obtained. COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (36Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar) with the αM cDNA alone or were co-transfected with the wild-type or chimeric αM and β2 cDNA. The wild-type and chimeric αM cDNA were in plasmid pCDNA3.1+, and the β2 cDNA was contained in plasmid pEF-BOS (36Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, COS cells were detached with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5 mm EDTA for flow cytometric analysis. 293 cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate method (37Heinzel S.S.

Briefly, 7.5 μg of wild-type or mutant αM cDNA in plasmid pEFpuro and 7.5 μg of β2 cDNA in plasmid pEF-BOS were used to transfect one 6-cm plate of 70–80% confluent cells. Two days after transfection, cells were detached with Hanks' balanced salt solution, 5 mm EDTA for flow cytometric analysis. COS cells and 293 cells were washed twice with L15 medium containing 2.5% FBS (L15/FBS) and resuspended to 1–2 × 106 cells/ml in the same medium. 50 μl of the cell suspension was incubated with an equal volume of the primary antibody (20 μg/ml purified mAb, 1:100 dilution of mAb ascites, or 1:2 dilution of hybridoma supernatant in PBS) on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with L15/FBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chain, Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 30 min on ice. For staining with mAb CBRM1/20 that requires Ca2+,3 the primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS supplemented with 1 mmCa2+. After washing, cells were resuspended in cold PBS and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For metabolic labeling, U937 cells were plated in four 10-cm Petri dishes and induced with PMA for 3 days as described previously (39Miller L.J. Springer T.A. J.

Cells in each dish were washed twice with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium and labeled with 0.625 mCi of [35S]methionine in 5 ml of methionine-free RPMI 1640 containing 15% dialyzed FBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, cells in two dishes were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed by addition of 3 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.24 TIU/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, antipain, and leupeptin) and incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. For chase labeling, 5 ml of complete medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml unlabeled methionine was added to each of the remaining dishes, and incubation at 37 °C was continued for 16 h. The chase-labeled cells were lysed identically to pulse-labeled cells, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For surface labeling, COS transfectants (2 × 106cells) were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The cells were surface-labeled with 1 mCi of Na125I using two IODO-BEADS (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled cells were washed three times with PBS containing 10% FBS and once with PBS and lysed as described above. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were precleared by addition of 1/10 volume of recombinant protein G agarose (50% suspension in PBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubation at 4 °C for 2–3 h with agitation. The precleared lysates were split into 250-μl aliquots, and to each aliquot, 2.5 μl of mAb ascites or 10 μg of purified mAb or 250 μl of mAb supernatant was added, and the final volume was adjusted to 500 μl with lysis buffer. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove protein aggregates, the antigen/antibody mixture was incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 1.5–2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with lysis buffer without detergent. For immunoprecipitation with mAb CBRM1/20, lysis buffer and wash buffer were supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+. Bound proteins were eluted from beads with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer by heating for 5 min at 100 °C, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The gels were processed for fluorography for [35S]methionine-labeled proteins or autoradiography for 125I-labeled proteins. The amino acid sequences between the β-propeller domain and the transmembrane segment of 36 integrin α subunits (9Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) were aligned with ClustalW, and then the alignment was iteratively refined using default settings with PRRP and the Gonnet amino acid substitution matrix, and an evolutionary tree was prepared with PHYLP (41Gotoh O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 823-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The αM and αIIb subunits fall in different branches of this tree, each of which is well populated. One branch containing 11 subunits most closely related to human αM,i.e. murine αM, human αD, and αX, murine and human αL, human and rat α1, and bovine, human, and mouse α2, were realigned with one another using PRRP. They are 21–70%,x̄ = 34% identical to human αM. Another branch containing the 17 subunits most closely related to human αIIb,i.e. hamster, human, and mouse α3, human andXenopus α5, chicken and human α6, mouse α7, chicken and human α8, and chicken, human, mouse, and Pleurodes αV, and YMA1 of Caenorhabditis elegans , were realigned in a separate group. They are 20–38%, x̄ = 28% identical to human αIIb. The alignments in MSF format, with gaps in human αM and human αIIb removed to increase prediction accuracy, were separately submitted for secondary structure prediction to PHD (42Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4Available on-line at the following address:http://www.embl-heidelberg.de./predict protein/. Smaller subgroups containing a higher degree of relationship to αM (6 α subunits, with 27–70% identity to αM) or to αIIb (9 α subunits, with 33–38% identity to αIIb) gave very similar predictions but with a slightly lower correlation between the αM and αIIb predictions. To study whether folding of the αM subunit is dependent on association with the β2 subunit, we examined the expression of mAb epitopes on the unassociated αM subunit. Eighteen mAbs that have previously been mapped to different regions in the αM subunit were used (29Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar)2 (Fig. 1). Previous studies on leukocyte integrin biosynthesis have shown that the α and β subunit precursors are initially unassociated in the endoplasmic reticulum and that transport to the Golgi apparatus and processing from high mannose N -linked carbohydrates to complex carbohydrates are dependent on the formation of α and β complex (39Miller L.J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 842-847PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ho M.-K. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2766-2769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Sanchez-Madrid F. Nagy J. Robbins E. Simon P. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether mAbs to the I-domain, to the β-propeller domain, and to the C-terminal region immunoprecipitated the unassociated αM precursor (α′M). All mAbs immunoprecipitated the mature αM subunit with molecular size of about 170 kDa from the lysate of cells pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and chased for 16 h (Fig. 2,lower panel ). The αM subunit was complexed with the β2 subunit as shown by co-immunoprecipitation of the β2 subunit with the αM subunit. However, mAbs differentially precipitated the α′M precursor, which is slightly smaller than the mature αM subunit from the pulse-labeled cells (Fig. 2, upper panel ). There was little or no α′M precursor associated with the β2 precursor (β′2) in the pulse-labeled cells, since no detectable β′2 over background was co-precipitated by mAbs to the αM subunit, but β′2 was precipitated with mAb CBRLFA-1/2 to the β2 subunit (upper panel, lane 18 ). All mAbs to the I-domain precipitated α′M (upper panel, lanes 2–6 ). By contrast, three mAbs (CBRN1/6, CBRN3/4, and CBRM1/20) to the β-propeller domain did not precipitate α′M (upper panel, lanes 7, 8 , and 21 ). mAb CBRM1/32 to the β-propeller domain did not precipitate the αM/β2 complex or α′M from cell lysates (data not shown), suggesting that its epitope is sensitive to detergent extraction. Five mAbs (OKM1, CBRM1/10, CBRM1/23, CBRM1/25, and CBRM1/26) to the C-terminal region precipitated α′M (upper panel, lanes 9 and 10 and 14 -16 ), whereas four other mAbs (CBRM1/16, CBRM1/17, CBRM1/18, and CBRM1/30) precipitated no to very little α′M (upper panel, lanes 11–13 and 17 ). Thus, epitopes of mAbs to the I-domain are expressed on the unassociated αM precursor, whereas epitopes of β-propeller domain mAbs and a subset of mAbs to the C-terminal region are not.Figure 2Immunoprecipitation of the unassociated αM precursor (α′M) and the αM/β2 complex. PMA-induced U937 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and chased with unlabeled methionine for 16 h. The αM and β2 precursors (α′M and β′2, respectively) and the αM/β2 complex were immunoprecipitated from lysates of pulse-labeled cells (upper panel ) and pulse-chased cells (lower panel ). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorographed. The nonbinding mAb, X63, was used"

Here we show that a recombinant α1(V) fragment (Ile824 to Pro950), referred to as HepV, is sufficient for heparin binding at physiological ionic strength. Both native individual α1(V) chains and HepV are eluted at identical NaCl concentrations (0.35m) from a heparin-Sepharose column, and this binding can be inhibited specifically by the addition of free heparin or heparan sulfate. In contrast, a shorter 23-residue synthetic peptide, containing the putative heparin binding site in HepV, fails to bind heparin. Interestingly, HepV promotes cell attachment, and HepV-mediated adhesion is inhibited specifically by heparin or heparan sulfate, indicating that this region might behave as an adhesive binding site. The same site is equally functional on triple helical molecules as shown by heparin-gold labeling. However, the affinities for heparin of each of the collagen V molecular forms tested are different and increase with the number of α1(V) chains incorporated in the molecules. Molecular modeling of a sequence encompassing the putative HepV binding sequence region shows that all of the basic residues cluster on one side of the helical face. A highly positively charged ring around the molecule is thus particularly evident for the α1(V) homotrimer. This could strengthen its interaction with the anionic heparin molecules. We propose that a single heparin binding site is involved in heparin-related glycosaminoglycans-collagen V interactions, but the different affinities observed likely modulate cell and matrix interactions between collagen V and heparan sulfate proteoglycans in tissues.

We propose that a single heparin binding site is involved in heparin-related glycosaminoglycans-collagen V interactions, but the different affinities observed likely modulate cell and matrix interactions between collagen V and heparan sulfate proteoglycans in tissues. Collagen V is a fibrillar collagen that plays an important role in fibrillogenesis, and it also acts as an adhesive substrate for a large variety of cells and binds to a number of extracellular components through its major triple helical domain (1Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Collagen V interacts with matrix proteoglycans such as the two small proteoglycans decorin and biglycan (2Whinna H.C. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3920-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the proteoglycan form of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (3Suzu S. Ohtsuki T. Makishima M. Yanai N. Kawashima T.

Glycobiology. 1994; 3: 327-332Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and as shown recently, the membrane spanning proteoglycan NG2 (6Tillet E. Ruggiero F. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10769-10776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions are mediated by the core proteins, but others depend on the glycosaminoglycan chains such as the heparan sulfate chains. Apart from in vitro binding of collagen V to membrane-spanning proteoglycans, the suggestion that heparan sulfate interacts with collagen V was supported by inhibition experiments showing a reduction of cell attachment to collagen V in the presence of heparin (7LeBaron R.G. Höök A. Esko J.D. Gay S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7950-7956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown already that cell focal adhesion on fibronectin requires the cooperation of both cell transmembrane proteoglycans and integrin receptors (8Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Because we have demonstrated already that cell-collagen V interactions involved integrins (9Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Ruggiero F. Comte J. Cabañas C. Garrone R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1865-1874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of membrane-spanning proteoglycans could reinforce cell attachment to collagen V and, in that sense, would be of physiological importance. Therefore, to understand the role of collagen V-heparan sulfate proteoglycan interactions, it appears essential to characterize the specific domain(s) of the molecule responsible for binding to heparin, a glycosaminoglycan related to heparan sulfate. Collagen V is a typical fibrillar collagen containing a 300-nm-long triple helical domain that presents different molecular forms in tissue. The predominant molecular form found in most tissues is the heterotrimer [α1(V)]2α2(V), whereas the α1(V)α2(V)α3(V) molecule is only extracted from human placenta (1Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The homotrimer [α1(V)]3 occurs in cultures of hamster lung cells and was suggested to be present in embryonic tissue (11Haralson M.A. Mitchell W.M. Rhodes R.K. Kresina T.F. Gay R. Miller E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5206-5210Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Haralson M.A. Mitchell W.M. Rhodes R.K. Miller E.J. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was produced recently as a recombinant molecule (14Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric [α1(V)]2α2(V) molecular form was shown previously to bind to heparin at physiological salt concentrations. This activity was attributed to a proteolytic NH2-terminal 30-kDa fragment of the α1(V) chain (15Yaoi Y. Hashimoto K. Koitabashi H. Takahara K. Ito M. Kato I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Aside from a requirement for the α1(V) chain, the features of the different stoichiometries of the collagen V triple helix necessary for heparin binding remain unknown. Such studies have been hampered by the fact that determination of minimal sites on the collagenous triple helix is difficult. Thus in this manuscript, to locate more precisely the heparin binding site, we have combined several approaches: (i) recombinant technology, in which collagenous domains and the molecule isotypes can be engineered and generated in quantities sufficient for biochemical and functional analysis; (ii) a synthetic peptide to narrow the sequence involved in heparin-collagen V recognition; (iii) electron microscopy to visualize the site on triple helical molecules. Using these approaches it has been possible to establish that a recombinant fragment of the α1(V) chain (Ile824I to Pro950) but not a synthetic peptide encompassing the putative heparin binding site binds to heparin and heparan sulfate. Moreover, we provide evidence for a cell adhesive function of this fragment through a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. This region corresponds to a heparin binding site common to the three known collagen V molecular forms, although increasing heparin affinities were correlated positively with the number of α1(V) chains incorporated in the molecule. Based on molecular modeling of the portion of the α chain which includes the putative binding sequence, we propose a model to explain the different affinities observed for the distinct collagen V molecular forms. The HepV module cDNA (nucleotides 2595–2976) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using as template the clone 302 kindly provided by Dr. Takahara (16Takahara K. Sato Y. Okasawa K. Okamoto N. Noda A. Yaoi Y. Kato I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides flanking the desired sequence were designed. One corresponding to the 5′-end of the module carried an Eco RI site (5′-TATGAATTCCCATCAAGGGTGATCGGGGGGAGA-3′), and the second, corresponding to the 3′-end of the module, introduced a Pst I site and a stop codon (5′-TATCTGCAGATTAGGGTCCCCGTTCACCAGGAGGGCCAGCTGG-3′). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product of 399 base pairs was subcloned in the Eco RI and Pst I sites of a pT7-7 expression vector (17Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). The plasmid obtained, named pHepV, thus encoded the heparin binding site of α1(V) under the control of theEscherichia coli phage T7 promoter. The sequence of the recombinant DNA was checked thoroughly. To obtain the recombinant protein, pHepV was transformed in theE. coli host strain BL21(DE3). This strain carries the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lac promoter/operator region which allows induction by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and subsequently the transcription of the recombinant plasmid. E. coli cells harboring the plasmid pHepV were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.7 in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was then supplemented with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce protein expression. The incubation was then maintained at the same conditions for an additional period of 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,920 × g for 20 min, resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and sonicated by two 30-s pulses at intensity level 3, using a Branson Sonifier-250 (Branson Ultrasonics). After centrifugation, supernatants and pellets were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For purification of the recombinant fragment HepV, the bacterial supernatant was dialyzed against 35 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, filtered, and applied to a HPLC cation exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Resource-S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (Waters 625 LC system) and eluted by a linear NaCl gradient (0–300 mm) in the same buffer. The fraction eluted at 200 mm NaCl and containing HepV was purified further by anion exchange chromatography through a HiTrapQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The column was equilibrated in 200 mm NaCl, 35 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. The unbound fractions contained purified HepV as analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Collagen V [α1(V)]2α2(V) heterotrimer was extracted with pepsin and purified as described previously (9Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Human placental pepsinized collagen V containing [α1(V)]2α2(V) and α1(V)α2(V)α3(V) heterotrimers in equal ratio were purchased from Sigma. The production in 293-EBNA cells of recombinant homotrimer [α1(V)]3 and subsequent purification are described elsewhere (14Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The peptide GTPGKPGPRGQRGPTGPRGERGP referred to as HepP was synthesized according to standard protocols using Fmoc (N -(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry in a Milligen 9050 synthesizer. The peptide was purified by reverse phase HPLC and was shown by amino acid analysis to have the correct primary structure. Glycosaminoglycans were obtained from commercial sources: heparin and chondroitin sulfate C from Sigma and heparan sulfate from Jacques Boy, Reims, France. Heparin-Sepharose affinity columns (HiTrap Heparin, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (buffer A) or in 35 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4 containing 200 mm NaCl (buffer B). Protein samples were loaded onto a column, and a programmed linear gradient of 150–500 mm NaCl in buffer A and 200–500 mmNaCl in buffer B was applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To determine heparin affinities to individual chains, collagen V samples were heat-denatured (60 °C for 20 min) before loading. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and the elution profile of protein samples was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 206 nm. The different fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above except fractions obtained with the peptide, which were analyzed by amino acid analysis. Analysis of the capacity of glycosaminoglycans to inhibit HepV binding to heparin and the synthetic peptide to release HepV bound to heparin were both carried out in batch with heparin-Sepharose CL-6B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resin was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl for glycosaminoglycans inhibition experiments. For glycosaminoglycan inhibition experiments, 5 μg of HepV was incubated in the absence or presence of free heparin, heparan sulfate, or chondroitin sulfate for 2 h at room temperature before being applied to the resin for an additional 30 min. Unbound material was recovered by gentle centrifugation after the addition of 1 ml of starting buffer to the samples. Elution of bound material was achieved by adding 0.5 m NaCl to the starting buffer. All fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. For peptide inhibition, 50 μl of the resin was incubated with 5 μg of HepV for 30 min at room temperature and washed with 1 ml of starting buffer. Bound material was then incubated with various concentrations of the synthetic peptide HepP, and the released material was recovered by gentle centrifugation. The resin was then washed with starting buffer, and the elution of the remaining bound material was achieved by adding 1 m NaCl to the starting buffer. Fractions were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Amino acid compositions were determined after hydrolysis under vacuum (6 N HCl, 115 °C, 24 h) in presence of 2-mercaptoethanol in a Pico Tag system (Waters) with a Beckman amino acid analyzer. For NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing, proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems) for 4 h at 60 V in 10 mm CAPS, 5% methanol, pH 11, and the band of interest was excised from the membrane after brief staining with 0.2% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid (Sigma). Amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Collagen solutions (collagen V samples and collagen I as control) were dialyzed overnight against PBS at 4 °C and then incubated with heparin-BSA-gold 10-mm particles (Sigma) for 3 h at room temperature. Samples were dialyzed against 1m ammonium acetate and finally diluted to 10 μg/ml with the same buffer. After the addition of an equal volume of glycerol, the solutions were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica sheet and were placed immediately on the holder of a MED 010 evaporator (Balzers). Rotary shadowing was carried out as described previously (19Ruggiero F. Petit B. Ronzière M.-C. Farjanel J. Hartmann D.J. Herbage D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Observations of replicas were performed with a Philips CM120 microscope at the CMEABG (Centre de Microscopie Electronique Appliquée à la Biologie et à la Géologie, Université Claude Bernard, Lyon I). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and a mixture of antibiotics. Before the adhesion assay, cells were harvested with 1% EDTA in PBS or with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, when indicated. Multiwell plates (96-well tissue culture plates, Costar, France) were coated by overnight adsorption at 4 °C with substrates at concentrations ranging from 0 to 40 μg/ml (100 μl/well). After saturation of the wells with 1% bovine serum albumin, freshly suspended cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4 × 105 cells/ml) were plated onto coated wells (100 μl/well) and allowed to attach for 30–40 min at 37 °C. The attached cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, and stained for 25 min with 0.1% crystal violet in water. After extensive washing, the dye absorbed to the cells was solubilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and optical density was read with an enzyme immunosorbent assay reader (Dynex MRX) at 570 nm. Each assay point was carried out in triplicate. For inhibition assays, the coated wells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml glycosaminoglycans (heparin, heparan sulfate, or chondroitin sulfate) for 1 h at 37 °C. Freshly suspended cells were then added, and the wells were incubated for 30–40 min. For synthetic peptide inhibitions, cells were first mixed with 500 μmRGDS peptide before being seeded onto the coated wells. The assays were then continued as described above. The two-dimensional projection used to represent the three-dimensional structure of α-helices is called a helical wheel. It allows, in the case of heparin binding consensus sequences, visualization of clusters of basic residues (20Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The helical wheel representation for collagen helix differs from a true α helix and thus was represented as described previously (21Deprez P.N. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For the representation of collagen V triple helices ([α1(V)]2α2(V) and [α1(V)]3), the helical wheels were positioned with the glycyl residues at the center of the molecule. For the molecular modeling of the peptide (Gly904 to Arg924), the coordinates of the three NH2-terminal GPP* (P* for hydroxyproline) triplets of the collagen-like peptide (PP*G)4PP*A(PP*G)5 were used to calculate interproton distance (22Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The Protein Data Bank code number is 1CAG. Each value was allowed to vary from −0.3 to +0.1 Å around the actual interproton distance. In this way a total of 683 constraints was introduced for the triple helical region, 105 of which were interchain constraints. In addition, average (Φ, Ψ) dihedral angles deduced from the crystal structure were also introduced with the following values: for Gly Φ = −72 ± 15° and Ψ = 174 ± 25°; for X position Φ = −72 ± 15° and Ψ = 164 ± 20°; for Y position Φ = −60 ± 15° and Ψ = 150 ± 18° (see Table I in Ref. 22Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar; note that the reported standard deviations were doubled for each angle). Three-dimensional structures were generated from set of constraints with the X-PLOR 3.8.5 program (23Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the default parameter sets, except for some minor modifications to increase the duration of the molecular dynamic simulations and the number of energy minimization steps. Structure superimposition, three-dimensional graphic displays, and manipulations were accomplished using ANTHEPROT 2.0 software (24Geourjon C. Deléage G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1995; 13: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Protein Data Bank numbers are 1a89 for the homotrimer and 1a9a for the heterotrimer. We designed a fragment, referred to as HepV, which encompasses the complete NH2-terminal part of the 30-kDa CNBr peptide defined by Yaoi et al. (15Yaoi Y. Hashimoto K. Koitabashi H. Takahara K. Ito M. Kato I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the sequence around the endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage site which was found to be determinant for heparin binding (Fig. 1). The resulting heparin binding site was thus narrowed down from the COOH-terminal end of the 30-kDa fragment to a 12-kDa polypeptide, HepV. An expression vector pT7-7, which encodes amino acids Ile824 to Pro950 of human α1(V) chain was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, SDS-PAGE analysis of the soluble and insoluble cellular extracts showed the presence of an additional protein band of 17 kDa in soluble extracts which was not found in transformed E. coli cells before induction. The difference between the apparent molecular mass and the predicted polypeptide mass of 12 kDa was attributed to the peculiar structure of collagen chains migrating slower than the globular standards, as well as the additional NH2-terminal amino acid residues originating from the construct. Passage of the supernatant over a Mono S column separated the HepV domain from most of the contaminating bacterial proteins. Final purification was achieved by rechromatography on a Mono Q column (Fig. 2 A ). Analysis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified band indicated the sequence XRIPIKGD, which agreed with that of the HepV construct. The four first amino acid residues correspond to NH2-terminal extension added for cloning purposes.Figure 2Panel A , 15% SDS-PAGE analysis of purified recombinant HepV fragment. Lane 1 , protein pattern of the loaded material. Lanes 2 and 3 , HepV purification by two-step ion exchange chromatography: bound fraction to a cation exchange column eluted at 0.2 m NaCl contains HepV (lane 2 ); unbound fraction to the anion exchange column contains purified recombinant fragment (lane 3 ). Panel B , a HPLC heparin affinity column was used to determine the affinity of heparin for HepV. Purified HepV was bound to the column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (dashed line ). The fraction eluted at 0.35 m NaCl contained HepV as shown by 15% SDS-PAGE analysis of the major peak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding interaction of heparin with collagen V fragments was studied using their affinities on a heparin-Sepharose column. We showed that HepV bound to the heparin-Sepharose column at physiological pH and ionic strength. Moreover, HepV was eluted from the column at 0.35m NaCl (Fig. 2 B ), which is exactly the concentration required to elute isolated native α1(V) chains. In addition, binding to heparin is inhibited by incubation of HepV with free heparin or heparan sulfate but not with chondroitin sulfate before loading on the heparin-Sepharose column (Fig.3 A ). Furthermore, to assess the importance of the length of the sequence flanking the putative heparin binding site, we designed a peptide, HcpP, containing the basic amino acid clusters KPGPRGQR but also including the basic residues close to the endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage site (at the carboxyl group of glutamate residue) (Fig. 1). Only 5% of the corresponding synthetic peptide was able to bind to a heparin-Sepharose column as indicated by the amino acid composition of the bound and unbound fractions (data not shown). Also, the peptide (added at concentrations up to 1 mg/ml; corresponding to a 200-fold molar excess) was unable to detach HepV bound to heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 3 B ) or to inhibit heparin binding to collagen V in a solid phase assay (not shown). We showed that isolated α1(V), but not α2(V) and α3(V) chains, was able to bind heparin at physiological pH and ionic strength and was eluted from the column at exactly 0.35m NaCl (Fig. 4 A ). To evaluate whether the binding site present in α1(V) is available when incorporated into the triple helix, different collagen V molecular forms were passed through a heparin column: the native heterotrimeric molecular form [α1(V)]2α2(V) from bovine bone and from human placenta, also containing in a 1:1 ratio the molecular form α1(V)α2(V)α3(V). To circumvent the problem of the α1(V) homotrimer, which is difficult to obtain from tissue, we used the recombinant homotrimer expressed and purified as described elsewhere (14Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that the affinities of each molecular form for heparin in terms of NaCl concentrations necessary for elution followed this order: α1(V)α2(V)α3(V) (0.28m) < [α1(V)]2α2(V) (0.35 m) < [α1(V)]3 (0.45 m) (Fig. 4 B ). These results indicate that the affinity of the different molecular forms could be modulated in relation to the number of α1(V) chains present in each subtype, two α1(V) chains in the triple helix being necessary to obtain the same affinity determined with isolated α1(V) chain. Because an active site might be available in small fragments or individual chains but masked in the context of the whole molecule, we then examined, by electron microscopy, the location of the heparin binding site on triple helices using heparin as a probe (according to Ref. 5San Antonio J.D. Karnovsky M.J. Gay S. Sanderson R.D. Lander A.D. Glycobiology. 1994; 3: 327-332Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For this purpose, collagen V, and collagen I as control, were complexed with heparin-BSA-gold and prepared for rotary shadowing as mentioned under “Experimental Procedures.” Pepsinized [α1(V)]2α2(V) collagen V-heparin gold complexes were often observed as large intermolecular aggregates for which it was difficult to identify the precise location of heparin binding. However, selected areas contained a sufficient proportion of individual molecules to determine the position of the gold particles on collagen V molecules. The binding site was located at about 100 nm from one of the extremities of the molecules (Fig.5 A ). This corresponds exactly to the α1(V) binding site position if we consider that the distance is measured from the NH2-terminal extremity of the collagen molecule. This binding site is specific to collagen V molecules since it was not observed on collagen I molecules labeled with heparin-gold (data not shown). Attempts to determine the polarity of collagen V ends using the recombinant [α1(V)]3 homotrimer encompassing the entire N -propeptide were not successful. Indeed, the presence of the N -propeptide seemed to enhance the formation of intermolecular aggregates associated with heparin-gold, and individual labeled molecules were rarely observed. Therefore mapping experiments were undertaken with a 200-nm fragment product of the recombinant [α1(V)]3 homotrimer (Fig. 5 B ). We have shown previously that this fragment resulted from a proteolytic cleavage occurring close to a flexible region present in the triple helical domain of the homotrimer (14Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NH2-terminal sequence of this fragment was found to start at residue Asp759, which is 65 amino acid residues upstream from the heparin binding site we have determined (Ile824 to Pro950) (14Fichard A. Tillet E. Delacoux F. Garrone R. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30083-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This would correspond to about 20 nm from the NH2-terminal end of the fragment and allow the orientation of the molecules. As expected, when this fragment was applied to heparin-Sepharose it was retained on the column and was eluted in the same conditions as the entire recombinant homotrimer, thus confirming the presence of the heparin binding site (data not shown). Mapping experiments on the fragments clearly showed a single location of heparin gold particles at a site very close to one end of the fragment, thus identified as the NH2-terminal extremity"
https://openalex.org/W1991141057,"Abstract The carboxyl terminus of p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k) has a set of Ser and Thr residues (Ser411, Ser418, Ser424, and Thr421) phosphorylated in vivo by an unidentified kinase(s). These Ser/Thr sites are immediately followed by proline, a motif that is commonly seen in the substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) and mitogen-activated protein kinases. A previous study has shown that Cdc2 (Cdk1) indeed phosphorylates these p70s6k Ser/Thr residues in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Cdc2-cyclin B complex phosphorylates Ser411 in the KIRSPRR sequence, whereas other Cdk-cyclin complexes including those containing Cdk2, Cdk4, or Cdk6 do not. Additionally, Ser411 phosphorylationin vivo was increased at mitosis in parallel with Cdc2 activation, and it was suppressed by a dominant negative form of Cdc2. These data indicate that p70s6k is a physiological substrate of Cdc2-cyclin B in mitosis. Since the activity of p70s6k is low during mitosis, Cdc2-cyclin B may play a role in inactivating p70s6k during mitosis, where protein synthesis is suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W2017684704,"The murine adult IIB myosin heavy chain (IIB MyHC) gene is expressed only in certain skeletal muscle fibers. Within the proximal promoter are two A + T-rich motifs, mAT1 and mAT2, which greatly enhance muscle-specific transcription; myogenic cells contain proteins that bind to these sequences. MEF-2 binds to both mAT1 and mAT2; a mutation abolishing its binding to mAT1 greatly diminishes the activity of the promoter. Both mAT motifs also form complexes with a protein requiring a target sequence typical of POU domain proteins, which migrate in electrophoretic mobility shift assays to the same position as a complex containing purified Oct-1 and which are supershifted by an antibody specific to Oct-1; this protein is therefore probably Oct-1. Footprinting experiments demonstrate that mAT1 is preferentially occupied by MEF-2 and mAT2 by Oct-1 and that these two proteins appear to bind cooperatively to their respective sites. Although the two mAT motifs have sequences that are very similar, they nonetheless exhibit distinct behaviors and perform differently in the activation of the promoter. The contribution of the IIB MyHC gene to specification of the myogenic phenotype is thus at least in part regulated by MEF-2 and Oct-1.

Skeletal muscle represents an excellent model to examine tissue-specific controls on transcription, since most of the major muscle structural proteins have several isoforms that often have characteristic spatiotemporal patterns of expression (reviewed in Ref.1Bandman E.

Among the transcription factors important for muscle gene expression are the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) regulatory factors (myf-5, MyoD, myogenin, and MRF4), which are able to induce muscle differentiation in non-myogenic cells (reviewed in Ref. 8Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The MEF-2 proteins (summarized in Ref. 9Breitbart R.E. Liang C.-S. Smoot L.B. Laheru D.A. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Development. 1993; 118: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are also often required for the transcription of muscle genes. Many genes require interactions among several promoter-bound proteins, both tissue-specific and non-tissue-specific, to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We have previously characterized numerous potential binding sites for known transcriptional activators within the 5′-flanking region of the IIB MyHC gene (10Takeda S. North D.L. Diagana T. Miyagoe Y.

In particular, two regions rich in the nucleotides A and T, situated between −140 and −190 bp, enhance the transcriptional activity of those constructions that contain them. This activation is found only in differentiated myotubes and not in undifferentiated myoblasts, implying that these sites contribute to the restriction of the expression of the IIB MyHC gene to mature muscle tissue.There are numerous DNA-binding proteins that recognize and bind to sequences that are predominantly composed of A and T nucleotides. Among these are the ubiquitous SRF (13Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the “related-to-SRF” proteins that share with SRF the existence of an amino-terminal MADS domain (13Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr.

There are at least four different mef2 genes, each of which may be alternatively spliced to produce several isoforms of the MEF-2 protein, some of which are selectively expressed in muscle and brain (9Breitbart R.E.

Bovine MTFmtformylates its homologous mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA and the E. coli initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAfMet) with essentially equal efficiency. The E. coli elongator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAmMet) was also formylated although with somewhat less favorable kinetics. These results suggest that the substrate specificity of MTFmt is not as rigid as that of the E. coli MTF which clearly discriminates between the bacterial initiator and elongator Met-tRNAs. These observations are discussed in terms of the presence of a single tRNAMet gene in mammalian mitochondria. The mammalian mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA transformylase (MTFmt) was partially purified 2,200-fold from bovine liver mitochondria using column chromatography. The polypeptide responsible for MTFmt activity was excised from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and the amino acid sequences of several peptides were determined. The cDNA encoding bovine MTFmt was obtained and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature form of MTFmt consists of 357 amino acid residues.

These observations are discussed in terms of the presence of a single tRNAMet gene in mammalian mitochondria. During the initiation of protein biosynthesis the initiator methionyl-tRNA is bound to the ribosomal P-site. In prokaryotes, this step is facilitated by initiation factor 2 (IF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: IF-2, initiation factor-2; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MTF, methionyl-tRNA transformylase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; bp, base pair; THF, tetrahydrofuran. while in the eukaryotic cytoplasm this step is mediated by eIF-2. In contrast, all other aminoacyl-tRNAs function as elongator tRNAs and enter the A-site of the ribosome in a complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) in prokaryotes or eEF-1 in the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm (1Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most organisms, the initiator tRNA has distinct features that ensure its selection during the initiation process and its exclusion from the steps of polypeptide chain elongation. In prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, the methionine attached to the initiator tRNA undergoes formylation at its amino group through the action of the enzyme methionyl-tRNA transformylase (MTF) (2Marcker K. Sanger F. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 8: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Mahler H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1973; 1: 625-637Google Scholar, 4Schwartz J.H. Meyer R. Eisenstadt J.M. Brawerman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 25: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli , MTF discriminates strictly between the initiator tRNA and the tRNAs used for chain elongation by recognizing specific determinants in the initiator tRNA (5RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 547-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Formylation of methionyl-tRNA is necessary for the interaction of the tRNA with IF-2. Formylation also eliminates any significant interaction with EF-Tu. In the yeasts and plants, the initiator tRNA is not formylated. However, Met-tRNAiMet is excluded from chain elongation by the presence of a 2′-O -ribosyl phosphate modification at position 64 of the initiator tRNA (6Åström S.U. Byström A.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 535-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The translational system in animal mitochondria is thought to be more closely related to that of prokaryotes than to that of the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm (7Galper J.B. Darnell J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 57: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Kumazawa Y. Schwartzbach C.J. Liao H.X. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. Miura K. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This idea is based on the use of fMet-tRNA for initiation, on the antibiotic sensitivity of the ribosomes, and on the ability of the mammalian mitochondrial elongation factors to function on bacterial ribosomes. However, animal mitochondrial protein synthesis has a number of unusual features that distinguish it from other translational systems. In general, mitochondrial tRNAs are shorter than their prokaryotic or eukaryotic cytoplasmic counterparts (59–75 nucleotides in length). They display numerous primary structural differences from “normal” tRNAs. In some cases, they cannot be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure and lack one or more of the invariant or semi-invariant residues found in other tRNAs (9Dirheimer G. Keith G. Dumas P. Westhof E. Süll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 93-126Google Scholar). There are genes for 22 tRNAs in the mammalian mitochondrial genome (10Anderson S. de Bruijin M.H. Coulson A.R. Eperon I.C. Sanger F. Young I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 683-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). This number is sufficient to read the altered genetic code found in this organelle. There is a single tRNA for each amino acid except for leucine and serine for which two tRNAs are required. A single gene for tRNAMet is present and no tRNAs appear to be imported into mammalian mitochondria (11Roe B.A. Wong J.F.H. Chen E.Y. Walton A.G. Proceedings of the Third Cleaveland Symposium on Macromolecules. Elsevier, Amsterdam1981: 167-176Google Scholar). It is unclear how a single tRNAMet species can play the dual roles of an initiator and an elongator tRNA. Translational initiation in mammal mitochondria requires fMet-tRNA for the IF-2mt-dependent binding to ribosomes. However, the unformylated form is required by EF-Tumt for chain elongation (12Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13618-13622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the single tRNAMet gene must give rise to two species of tRNA (fMet-tRNA and Met-tRNA). This process requires a mechanism to adjust the ratio of formylated to non-formylated Met-tRNAs to meet the needs of both initiation and elongation. As a first step toward the investigation of this process, we report here the purification, cloning, and characterization of bovine mitochondrial MTF (MTFmt). Folinic acid and CHAPS were purchased from Sigma. [35S]Methionine (37 TBq/mmol) and [14C]methionine (1.85 GBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham. DEAE-Sepharose fast flow, Mono S (HR5/5), Hi Trap Blue, and Hi Trap Heparin columns were purchased from Pharmacia. An affinity column using an immobilized E. coli tRNA mixture was prepared as described (14Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3059-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffer TG contains 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. Buffer PG contains 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% CHAPS. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Met-tRNA synthetase (MetRSmt) was partially purified from mitochondrial extracts by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad). E. coli MetRS was partially purified from E. coli extracts by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad). Mitochondrial tRNAMet was purified by a solid-phase hybridization method using DNA probes complementary to the 30 bases at the 3′-end of the tRNA (16Wakita K. Watanabe Y. Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Nakamura S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). E. coli tRNAfMetand tRNAmMet were purified as described (17Nishimura S. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. 2. Harper & Row, New York1971Google Scholar, 18Yoshida M. Takeishi K. Ukita T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 228: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Further purification was carried out on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel if necessary. Aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAMet was carried out in reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 14 mm Mg(OAc)2, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 1 mmspermine, 20 μm [35S]methionine (200 GBq/mmol), 2–4 μm tRNAMet, and saturating amounts of partially purified MetRSmt. The tRNA was extracted using phenol equilibrated at pH 5.0 and the remaining ATP and methionine were removed on a Hi Trap desalting gel (Pharmacia). Aminoacylation of E. coli tRNA was carried out with [35S] or [14C]methionine as described (19Gite S. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5305-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the Met-tRNAs were purified as described above. The bovine liver mitochondria were prepared as described (20Schwartzbach C.J. Farwell M. Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). About 60 g of mitochondria were resuspended in 240 ml of Buffer TG containing 0.005 m KCl (TG.005), and disrupted by sonication using five 20-s bursts at 100 watts followed by 40-s cooling periods. The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 180 min. The supernatant fraction (S100) was either processed immediately or frozen quickly and stored at −70 °C. CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) to all the buffers indicated below. The S100 (5,700 mg) was applied to a 100-ml DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (17.5 × 2.7 cm) equilibrated with Buffer TG.005, at a flow rate of about 2.0 ml/min. The column was washed by Buffer TG.005 until the absorbance at 280 nm became less than 0.1 and the proteins bound to the column were eluted by a 1.0-liter linear gradient of 5–400 mm KCl in Buffer TG. Fractions (10 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Fractions containing MTFmt activity were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (45–60% saturation). The pellet was then dissolved in Buffer PG and dialyzed against Buffer PG containing 0.15m KCl (PG.15) for 6 h with two changes of buffer. The sample (1,300 mg) was applied to a Mono S column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated in Buffer PG.15 at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The column was then washed with Buffer PG.15 and developed with a 10-ml linear gradient from 0.15 to 0.4 m KCl in Buffer PG. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected at the flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The fractions with MTFmtactivity were pooled and diluted with Buffer PG until the concentration of KCl was less than 0.25 m. The sample was immediately frozen and stored at −70 °C. The sample (1.6 mg) was applied at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min to a Hi Trap Blue column (1 ml) equilibrated in Buffer PG containing 0.25 m KCl (PG.25). After washing with Buffer PG.25, bound proteins were eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient from 0.25 to 0.75 m KCl in Buffer PG. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected at the flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The fractions with MTFmt activity were pooled and diluted with Buffer PG to decrease the KCl concentration to less than 0.10 m. The sample was then frozen quickly and stored at −70 °C. E. coli tRNA was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The partially purified sample (0.24 mg) containing MTFmt activity was applied to the column (0.5 × 2.1 cm) which had been equilibrated in Buffer PG containing 0.1 m KCl (PG.10). The column was developed with a linear gradient (0.10 to 0.60 m KCl in Buffer PG). Fractions (0.1 ml) were collected at the flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The fractions showing MTFmt activity were diluted with Buffer PG to reduce the concentration of KCl to less than 0.25 mand stored at −70 °C. The sample (0.13 mg) was applied to a Hi Trap Heparin column (1 ml) equilibrated with Buffer PG.25. The column was washed with Buffer PG.25 and developed with a 10-ml linear gradient from 0.25 to 0.75 m KCl in Buffer PG. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected at the flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Fractions with MTFmt activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% CHAPS. The sample was divided into small aliquots, fast-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. The assay of the formylation activity was carried out according to Ref. 21Blanquet S. Dessen P. Kahn D. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar with a slight modification as follows. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm E. coli [14C]Met-tRNAfMet, 0.3 mm N 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and the indicated amounts of MTFmt. The partially purified sample containing MTFmt was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a siliconized glass-fiber membrane (22Eckerskron C. Mewes W. Goretzki H. Lottspeich F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The band believed to be MTFmt (based on the correlation between the intensity of this band and the activity of MTFmt) was excised. The amino-terminal sequence was obtained on an Applied Biosystems 477A/120A protein sequencer. The sequences of internal peptides were obtained according to Clevelandet al . (23Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications indicated in Ref. 24Omori A. Yoshida S. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 471Google Scholar. Approximately 1 × 106 plaques from a bovine heart cDNA library (Uni-ZAPTM XR, Stratagene) were screened by hybridization with a putative human MTFmtcDNA probe labeled by random priming (25Gottesman M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 151: 363-364Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out at 65 °C with 6 × SSC buffer containing 20 mm NaH2PO4 and 0.4% (w/v) SDS (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive plaques were isolated and the pBluescript SK(−) plasmid clones were excised in vivo according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was subjected to autosequencing using a HITACHI SQ-5500 sequencer (27Biggin M.D. Gibson T.J. Hong G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3963-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). The initiation of protein synthesis in mitochondria requires the use of the formylated initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNA). Hence, this organelle must possess a factor equivalent to the bacterial methionyl-tRNA transformylase. When extracts of bovine mitochondria were tested for a factor that could carry out the formylation of E. coli Met-tRNAfMet, a small amount of activity could be detected. The partial purification of this activity (MTFmt) was carried out by successive column chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” (TableI).Table IPurification of mitochondrial MTFmt from bovine liverPurification stepProteinTotal unitsSpecific activity1-aSpecific activity; 1 unit of the enzyme is the capacity of formylating 1 pmol of E. coli Met-tRNAfMet in 1 min at 30 °C.Total recoveryPurification×10 3 mg×10 3unit/mg%-foldMitochondrial extract1-bFrom 63 g (wet weight) of bovine mitoplast.(S-100)5,7001,1000.191001DEAE-Sepharose1,3004200.32381.7Mono S1.627172.589Hi Trap Blue0.247.5310.068160Affinity column (tRNAE. colimix-Sepharose)0.137.0540.064280Hi Trap Heparin0.0104.24200.0382,2001-a Specific activity; 1 unit of the enzyme is the capacity of formylating 1 pmol of E. coli Met-tRNAfMet in 1 min at 30 °C.1-b From 63 g (wet weight) of bovine mitoplast. Open table in a new tab The purification scheme resulted in a 2,200-fold purification of MTFmt with an overall yield of about 0.04%. Throughout the purification scheme, the recovery of MTFmt was significantly improved by the addition of the detergent CHAPS to all of the buffers used. This observation suggests that there are hydrophobic patches on MTFmt that lead to the absorption of this factor on the matrices of various resins or that reduce its solubility resulting in substantial losses of activity. Analysis of the partially purified preparation of MTFmt on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B ) showed the presence of three major polypeptide bands. The band with a molecular mass of about 40,000 daltons was tentatively identified as MTFmt. The intensity of this band correlated with the amount of MTFmtactivity observed. In addition, the transformylase would be expected to be about this size. This polypeptide represented about 25% of the protein in the partially purified sample. About 2.5 μg of MTFmt were obtained from 2 kg of bovine liver. In order to obtain cDNA clones of MTFmt, partial peptide sequences were determined. MTFmt was first subjected to NH2-terminal Edman degradation. Second, for the determination of internal amino acid sequences, peptides resulting from digestion with endoproteinase V8 were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Edman degradation. Three peptide sequences were obtained (Table II).Table IISequences of peptide fragments derived from bovine liver MTFmtPeptidePosition1 = NH2-ASPPWED1–72 = EVVTVPSPSP53–623 = ETVPVPPKST162–171 Open table in a new tab These sequences were then used to search the data bases. The partial sequence of one human cDNA (GenBank number 108908) included the sequence EVVTVPSPSP found as an internal peptide in bovine MTFmt. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA contained a 400-bp region which was homologous to E. coli MTF. This cDNA clone was, thus, predicted to encode a portion of human MTFmt. Probes prepared from this putative human MTFmt cDNA hybridized with the E. coli MTF gene (data not shown). A bovine heart Uni-ZAPTMXR cDNA library was screened using the human cDNA clone as a probe. Five positive plaques were isolated among 1 × 106 plaques, and the plasmids carrying the cDNA inserts of interest were excisedin vivo . The largest clone characterized carried a 1355-bp insert (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis indicated that this clone contained the entire coding region for the mature form of MTFmt (1071 bp) and a portion of a putative mitochondrial import signal (45 bp). The 3′-untranslated region was 220 bp in length and contained a conventional polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) 17 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail (Fig. 2) (28Wickens M. Stephenson P. Science. 1984; 226: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The mature form of MTFmt is 357 amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of 40,017. This value is consistent with the molecular weight of the band identified as MFTmt on SDS-PAGE. The amino acid sequence of MTFmt is about 30% identical to the corresponding prokaryotic factors (Fig. 3 A ) (29Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 244: 359-367Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J.

It is interesting to note that the sequence of bovine MFTmt is also only 28% identical to that of yeast MTFmt (34Skala J. Van Dyck L. Purnelle B. Goffeau A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Table III).Table IIIIdentity of the known MTF amino acid sequences from various organismsE. coliT. thermophilusH. influenzaeM. genitaliumB. subtilisYeast (mt)Bovine (mt)%%%%%%%E. coli100T. thermophilus44100H. influenzae6540100M. genitalium262329100B. subtilis43394032100Yeast (mt)2929292427100Bovine (mt)292829242828100Sequence comparisons were done with the Maximum Matching program in GENETYX version 7.0.

It should be noted that, while the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence obtained by peptide sequencing was ASPGWED, the cDNA sequence obtained gave the sequence ASPPWED when translated into the amino acid sequence. This apparent discrepancy could arise if there is more than one copy of MTFmt gene in the bovine nuclear genome with slightly different sequences. The crystal structure of E. coli MTF has recently been determined (35Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analysis of this structure indicates that MTF contains two domains, NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains. NH2-terminal domain carries the tetrahydrofolate (THF)-binding site in which the THF binding motif (SLLP motif) is contained, as well as a Rossman fold (35Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The longest stretch of conserved residues among the MTFs from various sources is located in the THF-binding site proposed for E. coli MTF (35Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The COOH-terminal domain provides a positively charged surface oriented toward the active center of the enzyme and is, presumably, involved in positioning the Met-tRNA substrate for the formylation reaction. The THF binding motif is present as SCLP in bovine MTFmt, and the Phe at position 14, which is assumed to be responsible for the interaction of E. coli MTF with the 3′-end of the Met-tRNA (35Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is also conserved in the bovine mitochondrial counterpart (Phe-29) (Fig. 3). The COOH-terminal domain of E. coli MTF is characterized by an oligonucleotide binding fold termed the OB fold. The OB fold is formed by two orthogonal sheets consisting of five antiparallel strands folded into a β-barrel surrounded by α-helices (35Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions using the Chou-Fasman or Robson methods (36Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; : 45-148PubMed Google Scholar, 37Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar) have not able been to clearly identify a similar structure in MTFmt. The Lys at position 207 in the linker region between the two domains of E. coli MTF is thought to be involved in the interaction with the 3′-end of the tRNA (19Gite S. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5305-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This residue (Lys-214) has been conserved in the spacer region between the domains of MTFmt (Fig. 3). The initiation of translation in most prokaryotic organisms requires the formylation of the initiator Met-tRNA by MTF. In E. coli , the formyl group is a positive determinant for the specific interaction of IF-2 with the initiator tRNA. It also serves as a negative determinant that nearly eliminates the binding of EF-Tu to the initiator tRNA (5RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 547-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial MTF will not formylate the Met-tRNAmMet species used for chain elongation. The strict substrate specificity of E. coli MTF is essential to ensure the accuracy and the efficiency of the initiation process. In contrast to all other systems, animal mitochondria do not contain two distinct methionyl-tRNA species that are used exclusively for the initiation or elongation phases of protein synthesis. Mammalian mitochondria have a single tRNAMetgene which is encoded in the organelle genome (10Anderson S. de Bruijin M.H. Coulson A.R. Eperon I.C. Sanger F. Young I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 683-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that cytoplasmic tRNAs are imported into animal mitochondria (11Roe B.A. Wong J.F.H. Chen E.Y. Walton A.G. Proceedings of the Third Cleaveland Symposium on Macromolecules. Elsevier, Amsterdam1981: 167-176Google Scholar). Thus, the single tRNAMet gene must, in some unknown manner, give rise to both an initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNA) and an elongator tRNA (Met-tRNA) (35Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Gite S. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5305-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The unique presence of a single Met-tRNA species in mammalian mitochondria made it of considerable interest to address the substrate specificity of MTFmt. The kinetic parameters governing the formylation of three native tRNA molecules, bovine mitochondrial Met-tRNA, E. coli Met-tRNAfMet, and E. coli Met-tRNAmMet, were measured (TableIV). The results of these experiments indicated that MTFmt is clearly able to use E. coli Met-tRNAfMet with a V maxthat is about 3-fold higher than that observed with the mitochondrial Met-tRNAMet. The K m observed with theE. coli initiator tRNA is a little over 3-fold higher than with the mitochondrial tRNAMet. The net result is that the relative V max/K m for these two tRNAs are essentially the same. Surprisingly, MTFmt was also able to formylate the E. coli elongator Met-tRNAmMet. This tRNA is never a substrate for formylation by the homologous E. coli MTF (38Dickerman H.W. Steers Jr., E. Redfield B.G. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1522-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheK m value observed with Met-tRNAmMet is essentially the same as that observed for E. coli Met-tRNAfMet while the V max is about 3-fold lower than that observed with the mitochondrial Met-tRNA. MTFmt clearly does not discriminate between the bacterial initiator and elongator Met-tRNAs. This observation is compatible with the fact that there is a single Met-tRNA species in mammalian mitochondria.Table IVKinetic parameters in formylation of various Met-tRNAsMet-tRNAV max (×10−2μM/min)K mRelativeV max/K m4-aRelative V max/K mis the ratio of Vmax/Km of mitochondorial Met-tRNA toV max/K m of each Met-tRNA.μME. coli (f)2.40.0910.83E. coli (m)0.280.0950.091Bovine mitochondria0.80.02514-a Relative V max/K mis the ratio of Vmax/Km of mitochondorial Met-tRNA toV max/K m of each Met-tRNA. Open table in a new tab E. coli MTF is known to have some affinity for many different tRNAs that is mediated through an interaction between the 3′-end of the acceptor stem of the tRNA and regions surrounding Lys-207 in MTF (19Gite S. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5305-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). However, only Met-tRNAfMet is a substrate for the actual formylation process. It has been speculated that the formylation reaction is triggered by the melting of the acceptor stem of Met-tRNAfMet which is facilitated in the initiator tRNA by the unstable acceptor stem found in this tRNA (19Gite S. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5305-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Wallis N.G. Dardel F. Blanquet S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7668-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several residues in MTF are thought to be involved in this melting process, such as basic residues in the loop I, and Phe-14 (35Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Ramesh V. Gite S. Li Y. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13524-13529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Phe-14 corresponds to Phe-29 in MTFmt, but Arg-42 in the loop I could not be identified clearly in MTFmt. A comparison of the sequences of prokaryotic MTF and yeast MTFmt with the sequence of bovine MTFmt does not provide a clear rationale for the structural basis for the Met-tRNA specificities of these enzymes. However, it should be noted that the region termed the “insertion sequence” in the Rossman fold, which is usually variable in length in class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (41Arnez J.G. Moras D. Nagai K. Mattaj I.W. RNA-Protein Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 52-81Google Scholar), is shorter in the case of bovine MTFmt than in prokaryotic MTF (Figs. 3 and 4). The difference in this distance would be expected to place a number of residues in somewhat different positions in MTFmt. This difference might permit the mitochondrial factor to form the transition state with the elongator Met-tRNA easily. Hence it might be able to formylate the elongator Met-tRNA without the necessity for melting the acceptor stem. Further experiments will be designed to evaluate this idea. How the single tRNAMet gene gives rise to both an initiator and an elongator tRNAMet species still remains unknown at this time. One possibility is that the formylation of Met-tRNA converts it from the elongator to the initiator tRNA since formylation increases its affinity for IF-2mt and diminishes its ability to form a complex with EF-Tumt. The ratio of formylated to the non-formylated Met-tRNA might be regulated by a competition between MTFmt and EF-Tumt for Met-RNA. The purification and characterization of MTFmt as described here will allow us to investigate this issue by using purified IF-2mt and EF-Tumt. Alternatively, the activity of MTFmtmight be regulated by an unknown mechanism in vivo in conjunction with the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis. An investigation of this possibility must await the development of a better understanding of the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis. We are indebted to our previous co-workers, Dr. T.

Receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing replacement of GDP, which is buried between these two domains, with GTP. Substitution of the homologous αi2 residues for four αs residues in switch III, a region that changes conformation upon GTP binding, or of one nearby helical domain residue decreases the ability of αs to be activated by the β-adrenergic receptor and by aluminum fluoride. Both sets of mutations increase the affinity of αs for the β-adrenergic receptor, based on an increased amount of high affinity binding of the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The mutations also decrease the rate of receptor-mediated activation and disrupt the ability of the β-adrenergic receptor to increase the apparent affinity of αs for the GTP analog, guanosine 5′-O -(3-thiotriphosphate). Simultaneous replacement of the helical domain residue and one of the four switch III residues with the homologous αi2 residues restores normal receptor-mediated activation, suggesting that the defects caused by mutations at the domain interface are due to altered interdomain interactions. These results suggest that interactions between residues across the domain interface are involved in two key steps of receptor-mediated activation, promotion of GTP binding and subsequent receptor-G protein dissociation.

These results suggest that interactions between residues across the domain interface are involved in two key steps of receptor-mediated activation, promotion of GTP binding and subsequent receptor-G protein dissociation. Heterotrimeric G proteins transmit signals from cell surface receptors to effector proteins that modulate a wide variety of cellular processes (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar, 2Neer E. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The α and βγ subunits of G proteins are associated in the inactive GDP-bound form. Receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing replacement of GDP by GTP on the α subunit. Receptor-catalyzed nucleotide exchange is thought to involve an “opening” of the guanine nucleotide binding pocket that facilitates GDP release and increases the relative affinity for GTP compared with GDP (3Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transient empty state of the G protein has a high affinity for the hormone-receptor complex. However, this state is short-lived due to the high intracellular concentration of GTP. Binding of GTP leads to dissociation of the receptor from α·GTP and βγ, each of which can transmit signals to effectors. Hydrolysis of GTP by the α subunit regulates the timing of deactivation and reassociation of α with βγ. α subunit structures consist of two domains, a GTPase domain that resembles the oncogene protein p21ras and a helical domain consisting of α helices and connecting loops. The bound GDP is buried between the two α subunit domains, suggesting that the helical domain may present a barrier to GDP release. Three regions in the GTPase domain (switches I–III) assume different conformations in the structures of GTPγS 1The abbreviation used is: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O -(3-thiotriphosphate). -boundversus GDP-bound α subunits (5Noel J.P.

Like the helical domain, switch III, which is located at the interface of the two domains, is unique to the structures of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. The conformational switch regions are important for the interaction of α subunits with effectors (9Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

We previously identified a cluster of four switch III residues 2Residue numbering throughout is according to the long splice variant of αs. in αsat the interface between the GTPase and helical domains in which substitutions with αi2 homologs in the mutant construct N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs decreased receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase in transiently transfected cells (13Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The activation defect caused by substituting αi2 residues for these αs residues was corrected by replacing the helical domain of αs with that of αi2 in a chimera, αsis, in which αi2 homologs were substituted for αs residues 62–235, extending from the end of the α1 helix to the end of the α2 helix (13Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, matching αi2 residues on both sides of the domain interface of αs restored receptor-initiated activation. We now report a detailed analysis of the activation defects caused by these switch III substitutions and of a mutation that replaces a nearby helical domain residue, Asn167, with the homologous αi2 residue, arginine. Measurements in stably transfected cells of isoproterenol binding to the β-adrenergic receptor, and the time course and dose-dependence of adenylyl cyclase stimulation by the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog, GTPγS, in the presence and absence of isoproterenol indicate that the mutations increase the affinity of αs for the β-adrenergic receptor, decrease the rate of receptor-mediated activation, and block receptor-stimulated increases in GTPγS affinity. Additional mutational analysis refines the nature of the interdomain interactions that play a role in receptor-mediated activation by demonstrating that of the switch III substitutions, R258A alone causes a defect in receptor-mediated activation, that this defect is corrected when the helical domain of αs is replaced with that of αi2, and that the defect caused by the N167R substitution is corrected when combined with the N254D substitution but not the R258A substitution. These results suggest that interdomain interactions are involved in the transmission of signals between the receptor and the guanine nucleotide binding pocket. αs mutant constructs were generated from rat αs cDNA (14Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric α subunits were constructed from rat αscDNA and mouse αi2 cDNA (15Sullivan K.A. Liao Y.C.

Subcloning and mutagenesis procedures were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. All α subunit constructs produced in this study contain an epitope, referred to as the EE epitope (16Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This epitope does not affect the ability of αs to activate adenylyl cyclase in response to stimulation by the β-adrenergic receptor (17Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The αs cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector, pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen) as a Hin dIII fragment. N167Rαs, N167Aαs, N254Dαs, M255Lαs, I257Lαs, R258Aαs, and N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs were produced by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene kit. N167R/N254Dαs and N167R/R258Aαs were produced by ligating Alwn I fragments containing either the N254D or the R258A mutations into N167Rαs in place of the analogous fragment to produce an αs cDNA containing both mutations. Construction of the αsis chimera, in which αs residues 62–235 are replaced by the homologous αi2 residues, has been described elsewhere (13Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). R258Aαsis was produced by ligating a Bam HI fragment containing the R258A mutation into αsis in place of the analogous fragment. Receptor-independent cAMP accumulation in transiently transfected cells was measured after introducing a second mutation (RC) that substitutes cysteine for the arginine at position 201 and causes constitutive activation by decreasing GTPase activity (19Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). αsRC versions of N254Dαs, M255Lαs, I257Lαs, and R258Aαs were produced by ligating Bam HI fragments containing the mutations into αsRC in place of the analogous fragment. αsRC versions of N167Rαs and N167Aαs were produced by ligating Alwn I fragments containing the RC mutation into N167Rαs and N167Aαs, respectively, in place of the analogous fragment. αsRC versions of N167R/N254Dαsand N167R/R258Aαs were produced by ligating Alwn I fragments containing the RC mutation and either the N254D or the R258A mutation into N167Rαs in place of the analogous fragment. The αsisRC version of R258Aαsis was produced by ligating a Bam HI fragment containing the R258A mutation into αsisRC in place of the analogous fragment. αsconstructs were subcloned as Hin dIII fragments into the retroviral vector pMV7 (20Kirschmeier P.T.

Single colonies containing the pMV7 vector were obtained using limiting dilution in microtiter wells and selection in G418 (1 mg/ml).

The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody according to the ECL Western blotting protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Conversion of [α32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP in the presence of various activators was measured as described (23Masters S.B. Miller R.T. Chi M.H. Chang F.-H. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

Reactions shown in Figs. 1 and 4 were preincubated for 5 min in the absence of [α32P]ATP and then incubated for 30 min. For the time courses shown in Fig. 3, membranes were preincubated in the absence of [α32P]ATP and activators for 6 min. At time = 0, [α32P]ATP and either GTPγS or GTPγS and isoproterenol were added and aliquots were removed at the indicated times for cAMP determination. To determine EC50 values for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by GTPγS shown in Fig. 4, the observed adenylyl cyclase activity was fitted to the equation, Y=b+a−b1+(X/c) dEquation 1 where X is the concentration of GTPγS, Y is the observed adenylyl cyclase activity, a is the adenylyl cyclase activity observed in the absence of GTPγS, b is the maximum observed adenylyl cyclase activity, c is the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of GTPγS, andd is the slope factor.Figure 4Isoproterenol does not decrease the EC50 for activation of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs by GTPγS. Adenylyl cyclase activities in membranes ofcyc − cells stably expressing αs(A ), N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs (B ), or N167Rαs (C ) were determined in the presence of the indicated concentrations of GTPγS, in the presence (filled symbols ) or absence (open symbols ) of 100 μm isoproterenol (Iso ).

Kaslow D. Kaslow H.R. Salomon M.R. Licko V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of this time, the membranes were diluted and washed on Whatman GF/C filters, and bound [125I]ICYP was measured. The experimental data were analyzed for competition at two sites by nonlinear least-squares curve fitting as described (24Bourne H.R. Kaslow D. Kaslow H.R. Salomon M.R. Licko V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar).K L and K H, the low and high affinity dissociation constants, respectively, were assumed to be the same in the presence and absence of GTP. WhenK L and K H were allowed to vary in the two conditions, improved fits to the data were obtained. Therefore, the two-state model may be an oversimplification of receptor behavior, as has been suggested (25Krumins A.M. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). α subunit constructs were introduced by electroporation into a subclone ofcyc − S49 lymphoma cells (26Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 187: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that stably expresses Simian virus 40 large T antigen, and cAMP accumulation was measured after labeling with [3H]adenine as described (13Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotides were separated on ion-exchange columns (27Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar), and cAMP accumulation was expressed as [3H]cAMP/([3H]ATP + [3H]cAMP) × 1000. Receptor-independent cAMP accumulation was determined by measuring basal cAMP levels in cells transfected with the αsRC versions of the mutant constructs. The ability of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαsto be activated by the β-adrenergic receptor and by AlF4−, which mimics the γ-phosphate of GTP, was measured after expression in cyc − S49 lymphoma cells (26Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 187: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which lack endogenous αs (28Harris B.A. Robishaw J.D. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Science. 1985; 229: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). At equal expression levels (Fig.1 A ), adenylyl cyclase activity stimulated by both isoproterenol and by AlF4−was reduced by 80% in membranes of cells expressing N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs compared with membranes of αs-expressing cells (Fig. 1 B ). Stimulation by the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog, GTPγS, not only was intact, but increased by almost 2-fold. Because the activation defect of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs, as assessed in transiently transfected cells, was suppressed when the helical domain consisted of αi2 residues (13Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the x-ray crystal structures of α subunits to identify nearby helical domain residues that might be responsible for the conditional defect of these switch III substitutions. Comparison of the GTPγS- and GDP-bound α subunit structures (5Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 6Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E.

In αs, the only residue in this loop that is close to any of the four residues and differs in the sequences of αs and αi2 is Asn167. Mutation of Asn167 to the homologous αi2 residue to produce N167Rαs decreased both isoproterenol-stimulated and AlF4−-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by 60% in membranes of cells expressing equal amounts of protein compared with membranes of αs-expressing cells (Fig. 1). As with N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs, stimulation by GTPγS was increased ∼2-fold (Fig. 1). Because N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs exhibited decreased receptor-mediated activation, we used a competitive binding assay to determine whether these mutant α subunits exhibit alterations in binding to the β-adrenergic receptor. This assay measures an αs-dependent increase in the affinity of the β-adrenergic receptor for the agonist, isoproterenol (24Bourne H.R. Kaslow D. Kaslow H.R. Salomon M.R. Licko V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar, 29De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which occurs in the absence of bound guanine nucleotide. The high affinity hormone binding state of the receptor is thought to reflect its interaction with Gs in the nucleotide-free state. In the presence of GTP, receptors in membranes of αs-expressing cells were predominantly in the low affinity state (Fig.2 A ). In the absence of GTP, αs caused the appearance of high affinity binding sites for isoproterenol on the receptor (Fig. 2 A ). Like αs, both N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs increased the affinity of the β-adrenergic receptor for isoproterenol in the absence of GTP compared with in its presence (Fig. 2, B and C ). However, in membranes of cells expressing these constructs, the affinity of the receptor for isoproterenol in both the presence and absence of GTP was greater than in membranes from αs-expressing cells, due to decreases in K L and K H, the low and high affinity dissociation constants, respectively, as well as increases in the percentage of receptors in the high affinity form, %R H. This increase in hormone-receptor binding was particularly striking in cells expressing N167Rαs, in which 50% of the receptors were in the high affinity form in the presence of GTP. The simplest explanation of the increased amount of hormone-receptor binding observed in the presence of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs is that these mutant α subunits increase the affinity of Gsfor the receptor in both the nucleotide-bound and -free states. Because dissociation of Gs from the activated receptor must precede adenylyl cyclase activation, we investigated whether N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαsexhibited altered rates of receptor-mediated activation. To estimate relative rates of receptor-mediated activation, we determined the effects of isoproterenol on the time courses of adenylyl cyclase activation by GTPγS. In membranes of cells expressing αs, GTPγS activated adenylyl cyclase with a time lag that was greatly reduced by isoproterenol (Fig.3 A ). This decreased time lag reflects receptor-stimulated increases in the rates of GDP dissociation and GTPγS binding. In the absence of isoproterenol, GTPγS activated adenylyl cyclase in membranes containing N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs or N167Rαs with somewhat shorter time lags than in αs membranes (Fig. 3,B and C ). Isoproterenol increased the activation rates of these mutants, but not to the same extent as for αs. Thus, in the presence of isoproterenol, the time lags of the mutants were longer than that of αs (Fig. 3,B and C ). N167Rαs, which caused the appearance of the greatest amount of high affinity binding to the receptor (Fig. 2 C ), exhibited the longest time lag in the presence of isoproterenol. Thus, N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαsexhibit decreased rates of receptor-mediated activation, which could reflect decreased rates of GTP-dependent dissociation from receptors. Alternatively, or in addition, decreased rates of receptor-mediated activation could be due to defects in receptor-stimulated GTP binding, which we investigated as described below. Receptors stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange on G proteins by increasing the rate of GDP release and by causing a preference for GTP compared with GDP (3Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For αs, this results in an approximately 8-fold decrease in the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for GTPγS stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in the presence of isoproterenol compared with in its absence (Fig. 4 A ). In the absence of isoproterenol, N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs exhibited EC50 values for GTPγS stimulation of adenylyl cyclase that were slightly lower than that of αs (Fig. 4, B and C ). However, these EC50 values were unchanged by isoproterenol (Fig. 4, B and C ) so that in the presence of isoproterenol, their apparent affinities for GTPγS were less than that of αs. Thus, although isoproterenol increases the rate at which these mutant α subunits exchange nucleotide (Fig. 3), it does not increase their apparent affinities for GTP. We individually tested each of the four switch III residues that were mutated in N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs to determine their roles in receptor-mediated activation. Receptor-dependent stimulation of cAMP synthesis was measured in transiently transfectedcyc − S49 lymphoma cells. The only substitution that decreased receptor-mediated activation was R258A (Fig.5 A ). Receptor-independent cAMP accumulation was also measured after introducing a second mutation (the RC mutation) that substitutes cysteine for the arginine at position 201 (19Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). αsRC has decreased GTPase activity and is constitutively activated. R258AαsRC produced receptor-independent cAMP accumulation similar to that of αsRC, indicating that, as is the case for N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs, R258Aαs can activate adenylyl cyclase when it is in the GTP-bound form. Because the activation defect of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs was corrected by replacing the helical domain of αs with that of αi2 in a chimera, αsis, in which αi2 homologs were substituted for αs residues 62–235, (Fig.6) (13Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether introducing the single homolog substitution (R258A) responsible for the defect of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs into αsis would result in normal activation properties. R258Aαsis exhibited activation properties similar to those of αs rather than those of R258Aαs(Fig. 5 A ). Thus, the defect produced by the R258A substitution appears to be due to an alteration in interactions with αs residue(s) in the helical domain. We investigated the effect of combining the substitutions on each side of the domain interface, N167R and R258A, that caused significant decreases in receptor-mediated activation. Although Asn167 and Arg258 are both at the domain interface, they are not close enough to make contact in the x-ray crystal structures of α subunits (see Fig. 6). N167R/R258Aαs exhibits a more severe activation defect (Fig. 5 B ) than either N167Rαs (Fig.5 C ) or R258Aαs (Fig. 5 A ) does, although receptor-independent activation by N167R/R258AαsRC is normal. Because the defects of the N167R and R258A substitutions are additive, the contributions of these substitutions to defects in receptor-mediated activation are independent. Furthermore, some other residue(s) in the helical domain other than the αi2 homolog of Asn167 must be responsible for the suppression of the R258A defect in R258Aαsis. According to the x-ray crystal structures of α subunits, Asn167 is close to Asn254 (see Fig. 6). Therefore, we hypothesized that the N167R substitution might cause a conditional defect, depending on the identity of the residue at position 254. According to this hypothesis, replacing Asn254 with aspartate should correct the defect caused by the N167R mutation. Indeed, we found that an α subunit with both substitutions, N167R/N254Dαs, exhibits activation properties similar to those of αs (Fig. 5 B ). Thus, the N254D substitution, which on its own does not disrupt receptor-mediated activation, corrects the activation defect caused by the N167R substitution. To further investigate the mechanism by which the N167R substitution causes a defect in receptor-mediated activation, we determined the effect of mutating Asn167 to alanine. Alanine substitutions eliminate the side chain beyond the β carbon but generally do not alter the main chain conformation or impose significant electrostatic or steric effects (30Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the activation defect resulting from the N167R substitution is due to a steric or electrostatic incompatibility with Asn254, then alanine substitution might not cause an activation defect. However, if the N167R substitution removes a favorable interaction between Asn167and Asn254, then alanine substitution should also cause a defect. Because N167Aαs exhibited normal receptor-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 5 C ), the activation defect of N167Rαs appears to be due to a steric or electrostatic incompatibility that is reversed by the N254D substitution. Our analysis of αs mutants with substitutions at the interface of the GTPase and helical domains suggests that interdomain interactions play a role in the bi-directional transmission of signals between receptors and the nucleotide binding site. Interaction between activated receptors and G proteins promotes GTP binding by accelerating GDP release and increasing the relative affinity for GTP compared with GDP (3Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, nucleotide binding decreases the affinity of G proteins for receptors (24Bourne H.R. Kaslow D. Kaslow H.R. Salomon M.R. Licko V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar, 29De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of the homologous αi2residues for four αs residues (Asn254, Met255, Ile257, and Arg258) in switch III of the GTPase domain or of one nearby helical domain residue (Asn167) in the αD/αE loop causes defects in both directions of this communication process. Signal transmission from the receptor to the nucleotide binding site is defective in that the affinities of these αs mutants for GTPγS are unchanged by isoproterenol. Conversely, altered communication between the guanine nucleotide binding pocket and the receptor binding site(s) is demonstrated by high affinity hormone-receptor binding in the presence of 300 μm GTP. Contacts between the αD/αE loop in the helical domain and three regions of the GTPase domain have been implicated as playing a role in receptor-mediated activation. In the heterotrimer-based α subunit model shown in Fig. 6, the helical domain side of the interface “above” the GDP consists of the αD/αE loop. Moving up from the GDP toward the top of the α subunit, the corresponding GTPase side of the interface consists of the β5/αG, β4/α3, and αG/α4 loops. Closest to the GDP, a salt bridge interaction between Asp173 in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the αD/αE loop and Lys293 in the β5/αG loop (Fig. 6, dark blue ) is required for activation by the β-adrenergic receptor and by AlF4−, but not by GTPγS (31Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29339-29342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are highly conserved among α subunits, and Lys293 is located in the NKX D motif, which is important for GTP binding by monomeric GTPases. Mutation of Asp173 increases GTP affinity, consistent with the idea that the mutation “frees” Lys293 from Asp173 to interact with GTP, whereas mutation of Lys293 decreases GTP affinity. Because Asp173and Lys293 are adjacent to the bound guanine nucleotide, they are more directly involved in regulating guanine nucleotide binding than the residues mutated in our study are. The effects of mutating Asp173 and Lys293 on receptor affinity and receptor-dependent changes in GTP affinity have not been determined. Arg258 (Fig. 6, red ) is located further up, in the β4/α3 loop, which includes switch III. Interestingly, a mutation that substitutes tryptophan for Arg258 was found in a patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, and R258Wαs exhibited more severe defects than did R258Aαs. 3D. R. Warner and L. S. Weinstein, personal communication. The defect caused by the R258A substitution is suppressed (Fig.5 A ) by substituting the entire helical domain of αi2 for that of αs in the αsis chimera (Fig. 6), but we have not identified the helical domain residue(s) responsible. In addition to Asn167, there are two other αs residues in the αD/αE loop, Ile172 and Cys174, that differ in the sequences of αs and αi2. Cys174 is not close to Arg258 when modeled onto the heterotrimeric G protein structures (10Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, in the latter structure, the side chains of Ile172 and Arg258 are within ∼4 Å of each other (see Fig. 7). Asn167 (Fig. 6, red ) is located further away from the GDP in the αD/αE loop. The activation defect caused by replacing Asn167 with its αi2 homolog (arginine) is corrected (Fig. 5 B ) by simultaneously replacing Asn254 (Fig. 6, magenta ) in the β4/α3 loop with its αi2 homolog (aspartate). In the α subunit structures, the corresponding residues are hydrogen bonded to each other via the side chain of the residue corresponding to Asn167 and either the side chain (in αt (5Noel J.P.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar)) of the residue corresponding to Asn254 (see Fig. 7). The N254D substitution in αs might correct the defect caused by the N167R substitution via a charge neutralization mechanism. This idea is supported by the fact that all α subunits with an arginine at the position corresponding to Asn167 (αq, α11, α14, α15, α16, and αo) have an aspartate at the position corresponding to Asn254 and by the observation (Fig. 5 C ) that the N167A substitution in αsleaves receptor-mediated activation intact. It is not surprising that the activation defect of N167R/R258Aαs is worse than those of N167Rαs and R258Aαs (Fig. 5), because these residues are not within contact distance. Because the two mutations cause additive defects, the two residues also do not appear to influence each other through electrostatic or steric effects (33Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). We previously found that substitution of αi2 residues for αs residues 304, 305, and 307–311 in the αG/α4 loop (furthest from the nucleotide on the GTPase side of the interface in Fig. 6) disrupts receptor-mediated activation in the context of αs but not αsis (13Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Of the mutated αs residues, only Lys305 and Tyr311 are close to the interface in the structure of αs·GTPγS (32Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although interactions between residues in switch III and the αD/αE loop are important for receptor-mediated activation, the known receptor binding sites of αs, the carboxyl terminus of α5 (13Marsh S.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are not near this interface. α subunits bind to βγ, which is required for receptor-mediated activation, via switches I and II and the amino terminus (10Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 11Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), which are also not near this interface. Thus, receptors initiate activating signals at a significant distance from the domain interface, possibly via an interaction between switches II and III. N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαsexhibit two characteristics in the absence of receptor stimulation that are not normal and that resemble those of wild-type αsupon activation by hormone-bound receptors. They exhibit slightly elevated basal rates of activation (Fig. 3) and somewhat increased basal affinities for GTPγS (Fig. 4). The basal activation rates of these αs mutants, which reflect basal nucleotide exchange rates, are not nearly as elevated as in an αs mutant, A366Sαs, which is both thermolabile and constitutive activated (35Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. Van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, increased rates of basal GDP dissociation in N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs would account for their observed defects in activation by aluminum fluoride, which requires the presence of bound GDP. The defects in guanine nucleotide and receptor binding of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs may be interrelated. For instance, decreased receptor-stimulated GTP binding would stabilize the high affinity hormone-receptor-G protein complex, which forms when the G protein is in the nucleotide-free state. Conversely, higher affinity receptor-G protein interactions could decrease nucleotide binding, because activated receptors can cause dissociation of both GDP and GTP analogs (36Cassel D. Selinger Z. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1977; 3: 11-22PubMed Google Scholar, 37Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, although there are other reported αs mutants with defects in GTP binding and receptor-mediated activation, there is no precedent for an associated increase in receptor affinity. R231Hαs, containing a mutation in the α2 helix (38Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5656-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and S54Nαs, containing a substitution in the α1 helix (39Hildebrandt J.D. Day R. Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4830-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exhibit impaired activation by receptors and AlF4− but can be activated by GTPγS. The affinities of these αs mutants for GTP are decreased upon receptor stimulation. The affinity of R231Hαs for the receptor is normal, and the affinities of S54Nαs and of A366Sαs, which exhibits accelerated GDP release (35Iiri T. Herzmark P. Nakamoto J.M. Van Dop C. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), were not determined. The defect of S54Nαs appears to be due to altered interactions with the bound Mg2+, with which Ser54 interacts. Thus, the activation defects of these αs mutants are distinct from those of N254D/M255L/I257L/R258Aαs and N167Rαs. Further studies will be required to elucidate how the α subunit domain interface mediates communication between the residues responsible for receptor binding and the guanine nucleotide binding pocket. This type of regulation appears to be unique to heterotrimeric G proteins, which interact with seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors, compared with monomeric GTPases, which lack switch III and the helical domain and which utilize different exchange factors.

Treatment of JEA2 cells with interleukin (IL)-7 induces CBLB phosphorylation as well. FL and IL-7, respectively, induce and increase association of tyrosine-phosphorylated SHC and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase with CBLB. In these cells, CBLB constitutively binds the GRB2 adaptor predominantly through its N-terminal SH3 domain, to form a complex that is distinct from the GRB2·CBL and GRB2·SOS1 complexes.

In contrast to the two related receptors, FMS/colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor and KIT, p85PI3K associates with mouse FLT3 at a specific docking site that is located in the C-terminal end of the molecule (14Rottapel R.

Biol. 1994; 40: 443-456PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the two prominent FLT3 substrates in human hematopoietic cell lines are p52SHC and p115CBL(17Lavagna-Sévenier C. Marchetto S. Birnbaum D. Rosnet O. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The CBL protooncogene product is related to the transforming protein of the CAS-NS1 retrovirus that causes pre-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias in mice (18Langdon W. Hartley J. Klinken S. Ruscetti S. Morse III, H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In the past 4 years, CBL has been proven to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors and after engagement of antigen receptors on B and T cells (19Odai H.

Depending on the stimulus and the cell type, CBL binds a number of cytoplasmic enzymatic or regulatory molecules, such as the SYK (24Ota Y. Beitz L. Scharenberg A. Donovan J. Kinet J.-P. Samelson L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6159-6163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently, a gene product highly related to CBL, named CBLB (30Keane M. Rivero-Lezcano O. Mitchell J. Robbins K. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar), was characterized. Interestingly, all structural domains found in CBL are also present in CBLB, including an evolutionary conserved N-terminal region, a RING finger-like motif, a proline rich region, and a putative leuzine zipper at the C terminus. The former region is able to bind the epidermal growth factor receptor and ZAP-70 in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner, and could thus define a new structural unit functionally related to the SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains. CBLB may exist as a full-length protein and as shorter isoforms truncated in their C terminus, thus leading to leucine zipper minus proteins (30Keane M. Rivero-Lezcano O. Mitchell J. Robbins K. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that CBLB is expressed in human hematopoietic cell lines of myeloid and B-lymphoid origins that express endogenous FLT3, and in most acute leukemia and peripheral blood cells. In JEA2 pro-B cells, FL or IL-7 exposure induces CBLB phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, its association with a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules including SHC, and increases binding to p85PI3K. Like CBL, CBLB forms a constitutive and SOS-independent complex with the GRB2 adaptor through SH3-dependent interactions. This is the first demonstration that CBLB is a substrate for cytokine-activated tyrosine kinase(s). LAZ221 cells were obtained from the German Collection of Micro-organisms and Cell Cultures, and THP1 and MCF7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. JEA2 and OCI/AML5 were kind gifts from C. Schiff (Marseille, France) and M. Minden (Toronto, Canada), respectively. All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum. The culture medium of the growth factor-dependent OCI/AML5 was further supplemented with 10% culture supernatant from the bladder carcinoma cell line 5637. Pure (>95%) population of leukemic blast cells were prepared from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of leukemic patients with high blast counts (>50 × 109/liter) by centrifugation on a Ficoll gradient. All samples were obtained from adult patients after informed consent. Leukemic samples were classified according to French-American-British classification (31Bennet J. Catovsky D. Daniel M. Flandrin G. Galton D. Gralnick H. Sultan C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1985; 103: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar) and confirmed by phenotypical analysis. Peripheral blood cells were isolated from blood samples obtained from healthy donors (Centre Régional de Transfusion Sanguine, Marseille, France) and fractionated into lymphocytes and monocytes as described previously (32Birg F. Courcoul M.A. Rosnet O. Bardin F. Pébusque M. Marchetto S. Tabilio A. Mannoni P. Birnbaum D. Blood. 1992; 80: 2584-2593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) and rabbit polyclonal anti-rat p85PI3K were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-human CBL (C-15) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GRB2, anti-SOS1, and anti-SHC monoclonal antibody were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A polyclonal anti-human CBLB antibody was obtained by immunization of rabbits with a 15-mer peptide (REFAFPPPVSPRLNL) that corresponds to the C-terminal amino acids of human CBLB (30Keane M. Rivero-Lezcano O. Mitchell J. Robbins K. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. For immunoprecipitation experiments, an immunopurified goat polyclonal antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz) made available during the course of our study and directed against the same peptide was used. Five μg of anti-CBL or control rabbit immunoglobulins and 4 μl of anti-CBLB or nonimmune rabbit serum were added to the lysates in the presence of protein A-coupled Sepharose, and the mix was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation and discarded. Proteins in the supernatants were then recovered by adding 700 μl of cold acetone, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein-containing pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of lysis buffer plus 25 μl of SDS/2-mercaptoethanol-containing buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis of total cell lysates, cells were starved for 24 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were then stimulated or not with 100 units of Escherichia coli -produced murine FL (3Hannum C. Culpepper J. Campbell D. McClanahan T. Zurawski S. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R. Hudak S. Wagner J.

Nature. 1994; 368: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by DNAX, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 40 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 6 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, heated in SDS/2-mercaptoethanol-containing buffer, and separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were starved, stimulated, and washed as mentioned above. Cells were then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer. RIPA lysis buffer is 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as mentioned above. Clarified cell lysates were incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-CBLB goat antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz) and protein A-coupled Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and then heated in SDS/2-mercaptoethanol-containing loading buffer and separated by PAGE. Polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, St-Quentin-Yvelines, France), and the membranes were probed following the recommendations of the manufacturer with the indicated antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 except for the 4G10 antibody that was diluted in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Anti-CBLB rabbit antiserum was used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies (Dako S.A., Trappes, France) were used for detection. For successive probing of the same membrane with different antibodies, stripping was performed in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 30 min at 50 °C. In peptide inhibition experiments, a CBLB-derived or an irrelevant peptide was added to the Western blotting solution at a concentration of 50 μm. The induction of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins was performed as described previously (33Fournier E. Dubreuil P. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 921-931PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates from nonstimulated or FL-stimulated cells were mixed with 10 μg of recombinant protein on glutathione beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon, and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. GST fusion proteins encoding full-length GRB2 (GST-GRB2) and double SH3 mutant GST-GRB2 49L/203R (named GST-GRB2 μSH3), and isolated amino-GST-GRB2 SH3 domain (residues 1–58) (N-SH3), and the C-terminal GST-GRB2 domain (residues 159–217) (C-SH3), have been described previously (34Gout I.

Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) and are kind gifts of D. Cantrell (London, United Kingdom). To determine whether CBLB could be a substrate for FLT3 or an FLT3-activated tyrosine kinase, we analyzed human hematopoietic cell lines expressing endogenous FLT3 receptors for the presence or absence of product(s) of the CBLB gene. As a first step, we produced an antiserum raised again the C terminus of the full-length CBLB protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The human ductal carcinoma cell line MCF7 was included in the study as a positive control since it was shown to express a 4–5-kilobase CBLB transcript. In immunoblot experiments, this antiserum detected two proteins of approximately 115 and 120 kDa in total cellular lysates of two myeloid (THP1 and OCI/AML5) and two early-B lymphoid (LAZ221 and JEA2) cell lines known to express FLT3 (36Rosnet O. Bühring H.-J. Marchetto S. Rappold I. Lavagna C. Sainty D. Arnoulet C. Chabannon C. Kanz L. Hannum C. Birnbaum D. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 238-248PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to MCF7 (Fig.1 A ). The same membrane was subsequently immunoblotted with an anti-CBL antibody. The presence of a 115-kDa reactive band in all lanes indicated that CBL and CBLB were coexpressed in all cell lines analyzed. A CBLB doublet was also detected in erythroleukemic HEL and promyelocytic HL60 cell lines (data not shown) and in all acute lymphoid leukemia and AML samples tested, in addition to T and B lymphocytes and monocytes from peripheral blood (Fig. 1 B ). Reprobing the membrane with anti-CBL antibody revealed a very similar ubiquitous pattern of expression among leukemic cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Because CBL is a 115-kDa protein that might account for the lower band and because CBL and CBLB immunogenic peptides show weak homologies, the specificity of the antiserum was carefully assessed. First, immunodepletion experiments demonstrated that the rabbit anti-CBLB and anti-CBL antibodies do not show cross-reactivities (Fig.2 A ). Second, incubation in the presence of the immunizing peptide suppressed the CBLB doublet but not the CBL-reactive 115-kDa band (Fig. 2 B ). In the subsequent experiments, we used this anti-CBLB rabbit antiserum for Western blot analysis and a commercial CBLB-specific goat antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”) for immunoprecipitation, respectively. To know if CBLB was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FL stimulation, in a manner similar to CBL (17Lavagna-Sévenier C. Marchetto S. Birnbaum D. Rosnet O. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), CBLB was immunoprecipitated from nonactivated and FL-activated THP1 and JEA2 cells, run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.3, CBLB was phosphorylated at a low to undetectable level in nonstimulated cells, but was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after 5 min of FL stimulation. We subsequently used only JEA2 cells because they show more CBLB expression and FL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation than THP1 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CBLB in response to FL was analyzed in a time-course experiment. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CBLB was very rapid, reached a maximal intensity between 2 and 5 min, and then decreased to nearly basal level at 30 min (Fig. 4). Coprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at 85, 50, and 55 kDa showed the same kinetic of phosphorylation. A 160-kDa phosphoprotein that may be FLT3 could be seen at 15 min but was no more detectable after 60 min (data not shown). Subsequent stripping and reprobing of the membrane with various antibodies recognizing signal-transducing molecules demonstrated a strong and transient association of CBLB with p52SHC. Since p52SHC comigrates with pp55, SHC is likely to bind CBLB in its tyrosine-phosphorylated form. Blotting with anti-p85PI3K antibody indicated that p85PI3K weakly bind CBLB in unstimulated cells, and that this association was transiently increased following FL stimulation. Direct immunoprecipitation showed that p85PI3K was not phosphorylated on tyrosine after FL stimulation of JEA2 cells (data not shown) and did not correspond to the pp85 observed in anti-CBLB immunoprecipitates. Finally, we demonstrated constitutive binding of the GRB2 adaptor to CBLB. Because FL plus IL-7 is the most efficient cytokine combination to promote pro-B cells development in vitro , we next analyzed the effect of IL-7 alone or combined with FL on CBLB phosphorylation and associated proteins in JEA2 cells. Fig. 5shows that IL-7 induced CBLB phosphorylation and association with SHC and p85PI3K in a manner very similar to FL, albeit less intense. No particular change was observed when FL and IL-7 were added together, as compared with FL used alone. To determine the contribution of individual SH2 and SH3 domains of GRB2 to the association with CBLB, we did in vitro mixing experiments using bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins. Full-length GRB2 was able to bind p115 and p120CBLB products in nonstimulated and FL-activated JEA2 cells (Fig. 6 A ). Among individual SH domains, only the N-terminal SH3 domain of GRB2 bound CBLB (Fig.6 A ). Binding to CBL showed the same domain requirement, as evidenced by subsequent blotting of the same membrane with an anti-CBL antibody. Association of GRB2 with SOS1, CBL, and CBLB primarily depends on its N-terminal SH3 domain (see Refs. 23Donovan J. Wange R. Langdon W. Samelson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 37Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, and preceding paragraph) and CBL·GRB2 and SOS1·GRB2 complexes are distinct (26Meisner H. Conway B. Hartley D. Czech M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38Brizzi M. Dentelli P. Lanfrancone L. Rosso A. Pelicci P.G. Pegoraro L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2067-2076PubMed Google Scholar). To extend this observation to CBLB-containing complexes, we did immunoblot analysis of anti-SOS1, anti-CBL and anti-CBLB immunoprecipitates obtained from nonactivated and FL-activated JEA2 cells. Results shown in Fig. 6 B indicate that no cellular SOS1 proteins were present in anti-CBL and anti-CBLB complexes from JEA2 cells. In addition, the anti-CBL immunoblot of the membrane showed no CBL proteins in anti-SOS1 and in anti-CBLB immunoprecipitates from JEA2 cells. Considering the comparable GRB2 contents in anti-CBL, anti-CBLB, and anti-SOS1 immunoprecipitates, we concluded that most if not all CBL, CBLB, and SOS1 molecules were complexed to different pools of GRB2 proteins. FL stimulation did not affect the preformed complexes. CBLB is a recently characterized molecule closely related to the product of the CBL protooncogene (30Keane M. Rivero-Lezcano O. Mitchell J. Robbins K. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar). CBLB and CBL share structural domains including a basic N-terminal region, a RING finger, a proline-rich domain, and a putative leucine zipper. CBL is a cytoplasmic protein that can associate with cellular structures such as the trans-Golgi region and the cytoskeleton (21Tanaka S. Neff N. Baron R. Levy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 39Blake T. Heath K. Langdon W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, extensive studies have shown that CBL is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to most, if not all, stimuli involving activation of cellular tyrosine kinases, indicating that it could play a central role in controlling signal transduction pathways (40Langdon W. Aust. N. Z. J. Med. 1996; 25: 859-864Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CBL is constitutively complexed to the GRB2 adaptor through proline-rich/SH3 domain-dependent interactions (19Odai H.

Kim Y.-T. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27504-27509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Meisner H. Conway B. Hartley D. Czech M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6159-6163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) proteins in an SH2/phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. Despite this, the precise role(s) of CBL are not known, with the recent exception that CBL inhibition blocks SRC-dependent bone resorption (41Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We have found that CBL is a major tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate following activation of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase (17Lavagna-Sévenier C. Marchetto S. Birnbaum D. Rosnet O. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine whether CBLB could also be involved in FLT3 signaling. As a first step, we produced CBLB-specific antibodies by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the 15 CBLB C-terminal residues. This antiserum was able to detect a protein doublet of 115/120 kDa in cellular lysates of cell lines known to express FLT3, and in MCF7 breast cancer cells, previously shown to express high quantities of CBLB transcripts (30Keane M. Rivero-Lezcano O. Mitchell J. Robbins K. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length CBLB has a predicted M r of 104.774. The apparentM r seen on gel are higher. This difference is likely to result from a high proline content (12.5%) of CBLB, a feature that can maintain secondary structures in denaturating conditions. It is presently not known if the two CBLB polypeptides result from post-translational modification of the same primary product, such as phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues, or if they correspond to isoforms. Two CBLB shorter isoforms, encoded by variant mRNA, lacking 172 and 213 C-terminal amino acids exist (30Keane M. Rivero-Lezcano O. Mitchell J. Robbins K. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar) but cannot account for the proteins observed on gel, as the immunizing epitope is absent from these two proteins. Activation of FLT3 by FL leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of CBLB in THP1 monocytic and JEA2 pro-B cells. The relative contribution of the two observed CBLB proteins to the total phosphorylation could not be estimated because of the close proximity of the two bands, relative to the intensity of the tyrosine phosphorylation signal. The extensive conservation between CBL and CBLB suggests that CBLB, like CBL, is able to form supramolecular complexes with a number of components of the signaling machinery. Indeed, this work shows, for the first time, that it is the case. The association of CBL with GRB2 and p85PI3K are differentially modulated following stimulation of the B and T cell antigen receptors (19Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3780-3787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, CBLB binds GRB2 in a constitutive manner, which is not modified after FL stimulation. The SOS1-derived proline-rich peptide VPPPVPPRRR binds to GRB2 SH3 domains (37Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) and is very similar to the sequence SLPPVPPRLD found at position 492 and 503 in CBL and CBLB, respectively. The existence of this site on the two latter proteins is likely to explain their association with GRB2. The binding preference of CBL and CBLB for the N-terminal GRB2 SH3 domain suggests that similar proline-rich sequences, including the one mentioned above, mediate the CBL/CBLB binding to GRB2. CBL and CBLB do not associate with SOS1 in vivo despite a quantitatively similar GRB2 content in anti-CBL, anti-CBLB, and anti-SOS1 immunoprecipitates. This confirms that SOS1 and CBL are prominently present in distinct GRB2-containing complexes and extends this observation to CBLB. This indicates that CBL and CBLB may together regulate the RAS pathway by competing SOS1 for binding to GRB2. CBL is a major phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-associated cytoplasmic protein, for example in cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (27Soltoff S. Cantley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). 731YEAM in CBL was recently demonstrated to mediate phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase binding (44Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this site is not conserved in CBLB. In consequence, CBLB binding to p85PI3K might be indirect or mostly SH3-dependent. As CBLB is tyrosine-phosphorylated, at least in response to FLT3 and IL-7 receptor activation, molecules that inducibly and directly bind CBLB through SH2-dependent interactions remain to be found. A number of previous reports have demonstrated GRB2-mediated SHC binding to CBL (20Wang W. Yeung Y.-G. Langdon W. Stanley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Brizzi M. Dentelli P. Lanfrancone L. Rosso A. Pelicci P.G. Pegoraro L.

We demonstrate here that tyrosine-phosphorylated p52SHC also binds CBLB, probably via GRB2 as well. The functional significance of the recruitment of SHC to CBL and CBLB is presently unknown. In view of their similarity with Sli1 (46Yoon C. Lee J. Jongeward G. Sternberg P. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and D-CBL (47Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which act as negative regulators of epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated transduction pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans andDrosophila melanogaster , respectively, CBL and CBLB may act to terminate proliferation induced by various growth factors and cytokines. However, only the N-terminal portion including the RING finger, is present in Sli1 and D-CBL, raising the possibility that CBL and CBLB have retained a functional protein-protein interaction domain, but may have different, if not divergent biological functions. In mammalian cells, recent reports have shown that CBL can behave as an effector (41Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) or a repressor (48Ota Y. Samelson L. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) of tyrosine-dependent signaling pathways. This underlines the multifunctionality of CBL and possibly of CBLB as well. Because of CBLB, together with CBL, is expressed in PBL and leukemic cells of lymphoid and myeloid origins, it is probably involved in a large number of tyrosine-kinase-regulated signaling processes in hematopoietic cells. We believe that tightly balanced CBLversus CBLB levels and/or compartmentalization may have a biological significance. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that CBLB, like CBL, is a substrate for activated tyrosine kinase(s) and can bind to GRB2 and p85PI3K, in addition to a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including SHC. It is likely that CBLB participates in tyrosine kinase-regulated pathways in hematopoietic progenitors and more mature cells of the lympho-hematopoietic system. We are grateful to C. Mawas for critical reading of the manuscript. Leukemic samples were kindly provided by D. Sainty and G. Cohen, and GST-GRB2 fusion proteins were kind gifts of D. Cantrell. We also thank E.

In parallel, cell growth is retarded. We have transfected HT-29 M6 cells with an activated form of the conventional protein kinase Cα (cPK-Cα). Expression of this isoform induced the acquisition of a scattered phenotype, similar to that adopted by cells after addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, with very low cell-to-cell aggregation and undetectable levels of functional E-cadherin. These cell clones were highly motile and rapidly invaded embryonic chick heart fragments. Furthermore, cells expressing activated-cPK-Cα showed decreased proliferation in comparison to control clones. We have also studied how these two apparently antagonistic changes affect the tumorigenic ability of HT-29 M6 cells. When the different cell clones were xenografted into athymic mice, the effect on cell growth seemed to predominate. Expression of activated-cPK-Cα significantly reduced the size of the tumors; the cells with the highest level of expression did not even form subcutaneous tumors. Besides their smaller size, the morphology of these tumors was clearly different from those originated by HT-29 M6 cells, and they could be defined as infiltrative on anatomo-pathological basis. These results indicate that cPK-Cα controls both cell-to-cell adhesion and proliferation of intestinal cells.

These results indicate that cPK-Cα controls both cell-to-cell adhesion and proliferation of intestinal cells. Unveiling the mechanisms that control establishment and maintenance of intercellular contacts in the epithelium of the intestine is essential to understanding colon carcinogenesis. There is considerable evidence that protein kinase C (PK-C) 1The abbreviations used are: PK-C, protein kinase C; Gf, PK-C inhibitor GF109203X; Go, PK-C inhibitor Go 6976; cPK-C, conventional PK-C; nPK-C, atypical PK-C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. 1The abbreviations used are: PK-C, protein kinase C; Gf, PK-C inhibitor GF109203X; Go, PK-C inhibitor Go 6976; cPK-C, conventional PK-C; nPK-C, atypical PK-C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator. isoforms are involved in this process; for example, addition of the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) has been shown to reduce cell-to-cell contacts in epithelial cells (1Ojakian G.K. Cell. 1981; 23: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This compound has been widely used to activate PK-C in cells because it is membrane-permeable and causes a maintained stimulation of most members of this extended family (cPK-C and nPK-C) (2Dekker L.V. Palmer R.H. Parker P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 5: 396-402Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Newton A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Addition of PMA to intestinal cell subpopulations derived from HT-29 cells, like its addition to many other epithelial cell lines, causes a striking alteration in their morphology and induces scattering of cell colonies (4Fabre M. Garcia de Herreros A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 513-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process is characterized by the acquisition of a more fibroblastic phenotype, with lower cell-to-cell adhesion and inactivated E-cadherin (4Fabre M. Garcia de Herreros A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 513-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Skoudy A. Llosas M.M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In parallel, addition of this compound retards cell growth, an effect that has also been observed in other intestinal cells (6Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our group have shown that cell scattering can also be induced by thymeleatoxin, a specific activator of conventional PK-Cs (cPK-Cs) (7Llosas M.M. Batlle E. Coll O. Skoudy A. Fabre M. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to identify the PK-C isoform involved in these events and determine whether activation of this isoform in intestinal cells lead to altered tumorigenic properties of HT-29 M6 cells (HT-29 cell subpopulation isolated using 10−6methotrexate) in vivo . PMA, leupeptin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were supplied by Sigma. Gelatin and plasminogen were from Merck and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. PK-C inhibitors GF109203X (Gf) and Go 6976 (Go) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); these products were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored protected from light at −40 °C. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal antibodies against cPK-Cα and E-cadherin (HECD-1) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), respectively. Prestained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA). All of the oligonucleotides used in our assays were synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The properties of the cell line used in this study HT-29 M6 (M6), originally characterized with the name of HT-29 (10−6 methotrexate), have been extensively described (8Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6334-6343PubMed Google Scholar,9Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Luccioni C. Beaumatin J. Clair M. Kornowski A. Dussaulx E. Dutrillaux B. Zweibaum A. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 115: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104cells/cm2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (5Skoudy A. Llosas M.M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Experiments of scattering were performed using cells 4–5 days after plating, when they were 40–50% confluent. Human cPK-Cα was obtained from ATCC. Mutation of the alanine situated in position 25 to glutamic acid (A25E) was carried out according to the method of Kunkel et al. (10Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.A. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar), using the oligo 5′-CCCGCAAAGGGGAGCTCAGGCAGAAG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 89–114 of the sequence of human cPK-Cα). In addition to the change C to A (position 102, in bold), required to replace Ala with Glu, the G present in position 106 was mutated to a C (underlined); this second silent mutation generates a restriction site for Sac I, which is useful to recognize the mutated cDNA. The presence of the mutations in the final construction was verified by sequencing using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Mutated cPK-Cα, denominated cPK-Cα(+), was inserted in the Not I site of pOPRSV expression plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and transfected to M6 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) under the conditions indicated by the manufacturer. After 21 days of selection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with G-418 (0.6 mg/ml) (Sigma), resistant clones were isolated. As a control, transfection of HT-29 M6 with pOPRSV plasmid without insert was performed; two clones resistant to G-418 were isolated and analyzed. RNA was obtained from the different clones using the guanidium thiocyanate method (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 1: 156-159Crossref Scopus (62898) Google Scholar), treated with DNase I, and reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers. This cDNA was first analyzed by PCR with oligos A1 (5′-TGGACAAACTACCTACAGAGATT-3′) and A2 (5′-TCCCAAACCCCCAGATGAAGTCG-3′); oligo A1 corresponds to nucleotides 2638–2660 of pOPRSV, a sequence located downstream from the transcription start point; oligo A2 corresponds to nucleotides 211–189 of cPK-Cα. To verify the specificity of the amplification, the 275-base pair product of amplification was subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to a Nylon-membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and blotted with oligo B1 (5′-GGACCATGGCTGACGTTTTC-3′, nucleotides 23–42 of cPK-Cα) labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. In order to compare the relative expression of the mutated and wild-type forms of cPK-Cα, the cDNA was amplified quantitatively with oligos B1 and B2 (5′-ACAGCAAACTTGGACTGGAA-3′, nucleotides 239–220), which flank the mutation. The product of the PCR was digested with Sac I and analyzed as above using oligo A2 labeled with 32P. After treatment with Sac I, wild-type cPK-Cα generated a fragment of 217 base pairs; the mutated cDNA generated a fragment of 142 base pairs. As a control, the cDNA was subjected to 20 cycles of amplification using two oligonucleotides specific for human actin (sequences 10–30 and 358–338). Invasiveness into embryonic chick heart fragments was assayed following the method of Mareel et al. (12Mareel M. Kint J. Meyvisch C. Virchows Arch. B. Cell Pathol. 1979; 30: 95-111Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, heart fragments of 9-day-old chick embryos were dissected and incubated for 2 days in an orbital shaker set at 100 rpm at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Precultured heart fragments with a diameter of 0.5 mm were selected under a stereomicroscope. Cell suspensions were brought into contact with precultured heart fragments placed on semisolid agar medium. After incubation for 8 h at 37 °C to allow the cells to attach to the external fibroblastic layer of precultured heart fragments, individual confrontations were transferred to 5-ml Erlenmeyer flasks for further incubation in an orbital shaker (120 rpm) at 37 °C. After 1–4 days, confrontations were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy. Cell confrontations were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, treated with 2% OsO4, and dehydrated washing in ascending series of graded ethanol (once in 50%, once in 70%, twice in 95%, and five times in 100% ethanol). Cells were then embedded in Spur resin (TAAB Laboratories, Aldermaston, United Kingdom). For light microscopy, semithin sections were cut with a LKB ultramicrotome and stained with toluidine blue. For transmission electron microscopy, ultrathin sections of 500–800 Å were placed on uncoated 300-mesh copper grids prior to staining with uranyl acetate (5% in absolute ethanol) and lead citrate and viewed at original magnifications from 4500 to 15,000 in a Hitachi H700 transmission electron microscope operated at 75 kV. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Tumorigenic ability was determined by inoculation of 1 × 106cells in the subcutis of 5-week-old athymic female nude mice (Criffa, Barcelona, Spain). Viability of the uninjected cells, determined at the end of the process, always exceeded 95%. Tumors were followed externally. After 6 weeks, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the site of the injection, as well as the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes, was examined. Tissues were fixed, embedded in paraffin, and analyzed under the microscope after hematoxylin-eosin staining. Activity of plasminogen activators was determined by zymography. Conditioned medium from cells cultured for 24 h in the absence of fetal bovine serum (10%) was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Sample volumes were adjusted on the basis of protein concentration in the corresponding cell lysate, and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in plasminogen and gelatin-containing gels, as described elsewhere (13Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). Protease activity was revealed by incubating the gels in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h followed by incubation in 0.1 m glycine, pH 8.3, overnight at 37 °C. After fixing of proteins with methanol/acetic acid/water (30:10:60), gels were stained with 0.1% Amido Black and destained. To determine cell dissociation, the assay developed by Nagafuchi et al. (14Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) was used, with the modifications described previously (7Llosas M.M. Batlle E. Coll O. Skoudy A. Fabre M. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The extent of dissociation was represented by the indexN TC/N TE, whereN TC and N TE are the total particle number after treatment of cells with trypsin in the presence or absence of calcium, respectively. E-cadherin association to the cytoskeleton was determined analyzing by Western blot the presence of this protein in Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions, prepared as described by Nelson and co-workers (15Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were quantified by scanning densitometry (Hoefer GS-300 Scanning Densitometer). We have previously reported that PMA induces remarkable morphological changes in M6 cultures (4Fabre M. Garcia de Herreros A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 513-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After addition of this phorbol ester, M6 colonies scatter, and cells acquire a fibroblastic aspect. These effects are observed shortly after the addition of this phorbol ester at concentrations as low as 20 nm. Among the properties altered by PMA, cells lose homotypic adhesion, and concomitantly, E-cadherin is inactivated (5Skoudy A. Llosas M.M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These effects of PMA are prevented if the cells are simultaneously incubated with the PK-C inhibitor Gf (2 μm) (7Llosas M.M. Batlle E. Coll O. Skoudy A. Fabre M. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gf is a bisindolymaleimide derivative that selectively inhibits PK-C isoforms; in vitro , it shows a ranked order of potency of cPK-Cs > nPK-Cs > atypical PK-Cs (16Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marmé D. Schachtle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, the action of PMA on cell scattering, homotypic adhesion, or E-cadherin inactivation was blocked by similar concentrations of Gf. The minimal dose of Gf required to prevent morphological scattering induced by PMA was 0.5 μm; in the presence of this concentration, cells incubated with PMA presented a similar phenotype to untreated controls (not shown). The effect on this inhibitor on the loss of homotypic adhesion was also estimated; IC50 was obtained with approximately 70 nm Gf, a concentration lower than the IC50 for nPK-Cs δ or ε activities (210 and 130 nm, respectively), determined byin vitro protein kinase assays. Concomitantly with the effect on homotypic aggregation, low doses of Gf (0.5 μm) PMA also blocks the decrease in E-cadherin-associated to cytoskeleton caused by PMA (Table I).Table IInhibition by Gf and Go of the effects of PMA on M6 cellsAdditions to the cellsScattering1-aCell scattering was examined under the phase contrast microscope by two independent researchers after 6 h of incubation; scattering was evaluated as ++ (more than 90% of the colonies showed cells migrating out), + (20–90% of the colonies showed cell dispersion), +/− (cells flattened but did not move) or − (cells did not migrate and presented a phenotype very similar to untreated cells.Homotypic adhesion1-bHomotypic adhesion (N TC/N TE index) was calculated by counting the number of cell particles after trypsinisation in the presence (N TC) or absence (N TE) of Ca2+.

Open table in a new tab M6 cells, grown in complete medium (DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum) for 5 days after seeding were incubated in the presence of PMA (100 nm) and inhibitors. Recently, the preparation of a selective inhibitor of cPK-Cs with respect to nPK-C or atypical PK-C has been described (16Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marmé D. Schachtle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro , this compound, Go, displays high activity against cPK-Cs α and β (with IC50 values of 2.5 and 6.2 nm, respectively) whereas no effect was observed on nPK-Cs ε or δ or or atypical PK-Cζ even at micromolar concentrations (16Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marmé D. Schachtle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In M6 cells, Go blocked the action of PMA on the three parameters studied (Table I), although the doses required were considerably higher than those of Gf. This difference could be explained by a lower ability to penetrate the cells; although the activity of Go and Gf have been studied in vitro , their relative potency in whole cells has not been characterized. However, even the highest concentration of Go used in our assays did not inhibit nPK-Cε activity in vitro (data not shown). The use of these inhibitors suggests that a cPK-C is responsible for triggering the process of scattering and loss of cell-to-cell adhesion. We have previously described that the only cPK-C expressed in HT-29 M6 cells is cPK-Cα (7Llosas M.M. Batlle E. Coll O. Skoudy A. Fabre M. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The presence of cPK-Cα, and not of cPK-Cs β or γ, was demonstrated both by Western blot with specific monoclonal antibodies and by reverse transcription-PCR analysis, using two oligos corresponding to consensus sequences of these three isoforms. Therefore, to prove the role of cPK-Cα in cell scattering, we have overexpressed this isoform in M6 cells. A mutation in the pseudosubstrate domain of cPK-Cα was performed in order to obtain a higher basal activity of this enzyme in the absence of external activators. This mutation consists of the replacement of Ala (residue 25) present in the central position of the pseudosubstrate by a charged Glu residue. This substitution, A25E, activates cPK-Cα because it reduces the affinity of the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate peptide for the catalytic site (17Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although considerably more active in the absence of effectors than the wild-type enzyme, this mutated cPK-Cα, denominated cPK-Cα(+), can be further activated by the addition of PMA and phospholipids (17Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Four different cPK-Cα(+) transfectant clones were selected and analyzed in detail; these four clones summarized the different phenotypes obtained in our experiments. One of the clones (A1) presented a phenotype identical to control M6 (Fig. 1) and a similar sensitivity to PMA (not shown). Clone A2 showed a phenotype slightly less compact than control cells; the two other clones (A3 and A4) presented the phenotype previously defined as “scattered” to different extents. A3 cells formed colonies composed of flattened cells, with a low number of cell-to-cell contacts, whereas the phenotype of A4 cells was almost identical to that displayed by M6 chronically treated with PMA. In parallel, a transfection with a control plasmid that did not contain insert was performed; all of the clones observed presented a morphology identical to HT-29 M6 cells (not shown), and two of these clones (C1 and C2) were isolated and used as negative controls in our studies. Addition of the PK-C inhibitor Gf to clone A2 or A3 induced the formation of colonies identical to control cells; reversion by Gf, although important, was not complete in M6 cells chronically treated with PMA or in A4 cells (Fig. 1). Because the mutant cPK-Cα is not fully activated by the mutation and can be further stimulated by addition of PMA, we analyzed the sensitivity of the clones to the phorbol ester. Clones A2, A3, and A4 were sensitive to doses of PMA that did not induce scattering of any of the control clones; for instance, A2 cell colonies dispersed in response to 5–10 nm phorbol ester, a 4-fold lower dose than that required with control cells (Fig. 1, bottom row ). In A4 and A3 cells, the addition of PMA induced the acquisition of an extremely stretched phenotype, characterized by long cellular extensions (Fig. 1,bottom row ). The expression of the mutant cPK-Cα was analyzed by RT-PCR; only clones A2, A3, and A4, but not A1 or the controls, showed expression of the mutant cPK-Cα(+) transcript (Fig.2). Although the amplification was only semiquantitative, the rank of expression could be established as A4 > A3 > A2, demonstrating a correlation between expression of cPK-Cα(+) and cell scattering. Taking advantage of the new restriction site created with the mutation, the relative amounts of the wild-type and mutant forms were determined; only A4 presented levels of cPK-Cα(+) transcript higher than those of the wild-type form. Because activation of cPK-Cα leads, in many cases, to down-regulation of this enzyme, determinations of total levels of this protein were not informative. However, the levels of other PMA-responsive PK-C isoforms were analyzed in transfectant clones by Western blot, to verify whether the higher sensitivity to PMA was due to increased synthesis of PK-Cs other than PK-Cα. We did not detect any increase in the levels or change in localization of the nPK-Cs ε and η in the cPK-Cα(+)-transfectant clones, nor was cPK-Cβ, absent in M6, induced in these cells (data not shown). In order to measure the endogenous activity of cPK-Cα, we employed an indirect assay: the analysis of expression of a gene containing phorbol ester-response elements. This method has been used previously by other authors with this goal (17Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Muramatsu M. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The gene used in these studies was the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA); the promoter of this gene contains several phorbol-ester responsive elements, and its expression is greatly stimulated by activation of several PK-C isoforms (19Rorth P. Nerlov C. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5009-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Reifel-Miller A.E. Conarty D.M. Valasek K.M. Iversen P.W. Burns D.J. Birch K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21666-21671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to analyze endogenous cPK-Cα activity in the M6 cells and in the clones transfected with cPK-Cα(+), expression of uPA was determined by zymography. This method estimates the activity of uPA, a parameter that correlates with its expression. M6 or control clones (C1 and C2) presented very low levels of plasminogen activators. High levels of a protease activity with a molecular mass of 54 kDa, corresponding to uPA, were observed in the supernatant of these cells chronically treated with PMA (Fig. 3). A1 or A2 cells did not show significant levels of uPA; the presence of this activity was detected in A3 cells and, to a much greater extent, in A4 cells, where it was a level similar to that seen in M6 cells incubated with PMA (Fig. 3). These data allow us to rank the cells in terms of cPK-Cα activity as A4 ≫ A3 > A2 = controls. Scattering is associated with an increase in the mobility of cells. To determine whether expression of cPK-Cα enhanced mobility, a wound was inflicted in the epithelial monolayer, and the ability of the cells to fill the gap was determined. After 24 h, control M6 cells had not moved into the denuded area (Fig.4). Incubation with 100 nmPMA but not with 10 nm PMA induced the cells to significantly fill the free space. Expression of cPK-Cα(+) correlated with the extent of the healing; A4 cells showed higher mobility than A3, and these in turn showed higher mobility than A2. A2 and A3 were sensitive to low doses of PMA (10 nm) that did not induce the movement of M6 cells (Fig. 4). Besides the modification of other cellular properties, scattering requires the loss of homotypic aggregation. In M6 cells, the decrease in this parameter is concomitant with the inactivation of E-cadherin (5Skoudy A. Llosas M.M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, as expected, clones A3 and A4 showed dissociation indexes much higher than M6 cells or the control clones analyzed (A1, C1, and C2) (Table II). These indexes were very similar to that calculated for HT-29 M6 cells incubated in the presence of PMA. Clone A2 presented an index not significantly different from control cells, but these cells were much more sensitive to the addition of PMA (Table II). Very similar results were obtained when the function of E-cadherin was studied. Inactivation of this protein (loss of the association to the cytoskeleton) is reflected by an increase in its solubility in Triton X-100 (15Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In untreated M6 cells and in the control clones, approximately 35% of total E-cadherin was insoluble in Triton X-100 (Fig. 5). However, in long-term PMA-treated cells or in A3 and A4 cells, the level of E-cadherin present in this fraction, which corresponds to the functional E-cadherin, was barely detectable (Fig. 5). The"

These members of the serpentine receptor superfamily transduce the signals of proinflammatory chemokines. The physiologic effects on the directed migration of leukocytes are mediated through linkage to guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins) (reviewed in Ref. 8Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev.

In contrast, the precise mechanism for their role as coreceptors in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion has not been fully elucidated, although some insights into structure-function relationships and the consequences of Env-coreceptor interactions have been gleaned. Whereas virtually all Env glycoproteins can associate with CD4 (9Platt E.J. Madani N. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. J.

T-tropic strains spawned late in the evolution of AIDS predominantly use CXCR4 (20Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A.

There is emerging evidence that dual tropic viruses, which exhibit a more promiscuous utilization of coreceptors (16Doranz B.J. Rucker J. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Samson M. Peiper S.C. Parmentier M. Collman R.G. Doms R.W. Cell. 1996; 85: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar), represent intermediates in this evolution (11Connor R.I. Sheridan K.E.

Fusion of the viral and target cell membranes is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein in many viral systems, including HIV (reviewed in Ref. 22White J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 675-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). During this process, Env undergoes a dramatic change in conformation that ultimately results in exposure of the fusion peptide of gp41, enabling it to interact directly with the plasma membrane of the target cell. The association of gp120 with CD4 elicits the unmasking of cryptic epitopes in the former (23Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 24Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7383-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this activated configuration cannot effect fusion. The structure of this complex is, however, permissive for association of Env with a cognate coreceptor, which triggers the former to assume a fusogenic conformation. Thus, it is likely that it is the binding of coreceptors to the activated form of Env that leads to mobilizing the exposure of the fusion peptide of gp41. To this end, a complex of soluble CD4 and a T-tropic Env has been reported to coimmunoprecipitate with CXCR4 (25Lapham C.K. Ouyang J. Chandrasekhar B. Nguyen N.Y. Dimitrov D.S. Golding H. Science. 1996; 274: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and a similar trimolecular complex containing CCR5 has been demonstrated with M-tropic Env in ligand binding experiments (26Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J.

Furthermore, it is clear from experiments with chimeric receptors and point mutants that there is differential utilization of CCR5 by virus strains, with dual tropic viruses being more sensitive to changes in CCR5 than M-tropic strains (33Doranz B.J.

Since ECL2 of CXCR4 is also crucial for coreceptor function for T-tropic Env, it may play a pivotal role in coreceptor function in the evolving spectrum from M-tropism to T-tropism. This domain has a net positive charge in CCR5 and a net negative charge CXCR4. The primary structural basis for the requirement of ECL2 of CXCR4 for coreceptor activity was investigated to gain insight into the mechanism of Env-mediated fusion.

While no individual charged residue or cluster was critical for coreceptor activity with the IIIB or 89.6 Env, removal of a single, specific acidic residue from this domain conferred coreceptor activity with an array of Env from M-tropic strains without significantly altering this function for T-tropic or dual tropic Env. These findings provide further insight into the complexity of the interaction between gp120 and coreceptors during the progression of infection and furnish a model coreceptor system that could be widely applicable to the study of HIV-1 entry into target cells and to virally mediated gene therapy of AIDS. Constructs encoding wild type CXCR4 and CCR5 in the pcDNA3 vector described previously were used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis using the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Clones containing the programmed mutation(s) were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of the targeted region, and the nucleotide sequence of the entire open reading frame was confirmed prior to analysis in fusion assays to exclude the possible introduction of extraneous mutations. A chimeric receptor containing the N-terminal extracellular domain of CCR5 and the complementary region of CXCR4, designated 5444, and a battery of chimeras composed of CXCR4 and CXCR2, both of which were prepared by polymerase chain reaction-ligation-polymerase chain reaction as described previously, were also used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis (34Lu Z.-H.

Briefly, constructs encoding the candidate coreceptor, CD4, and luciferase under the transcriptional control of a T7 promoter were cotransfected into the QT6 cell line using calcium phosphate precipitation. 16–18 h post-transfection, the transfectants were mixed with either HeLa or QT6 effector cells in which the expression of HIV-1 Env and T7 polymerase was directed using a vaccinia virus system (37Broder C.C.

Eight hours following mixing of the effector and target cells, the supernatant medium was aspirated, and detergent lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using a LucLite luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Packard Instrument Co.) in a Top Count luminometer (Packard Instrument Co.).

Viral stocks were prepared as described previously by infecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding the IIIB, ADA, or BaL Env proteins and the NL4–3 luciferase virus backbone (48Chen B.K. Saksela K.

U87-MG target cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding CD4 and wild type or mutant coreceptors. Following incubation for 24 h to permit transient expression, the cells were infected with viral stocks in the presence of 4 μg of polybrene/ml in a total volume of 500 μl. Three days postinfection, an additional 0.5 ml of medium was added. Four days postinfection, the cells were harvested by resuspension in 150 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and 50–75-μl aliquots were assayed for luciferase activity using commercial reagents (Promega, Madison, WI) in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta luminometer. The expression of chemokine receptor chimeras and point mutants on the surface of transfectants was measured by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies to CXCR4 (12G5), CCR5 (12D1 and R&D 45529; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and CXCR2 (10H2). Cells were stained at room temperature with the appropriate monoclonal antibody, washed, incubated with a secondary antibody labeled with phycoerythrin, and analyzed using an Elite flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Miami, FL). Previous studies using CXCR4/CXCR2 chimeras have demonstrated the importance of ECL2 of CXCR4 in coreceptor activity with Env glycoproteins encoded by IIIB (T-tropic) and 89.6 (dual tropic) (34Lu Z.-H. Berson J. Cen Y.-H. Turner J.D. Zhang T.-Y. Sharron M. Jenks M.H. Wang Z.-X. Kin J. Rucker J. Hoxie J.A. Peiper S.C. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6426-6431Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In order to dissect the motifs that are involved in this function, an aggressive mutagenesis strategy was initially focused on charged amino acid residues in ECL2 and adjacent transmembrane-spanning helices. Alanine (Ala) scanning mutagenesis was performed to identify charged residues in this domain of CXCR4 that may be involved in the interaction with dual tropic and T-tropic envelope glycoproteins. This loop contains 5 acidic and 2 basic amino acid residues, and the fourth transmembrane-spanning domain (tm4) contains 1 acidic residue, as depicted in Fig.1. Variants were prepared in which the charged residues were individually converted to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Fusion coreceptor activity of the Ala-scanning mutants with IIIB and 89.6 Env glycoproteins did not differ significantly from that of the wild type receptor (data not shown), indicating that no single residue was critical to coreceptor activity. There was a suggestion that removal Glu-179 and Asp-182 may result in a subtle but consistent enhancement of coreceptor activity. Since 6 of 13 residues in the proximal region of ECL2 of CXCR4 are charged, it was reasoned that several may contribute to a structure that interacts with Env. To test this possibility, variants in which multiple charged residues were converted to neutral ones were prepared and analyzed for coreceptor function (data not shown). Glu-179 was replaced with Gln in order to maintain potential hydrophilic boundaries of tm4 while removing the net charge. CXCR4-E179Q/D181A/D182N showed a moderate decrease in utilization by IIIB and 89.6. The conversion of Asp-187 and Lys-188 to Ala, with or without D193A, did not have a dramatic effect on coreceptor activity. Surprisingly, a variant in which all acidic and one of the basic (Arg-189) residues were converted to neutral amino acids (E179Q/D181A/D182N/R188A/D193A) retained significant coreceptor activity with IIIB (∼50%) and 89.6 (∼25%). The absence of a significant impact of remodeling the conformation of ECL2 by the removal of 6 of 7 charged amino acids on the fusion cofactor activity for dual tropic and T-tropic Env suggests that they are not directly involved in the structure that associates with Env. To test the possibility that noncharged residues participate in this structure, Phe-189 and Tyr-190 were replaced with Ala, and a hydrophobic stretch in the distal portion of ECL2 was interrupted by converting Val-197 to Asn. Neither of these mutations significantly altered fusion coreceptor function with IIIB and 89.6 (data not shown). The excess of acidic residues in ECL2 of CXCR4 is contrasted by an excess of basic amino acids in the corresponding domain of CCR5, which does not support fusion with T-tropic Env (33Doranz B.J. Lu Z.-H. Rucker J. Zhang T.-Y. Sharron M. Cen Y.-H. Wang Z.-X. Guo H.-H. Du J.-G. Accavitti M.A. Doms R.W. Peiper S.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6305-6314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the net charge of ECL2 is critical to determining the coreceptor activity of CXCR4 to include T-tropic and dual tropic but not M-tropic Env, each acidic residue in this domain was converted individually to Lys. Analysis of these charge conversion mutants failed to reveal a significant alteration in coreceptor activity with IIIB and 89.6 (data not shown). Surprisingly, one of these variants, CXCR4-D193K, seemed to have minimal enhancement of utilization by 89.6. Conversion of Asp-171, which is located in tm4, to Lys resulted in a marked loss of coreceptor function with the 89.6 (6% of wild type CXCR4) and IIIB (16%) Env glycoproteins. However, this variant was utilized as a fusion coreceptor by the BK132 and DH12 Env glycoproteins at levels approximately 25% of wild type CXCR4 (data not shown). A variant in which multiple acidic amino acid residues were switched to Lys, CXCR4-E179K/D181K/D182K, was produced to mimic the charge of the proximal region in ECL2 of CCR5. This mutant demonstrated a dramatic loss of function. Neither of these variants were detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescent staining (data not shown), suggesting that the mutations interfered with intracellular trafficking. The difference in charge between ECL2 of CCR5 and CXCR4 and the frequent acquisition of positively charged residues in the V3 loop of Env upon conversion from M- to T-tropism (43Fouchier R.A.M.

A. 1996; 93: 15382-15387Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that a negatively charged ECL2 is required to limit the coreceptor function of CXCR4 to T-tropic Env and that changing the charge of this domain could be associated with a gain of coreceptor utilization by M-tropic Env. To test this possibility, the Ala scanning and charge conversion point mutants described above were tested in cell-cell fusion assays with JRFL. None of the CXCR4 variants containing charge conversion mutations were found to acquire coreceptor activity with this M-tropic Env (Fig.2 A ). Parallel analysis of the Ala-scanning mutants, also shown in Fig. 2 A , revealed that a single point mutant, CXCR4-D187A, functioned as a coreceptor for JRFL, demonstrating approximately 25% of the activity of CCR5. This point mutant was also found to be utilized as a fusion coreceptor by other M-tropic Env, including ADA, Bal, and SF162 (data not shown). Analysis of CXCR4 variants with multiple mutations for M-tropic coreceptor activity revealed that variants containing the D187A mutation exhibited coreceptor activity with JRFL (data not shown). This activity was not altered significantly by the addition of R188A, D193A, F189A/Y190A, or V197N, but it was diminished by E179Q/D181A/D182A, E179Q/D181A/D182A/R188A, and E179Q/D181A/D182A/R188A/D193A. The acquisition of M-tropic coreceptor activity was not observed in variants lacking D187A. To determine the requirements at amino acid residue 187 of CXCR4 for the maximum acquisition of M-tropic coreceptor activity, saturation mutagenesis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 B , the conversion of CXCR4-Asp-187 to Val, Phe, and Ser was associated with the acquisition of coreceptor activity with JRFL, whereas replacement with Asn resulted in limited M-tropic coreceptor activity, which was absent when Lys was substituted. CXCR4-D187V consistently demonstrated a significant level of fusion coreceptor activity with M-tropic Env, with a mean value that was greater than 50% of wild type CCR5. However, these mutations had minimal effects on the coreceptor activity of CXCR4 with IIIB and 89.6 (data not shown). The M-tropic coreceptor activity of CXCR4-D187V could be inhibited by the addit"

Overexpression of cyclin D3 led to accelerated passage through G1 in actively proliferating cells with no effect on the overall population doubling time. In cells re-entering the division cycle from a quiescent state, cyclin D3 caused an even more dramatic advancement of S phase entry. Accelerated progression through G0/G1-to-S correlated with premature phosphorylation of the pRb tumor suppressor protein and its relatives, p107 and p130. We conclude that cyclin D3 can act as a rate-limiting G1 cyclin and that this effect involves, in part, the premature phosphorylation of critical substrates.

The eukaryotic cell division cycle is regulated by the successive activation and deactivation of a family of serine/threonine kinases composed of a positive regulatory subunit, termed cyclin, and a catalytic subunit, known as a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk). 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; tet, tetracycline. 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; tet, tetracycline. The D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) and their corresponding kinases, cdks 4 and 6, are believed to be involved in the regulation of the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, particularly in the coupling of cell cycle progression and mitogenic signals. The high homology between the three D-type cyclins has suggested functional redundance. On the other hand, tissue-specific expression patterns, different affinity to cdks, and the fact that sequence comparison for individual members reveals a higher degree of conservation between species than between other D-type cyclins within the same species argue for a more specific role of each D-type cyclin (1Reed S.I.

Homozygous disruption of the cyclin D1 or D2 genes, however, has a surprisingly limited effect on development of the mouse embryo and subsequent viability. Cyclin D1 knock-out mice are slightly smaller than their wild type littermates, exhibit a retinopathy, and fail to lactate because of abnormal development of the mammary gland during pregnancy (3Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 4Fantl V. Stamp G. Andrews A. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Cyclin D2-nullizygous female mice are sterile because of the inability of ovarial granulosa cells to respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (5Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H.

Most tissues seem to develop normally in these animals, indicating the possibility that other D-type cyclins might be able to take over the function of cyclin D1 or D2. Paradoxically, however, abrogation of cyclin D1 by antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides prevents cultured fibroblasts from entering S phase (6Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 7Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar S.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). This difference between animal and cell culture studies remains to be resolved. On the other hand, overexpression of cyclins D1 or D2 accelerates progression through G1 and reduces the dependence of fibroblasts on growth factors (7Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), suggesting that all D-type cyclins can be rate-limiting effectors of S phase entry.The human and mouse cyclin D3 genes were originally identified by cross-hybridizing cyclin D1 probes with a mouse phage genomic library or a human cDNA library, respectively (10Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 11Motokura T. Keyomarsi K. Kronenberg H.M. Arnold A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20412-20415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, compared with cyclins D1 or D2, surprisingly little is known about the function of cyclin D3. Successful disruption of the cyclin D3 gene in mice has not been reported. The cell cycle effects of cyclin D3 overexpression have so far only been studied in hematopoetic cells where cyclin D3, like cyclin D2, leads to shortening of G1 and failure to differentiate in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (12Kato J.Y. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11513-11517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For unknown reasons, a previous attempt to construct stable fibroblast lines constitutively overexpressing cyclin D3 failed (7Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar S.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to investigate the effects of cyclin D3 overexpression on the cell cycle in stable fibroblast lines. To avoid potential toxic effects of constitutive cyclin overexpression we employed an inducible expression system.DISCUSSIONWe report here that overexpression of cyclin D3 accelerates progression through the G1 phase in actively growing fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts emerging synchronously from quiescence. Accelerated progression through G1 is accompanied by premature phosphorylation of pocket proteins, key substrates of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The overall growth rate was not affected by cyclin D3 overexpression, suggesting that the accelerated passage through G1 phase is compensated for by expanding subsequent cell cycle phases.Overexpression of cyclin D1 or cyclin E using the same experimental system was previously shown to cause a similar alteration of the cell cycle profile in asynchronous cells. Likewise, constitutive overexpression of cyclin D2 or D3 in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells was shown to cause contraction of G1 without concomitant increase in the population doubling time (15Ando K. Ajchenbaum C.F. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9571-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest functional overlap among D-type cyclins and possibly even cyclin E. The phenotypic similarity of the effects of overexpression of various G1 cyclins does not, however, lead to the conclusion that all operate through identical mechanisms. If one assumes that progression through G1 is controlled by more than one rate-limiting event, a shortening of the overall passage time can be achieved through different mechanisms, possibly operating at different times within the G1 interval.Indeed, a functional difference between cyclin D3 and cyclin E is suggested from experiments involving cells emerging synchronously from G0 phase. Whereas overexpression of cyclin E shortened G1 by about the same time interval in cycling cellsversus cells re-entering the cycle from G0, cyclins D1 and D3 had a much more pronounced effect if overexpressed during emergence from G0. The time that quiescent cells require to enter S phase can be considered as the sum of the time needed to re-enter the cell cycle (G0-to-G1) and the time needed for passage through G1. In our experiments, noninduced quiescent R12 fibroblasts began to enter S phase between 12 and 15 h following re-stimulation with serum (Fig. 3), whereas the duration of G1 calculated for cycling cells ranged from 4.4 to 6.2 h. A characteristic feature of D-type cyclins that distinguishes them from other cyclins is the regulation of their accumulation by the action of growth factors. Therefore it is reasonable to propose that cyclin D3 overexpression would have a strong impact on effectors normally targeted by mitogenic signals early during the G0/G1 transition. Cyclin E, on the other hand, appears to be equally effective in cells emerging from quiescence as in actively cycling cells, suggesting a role specific for a later interval of G1, downstream of the specific effects of mitogens. These observations, however, do not preclude that cyclin E-associated kinase may be a target of regulation during emergence from G0 (16Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these data, as well as evidence for distinct roles with regard to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, pRb, suggest that D-type cyclins and cyclin E stimulate passage through G1 via different mechanisms (17Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Although the effects of cyclin D3 overexpression provide further evidence for a specific cell cycle function of D-type cyclins as opposed to cyclin E, the issue of functional specificity of individual D-type cyclins still requires clarification. In the cell types and experimental systems utilized, there was no obvious difference between cyclin D1 and D3, suggesting functional redundance. Proliferation in only a very limited number of cell types or tissues may in fact be controlled exclusively by a single D-type cyclin, an assumption that is indeed corroborated by the narrowly circumscribed defects found in cyclin D1 or D2 knockout mice (3Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 4Fantl V.

On the other hand, different D-type cyclins might moderate specific functions in other cellular processes not directly related to cell cycle control. Interestingly, overexpression of D-type cyclins in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells showed that only cyclin D2 and D3 but not cyclin D1 can abrogate myeloid differentiation in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas all three conferred similar cell cycle effects in the absence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (12Kato J.Y. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11513-11517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that cyclin D1 can activate estrogen receptor-dependent transcription independently of its kinase regulatory function, although conflicting evidence has been presented concerning the specificity of this function for any particular D-type cyclin (18Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of pRb in late G1, close to the restriction point, disrupts the pRb-E2F complex, thereby mobilizing the trans-activating potential of E2F (20Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar,21Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Like pRb, the related protein p130 can be found in E2F-DNA complexes during early G1 and is the most prominent E2F-binding pocket protein in quiescent fibroblasts (22Cobrinik D. Whyte P. Peeper D.S. Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2392-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 23Wolf D.A. Hermeking H. Albert T. Herzinger T. Kind P. Eick D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2067-2078PubMed Google Scholar). However, because pRb is the preferred substrate for D-type cyclin-dependent kinases in vitro (24Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), and the G1 arrest caused by abrogation of cyclin D/cdk activity by neutralizing antibodies or the cdk inhibitor p16 depends on the presence of functional pRb (25Medema R.H.

Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), it is assumed that pRb is the principal functional substrate of D-type cdks in vivo . Our observation that cyclin D3 overexpression triggers the rapid phosphorylation of pRb supports this evidence. Phosphorylation of pRb preceded S phase entry in cyclin D3-overepressing cells by many hours and is therefore unlikely to reflect a positional effect secondary to the general acceleration of G1 progression. p130, which exhibited a similar acceleration of phosphorylation in these experiments, may well be one of the substrates that cells need to phosphorylate specifically during emergence from G0 into G1. Efficient and rapid phosphorylation of p130 may explain why cells emerging from quiescence benefit even more from overexpression of cyclin D3 than do cycling cells.

The D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) and their corresponding kinases, cdks 4 and 6, are believed to be involved in the regulation of the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, particularly in the coupling of cell cycle progression and mitogenic signals. The high homology between the three D-type cyclins has suggested functional redundance. On the other hand, tissue-specific expression patterns, different affinity to cdks, and the fact that sequence comparison for individual members reveals a higher degree of conservation between species than between other D-type cyclins within the same species argue for a more specific role of each D-type cyclin (1Reed S.I. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Homozygous disruption of the cyclin D1 or D2 genes, however, has a surprisingly limited effect on development of the mouse embryo and subsequent viability. Cyclin D1 knock-out mice are slightly smaller than their wild type littermates, exhibit a retinopathy, and fail to lactate because of abnormal development of the mammary gland during pregnancy (3Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 4Fantl V. Stamp G. Andrews A. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Cyclin D2-nullizygous female mice are sterile because of the inability of ovarial granulosa cells to respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (5Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Most tissues seem to develop normally in these animals, indicating the possibility that other D-type cyclins might be able to take over the function of cyclin D1 or D2. Paradoxically, however, abrogation of cyclin D1 by antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides prevents cultured fibroblasts from entering S phase (6Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 7Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar S.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). This difference between animal and cell culture studies remains to be resolved. On the other hand, overexpression of cyclins D1 or D2 accelerates progression through G1 and reduces the dependence of fibroblasts on growth factors (7Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar S.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 8Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y.J. Cacace A.M. Infante A.S. Doi S. Santella R.M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), suggesting that all D-type cyclins can be rate-limiting effectors of S phase entry. The human and mouse cyclin D3 genes were originally identified by cross-hybridizing cyclin D1 probes with a mouse phage genomic library or a human cDNA library, respectively (10Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 11Motokura T. Keyomarsi K. Kronenberg H.M. Arnold A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20412-20415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, compared with cyclins D1 or D2, surprisingly little is known about the function of cyclin D3. Successful disruption of the cyclin D3 gene in mice has not been reported. The cell cycle effects of cyclin D3 overexpression have so far only been studied in hematopoetic cells where cyclin D3, like cyclin D2, leads to shortening of G1 and failure to differentiate in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (12Kato J.Y. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11513-11517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For unknown reasons, a previous attempt to construct stable fibroblast lines constitutively overexpressing cyclin D3 failed (7Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar S.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to investigate the effects of cyclin D3 overexpression on the cell cycle in stable fibroblast lines. To avoid potential toxic effects of constitutive cyclin overexpression we employed an inducible expression system. DISCUSSIONWe report here that overexpression of cyclin D3 accelerates progression through the G1 phase in actively growing fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts emerging synchronously from quiescence. Accelerated progression through G1 is accompanied by premature phosphorylation of pocket proteins, key substrates of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. The overall growth rate was not affected by cyclin D3 overexpression, suggesting that the accelerated passage through G1 phase is compensated for by expanding subsequent cell cycle phases.Overexpression of cyclin D1 or cyclin E using the same experimental system was previously shown to cause a similar alteration of the cell cycle profile in asynchronous cells. Likewise, constitutive overexpression of cyclin D2 or D3 in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells was shown to cause contraction of G1 without concomitant increase in the population doubling time (15Ando K. Ajchenbaum C.F. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9571-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest functional overlap among D-type cyclins and possibly even cyclin E. The phenotypic similarity of the effects of overexpression of various G1 cyclins does not, however, lead to the conclusion that all operate through identical mechanisms. If one assumes that progression through G1 is controlled by more than one rate-limiting event, a shortening of the overall passage time can be achieved through different mechanisms, possibly operating at different times within the G1 interval.Indeed, a functional difference between cyclin D3 and cyclin E is suggested from experiments involving cells emerging synchronously from G0 phase. Whereas overexpression of cyclin E shortened G1 by about the same time interval in cycling cellsversus cells re-entering the cycle from G0, cyclins D1 and D3 had a much more pronounced effect if overexpressed during emergence from G0. The time that quiescent cells require to enter S phase can be considered as the sum of the time needed to re-enter the cell cycle (G0-to-G1) and the time needed for passage through G1. In our experiments, noninduced quiescent R12 fibroblasts began to enter S phase between 12 and 15 h following re-stimulation with serum (Fig. 3), whereas the duration of G1 calculated for cycling cells ranged from 4.4 to 6.2 h. A characteristic feature of D-type cyclins that distinguishes them from other cyclins is the regulation of their accumulation by the action of growth factors. Therefore it is reasonable to propose that cyclin D3 overexpression would have a strong impact on effectors normally targeted by mitogenic signals early during the G0/G1 transition. Cyclin E, on the other hand, appears to be equally effective in cells emerging from quiescence as in actively cycling cells, suggesting a role specific for a later interval of G1, downstream of the specific effects of mitogens. These observations, however, do not preclude that cyclin E-associated kinase may be a target of regulation during emergence from G0 (16Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these data, as well as evidence for distinct roles with regard to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, pRb, suggest that D-type cyclins and cyclin E stimulate passage through G1 via different mechanisms (17Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Although the effects of cyclin D3 overexpression provide further evidence for a specific cell cycle function of D-type cyclins as opposed to cyclin E, the issue of functional specificity of individual D-type cyclins still requires clarification. In the cell types and experimental systems utilized, there was no obvious difference between cyclin D1 and D3, suggesting functional redundance. Proliferation in only a very limited number of cell types or tissues may in fact be controlled exclusively by a single D-type cyclin, an assumption that is indeed corroborated by the narrowly circumscribed defects found in cyclin D1 or D2 knockout mice (3Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 4Fantl V.

On the other hand, different D-type cyclins might moderate specific functions in other cellular processes not directly related to cell cycle control. Interestingly, overexpression of D-type cyclins in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells showed that only cyclin D2 and D3 but not cyclin D1 can abrogate myeloid differentiation in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas all three conferred similar cell cycle effects in the absence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (12Kato J.Y. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11513-11517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that cyclin D1 can activate estrogen receptor-dependent transcription independently of its kinase regulatory function, although conflicting evidence has been presented concerning the specificity of this function for any particular D-type cyclin (18Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of pRb in late G1, close to the restriction point, disrupts the pRb-E2F complex, thereby mobilizing the trans-activating potential of E2F (20Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar,21Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Like pRb, the related protein p130 can be found in E2F-DNA complexes during early G1 and is the most prominent E2F-binding pocket protein in quiescent fibroblasts (22Cobrinik D. Whyte P. Peeper D.S. Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2392-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 23Wolf D.A. Hermeking H. Albert T. Herzinger T. Kind P. Eick D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2067-2078PubMed Google Scholar). However, because pRb is the preferred substrate for D-type cyclin-dependent kinases in vitro (24Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), and the G1 arrest caused by abrogation of cyclin D/cdk activity by neutralizing antibodies or the cdk inhibitor p16 depends on the presence of functional pRb (25Medema R.H.

Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), it is assumed that pRb is the principal functional substrate of D-type cdks in vivo . Our observation that cyclin D3 overexpression triggers the rapid phosphorylation of pRb supports this evidence. Phosphorylation of pRb preceded S phase entry in cyclin D3-overepressing cells by many hours and is therefore unlikely to reflect a positional effect secondary to the general acceleration of G1 progression. p130, which exhibited a similar acceleration of phosphorylation in these experiments, may well be one of the substrates that cells need to phosphorylate specifically during emergence from G0 into G1. Efficient and rapid phosphorylation of p130 may explain why cells emerging from quiescence benefit even more from overexpression of cyclin D3 than do cycling cells.

Using a quantitative in vitro motility assay we have found that the wild type Drosophila ACT88F actin behaved like rabbit skeletal muscle actin when tropomyosin and troponin were added at pCa5 and pCa9. In contrast the effect of tropomyosin upon the E93K mutant actin filament movement was completely different from wild type and resembled the response of wild type with tropomyosin+troponin at pCa9 (i.e. the filaments were switched off). Velocity of E93K actin did not increase, and the fraction of filaments motile was reduced to less than 15% by adding up to 30 nmtropomyosin. When myosin subfragment-1 modified byN -ethylmaleimide was mixed with mutant E93K actin-tropomyosin filaments we observed that it restored motility of the filaments to the level observed with E93K actin alone. We conclude that electrostatic charge on the surface of domain 2 of actin plays a critical role in determining the state of actin-tropomyosin that is a central feature of the steric blocking mechanism of actin filament regulation.

Regulation of vertebrate striated muscle thin filament activity involves a Ca2+-sensitive change of the state of the thin filament, which affects the interaction between actin molecules and myosin cross-bridges (1Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The thin filaments can be described as a two state allosteric and cooperative binding system in which the cooperative unit consists of seven actins and one tropomyosin: troponin I and myosin heads act as negative and positive allosteric effectors respectively (2Geeves M.A. Halsall D.J.

Tropomyosin is a dimeric α-helical coiled-coil that spans seven monomers along the actin filament (7Phillips G.N. Fillers J.P. Cohen C. J. Mol.

According to current models, the tropomyosin strand may exist in two or more locations on the surface of the actin (8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol.

In one position, corresponding to the biochemical on state, the negatively charged tropomyosin is located over actin subdomains 3 and 4 in a “trough” of positive charge (11Holmes K.C. Biophys.

J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): A57Google Scholar) and K238A/E241A/E360H in Dictyostelium (14Saeki K. Sutoh K. Wakabayashi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14465-14472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) result in weaker tropomyosin binding and destabilization of the on state. In striated muscles from arthropods (Limulus ) and vertebrates (Rana ) the tropomyosin strand has been shown to be over the junction between actin domain 3 and 1 and over domain 2 in the off state and consequently strong myosin binding sites are blocked (Refs. 8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar and 10Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, Fig. 1). The inhibitory component of troponin, troponin I, is a positively charged protein that binds to actin and switches the tropomyosin to the off state. It is noteworthy that although troponin I controls the actin-tropomyosin state, it does not bind directly to tropomyosin, so it probably acts indirectly through actin (15Al-Hillawi E. Bhandari D.G. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Electrostatic charges are likely to play an important part in this interaction. The amino acids in actin involved in stabilizing the off state have not been positively identified, but there is evidence for troponin I contacts on domains 1 and 2 of actin (16Levine B.A. Moir A.J.G. Perry S.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This is compatible with reports that changes in the shape of domain 2 of actin are associated with regulation (17Al-Khayat H.A. Yagi N. Squire J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 611-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A cluster of negative charge due to Asp56, Glu57, and Glu93 is located at the bottom of domain 2, close to the position occupied by tropomyosin when in the off state (Fig. 1) (10Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that this negative charge cluster may repulse tropomyosin, thus maintaining the on state and that neutralization of the repulsion by inhibitory proteins may be an essential feature of the inhibitory mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we studied the state of actin-tropomyosin in a mutant of the Drosophila flight muscle-specific actin geneAct88F with a charge reversal mutation of glutamic acid 93 to lysine (E93K actin)(18, 19). The E93K mutation produces a flightless phenotype characterized by disordered sarcomeres. However in vitro motility assays have demonstrated that E93K actin filaments can move over myosin and produce force, which is not very different from the wild type (20Razzaq A. Molloy J.E. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): A56Google Scholar, 21Molloy J.E Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 198s-205sGoogle Scholar). Using in vitro motility techniques similar to those we used to characterize tropomyosin based regulation in striated and smooth muscles (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem.

Flies were grown and then stored at −20 °C prior to processing. A myofibrillar preparation was made from 50 g (50,000) of flies according to the method of Saide et al . (23Saide J.D. Chin-Bow S. Hogan-Sheldon J. Busquets-Turner L. Vigoreaux J.O. Valgeirsdottir K. Pardue M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After a high salt extraction (20 mm KPO4, 500 mmKCl, pH 7.0) on ice for 10 min, the myofibril pellet was dehydrated by resuspending first in 6 volumes of ice-cold 50% acetone, then in 6 volumes of ice-cold 100% acetone, and finally allowed to air dry overnight at room temperature. Actin extraction from the acetone powder was performed essentially after the methods of Bullard (24Bullard B. Dabrowska R. Winkelman L. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Pardee and Spudich (25Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) in ACEX (2 mm Tris-Cl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) at 4 °C for 60 min. After spinning the extract at 43,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, a tenth of the extract volume of 10 × polymerization buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 500 mmKCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, pH 8.0) was added and polymerization allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. Solid KCl was added to a final concentration of 800 mm. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C to dissociate the contaminating Drosophila thin filament proteins, the preparation was spun at 90,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. The F-actin pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of ACEX, homogenized, and then dialyzed for 24 h in 3 × 1-liter changes of ACEX. The optical density at A280 to A310, with an extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm2/mg, was used to estimate the molarity of the G-actin stock. Anion exchange chromatography employing a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Inc.) was used to isolate the indirect flight muscle-specific actin isoform from the mixture of the six Drosophila isoforms constituting the G-actin stock. Before application to the column, the actin stock was clarified by first spinning at 90,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor and then filtering through 0.2-mm filters (Millipore). A 28-min segmented gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, was then used to resolve the actin mixture into four different isoform peaks (Fig.2). The peak B fractions from chromatographic runs of WT (or E93K) actin were pooled and polymerized as before for 2 h at room temperature and then spun at 100,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. Six separate paired preparations of WT and E93K actin were prepared; yield was 30–100 μg per preparation. E93K does not polymerize as readily as WT actin, and in one preparation it was necessary to add heavy meromyosin at 1:500 mol/mol in order to promote polymerization. The F-actin pellets were resuspended in ACEX to a final concentration of about 5 μm actin. The in vitro motility assay was performed as described by Fraser and Marston (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using 100 μg/ml skeletal muscle HMM on cover glasses coated with silicone by soaking in 0.2% dichloromethylsilane in chloroform. F-actin was labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (φ) as described by Kron et al. (26Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). F-actin·φ-tropomyosin and actin·φ-tropomyosin-troponin complexes were formed at 10 × assay concentration: 100 nm actin·φ , 150 nm tropomyosin, and 0–600 nm troponin were mixed in 50 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4 (buffer A), and incubated for 30–60 min. The complexes were diluted 10-fold immediately prior to infusion into the motility cell. We have demonstrated that tropomyosin does not dissociate during the experiment under these conditions and that additional tropomyosin in buffers C and D is not necessary (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A flow cell was prepared from a freshly siliconized coverslip and a microscope slide as described by Kron et al. (26Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Assay components and buffers were infused into the flow cell at 30–60-s intervals. Two 50-μl aliquots of HMM at 100 μg/ml were infused in buffer A (50 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) to provide a coating of immobilized HMM on the coverslip. This was followed by 2 × 50 μl of buffer B (buffer A + 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) then 2 × 50 μl of 10 nm actin·φ ± associated tropomyosin-troponin in buffer A. 50 μl of buffer C (buffer B + 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.5% methylcellulose, ± troponin at assay concentration) and 50 μl of buffer D (buffer C + 1 mm ATP) were then infused. Ca2+ concentration was varied by incorporating Ca2+·EGTA buffers in the final assay buffers C and D. The movement of actin·φ-tropomyosin filaments over the immobilized skeletal muscle HMM was observed under a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (63×/1.4 objective) with a DAGE-SIT-68 camera and recorded on video tape. Videos were digitized, and the movement was analyzed to determine fraction of filaments moving and velocity of motile filaments using either the automatic tracking program described by Marstonet al . (27Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Wu B. Roper G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or the manual tracking procedure in the cases where filaments were not easily detected (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Actin filament movement over immobilized heavy meromyosin was studied in an in vitro motility assay. With this assay it is possible to measure a number of parameters in place of the single parameter of ATPase. These are fraction of actin filaments moving, velocity of the filaments that are moving, and the number of filaments attached to myosin per unit area. It has been shown that Ca2+ can regulate all three of these parameters independently through troponin-tropomyosin (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem.

In previous work it has been shown that addition of arthropod (Limulus ) tropomyosin to actin increases filament velocity (4Wang F. Martin B.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3776-3780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this is not observed with vertebrate striated muscle tropomyosin. We therefore decided to test the Drosophila actin with vertebrate smooth muscle tropomyosin (from sheep aorta) as well as with vertebrate striated muscle tropomyosin (from rabbit). Smooth muscle tropomyosin tends to activate actomyosin ATPase, while skeletal muscle tropomyosin is usually inhibitory (30Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2070-2072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In thein vitro motility assay smooth muscle tropomyosin gives an increase in filament velocity similar to Limulus tropomyosin (4Wang F. Martin B.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3776-3780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 236: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The increased velocity has been suggested as indicating that actin-tropomyosin is predominantly in the on state, since smooth muscle tropomyosin has a higher K t and size of cooperative unit compared with skeletal muscle tropomyosin (28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) The regulation of Drosophila flight muscle actin filament movement by troponin and tropomyosin has not been studied before, and it is possible that Drosophila actin could have regulatory characteristics quite different from vertebrate actin. TableI compares Drosophila actin and the well studied rabbit striated muscle actin filaments (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem.

Commun. 1997; 236: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The two types of actin filaments moved at the same velocities with a high proportion of the filaments motile. Smooth muscle tropomyosin increased the velocity of both types of actin filaments by around 25%, while skeletal muscle tropomyosin had no effect on velocity, although cosedimentation experiments showed it did bind under the conditions of the motility assay (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The fraction of filaments motile was not affected by either tropomyosin.Table IComparison of the motility of rabbit skeletal muscle and Drosophila flight muscle (ACT88F) actinsRabbit skeletal muscle actinDrosophila ACT88F actinFraction filaments motileVelocityFraction filaments motileVelocityActin79.5 ± 1.5% (n = 11)1-aData from Ref. 28.3.7 ± 0.1 μm/s (n = 11)1-aData from Ref. 28.80 ± 3% (n = 6)3.6 ± 0.02 μm/s (n = 6)Percentage change due to 10 nm skeletal muscle tropomyosin1 ± 2 (n = 3)1-bData from Ref. 33.0 ± 1 (n = 3)1-bData from Ref. 33.−3 ± 4.5 (n = 3)−1 ± 1 (n = 3)Percentage change due to 20 nm smooth muscle tropomyosin0 ± 3 (n = 3)1-bData from Ref. 33.28 ± 2 (n = 3)1-bData from Ref. 33.5 ± 5 (n = 6)24 ± 3 (n = 3)Values are means ± S.E.1-a Data from Ref. 28Wu B.

In previous experiments we have demonstrated in our system that addition of up to 16 nm troponin at Ca9 results in a marked decrease in the fraction of filaments moving accompanied by a modest decrease in the velocity of the filaments that remain motile (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Addition of skeletal muscle troponin to wild type 88F actin-skeletal muscle tropomyosin filaments produced the same decrease in the fraction of filaments motile (half-maximal effect at about 4 nmtroponin) and the same small decrease in velocity of motile filaments (16% at 16 nm troponin) as was observed previously with skeletal muscle actin filaments (compare Fig.3 with Fig. 3 in Ref. 22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This behavior was observed irrespective of the type of tropomyosin used and is characteristic of actin-tropomyosin filaments in the off state (28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Different technical approaches to measuring troponin control of filament motility have produced differing patterns of results in some experimental circumstances (these are discussed in Ref. 28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, all the published analyses agree that reduction in the proportion of filaments that are motile is a characteristic feature of actin-tropomyosin filaments switched off by troponin or other inhibitory proteins (22Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7836-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 72: 1295-1307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At pCa5 troponin did not alter the fraction of filaments motile or the velocity. We conclude that the motility parameters of actin from rabbit andDrosophila are indistinguishable, and they are regulated by tropomyosin and troponin in the same way. This justifies the use of mammalian regulatory proteins in our investigation of mutantDrosophila actin. Although the E93K mutation has a flightless phenotype E93K actin, filaments have been reported to be capable of movement in the in vitro motility assay and of exerting force (20Razzaq A. Molloy J.E. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): A56Google Scholar, 21Molloy J.E Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 198s-205sGoogle Scholar). We found that wild type and E93K actin moved at almost the same velocity at 30 °C. At 28 °C wild type moved 26% faster than E93K actin, and it has been reported that at 23 °C wild type moved 50% faster than E93K actin (20Razzaq A. Molloy J.E. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): A56Google Scholar). Thus our results are in broad agreement with previous experiments using E93K actin and confirm that the mutation does not seriously compromise the actin-myosin interaction. Some differences are to be expected, since we have used a different surface (siliconized glass), and we performed experiments at higher ionic strength than previously and used 0.5% methyl cellulose (20Razzaq A. Molloy J.E. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): A56Google Scholar, 21Molloy J.E Burns J.E. Sparrow J.C. Tregear R.T. Kendrick-Jones J. White D.C.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 198s-205sGoogle Scholar). We have found that silica surfaces seem to provide less resistance to movement than nitrocellulose and also that the addition of methylcellulose to the medium enables weakly bound filaments to remain attached to the myosin surface (28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus the conditions we have adopted would minimize differences in motility performance between wild type and mutant actin. When smooth or skeletal muscle tropomyosin were added to wild type actin filaments, the fraction of filaments that were motile did not change. In contrast, when either smooth or striated muscle tropomyosin was added to the mutant E93K actin filaments, the fraction of filaments motile was greatly reduced (Fig. 4). Experiments were done with six paired preparations of wild type and E93K actin. The fraction of wild type actin filaments motile was 79 ± 3.6% (S.E., n = 7) and of E93K actin 71 ± 2% (S.E., n = 7). Tropomyosin progressively reduced the fraction of E93K actin filaments motile reaching 14 ± 2% (n = 5) with 16 nm skeletal muscle tropomyosin and 17 ± 2% (n = 3) with 16 nm smooth muscle tropomyosin; in contrast, tropomyosin did not affect WT actin filament motility (Fig. 4). Skeletal and smooth muscle tropomyosin had different effects upon filament velocity. The skeletal muscle tropomyosin had no effect on velocity of the wild type actin as observed previously with rabbit actin (Table I) and slightly decreased velocity of E93K actin filaments (Fig. 4). The decrease was greater at 25 °C (up to 37%, Fig. 4) than at 27 °C (up to 19%). Smooth muscle tropomyosin enhanced the velocity of wild type actin filaments by 25% at 30 °C (Fig. 4, Table I), but this was not observed with E93K actin filaments, instead velocity declined in the same way as it did with skeletal muscle tropomyosin (Fig. 4). It will be noted that the the large decrease in the fraction of E93K actin filaments motile and the small decrease in velocity when tropomyosin was added (Fig. 4) resembles the effect of adding troponin at pCa9 to wild type actin-tropomyosin filaments (Fig. 3). As has been discussed, this effect is characteristic of actin-tropomyosin filaments in the off state; thus it appears that the E93K mutation in actin causes tropomyosin to bind to actin only in the off state (32Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19688-19693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To confirm that the “switch off” of E93K actin filament movement was due to the tropomyosin-mediated mechanism, we added NEM-S-1 to E93K actin-tropomyosin. NEM-S-1 forms strong bonds to actin, even in the presence of ATP, thus it switches actin-tropomyosin to the on state independently of regulatory proteins (29Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): A25Google Scholar, 34Nagashima H. Asakura S. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 409-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that adding NEM-S-1 to actin-tropomyosin resulted in an increase in filament motility (28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When NEM-S-1 was mixed with E93K actin-smooth muscle tropomyosin filaments, we observed that it restored both the fraction of filaments motile and their velocity to the level observed with E93K actin when tropomyosin was absent (Fig.5). This reversal of inhibition required less than 0.4 NEM-S-1 per actin, thus confirming that it was acting cooperatively upon tropomyosin in the same way as it does with wild type striated muscle actin-tropomyosin (28Wu B. Fraser I.D.C. Marston S.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Nagashima H. Asakura S. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 409-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). E93K actin-tropomyosin filaments were also reactivated by adding troponin in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5). This indicates that the effect of the E93K mutation is to shift the on/off equilbrium of the thin filament toward the off state to a certain degree, but the Ca2+-activated troponin complex is capable of shifting the equilibrium back to the on state. In contrast a deletion mutation in tropomyosin has been shown to produce thin filaments that cannot be activated by Ca2+ and troponin (36Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Recent structural work has indicated that tropomyosin is loosly associated with actin and that its location may be dependent upon the charge distribution on the surface of actin. The negatively charged tropomyosin lies over domains 3 and 4 of actin in a trough of positive charge when in the on state (8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Changes in the surface charge of actin in this region by chemical modification (e.g. of Lys238 by pentane dione (35El-Saleh S.C. Thieret R. Johnson P. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11014-11021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or by mutations (E311A/R312A (13Gerson J.H. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): A57Google Scholar) and K238A/E241A/E360H (14Saeki K. Sutoh K. Wakabayashi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14465-14472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) lead to a reduction in tropomyosin binding affinity and modification of regulatory behavior. In addition mutations in tropomyosin can also modulate regulation (33Wu B. Redwood C.S. Purcell I.F. Esposito G. Watkins H. Marston S.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) The likely position of tropomyosin when in the off state has only recently been visualized by electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions. In both vertebrates and arthropods tropomyosin is seen to have moved across the face of the actin monomer so that it is over the junction between domains 1 and 3 and over domain 2 at the top of the actin monomer, covering the putative myosin binding site (8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although this description provides an explanation of how the steric blocking model of regulation could work, it provides no clues as to why tropomyosin is located in this position in the presence of inhibitory proteins. Several lines of evidence point to a possible involvement of domain 2 of actin in transmitting a signal from regulatory protein to tropomyosin. Actin monomers within actin filaments are flexible and conformational changes within the monomer are mainly in the region of domain 2 (38Egelman E.H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1985; 6: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39dos-Remedios C.G. Moens P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore detailed modeling of x-ray diffraction patterns from active and relaxed muscles have been interpreted in terms of a movement of domain 2 (17Al-Khayat H.A. Yagi N. Squire J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 611-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly in this model the distance between domain 2 and tropomyosin is halved when the muscle is switched off, but there are only minor changes in the distance between tropomyosin and the other three domains. Since it is proposed that tropomyosin is stabilized in the on position by actin surface charges in domains 3 and 4, it seems reasonable to propose that charges on the surface of domains 1 and 2 contribute to stabilizing tropomyosin in the off position. It has long been appreciated that in inhibitory proteins such as troponin I and caldesmon inhibitory function is related to concentrations of positive charge (the inhibitory peptide of troponin I, residues 104–115, contains 4 arginines and 2 lysines (40Perry S.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 593-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 41Perry S.V. Cole H.A. Head J.F. Wilson F.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 251-262Crossref Google Scholar)). There are complementary clusters of negative charged amino acids on the surface of actin, the most notable of which is at the bottom of domain 2 (Asp56, Glu57, Glu93). This negatively charged patch is close to tropomyosin in the off state (10Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 1. The critical nature of this region to muscle function is highlighted by the fact that the E93K mutation produces a flightless phenotype, and the E93A/R95A mutation in yeast is lethal (37Wertman K. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in this region affect sarcomere assembly (18Sparrow J.C. Reedy M. Ball E. Kyrtatas J. Molloy J. Durston E. Hennessey E. White D.C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 963-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and this may be a consequence of the poor polymerizability of E93K actin or due to an altered interaction with tropomyosin. The motility parameters of E93K actin are not greatly different from WT, but the interaction of E93K with tropomyosin is altered as shown by these experiments (Fig. 4). The observation that a charge reversal mutation of glutamic acid 93 to lysine results in tropomyosin binding to actin in the off state, as defined by the motility parameters (low fraction of filaments motile with little change in velocity) suggests one aspect of actin structure that may be important for regulation. Alterations of other amino acids in this charged cluster (D56A/E57A) seem to have similar effects upon actin-tropomyosin state (48Korman V. Tobacman L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A347Google Scholar), but charge changes at the nearby surface helix (E99A/E100A) or in the middle of domain 1 (D24A/D25A) have no effect upon regulation (49Wong W.W. Bobkova E.A. Gerson J.H. DasGupta G. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A264Google Scholar), this indicating a specific role for this site. We propose that electrostatic charge on the surface of domain 2 of actin plays a critical role in determining the equilibrium between states of actin-tropomyosin that is a central feature of the steric blocking mechanism of actin filament regulation (8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 42El-Saleh S.C. Warber K.D. Potter J.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1986; 7: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Concentrated negative charge in this region, as found in wild type actin, promotes the on state, and the absence or reversal of such charge, as found with the E93K actin mutant and actin-troponin I complex, permits tropomyosin to move toward domain 2 and thus promotes the off state. It is possible that the ability of structurally unrelated proteins such as troponin and caldesmon to inhibit actin-tropomyosin interaction with myosin may simply be due to neutralizing negative charge on the surface of actin, thus permitting tropomyosin to move to the off position on actin. It would also be compatible with the general observation that inhibitory proteins bind to actin rather than to tropomyosin. We thank Anne Lawn for excellent technical assistance in purifying the actins."

However, direct measurements of Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP have been limited by the low quantities of available mutant protein. We have improved the transfection efficiency by means of recombinant adenovirus vectors, yielding sufficient expression of wild type and mutant SERCA-1 ATPase for measurements of Ca2+ binding to the microsomal fraction of the transfected cells. We find that in the presence of 20 μm Ca2+ and in the absence of ATP, the Glu771 → Gln, Thr799 → Ala, Asp800 → Asn, and Glu908 → Ala mutants exhibit negligible binding, indicating that the oxygen functions of Glu771, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908 are involved in interactions whose single disruption causes major changes in the highly cooperative “duplex” binding. Total loss of Ca2+ binding is accompanied by loss of Ca2+ inhibition of the Pi reaction. We also find that, at pH 7.0, the Glu309 → Gln and the Asn796 → Ala mutants bind approximately half as much Ca2+ as the wild type ATPase and do not interfere with Ca2+ inhibition of the Pi reaction. At pH 6.2, the Glu309 → Gln mutant does not bind any Ca2+, and its phosphorylation by Piis not inhibited by Ca2+. On the contrary, the Asn796 → Ala mutant retains the behavior displayed at pH 7.0. This suggests that in the Glu309 → Gln mutant, ionization of acidic functions in other amino acids (e.g. Glu771 and Asp800) occurs as the pH is shifted, thereby rendering Ca2+ binding possible. In the Asn796 → Ala mutant, on the other hand, the Glu309 carboxylic function allows binding of inhibitory Ca2+ even at pH 6.2. In all cases mutational interference with the inhibition of the Pi reaction by Ca2+can be overcome by raising the Ca2+ concentration to the mm range, consistent with a general effect of mutations on the affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+.

Activation of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ (SERCA) 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; Cr-ATP, chromium ATP; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; pfu, plaque-forming unit; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; Cr-ATP, chromium ATP; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; pfu, plaque-forming unit; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.ATPase requires binding of Ca2+, which is then moved across the membrane upon utilization of ATP. Equilibrium binding isotherms, obtained with sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles as an abundant source of enzyme, demonstrate that in the absence of ATP, two Ca2+/ATPase bind cooperatively with K a = 5 × 1012m−2 (2Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As for the topology of Ca2+ binding within the ATPase molecule, involvement of six amino acid residues (Glu309, Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908) within four clustered transmembrane helices (M4, M5, M6, and M8) was suggested by mutational analysis (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The low yield of recombinant enzymes, however, has limited direct measurements of Ca2+ binding to the pertinent mutants (with the exception of the Glu309 → Gln mutant; Skerjank et al. (3Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In fact, involvement of the six amino acids in Ca2+ binding was suggested by their mutations interfering with the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on enzyme phosphorylation by Pi. The shortcoming of such experiments, however, was that they did not distinguish direct effects of mutations on Ca2+ binding from mutational effects on transmission of the Ca2+ binding signal within the ATPase protein.Alternative studies were performed to test whether the pertinent mutants retain the ability to occlude Ca2+ following addition of Cr-ATP (4Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, however, there is some degree of uncertainty as to whether Cr-ATP may affect Ca2+ binding by stabilizing the enzyme in a state analogous to that of the phosphorylated intermediate (i.e. “E2”). Other studies have utilized the effect of Ca2+ on the susceptibility of wild type and mutated enzyme to proteolytic digestion (5Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. De Gracia A.G. Soulié S.

The resulting expression yields sufficient amounts of protein for direct measurements of Ca2+ binding in the absence of nucleotide substrate, using native microsomal vesicles as the source of enzyme. We describe here our recombinant adenovirus constructs, the characteristics of ATPase overexpression in COS-1 cells under control of the SV40 promoter, the direct measurements of Ca2+ binding by wild type and mutated enzyme, and related tests of Ca2+ inhibition of the enzyme reaction with Pi.DISCUSSIONEquilibrium and kinetic experiments have demonstrated that in the absence of ATP, SERCA binds Ca2+ with a stoichiometry of two Ca2+/enzyme. Binding occurs with a sequential and cooperative mechanism (2Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereby the enzyme is stabilized in the “E1” state. An important discovery for the understanding of the Ca2+ binding topology within the SERCA molecule was achieved when single mutations of specific residues in the transmembrane domain were found to interfere with Ca2+inhibition of enzyme phosphorylation by Pi (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Based on this interference, it was proposed that the six residues participate in Ca2+ complexation within the transmembrane domain (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In fact it was shown by molecular modeling (21Inesi G. Lewis D. Nikic D. Hussain A. Kirtley M.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 185-215PubMed Google Scholar) that within the constraints imposed by the positions of these residues on four transmembrane helices, it is possible to arrange their oxygen functions to form a duplex calcium binding site with distribution and distances compatible with other duplex sites of known crystal structure, such as that of thermolysin (22Holmes M.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar).Several attempts have been made to assign the oxygen functions of the six amino acids implicated in binding to either calcium ion of the duplex complex (21Inesi G. Lewis D. Nikic D. Hussain A. Kirtley M.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 185-215PubMed Google Scholar, 23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additional amino acids within a neighboring cytosolic segment have been also implicated (5Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. De Gracia A.G. Soulié S. Centeno F. Moller J.V. Champeil P. Le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, a shortcoming of this work has been the lack of direct Ca2+binding measurements with the mutants, because of the low quantities of recombinant protein. The only mutant tested for binding was Glu309 → Gln expressed in insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (3Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This measurement required solubilization of the membrane-bound enzyme, purification by affinity chromatography, and reconstitution in liposomes, leaving some uncertainty on the detergent effect on binding and the orientation of the reconstituted enzyme in the liposomal membrane. Alternatively, “Ca2+occlusion” was measured in the presence of Cr-ATP (4Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which stabilizes the enzyme in a state similar to that obtained by enzyme phosphorylation with ATP. An advantage of our present experiments is that Ca2+ binding was measured in the absence of ATP under equilibrium conditions yielding strictly the E1 state. Another advantage is the use of wild type and mutant proteins assembled in native microsomal membrane with no need for detergent solubilization.Our measurements demonstrate that the Glu771 → Gln, Asp800 → Asn, Thr799 → Ala, and Glu908 → Ala mutations result in total loss of Ca2+ binding in the presence of 20 μmCa2+ (Table I). The strong inhibition of Ca2+binding in the first two mutants may be explained by considering that Glu771 and Asp800 could contribute electronegativity to both calcium ions, each donating its carboxyl oxygen to one calcium and its carbonyl oxygen to the other. Yet, it is remarkable that mutation of a single one of the acidic amino acids to its corresponding amide (thereby leaving the carbonyl oxygen in place) results in interference with binding of both calcium ions and with inhibition of the Pi reaction by Ca2+ (TableI).The strong inhibition of Ca2+ binding by the Thr799 → Ala and Glu908 → Ala mutations is also remarkable, because Thr can contribute only one hydroxyl group to the coordination complex. Furthermore, Glu908 appears to contribute only a carbonyl group because the Glu908 → Gln mutation does not have functional consequences (18Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Strock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is then apparent that the oxygen functions of Glu771, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908 provide important stabilization to the cooperative Ca2+ complex, either by direct interaction with Ca2+ or by participation in hydrogen bonding with water or peptide amide functions, so much so that mutational interference with a single one of these functions results in major disruption of the duplex binding site. These effects, however, can be overcome by increasing the Ca2+concentration (18Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Strock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that mutational disruption affects the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+.It is noteworthy that our finding of strong binding inhibition in the Glu908 → Ala mutant in the absence of ATP (i.e. E1 state) is in apparent contrast with the Ca2+ occlusion by the same mutant in the presence of Cr-ATP (4Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the high concentration of Ca2+ used in these experiments (23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Although we observed strong inhibition of Ca2+ binding with the mutants mentioned above we found that in the presence of 20 μm Ca2+ and pH 7.0, the Glu309→ Gln and Asn796 → Ala mutations result in reduction of Ca2+ binding to approximately half the level observed with wild type enzyme (Fig. 6). At pH 6.2, on the other hand, the Glu309 → Gln mutant exhibits no significant Ca2+ binding, whereas the Asn796 → Ala mutant retains the same binding as at neutral pH. This suggests that ionization of acidic functions of other amino acids (e.g. Glu771 or Asp800) occurs as the pH is shifted from 6.2 to 7.0, thereby facilitating Ca2+ binding in the Glu309 → Gln mutant. On the other hand, in the Asn796 → Ala mutant, the presence of the Glu309 acidic function allows binding of inhibitory Ca2+ even at pH 6.2.The lack of Ca2+ inhibition of the Pi reaction in the mutants allowing no Ca2+ binding is well understandable. On the other hand, the strong inhibition of the Pi reaction in mutants permitting binding of half the normal Ca2+ level suggests that (a ) these mutant molecules bind only one of two Ca2+ known to bind to the wild type enzyme and (b ) the single bound Ca2+is sufficient to inhibit the Pi reaction. Experimental demonstration of the inhibition of the Pi reaction by single Ca2+ binding is quite satisfactory, because it is observed in both Asn796 → Ala and Glu309 → Gln mutants at pH 7.0 and only in the former mutant at pH 6.2.That a single Ca2+ may be sufficient to inhibit the Pi reaction was previously suggested based upon the effects of sequential (and negatively cooperative) binding of strontium to sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (26Fujimori T. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18475-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on different effects of various mutations on the inhibition of the Pi reaction by Ca2+ (23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our direct measurements of Ca2+binding at pH 7.0 and 6.2 in parallel with phosphorylation experiments confirm that in the Asn796 → Ala and Glu309→ Gln mutants, at suitable Ca2+ and H+concentrations, a single Ca2+ is sufficient to inhibit the Pi reaction. This would be unlikely to occur in the wild type enzyme, because of the highly cooperative character of Ca2+ binding.

Binding occurs with a sequential and cooperative mechanism (2Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereby the enzyme is stabilized in the “E1” state. An important discovery for the understanding of the Ca2+ binding topology within the SERCA molecule was achieved when single mutations of specific residues in the transmembrane domain were found to interfere with Ca2+inhibition of enzyme phosphorylation by Pi (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Based on this interference, it was proposed that the six residues participate in Ca2+ complexation within the transmembrane domain (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In fact it was shown by molecular modeling (21Inesi G. Lewis D. Nikic D. Hussain A. Kirtley M.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 185-215PubMed Google Scholar) that within the constraints imposed by the positions of these residues on four transmembrane helices, it is possible to arrange their oxygen functions to form a duplex calcium binding site with distribution and distances compatible with other duplex sites of known crystal structure, such as that of thermolysin (22Holmes M.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar).Several attempts have been made to assign the oxygen functions of the six amino acids implicated in binding to either calcium ion of the duplex complex (21Inesi G. Lewis D. Nikic D. Hussain A. Kirtley M.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 185-215PubMed Google Scholar, 23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additional amino acids within a neighboring cytosolic segment have been also implicated (5Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. De Gracia A.G. Soulié S. Centeno F. Moller J.V. Champeil P. Le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, a shortcoming of this work has been the lack of direct Ca2+binding measurements with the mutants, because of the low quantities of recombinant protein. The only mutant tested for binding was Glu309 → Gln expressed in insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (3Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This measurement required solubilization of the membrane-bound enzyme, purification by affinity chromatography, and reconstitution in liposomes, leaving some uncertainty on the detergent effect on binding and the orientation of the reconstituted enzyme in the liposomal membrane. Alternatively, “Ca2+occlusion” was measured in the presence of Cr-ATP (4Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which stabilizes the enzyme in a state similar to that obtained by enzyme phosphorylation with ATP. An advantage of our present experiments is that Ca2+ binding was measured in the absence of ATP under equilibrium conditions yielding strictly the E1 state. Another advantage is the use of wild type and mutant proteins assembled in native microsomal membrane with no need for detergent solubilization.Our measurements demonstrate that the Glu771 → Gln, Asp800 → Asn, Thr799 → Ala, and Glu908 → Ala mutations result in total loss of Ca2+ binding in the presence of 20 μmCa2+ (Table I). The strong inhibition of Ca2+binding in the first two mutants may be explained by considering that Glu771 and Asp800 could contribute electronegativity to both calcium ions, each donating its carboxyl oxygen to one calcium and its carbonyl oxygen to the other. Yet, it is remarkable that mutation of a single one of the acidic amino acids to its corresponding amide (thereby leaving the carbonyl oxygen in place) results in interference with binding of both calcium ions and with inhibition of the Pi reaction by Ca2+ (TableI).The strong inhibition of Ca2+ binding by the Thr799 → Ala and Glu908 → Ala mutations is also remarkable, because Thr can contribute only one hydroxyl group to the coordination complex. Furthermore, Glu908 appears to contribute only a carbonyl group because the Glu908 → Gln mutation does not have functional consequences (18Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Strock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is then apparent that the oxygen functions of Glu771, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908 provide important stabilization to the cooperative Ca2+ complex, either by direct interaction with Ca2+ or by participation in hydrogen bonding with water or peptide amide functions, so much so that mutational interference with a single one of these functions results in major disruption of the duplex binding site. These effects, however, can be overcome by increasing the Ca2+concentration (18Chen L. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Zhong L. Strock C. Kirtley M.E. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10745-10752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that mutational disruption affects the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+.It is noteworthy that our finding of strong binding inhibition in the Glu908 → Ala mutant in the absence of ATP (i.e. E1 state) is in apparent contrast with the Ca2+ occlusion by the same mutant in the presence of Cr-ATP (4Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the high concentration of Ca2+ used in these experiments (23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Although we observed strong inhibition of Ca2+ binding with the mutants mentioned above we found that in the presence of 20 μm Ca2+ and pH 7.0, the Glu309→ Gln and Asn796 → Ala mutations result in reduction of Ca2+ binding to approximately half the level observed with wild type enzyme (Fig. 6). At pH 6.2, on the other hand, the Glu309 → Gln mutant exhibits no significant Ca2+ binding, whereas the Asn796 → Ala mutant retains the same binding as at neutral pH. This suggests that ionization of acidic functions of other amino acids (e.g. Glu771 or Asp800) occurs as the pH is shifted from 6.2 to 7.0, thereby facilitating Ca2+ binding in the Glu309 → Gln mutant. On the other hand, in the Asn796 → Ala mutant, the presence of the Glu309 acidic function allows binding of inhibitory Ca2+ even at pH 6.2.The lack of Ca2+ inhibition of the Pi reaction in the mutants allowing no Ca2+ binding is well understandable. On the other hand, the strong inhibition of the Pi reaction in mutants permitting binding of half the normal Ca2+ level suggests that (a ) these mutant molecules bind only one of two Ca2+ known to bind to the wild type enzyme and (b ) the single bound Ca2+is sufficient to inhibit the Pi reaction. Experimental demonstration of the inhibition of the Pi reaction by single Ca2+ binding is quite satisfactory, because it is observed in both Asn796 → Ala and Glu309 → Gln mutants at pH 7.0 and only in the former mutant at pH 6.2.That a single Ca2+ may be sufficient to inhibit the Pi reaction was previously suggested based upon the effects of sequential (and negatively cooperative) binding of strontium to sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (26Fujimori T. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18475-18487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on different effects of various mutations on the inhibition of the Pi reaction by Ca2+ (23Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our direct measurements of Ca2+binding at pH 7.0 and 6.2 in parallel with phosphorylation experiments confirm that in the Asn796 → Ala and Glu309→ Gln mutants, at suitable Ca2+ and H+concentrations, a single Ca2+ is sufficient to inhibit the Pi reaction. This would be unlikely to occur in the wild type enzyme, because of the highly cooperative character of Ca2+ binding. Equilibrium and kinetic experiments have demonstrated that in the absence of ATP, SERCA binds Ca2+ with a stoichiometry of two Ca2+/enzyme. Binding occurs with a sequential and cooperative mechanism (2Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dupont Y.

Different Effects of Gsα Splice Variants on β2-Adrenoreceptor-mediated Signaling: THE β -ADRENORECEPTOR COUPLED TO THE LONG SPLICE VARIANT OF G α HAS PROPERTIES OF A CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE RECEPTORJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 273Issue 18PreviewThe β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) couples to the G-protein Gs to mediate adenylyl cyclase activation. The splice variants of Gsα differ by a 15-amino acid insert between the Ras-like domain and the α-helical domain. The long splice variant of Gsα (GsαL) binds GDP with lower affinity than the short splice variant (GsαS), but the impact of this difference on the interaction of Gsα with the β2AR is not known. We studied the β2AR/Gsα interaction using receptor/G-protein fusion proteins (β2ARGsαS and β2ARGsαL) expressed in Sf9 cells.

The association of a wide array of accessory proteins with RNAP is critical for the regulation of each phase of the transcription cycle: initiation, elongation, and termination. In addition to accessory factors that interact with RNAP to regulate the transcription process, protein-protein interactions couple RNAP to proteins participating in other cellular processes such as DNA repair (1Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). During the development of purification procedures for Escherichia coli RNAP, we noticed the consistent co-purification of a 110-kDa polypeptide. The presence of this contaminant through the last step of varying purification procedures suggested that it was a previously unidentified factor specifically associated with the RNAP. Here, we identify the 110-kDa contaminant as the product of the hepA gene, a putative helicase with extensive sequence similarity to the SNF2 family of proteins (2Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V.

Some members of this family, which contains proteins from viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic species, are DNA-dependent ATPases and participate in cellular processes such as transcription regulation or DNA repair. We have cloned thehepA gene and overexpressed and purified the HepA protein. We show in vitro that RNAP preparations have an ATPase activity only in the presence of HepA and that HepA binds core RNAP competitively with the promoter specificity ς70 subunit with a 1:1 stoichiometry and a dissociation constant (K d) of 75 nm. An E. coli strain with a disruption in the hepA gene shows sensitivity to the DNA damaging agent UV light. The hepA gene was PCR amplified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) genomic DNA using the following primers: HEPAleft, 5′-GCCGAACACCCATGGCTTTTACACTTGGTC-3′; HEPAright, 5′-CCATTTTCGGATCCGTTACTGATGCGTTACAACG-3′.Nco I and Bam HI sites were engineered into HEPAleft and HEPAright, respectively (underlined), to allow digestion of the amplified products and subsequent ligation into the corresponding sites of the T7-based expression vector pET15b (Novagen) to generate pET15b-HepA. The cloning created a mutation in the second amino acid of the protein (from Pro to Ala) as well as a Gln to Arg mutation of the terminal amino acid. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET15b-HepA, grown to anA 600 of 0.6, and induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm. Induction was allowed to proceed for 4 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. The cells were thawed, resuspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was spun to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was collected and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) was slowly added to a final concentration of 0.8% (w/v). The PEI pellet was resuspended in TEGD (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) + 1 m NaCl, eluting HepA. The HepA containing supernatant was then precipitated by slowly adding 35 g of (NH4)2SO4/100 ml of solution while stirring, incubating for 15 min, and then centrifuging for 45 min at 11,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TEGD + 0.5m NaCl, and the sample was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column. The HepA containing fractions, which were determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, were pooled and precipitated again with (NH4)2SO4 as described above. The pellet was resuspended in TEGD and diluted with TEGD until the conductivity was less than TEGD + 0.2 m NaCl. The sample was then loaded onto a Poros HQ (PerSeptive Biosystems) anion exchange column equilibrated in TEGD + 0.2 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.2 to 0.5 m. The peak of HepA eluted at approximately 0.3 m NaCl. At this stage, the protein was >95% homogeneous as judged by overloaded SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Nevertheless, a contaminating DNase activity was still present, which was effectively removed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Throughout the purification procedure, protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and measuring the absorbance at 595 nm. 50 pmol of HepA protein was added to 25 pmol of core RNAP in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol. Samples were left to incubate for 15 min at 37 °C. Xylene cyanol was added to 0.25% prior to loading on a 5% polyacrylamide (29.2:0.8 acrylamide:bis) nondenaturing gel (6Zou C. Nobuyuki F. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in Tris-glycine running buffer, pH 8.3. The gels were electrophoresed at 20–30 mA until the xylene cyanol had migrated about three-fourths the length of the gel. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. To unambiguously identify the protein contents of the visualized bands, the protein bands of interest were excised from the gel with a scalpel, crushed, and left to soak for 10 min in SDS loading buffer supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Novex). For competition binding studies, 50 pmol of HepA protein was added to 25 pmol of core RNAP and incubated as above to form the core RNAP-HepA complex. 50 pmol ς70 was then added and incubated for another 15 min at 37 °C. Similarly, 50 pmol ς70 was incubated with core RNAP to form holoenzyme, which was then incubated with 50 pmol HepA. The samples were then analyzed by the native gel shift assay described above, along with excision of the bands and SDS-PAGE to determine the protein content of the bands. For the quantitative binding assays to determine the dissociation constant and stoichiometry of the HepA-core RNAP interaction, calf heart protein kinase was used to phosphorylate HepA. HepA (20 μg) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and 100 units of calf heart protein kinase (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT. The phosphorylation reaction proceeded for 10 min at 30 °C. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed from the reaction mixture by buffer exchange using a Microcon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon) into 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol. Varying amounts of HepA protein (1–12 pmol) were added to 3 pmol core RNAP and incubated as above. The samples were then analyzed by the native gel shift assay. The bound and free HepA was quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Storm). Insertion inactivation mutants of the hepA gene were constructed using a modified version of a gene replacement method (7Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create a partial deletion in the hepA locus. The Sma I-digested kanamycin (Km) resistance cassette from pBRΩkm2 (8Perez-Casal J. Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was inserted into the end-filled PmlI site of pET15b-HepA using standard molecular biology procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), resulting in a plasmid that carried an interrupted copy of the hepA gene (at codon 304 of 969). The hepA-Km r cassette was then excised from pET15b-HepA with Sph I and BspDI and ligated into the Sph I and Acc I sites of pMAK705 (7Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to construct pSD4. E. coli strains NM522 (Invitrogen) and JC7623 (recBC sbcBC ; Ref. 10Horii Z.I. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) were then transformed with pSD4 and selected for Km and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance at 30 °C. Single colonies were transferred to Luria Broth (LB) containing both Km and Cm and grown at 44 °C until turbid. Dilutions were spread onto prewarmed plates containing both antibiotics and incubated at 44 °C to select for cointegrates. The plasmid was then resolved by growing colonies for one cycle at 30 °C in the presence of both antibiotics until turbid (overnight) in 100 ml of LB. 100 μl of turbid culture was then inoculated into 100 ml of LB containing Km but not Cm, and two cycles of growth were allowed. Single colonies were then selected on media containing Km and grown at 30 °C. Cms-Kmr clones were selected by duplicate plating on media containing both antibiotics. Chromosomal insertion into hepA was verified by both PCR analysis as well as Southern analysis. Highly purified fractions of HepA from the Superose 6 column were assayed for their ability to hydrolyze the γ-phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP (11Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1223-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Reactions (10 μl) contained 10 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 μl of each protein fraction. The reactions proceeded at 25 °C for 3 h and were terminated by spotting 1 μl on a PEI-F cellulose plate (J. T. Baker). The plates were developed in a solution of 0.5m LiCl, 1 m formic acid and visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager. ATPase assays were also performed in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, double-stranded or single-stranded (boiled) salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), M13 single-stranded DNA, double-stranded or single-stranded (boiled) pBR322 plasmid DNA, or core RNAP. For the experiment shown in Fig. 3 C , the plasmid pHepA was constructed by cloning the Nde I-Hin dIII fragment (containing the HepA gene) from pET15b-HepA into the corresponding sites of the polylinker of pTrc99c (22Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.-J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid expressed HepA under the control of the IPTG-inducible Trc promoter. RNAP was purified by a standard procedure (12Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 13Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R.

The purified RNAP samples were tested for ATPase activity using the same assay as described above. The hepA mutants, NM522ΔhepA and JC7623ΔhepA , as well as the parental strains, NM522 and JC7623, were tested for resistance to UV exposure as follows. Cells were grown in 10 ml of LB to an optical density of 0.6–0.7. In a dark room, cells were exposed to a handheld UV light (254 nm, 4 W, 20–25 cm distance) in 1-min increments up to 6 min. Dilutions were plated, and the percentage of survival was calculated by comparing colony forming units against control samples not exposed to UV. The initial observation that formed the impetus for this study is illustrated in Fig. 1. In attempting to purify RNAP by a standard procedure (12Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 13Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R.

Cell. 1995; 83: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) from E. coli RL324 (harboring a C-terminal His6 tag in the chromosomal copy ofrpoC , which codes for the RNAP β′ subunit, obtained from R. L. Landick), we noticed nearly stoichiometric amounts of a contaminating protein with a mobility by SDS-PAGE corresponding to about 110 kDa. The contaminating protein was present through the final step of purification in some core RNAP and holoenzyme fractions off an anion exchange column (Fig. 1, fractions 11 , 12 ,16 , and 17 ). The contaminant was also present through the last step of a different purification procedure utilizing Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The presence of nearly stoichiometric amounts of the 110-kDa contaminant through the final steps of two different purification procedures suggested that this protein interacts with the RNAP itself. The 110-kDa protein was also present after purification of RNAP from E. coli JC7623 (10Horii Z.I. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the parent strain of RL324 containing the wild-type rpoC gene, eliminating the possibility that the 110-kDa contaminant adventitiously associated with the RNAP from RL324 through the His6 tag at the C terminus of the β′ subunit. The N-terminal sequence of the 110-kDa contaminant was determined to beX PFTLGQRWISDTESELGL. A data base search revealed a single match to the product of an open reading frame denoted hepA (helicase putative; Refs. 15Iwasaki H. Ishino Y. Toh H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Mol. Gen.

The inferred amino acid sequence of HepA contained amino acid sequence similarity with motifs I, II, and III of the six “DEAD box” helicase motifs (2Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Domchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Later, a frameshift in the original DNA sequence was postulated that revealed that the downstream sequences also contained DEAD box helicase motifs V and VI (3Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Based on extensive sequence similarity, HepA has already been grouped with the SNF2 family of putative helicases (3Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We used PCR methods to clone the hepA gene into a T7-based overexpression vector (18Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Because of ambiguity in the HepA sequence between helicase motifs III and V (where the frameshift was proposed to occur but its exact location could not be determined; Ref. 3Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we sequenced this region of the gene. The sequencing confirmed the presence of a frameshift in the original sequence. The correct sequence gave rise to a peptide of 969 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 109,700 Da, consistent with the SDS-PAGE mobility. Between the time our sequencing was completed and this manuscript was written, an updated sequence of this region of the E. coli genome was submitted to GenBank (accession number AE000116U00096). This sequence exactly matched our sequence. When induced with IPTG, HepA was expressed to very high levels comprising nearly 50% of total cellular protein. Overexpression of the protein had no obvious toxic effects. Upon cell lysis, the bulk of the overexpressed HepA was found in the soluble fraction. We purified the overexpressed HepA with a procedure similar to that used to purify RNAP (14Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the final step of purification by anion exchange chromatography, the RNAP and HepA bound to the column in buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. The excess HepA that was not associated with RNAP eluted from the column during a NaCl gradient at about 0.3 m NaCl. The resulting HepA was >95% homogeneous (based on overloaded, Coomassie-stained SDS gels), but in subsequent experiments it became clear that a substantial DNase activity either was associated with HepA or was contaminating it. We therefore performed an additional step of purification, gel filtration over a Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. This effectively removed the DNase activity from the HepA protein. With the highly purified HepA in hand, we asked whether HepA formed a stable complex with RNAP in vitro , as suggested above. For this purpose, we used a native gel shift assay (Fig.2 A ). When RNAP holoenzyme was mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of purified HepA and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, bands corresponding to free HepA and free RNAP holoenzyme were observed (Fig. 2 A , lane 1 ). Because mobility on the native gel is determined by both molecular weight and charge, the band in Fig.2 A corresponding to RNAP holoenzyme could conceivably contain a holoenzyme-HepA complex with the same mobility as holoenzyme. Therefore, we confirmed the protein components of the bands labeled in Fig. 2 A by excising them and analyzing their contents by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B ). By this method, the band labeledA in Fig. 2 A contains only β′, β, ς70, α, and ω, the components of holoenzyme (Fig.2 B , lane A ). Core RNAP alone gave rise to two bands on the native gel (Fig. 2 A , lane 5 ), likely because of the presence of core RNAP monomers and dimers in equilibrium (14Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A mixture of HepA and core RNAP (2:1 molar ratio) yielded a band corresponding to free HepA and a band distinct from the bands observed for core RNAP alone (Fig. 2 A , lane 4 , band C ). This distinct band contained β′, β, α, and ω (the components of core RNAP) and an apparently stoichiometric amount of HepA, based on the intensity of the Coomassie stain (Fig.2 B , lane C ). Thus, we conclude that HepA forms a stable complex with core RNAP but not holoenzyme. Additional experiments were conducted in which preformed complexes of core RNAP/HepA were challenged with an equimolar amount of ς70 or RNAP holoenzyme (core RNAP/ς70) was challenged with an equimolar amount of HepA. ς70effectively displaced HepA from core RNAP, whereas HepA was unable to displace ς70 (data not shown). We adventitiously found that treatment of purified HepA with [γ-32P]ATP and calf heart protein kinase resulted in covalent labeling of HepA with [32P]. We took advantage of this ability to radioactively label HepA to quantitate its interaction with core RNAP. Increasing amounts of labeled HepA were mixed with a constant amount of core RNAP, incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to form a complex, and then analyzed by the native gel shift assay (Fig. 2 C ). The amounts of free HepA and HepA associated with RNAP (and therefore shifted to the lower mobility band) were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis of the gels. A Scatchard analysis of the results (Fig. 2 D ) revealed that HepA interacts with core RNAP in a 1:1 complex with a dissociation constant (K d) of 75 nm. The finding that HepA binds core RNAP and not holoenzyme is not in contradiction to our earlier finding that HepA contaminated purified fractions of both core RNAP and holoenzyme off the final MonoQ column fractionation (Fig. 1). During the purification of overexpressed, free HepA, we found that it eluted from the MonoQ column at about 0.3m NaCl, about the same as core RNAP (13Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe the HepA found in core RNAP fractions (Fig. 1, lanes 11 and 12 ) corresponds to the unbound fraction of HepA, whereas the HepA found in holoenzyme fractions (Fig. 1, lanes 16 and 17 ) corresponds to HepA in the core RNAP-HepA complex, which co-elutes roughly with holoenzyme. This is possible because the molar amount of ς70 is roughly half that of the RNAP. Based on the Coomassie-stained bands, it appears that roughly 60% of the HepA is bound to RNAP, whereas about 40% is found in the unbound fraction. To assess the role of HepA in cellular processes, we constructed an insertion of a Kmr cassette at codon 304 (between helicase motifs II and III) in the genomic hepA gene of two separate strains of E. coli , NM522, and JC7623 (recBC sbcBC ; Ref. 10Horii Z.I. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Insertion of the Kmrcassette at this position of the hepA gene results in a predicted protein product less than one-third the length of full-length HepA and containing only two of the six helicase motifs (I and II). Thus, the normal function of HepA was undoubtedly disrupted. The two E. coli strains with the disrupted hepA gene (JC7623ΔhepA and NM522ΔhepA ) did not exhibit any obvious growth phenotypes over a temperature range of 25–45 °C. Because of the role, or suspected role, of many SNF2 family members in various DNA repair processes, we tested JC7623ΔhepA and NM522ΔhepA for their ability to survive exposure to UV light, which is known to cause DNA damage. An example of the results is shown in Fig.3, where survival of JC7623 and JC7623ΔhepA to increasing times of UV exposure is compared. The results, tabulated in TableI, show clearly that the hepA gene disruption in JC7623ΔhepA and NM522ΔhepA results in significantly reduced survival to UV exposure compared with the parent strains JC7623 and NM522.Table IhepA disruption reduces survival to UV exposureE. coli strainρuv1-aDetermined from the slope of the best fit line by linear regression according to the equation (% survival) = 100 × 10ρuvt where t is time of UV exposure in minutes.min−1JC7623−0.081JC7623ΔhepA−0.22NM522−0.14NM522ΔhepA−0.281-a Determined from the slope of the best fit line by linear regression according to the equation (% survival) = 100 × 10ρuvt where t is time of UV exposure in minutes. Open table in a new tab Because several members of the SNF2 family have been shown to be DNA-dependent ATPases (5Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), we tested fractions of the highly purified HepA from the Superose 6 gel filtration column for ATPase activity. Ability to hydrolyze the γ-phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP was monitored by thin layer chromatography (11Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1223-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), revealing an ATPase activity above background (Fig.4 A ). The ATPase activity in each fraction was nearly exactly proportional to the protein concentration in the fraction (Fig. 4 B ). To rule out the possibility that this weak ATPase activity arose from a contaminant of the purified HepA preparation, we compared the ATPase activity of purified RNAP from JC7623ΔhepA and JC7623ΔhepA /pHepA (JC7623ΔhepA transformed with a plasmid expressing HepA under the control of the Trc promoter). As expected, the purified RNAP from JC7623ΔhepA /pHepA induced with IPTG contained HepA (Fig. 4 C , lane 2 ), whereas RNAP from JC7623ΔhepA did not (Fig.4 C , lane 3 ). An ATPase assay of these same samples indicated that RNAP from JC7623ΔhepA had ATPase activity similar to a background sample with no added protein (Fig.4 C , lanes 6 and 7 ), whereas RNAP from JC7623ΔhepA /pHepA had ATPase activity well above background (Fig. 4 C , lane 5 ). Thus, we conclude that RNAP preparations have an ATPase activity only in the presence of HepA. This ATPase activity was not DNA- or RNA-dependent and was not stimulated by the addition of tRNA, double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, or core RNAP (data not shown). We have identified HepA, an E. coli protein that shares extensive sequence homology with the SNF2 family of putative helicases (3Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 17Lewis L.K. Jenkins M.E. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as an RNAP-associated factor. We cloned and purified HepA and showed that RNAP preparations have an ATPase activity only in the presence of HepA and that HepA associates with core RNAP in vitro (but not holoenzyme). We disrupted the hepA gene in E. coli , resulting in a phenotype displaying sensitivity to UV exposure The SNF2 family includes proteins from viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic species with roles in cellular processes such as cell cycle control (STH1), transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (ATR-X, BRM, hBRM, MOT1, ISW1, and SNF2), nucleotide excision repair (RAD16 and ERCC6), mitotic recombination (RAD54), and other types of DNA repair (RAD5). The family also includes many proteins with no known function. HepA is predicted to be an ATPase based on its extensive sequence similarity with other ATPases, and thus the ATPase activity associated with RNAP preparations only in the presence of HepA is likely to belong to HepA itself. The results of our experiments, however, do not rule out the possibility that the ATPase activity is associated with another protein (perhaps the RNAP itself) and that this activity is greatly stimulated by HepA. In contrast to SNF2 family members that have been shown to have ATPase activity (Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF2 and MOT1, human HIP116A); however, this ATPase activity does not appear to be DNA-dependent. The close relationship between the SNF2 family of proteins and known helicases (2Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Domchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) led us to test the purified HepA protein for helicase activity on various DNA and RNA substrates. Helicase activity has not been demonstrated for any SNF2 family member, and we were unable to detect any activity for HepA (data not shown). Because of the observed association between HepA and core RNAP, we also tested the effect of purified HepA protein on various in vitro transcription assays. We tested the effect of HepA on abortive initiation (19McClure W.R. Cech C.L. Johnston D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by ς70 holoenzyme at the T7 A1 promoter. We also formed ternary elongation complexes containing a 20-mer transcript on the T7 A1 tr2 transcription unit (20Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), added HepA, and then added nucleotides to initiate transcription elongation. We then examined the effect of HepA on transcription pausing, on the overall transcription elongation rate, and on termination at tr2. Finally, we formed the 20-mer ternary complexes on the T7 A1 tr2 transcription unit and then added ATP and HepA and tested for displacement of the ternary complexes. In all of these investigations, we could not observe any effect of the purified HepA protein on abortive initiation, transcription elongation, or termination or on the stability of the stalled ternary complexes (data not shown). We constructed insertion inactivation mutants of hepA to obtain clues to the role HepA plays in cellular processes. ThehepA disruption mutants were sensitive to UV exposure, suggesting that they were defective in some DNA repair process. The finding that HepA associates with RNAP links HepA with transcription, whereas the data from the hepA gene disruptions link HepA with DNA repair. It is interesting to note that the original observation of HepA co-purification with RNAP came from E. coli RL324 (harboring a C-terminal His6 tag in the chromosomal copy ofrpoC , which codes for the RNAP β′ subunit, obtained from R. L. Landick), and subsequently from E. coli JC7623 (10Horii Z.I. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the parent strain of RL324 containing the wild-typerpoC gene, eliminating the possibility that HepA adventitiously associated with the RNAP from RL324 through the His6 tag at the C terminus of the β′ subunit. Although we have found HepA co-purification with RNAP from other E. coli strains, the amounts of HepA associated with RNAP in these two strains is always substantially greater, suggesting that expression of HepA is up-regulated in these strains. Both RL324 and its parent JC7623 arerecBC sbcBC mutants. These mutations in the RecBCD enzyme complex are necessary for the efficient transformation of linear DNA into E. coli and were thus used for the construction of RL324. The RecBCD enzyme complex plays important roles in both recombination and DNA repair pathways. Thus, it is interesting to speculate that the possible disruption of RecBCD function may be compensated by increased expression of HepA, which we have linked to DNA repair. We thank Dr. A. J. Clark for providing the E. coli strain JC7623."

To study functional roles of the Arg306 region, overlapping 15-mer peptides representing the sequence of factor Va residues 271–345 were synthesized and screened for anticoagulant activities. The peptide containing residues 311–325 (VP311) noncompetitively inhibited prothrombin activation by factor Xa, but only in the presence of factor Va.

Diisopropylphosphoryl factor Xa and factor Xa but not factor VII/VIIa or prothrombin bound to immobilized VP311 with relatively high affinity. These results support the hypothesis that residues 311–325, which are positioned between the A1 and A2 domains of factor Va and likely exposed to solvent, contribute to the binding of factor Xa by factor Va. Based on this hypothesis, it is suggested that cleavage by activated protein C at Arg306 in factor Va not only severs the covalent connection between the A1 and A2 domains but also disrupts the environment and structure of residues 311–325, thereby down-regulating the binding of factor Xa to factor Va.

Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Stenflo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 355-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Irreversible proteolytic inactivation of FVa by APC is reported to be associated with three cleavages at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679 in the FVa heavy chain, whereas cleavage at only Arg306 in FV causes full loss of its activity (10Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of specific cleavages has been studied using purified Gln506-FVa that lacks the Arg506 cleavage site (11Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Inactivation of FVa by APC proceeds via a biphasic reaction that consists of a rapid and a slow phase. The rapid phase is associated with an initial cleavage at Arg506 and partial loss of activity (∼30%), whereas extensive or complete inactivation of FVa requires cleavage at Arg306. The contribution of cleavage at Arg679to FVa inactivation is presently unclear. All published results suggest that cleavage at Arg306 plays the most important role for inactivation of FVa as well as for FV. Inactivation of FVa by APC is associated with loss of the ability of FVa to bind FXa and with dissociation of the A2 domain of FVa from the rest of the cleaved FVa (15Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13986-13992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol.

To help clarify why cleavage at Arg306inactivates FV and FVa, overlapping 15-mer peptides representing FVa heavy chain residues 271–345 were synthesized and screened for their ability to inhibit prothrombin activation using purified prothrombinase components. The results presented here suggest that the region between the A1 and A2 domains of FVa involving residues 311–325 of FVa provides a binding site for FXa and implies that APC cleavage at Arg306 down-regulates FVa activity, at least in part, by disrupting the immediate environment and/or structure of this FXa-binding site. Peptides with amino-terminal α-amino groups and carboxyl-terminal carboxamide moieties were prepared under the supervision of Dr. Richard Houghten of the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies using the simultaneous multiple synthesis method (17Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) and were analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectral analysis to verify purity and composition (17Houghten R.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, some peptides were synthesized by and purchased from the Peptide Synthesis Group (Beckman Center, Stanford University, Palo Alto CA). Human FVa, prothrombin, and phospholipid vesicles (20% phosphatidylserine, 80% phosphatidylcholine) were prepared as described (18Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 2728-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Human FXa was purchased from Enzyme Research Labs (South Bend, IN). Diisopropylphosphoryl (DIP)-FXa (≥ 99% inactivated) was prepared by incubation of FXa at 1 mg/ml with 2 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma) on ice for 2 h followed by prolonged dialysis at 4 °C against Tris-buffered saline (0.05m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4). Human 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-factor Xa (DEGR-Xa) was purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). FVII/VIIa and rabbit anti-FVII were purchased from Celsus (Cincinnati OH), and monoclonal antibody against prothrombin was from Biodesign (Kennebunk, ME). Prothrombinase assays were performed at room temperature as described elsewhere (19Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and employed 20 pm FVa, 1 nm FXa, 25 μm or 50 μm phospholipid vesicles, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.3 μm prothrombin unless otherwise indicated in buffer containing 0.05 m Hepes, 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The rate of prothrombin activation was assessed using the chromogenic substrate H-d-cyclohexylglycyl-l-α-aminobutyryl-l-arginine-p -nitroanilide (final concentration, 0.2 mm) (American Bioproducts, Parsippany, NJ) in an EL312 microplate reader using Kineti-calc software (Biotek, Winooski, VT). It should be noted that this amidolytic assay cannot distinguish formation of α-thrombin from meizo-thrombin. Fluorescence titrations were performed using an SLM Aminco Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY) following the procedures of Krishnaswamy et al. (21Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For these experiments the excitation wavelength was 340 nm (band pass, 4 nm) and the emission wavelength was 545 nm (band pass, 16 nm). A 408-nm-long pass filter (KV-408) was used in the emission path to minimize scattered light artifacts. All buffers were filtered with 0.2-μm filters, and protein solutions were centrifuged to remove particulate matter. The sample compartment was maintained at 25 °C with a circulating water bath. Microliter additions of a 1 mm stock solution of peptide or buffer alone were added to a square 5-mm path length cuvette containing 300 μl of reaction mixture of DEGR-Xa at 200 nm in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and fluorescence intensity measurements were made 1 min after each addition. Three 5-s readings were made and averaged to determine the final value. Three titrations were done to allow for correction of fluorescence intensity values because of light scattering or any other artifacts. Titration A involved additions of peptide to DEGR-Xa. Titration B involved additions of control buffer to DEGR-Xa. Titration C involved additions of peptide to buffer alone. The corrected fluorescence change was then calculated according to the expression FFo=FA−FCFB−FC′Equation 1 where F A, F B, andF C are the fluorescent intensities from the above titration mixtures and F C′ is the intensity recorded for control buffer alone in the absence of added peptide. The net fluorescence intensity change (F/Fo ) was converted to percent, and nonlinear least squares regression was used to fit the data to the single ligand binding equation ΔF=ΔFmax[P]Kd+[P]Equation 2 where [P] is the peptide concentration. TheK d and ΔFmax were derived from data fitted using this equation. Binding assays were performed as described (19Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides at 20 μm were coated on the wells of Xenobind microtiter plates (Xenopore, Saddle Brook, NJ) according to manufacturer's instructions and then blocked with 3% hydrolyzed fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline. After washing the plate with Tris-buffered saline, various concentrations of DIP-FXa or FXa in binding buffer consisting of 0.05 m Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.5% porcine skin gelatin (Sigma) were incubated in plate wells for 1 h at room temperature. Following washings, bound DIP-Xa was detected using a monoclonal antibody to FX (purified IgG from Biodesign), which was quantitated with biotin-secondary antibody, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase, and phosphatase substrate as described (19Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of bound factor VII/VIIa and prothrombin was similarly made using appropriate antibodies. Detection of bound FXa was made using a chromogenic substrateN -α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-l-glycyl-l-arginine-p -nitroanilide (Chromogenix, Franklin, OH). The absorbance values observed for duplicate noncoated wells lacking peptides served as nonspecific controls for binding and were subtracted from absorbance values for corresponding duplicate peptide-coated wells. Nonspecific binding ranged from 5 to 30% of total observed binding in various experiments. To clarify potential functional roles of the region around the APC cleavage site at Arg306 in the FVa heavy chain, seven overlapping 15-mer synthetic peptides representing FVa sequences from residues 271–345 (Table I) were tested for their ability to inhibit prothrombinase assays in the presence and absence of FVa (Fig. 1). At 100 μm, peptide VP311 strongly inhibited prothrombinase activity in the presence of FVa, whereas peptide VP321 had a moderate inhibitory effect on prothrombinase activity. In the absence of FVa, VP311 did not inhibit prothrombin activation; however, it modestly and reproducibly enhanced prothrombinase activity by 50% (Fig. 1). To define prothrombinase inhibition by peptides, various concentrations of peptides were preincubated with FXa, FVa, or prothrombin, followed by addition of other prothrombinase components for activity assays (Fig.2). VP311 inhibited prothrombinase activity only in the presence of FVa (Fig. 2 B ). In the absence of FVa, VP311 at 100–200 μm reproducibly modestly enhanced prothrombinase activity by approximately 50% (Figs.2 B and 3 B ). Peptide VP321 showed only moderate inhibition in the presence of FVa, whereas at 200 μm it also modestly enhanced prothrombinase activity in the absence of FVa (Fig. 2 C ). Peptide VP301, which contains Arg306 and peptide VP331, like VP271, VP281, and VP291 (Fig. 1 and data not shown), had no effect on prothrombinase activity under any preincubation conditions (Fig. 2, A andD ).Table ISequences of peptides representing factor V heavy chain amino acid sequencesPeptideResiduesSequenceVP271271–285TVGPEGKWIISSLTPVP281281–295SSLTPKHLQAGMQAYVP291291–305GMQAYIDIKNCPKKTVP301301–315CPKKTR306NLKKITREQVP311311–325ITREQRRHMKRWEYFVP321321–335RWEYFIAAEEVIWDYVP331331–345VIWDYAPVIPANMDK Open table in a new tab Figure 2Inhibition of prothrombinase by synthetic 15-mer peptides representing residues 301–345 of factor V.Peptides at various concentrations (0–200 μm) were preincubated with (preinc. w. ) 0.3 μmprothrombin (FII ) (•), 1 nm FXa (○), 20 pm FVa (×), or 0.3 μm prothrombin without subsequent FVa addition (▪) for 15 min at room temperature. Then the other prothrombinase components were added to initiate thrombin formation, except where the absence of FVa is indicated. The synthetic peptides (Table I) were VP301 (A ), VP311 (B ), VP321 (C ), and VP331 (D ). The percentage of prothrombinase activity (rate of thrombin formation) without peptide was defined as 100%.

Peptide VP311 (closed symbols and solid line ) or a control peptide, VP311 reverse, that contained the reverse amino acid sequence (open symbols and dashed line ) were preincubated at concentrations indicated for 30 s with FXa (circles ) or with FVa (triangles ) and phospholipids for 30 s prior to addition of other prothrombinase components to initiate thrombin formation. Prothrombinase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that the buffer contained 0.05 m NaCl. Inpanel B , FVa was omitted. Symbols represent the mean of two (panel A ) or three (panel B ) separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A control peptide with the reverse sequence of amino acids of VP311, designated VP311reverse, was synthesized and tested in parallel with VP311 for inhibition of prothrombinase. Fig. 3 A shows that under conditions where VP311 inhibited prothrombinase by up to 90%, peptide VP311reverse inhibited prothrombinase only slightly. In the absence of FVa (Fig. 3 B ) where VP311 at 100–200 μm stimulated prothrombinase activity by 80%, VP311reverse in contrast slightly inhibited prothrombinase activity just as it did in the presence of FVa. Moreover, the inhibition of prothrombinase by VP311 cannot be simply due to a net high positive charge effect or an effect due to adjacent basic residues because VP301, which also contains a high net positive charge and two sets of adjacent basic residues, did not inhibit prothrombinase activity (Fig. 1). These results suggest that residues 311–335 in the FVa heavy chain may contribute to FXa-FVa and/or prothrombin-FVa interactions. A series of Lineweaver-Burk plots for prothrombinase activity at varying prothrombin concentrations is seen in Fig.4 for various concentrations of VP311. Peptide VP311 inhibited prothrombinase activity with a pattern of noncompetitive inhibition, and the apparent K i under these experimental conditions was 140 μm. This suggests that the effect of VP311 is not explained by competition for binding of the substrate, prothrombin, to FVa. The specific binding of peptide VP311 to FXa was measured to test the hypothesis that the sequence of VP311 represents a FXa-binding site in FVa. Because we found that the addition of VP311 to DEGR-Xa quenched the dansyl fluorescence of the labeled protein, binding of VP311 to the protein in solution was monitored by fluorescence intensity changes of the dansyl group in DEGR-Xa (Fig. 5). The apparent K d of peptide VP311 for DEGR-Xa was determined, based on the average value from three experiments, to be 71 ± 9 μm with a ΔFmax of −39%. This agrees reasonably well with the concentration of peptide VP311 required for 50% inhibition of the prothrombinase assays,i.e. 40–140 μm (Figs. 2 B ,3 A , and 4). The VP311-dependent decrease in dansyl fluorescence of DEGR-FXa (Fig. 5) was specific because the control peptide VP311reverse at 0–100 μm did not cause a significant change (<4%) in dansyl fluorescence (data not shown). Moreover, peptide VP301 that has a high positive charge because of its Arg/Lys content and that contains Arg306, which presents the peptide bond cleaved during inactivation of FVa by activated protein C, did not cause a significant change in the fluorescence of DEGR-Xa. These data support the hypothesis that FVa residues 311–335 provide a binding site for FXa. An additional approach was used to assess the binding of VP311 to FXa in which FXa was bound to peptides immobilized on microtiter plates. In this type of solid phase binding assay that involves a small surface-bound peptide, apparent K d values may be significantly lower than apparent K d values determined in fluid phase binding assays, possibly because proteins have an abnormally low off-rate constant once bound near a surface that is multivalent because it is coated with ligand and possibly because the hydrophobic surface itself may contribute to protein binding. Furthermore, immobilized peptides have reduced degrees of freedom. Thus, apparent binding constants determined by solid phase assays cannot be considered to be real binding constants and cannot be compared with fluid phase real binding constants. Nevertheless, these types of assays can be useful to compare relative binding affinities for similar ligands. DIP-FXa and FXa bound tightly to immobilized VP311 (Fig. 6). Apparent K dvalues calculated by Scatchard analysis using Enzfitter software averaged 10 nm (n = 4 experiments) for DIP-FXa and 46 nm (n = 2 experiments) for FXa. This demonstrated that both normal FXa and FXa with a modified active site bound to VP311. As controls, factor VII/VIIa showed no binding to VP311 and prothrombin showed only weak binding (apparentK d > 400 nm) (Fig. 6). Moreover, FXa did not bind to the immobilized basic peptide VP301. These results further support the hypothesis that FVa residues 311–335 provide a FXa-binding site. Synthetic peptides that inhibit multicomponent enzyme complexes can provide useful information about protein-protein interactions. To identify potential roles in the prothrombinase complex of FVa heavy chain residues near the APC cleavage site at Arg306, seven 15-mer peptides representing FVa residues 271–345 were studied, and peptide VP311 (residues 311–325) was found to inhibit prothrombinase activity but only in the presence of FVa. The sequence of peptide VP311 represents a major part of the connecting region between the A1 (residues 1–301) and A2 (residues 320–656) domains of the heavy chain (residues 1–709) of FVa (6Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Inhibition of prothrombinase activity by VP311 only in the presence of FVa suggests that this connecting region of FVa containing residues 311–325 might contribute to FXa-FVa and/or prothrombin-FVa interactions. Alternatively or additionally, VP311 could inhibit prothrombinase activity by disrupting important FVa intramolecular interactions. Kinetic data showed prothrombinase inhibition by VP311 to be noncompetitive with respect to prothrombin, suggesting that VP311 is not simply competing for prothrombin binding to the prothrombinase complex. Human FVa heavy chain has 84% overall homology with bovine FVa heavy chain, whereas peptide VP311 has 12 of 15 residues identical in human and bovine FV. Protein regions with a high percentage of homology between different species are often functionally important. Peptide VP311 also has a sequence motif that is present in peptides representing sequences in APC and human group II secretory phospholipase A2 that have been implicated in prothrombinase inhibition. This motif (KRXX KR) is present in the inhibitory peptide 142–155, including residues 146–151 of APC (KRMEKK), which was shown to inhibit FXa coagulant activity in the presence of FVa (23Mesters R.M. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12656-12663Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A similar motif is present in phospholipase A2 from residues 52–57 (KRLEKR). A peptide from residues 51–74 of phospholipase A2 was found to bind specifically to FXa (24Mounier C. Hackeng T.M. Bon C. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; XX (abstr.): 293Google Scholar). This motif in peptide VP311 involving residues 315–320 (RRHMKR) may be responsible for binding to a specific FVa-binding exosite on FXa. Based on these three peptides, each of which inhibit prothrombinase only in the presence of FVa, the putative FXa-binding motif is (K/R)RXY K(R/K) where there may be a preference for E at residue Y and for a bulky hydrophobic or neutral side chain at residue X . The residues preceding the basic hexapeptide motif in the proteins include Trp, Tyr, and Gln and may indicate a requirement for a large side chain capable of H-bonding. To test the hypothesis that VP311 disrupts FXa-FVa interactions by binding to FXa, both solution phase and solid phase binding studies were performed. In solution, peptide VP311 bound to DEGR-Xa with aK d of 71 μm, whereas peptides VP311reverse and VP301 did not significantly bind to DEGR-Xa. TheK d of 71 μm based on fluorescence titrations is similar to the VP311 concentration 40–140 μm required for 50% inhibition of prothrombinase activity. The interactions of bovine factor Va and bovine DEGR-Xa have been studied (25Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding to DEGR-Xa factor Va causes an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the dansyl reporter group in DEGR-Xa. In the presence of phospholipid vesicles the calculatedK d of bovine factor Va for DEGR-Xa was 1 nm. Unlike these results peptide VP311 caused a quenching of dansyl fluorescence intensity rather than an increase. It is not entirely clear why the direction of the effect would be opposite of that for factor Va. However, because fluorescence intensity is dependent on a variety of factors, including protein conformation and solvent exposure, it should not be unexpected that two molecules of such drastically different size might have different effects on the fluorescent intensity of the dansyl group. Although protein binding studies using immobilized peptides do not yield real equilibrium binding constant values and cannot be compared with fluid phase binding constants, such studies can provide useful qualitative descriptions of binding and may allow comparisons of relative affinities for different ligands or peptides. Binding assays using immobilized peptides showed that DIP-FXa and FXa do bind to VP311 with relatively high affinity, whereas two homologous vitamin K-dependent proteins, factor VII and prothrombin, do not bind to immobilized VP311 with comparable measurable affinity. Thus, the fluid phase and the solid phase binding studies combined with the prothrombinase inhibition data support the hypothesis that FVa residues 311–325 contain a binding site for FXa. In the absence of FVa, peptide VP311 at 200 μmreproducibly mildly enhanced rather than inhibited FXa activity, possibly mimicking in some way the cofactor effect of FVa on FXa. This effect in the absence of FVa is consistent with the concept that the sequence of VP311 binds to FXa. The control peptide, VP311reverse, did not stimulate FXa activity, showing specificity for the normal 311–325 sequence. In parallel to the ability of VP311 to stimulate FXa activity in the absence of FVa, it was recently reported that a peptide corresponding to FVIII residues 698–712 enhances FIXa activity in the absence of FVIIIa, whereas the same FVIII peptide inhibits FIXa activity in the presence of FVIIIa (27Liles D.K. Monroe D.M. Roberts H.R. Blood. 1997; 90 (abstr.): 463Google Scholar). Thus, each respective peptide may represent a protease-binding site on the respective cofactors, and binding of each peptide may induce a conformational change in its respective coagulation protease, producing a mild enhancement of the protease activity that is much less effective than that of the intact cofactor. FV and FVIII possess a common domain structure, A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (6Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W.

There is approximately 40% amino acid sequence identity between FV and FVIII in the amino-terminal heavy chain regions (A1-A2), and the three A domains of FV and FVIII show a minimum of 30% identity with any other A domain (28Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. Mann K.G. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2971-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, schematic models of the structures of FVa and FVIIIa based on electron micrographs show certain similarities (29Fowler W.E. Fay P.J. Arvan D.S. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Mosesson M.W. Fass D.N. Lollar P. DiOrio J.P. Parker C.G. Knutson G.J. Hainfeld J.F. Wall J.S. J. Clin.

The three A domains of FV and FVIII resemble the three A domains of human ceruloplasmin whose three-dimensional structure was solved using x-ray crystallography (32Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Ceruloplasmin is a six-domain structure comprising a heterotrimer of heterodimers, each dimer containing two β-barrel structures homologous to plastocyanin (32Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 33Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A homology model of the three A domains of FVIII based on this ceruloplasmin structure has recently been published (34Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and another FVIII homology model based on nitrite reductase has appeared (35Pan Y. DeFay T. Gitschier J. Cohen F.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The FVIII homology models propose that the A1-A2-A3 domains of FVIIIa form a trimer of heterodimers, with each domain containing two similar but distinct β-barrel plastocyanin-like structures (34Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the homologies of FV, FVIII, and ceruloplasmin, some reasonable though speculative insights about FVa structure may be drawn from inspection of the FVIII homology model and the ceruloplasmin x-ray crystallographic structure. The APC cleavage site at Arg306in the FVa heavy chain is in the solvent-exposed sequence (residues 302–319) connecting the A1 and A2 domains, and VP311 contains much of this sequence that is easily accessible to FXa and/or APC. Binding of FXa to this connecting region could block the accessibility of Arg306 to APC, thereby causing the known protective effect of FXa against FVa cleavage by APC (36Suzuki K. Stenflo J.A.

Furthermore, the APC cleavage site at Arg506 in FVa is situated between the two plastocyanin-like β-barrels of the A2 domain and is exposed to solvent, homologous to Arg562 in FVIIIa (35Pan Y. DeFay T. Gitschier J. Cohen F.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the prothrombinase complex, FVa and FXa interact stoichiometrically and FVa has an extended binding site for FXa with contributions from both the heavy and light chains (2Tracy P.B. Mann K.G.

Xue J. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6538-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Included in this extended binding interaction are residues 311–325, as shown here, and residues 493–506, which were previously shown to interact with FXa (44Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; (abstr.): 599PubMed Google Scholar). In the human ceruloplasmin x-ray crystallographic structure the sequences homologous to residues 493–506 and 311–325 of FVa are adjacent on the protein surface and are generally within 9–20 Å of one another (32Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Inspection of the FVIIIa homology model structure of Pemberton et al. (34Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the peptides homologous to these two sequences of FVa are directly adjacent to one another on the surface of the “bottom” of the protein. The distance in the FVIIIa model between the α-carbons of FVIII residues 562 and 385 (corresponding to FV residues 506 and 325) is 15.1 Å, and the α-carbons of FVIII residues 561 and 382 (corresponding to FV residues 505 and 322) are 9.2 Å apart. Because cleavage at Arg306 in FV or FVa causes loss of most or all FVa activity, whereas cleavage at only Arg506 ablates approximately 30% of FVa activity (10Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabringer I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the structural integrity of the region around Arg306 is apparently more important than that of Arg506 for the structure and function of FVa. The Arg306 cleavage may be lethal because of loss of the FXa-binding site, destabilization of the trimeric A1-A2-A3 structure of FVa because of loss of the covalent link between the A1 and A2 domains potentially with dissociation of the A2 domain (16Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or an overlapping combination of these effects. In conclusion, our data suggest that residues 311–325 in FVa provide a FXa-binding site that may be essential for prothrombinase activity. Cleavage of FVa at Arg306 by APC severs the covalent linkage between the A1 and A2 domains and likely alters FVa tertiary structure, especially of the FXa-binding site involving residues 311–325, such that FXa binding is ablated or greatly diminished and FVa is irreversibly inactivated.

We asked whether the progressive decrease in pH along the exocytic pathway could influence the secondary structure and lipid binding and aggregation properties of porcine SP-A. Conformational analysis from CD spectra of SP-A at various pH values indicated that the percentage of α-helix progressively decreased and that of β-sheet increased as the pH was reduced. The protein underwent a marked self-aggregation at mildly acidic pH in the presence of Ca2+, conditions thought to resemble those existing in the trans-Golgi network. Protein aggregation was greater as the pH was reduced. We also found that both neutral and acidic vesicles either with or without SP-B or SP-C bound to SP-A at acidic pH as demonstrated by co-migration during centrifugation. However, the binding of acidic but not neutral vesicles to SP-A led to 1) a striking change in the CD spectra of the protein, which was interpreted as a decrease of the level of SP-A self-aggregation, and 2) a protection of the protein from endoproteinase Glu-C degradation at pH 4.5. SP-A massively aggregated acidic vesicles but poorly aggregated neutral vesicles at acidic pH. Aggregation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles either with or without SP-B and/or SP-C strongly depended on pH, being progressively decreased as the pH was reduced and markedly increased when pH was shifted back to 7.0. At the pH of lamellar bodies, SP-A-induced aggregation of DPPC vesicles containing SP-B or a mixture of SP-B and SP-C was very low, although SP-A bound to these vesicles. These results indicate that 1) DPPC binding and DPPC aggregation are different phenomena that probably have different SP-A structural requirements and 2) aggregation of membranes induced by SP-A at acidic pH is critically dependent on the presence of acidic phospholipids, which affect protein structure, probably preventing the formation of large aggregates of protein.

Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of approximately 80% phospholipids, 10% other lipids, and 5–10% surfactant-specific proteins that lines the alveolar space and is essential for breathing (for reviews, see Refs. 1Clements J.A.

The release of surfactant to the alveolar lumen occurs by exocytosis of lamellar body content in response to secretagogue stimulation (8Chander A. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: L241-L253PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rooney S.A. Young S.L. Mendelson C.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The regulated secretory pathway of the type II cell is atypical because the lamellar body not only functions as a classic secretory granule, but it also intersects with the endocytic pathway (10Young S.L. Wright J.R. Clements J.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 66: 1336-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L699-L707PubMed Google Scholar). Like the storage granules in other secretory cells, lamellar bodies have an acidic internal environment (pH 5.5) (12Chander A. Johnson R.G. Reicherter J. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6126-6131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and high calcium content, bringing their intravesicular free Ca2+ concentration to a 2-10 mm range (13Eckenhoff R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well recognized that during the process of secretory granule formation, proteins of the granule content are segregated from proteins that are released from the cell by the constitutive secretory pathway. Morphological studies indicate that sorting of nascent secretory proteins into the regulatedversus constitutive pathway occurs in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (14Orci L. Ravazzola M. Storch M.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that selective aggregation of proteins plays an important role in sorting of proteins destined for secretory granules (16Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J.

This protein aggregation is triggered as proteins encounter mildly acidic pH and high calcium in the TGN lumen. Constitutively secreted proteins do not aggregate under these ionic and pH conditions and are excluded from such aggregates (17Yoo S.H. J. Biol.

It is a multifunctional protein capable of binding several ligands including phospholipids, carbohydrates, and Ca2+, and it belongs to the Ca2+-dependent lectin family. SP-A is a large oligomeric protein of approximately 650 kDa, composed of 18 nearly identical subunits. Each SP-A subunit contains an amino-terminal collagen-like domain and a carboxyl-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain that are linked by a more hydrophobic domain (neck). Nearly all alveolar SP-A is complexed with phospholipids. The carbohydrate recognition domain and the neck region are important protein domains involved in SP-A/lipid interactions (20Ross G.F.

At this pH, SP-A preferentially interacts with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (23Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Casals C.

The association of SP-A with lipids appears essential for the conversion of lipid aggregates from multilamellar forms present in the exocytic granule to dispersed ordered arrays known as tubular myelin (29Korfhagen T.R.

With respect to SP-A biosynthetic routing in alveolar type II cells, the protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported together with the precursors of hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C through the same pathway from Golgi complex to lamellar bodies (7Voorhout W.F.

Curstedt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 675-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Efrati H. Hawgood S. Williams M.C. Hong K. Benson B.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7986-7993Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The question that we address here is whether the progressive decrease in pH along the exocytic pathway could influence the structure and the lipid binding and aggregation properties of SP-A. The present study analyzes the structural properties of SP-A and its interaction with phospholipids at acidic pH in the presence and absence of the hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C. We found that the secondary structure of SP-A was changed by lowering the pH and that the protein underwent a rapid aggregation at mildly acidic pH in the presence of Ca2+, conditions thought to resemble those existing in the TGN and along the exocytic pathway. The binding of acidic but not neutral vesicles to SP-A, at acidic pH, affected the secondary structure of the protein. Vesicle aggregation induced by SP-A at acidic pH was critically dependent on the presence of negatively charged phospholipids in the composition of the vesicle. Pulmonary surfactant was prepared from pig bronchoalveolar lavage as described previously (34Casals C. Herrera L. Miguel E. Garcı́a-Barreno P. Municio A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1003: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SP-A was purified from isolated surfactant using sequential butanol and octyl glucoside extractions (31Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Schilling J. Damm D. Clements J. White R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). SP-B and SP-C were isolated directly from pig lungs by minor modifications of the method of Curstedtet al. (35Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Robertson B. Bergman T. Berggrem P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) described elsewhere (36Pérez-Gil J. Cruz A. Casals C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1168: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The purity of SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C was checked by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (12 and 16% acrylamide for SP-A and for SP-B and SP-C, respectively) under reducing conditions (50 mm dithiothreitol). Quantification of the proteins was carried out by amino acid analysis in a Beckman System 6300 high performance analyzer. The protein hydrolysis was performed with 0.2 ml of 6 m HCl, containing 0.1% (w/v) phenol in evacuated and sealed tubes at 108 °C for 24 h. Norleucine was added to each sample as an internal standard. In the course of this work, eight different preparations of porcine SP-A and four preparations of porcine SP-B and SP-C were used. Some of the experiments were repeated with canine SP-A with identical results. CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter fitted with a 150-watt xenon lamp. Quartz cells of 1-mm path length were used, and the spectra were recorded in the far-uv region (190–260 nm) at 50 nm/min scanning speed and at room temperature. Five scans were accumulated and averaged for each spectrum. The acquired spectra were corrected by subtracting the appropriate blank runs (of water or phospholipid vesicle solutions), subjected to noise reduction analysis and presented as molar ellipticities (degrees·cm2·dmol−1), assuming 110 Da as the average molecular mass per amino acid residue. At least three independent preparations of SP-A were measured. Final SP-A concentration was 80–100 μg/ml. Measurements at acidic or neutral pH were done in 5 mm acetate, 5 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 4.5 or 7.2, respectively. pH titration was started at neutral pH in 5 mm Tris, 5 mm MES, 5 mm acetate buffer, pH 7.2, in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2. From the starting pH, SP-A was titrated to pH 4.2 by the addition of 1–2-μl aliquots of 0.05 or 0.1m HCl solution. During titration, the medium pH was monitored with a micro-pH electrode. The spectrum of SP-A at each pH was recorded 10 min after each change of pH. Self-aggregation of SP-A induced by H+ was studied at 37 °C by measuring the change in absorbance at 360 nm in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. Both sample and reference cuvettes were first filled with 5 mm acetate, 5 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 4.5. After a 10-min equilibration at 37 °C, SP-A (20 μg/ml, final concentration) was added to the sample cuvette, and the turbidity change at 360 nm was monitored at 1-min intervals over 10 min. Self-aggregation of SP-A was reversed by shifting back the pH to 7.2. pH-induced protein aggregation was also determined by centrifugation at 12,000 × g in a Hettich microliter centrifuge for 15 min. The entire pellet fractions and supernatants were then subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by staining of the gels with Coomassie Blue. The variation of SP-A aggregation as the pH was reduced was studied at 37 °C in the presence or the absence of 5 mm Ca2+. Samples containing SP-A (5.5 μg) in 350 μl of 5 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm MES, 5 mm acetate buffer, pH 7.2, were titrated to the indicated pH values by adding 1–2-μl aliquots of 0.05 or 0.1 m HCl while vortexing. During titration, the medium pH was monitored. The absorbance at 360 nm was registered once it was stabilized after each change of pH. Synthetic phospholipids, DPPC, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL); egg 1,2-diacyl-sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1,2-diacyl-sn -glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (PG) were from Sigma, and their homogeneity was routinely tested on thin layer chromatography. The organic solvents (methanol and chloroform) used to dissolve lipids and to isolate and store hydrophobic surfactant proteins were high pressure liquid chromatography grade (Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain). Throughout all experiments, unilamellar vesicles of DPPC, DPPG, or DPPC/other (7:3, w/w) were used. The different lipid vesicles were prepared at a phospholipid concentration of 1 or 3 mg/ml by hydrating dry lipid films in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mmacetate, pH 7.2 or 4.5, and allowing them to swell for 1 h at a temperature above the phase transition temperature of the corresponding phospholipid. Next, the lipid dispersion (1 ml) was sonicated at the same temperature (typically above 45 °C) during 2 min at 390 watts/cm2 (bursts of 0.6 s, 0.4 s between bursts) in a UP 200S sonifier with a 2-mm microtip. All vesicles were prepared freshly each day, just before starting the experiment. The phospholipid concentration was assessed by phosphorus determination according to Rouser et al. (37Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleisher S. Lipids. 1966; 12: 505-510Google Scholar). For vesicle-size analysis in solution, quasielastic light scattering was used as described previously (24Casals C. Miguel E. Pérez-Gil J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Vesicle diameter at 37 °C was 135 nm for DPPC vesicles and around 60 nm for DPPC/DPPG (7:3, w/w) vesicles. Reconstitution of SP-B or SP-C or both hydrophobic proteins in DPPC or DPPC/DPPG (7:3, w/w) vesicles was performed as described previously (38Pérez-Gil J. Casals C. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3964-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) at a protein:lipid ratio of either 1:10 or 1:20. Briefly, appropriate amounts of phospholipids dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) were mixed with the desired amount of SP-B and/or SP-C stored in chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). Dry protein/lipid samples were hydrated in the appropriate buffer at 65 °C for 1 h with occasional mixing. Sonication was done at the same temperature under conditions described above. The binding of SP-A to phospholipid vesicles at acidic pH was determined by coflotation of protein and lipids after discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. SP-A (25 μg/ml final concentration) was added to 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5 with or without 377 μg/ml phospholipid vesicles. The mixture was incubated during 15 min at room temperature and then carefully placed in a centrifuge tube over a 1-ml cushion of 30% sucrose in the same buffer. Centrifugation was conducted at 25 °C in a Beckman SW-65 rotor at 129,000 ×g for 2 h. The supernatants were then transferred to concentrating tubes (Millipore Microcon 100®) and centrifugated in order to eliminate salts. The presence of SP-A in pellet and supernatant fractions was determined by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions. Phospholipid content in both fractions was assessed by phosphorus analysis (37Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleisher S. Lipids. 1966; 12: 505-510Google Scholar). Control experiments where liposomes or SP-A were deleted from the incubation were performed. After centrifugation, more than 97% of phospholipids were recovered in the supernatant, and all SP-A sedimented in the absence of phospholipid vesicles. The assay was performed at acidic or neutral pH by measuring the absorbance at 400 nm in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer at 37 °C as described previously (25Ruano M.L.F. Miguel E. Pérez-Gil J. Casals C. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipid vesicles (40 μg) with or without hydrophobic proteins were added to both the sample and the reference cuvette in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 7.2 or 4.5. After a 10-min equilibration at 37 °C, 4 μg of SP-A were added to the sample cuvette, and the change in optical density at 400 nm was monitored at 1-min intervals. Next, Ca2+ (1 mm or 50 μm, final concentration) was added to both the sample and the reference cuvette, and the change in absorbance was monitored again. To determine the protease sensitivity of lipid-free and membrane-bound SP-A, the endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus V8 (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany) was used. This serine protease hydrolyzes peptide and ester bonds specifically at the carboxylic side of Glu at pH 4.0 or both Glu and Asp at pH 8.0–8.5. SP-A (6.7 μg) was added to 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, either in the presence or absence of 60 μg of phospholipid vesicles prepared in the same buffer. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, 13.4 μg of freshly prepared enzyme solution (2:1 enzyme/protein, w/w) were added. The final incubation volume was 110 μl. The mixture was incubated during 4 h at 37 °C, and the digestion was stopped by freezing the samples at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Western blot analysis of SP-A as described previously (39Casals C. Varela A. Ruano M.L.F. Valiño F. Pérez-Gil J. Torre N. Jorge E. Tendillo F. Castillo-Olivares J.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) because the electrophoretic band of V8 protease (30–35 kDa) overlapped with that of SP-A (28–36 kDa). The primary antibody was kindly supplied by Dr. J. A. Whitsett (University of Cincinnati). CD spectra of SP-A at neutral and acidic pH are shown in Fig.1 A . At neutral pH, spectra were characterized by a shoulder at 220 nm and a strong negative extreme at 207 nm as previously reported (24Casals C. Miguel E. Pérez-Gil J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 40Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The change of pH from 7.2 to 4.5 led to a change in the shape of SP-A spectrum and markedly reduced the contribution of the 207-nm minimum to the spectrum. This change in the CD spectra of SP-A was reversed when the pH was changed back to 7.2. On the other hand, pH-dependent aggregation of SP-A was studied by measuring H+-induced turbidity changes (Fig. 1 B ), and the level of aggregation was determined by centrifugation (Fig. 1 C ). SP-A rapidly aggregated at pH 4.5, and all of the protein was recovered in the pellet. When the pH was changed back to 7.2, the turbidity at 360 nm vanished and all of SP-A was recovered in the supernatant fraction, indicating that pH-dependent self-aggregation of SP-A was reversible. The CD spectrum of SP-A at pH 4.5 corresponded to the H+-induced aggregated form of the protein. To determine whether protein aggregation might affect CD measurements, CD spectra of SP-A at pH 4.5 were recorded at different protein concentrations. No significant differences were observed in the range of 40–140 μg of SP-A/ml tested. The estimation of secondary structure fractions of porcine SP-A at neutral and acidic pH was performed by the SELCON program (the self-consistent method) recently modified by Sreerama and Woody (41Sreerana N. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10022-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This program determines the contribution of α-helix, β-structure, β-turn, and poly(l-proline II)-type (PII) conformation to the spectra of proteins. The PIIconformation is a left-handed extended helix with three residues per turn and is favored in proline-rich polypeptides due to the limited conformational flexibility of the proline ring (41Sreerana N. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10022-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The PII conformation was found in collagen and in short segments of some globular proteins. According to the SELCON program, porcine SP-A at neutral pH contained 19% α-helix, 26% β-sheet, 25% β-turn, 14% PII conformation, and 17% unordered form. The self-aggregated SP-A at pH 4.5 contained 10% α-helix, 39% β-sheet, 22% β-turn, 12% PII conformation, and 18% unordered form, indicating that at acidic pH the content of β-sheet conformation increased and that of α-helix decreased, whereas the content of PII conformation did not change. Fig.2 A shows the effect of lowering pH on self-association of the protein in the presence and absence of 5 mm Ca2+. SP-A underwent pH-dependent aggregation in the absence of Ca2+. Protein aggregation started at pH below 6.0 and reached a maximum value at pH 4.5. The ionization pK calculated from the plot of the dependence of SP-A aggregation on the pH was 5.26 ± 0.05. In the presence of Ca2+, a marked aggregation occurred in the pH range of TGN (6–6.5) and was greater as the pH was reduced. The ionization pK calculated in the presence of Ca2+ was 5.55 ± 0.15. At pH 4.5, protein aggregation was not influenced by Ca2+ as shown in Fig.2 B . At neutral pH, self-association of SP-A was absolutely dependent on 1-8 mm concentrations of Ca2+ (25Ruano M.L.F. Miguel E. Pérez-Gil J. Casals C. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,42Haagsman H.P. Sargeant T. Hauschka P.V. Benson B.J. Hawgood S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8894-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal self-aggregation of pig SP-A was 2.36 ± 0.15 mm (25Ruano M.L.F. Miguel E. Pérez-Gil J. Casals C. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The effect o"

In an <i>in vitro</i> assay that reconstitutes intra-Golgi protein transport, we find that a membrane-bound and AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>-sensitive factor is involved in the fusion reaction. To determine whether this effect is mediated by a heterotrimeric G protein localized to COPI-coated transport vesicles, we determined the presence of G proteins on these vesicles and found that they were segregated relative to the donor membranes. Because G proteins do not have an obvious sorting, retention, or retrieval signal, we considered the possibility that other interactions might be responsible for this segregation. In agreement with this, we found that trimeric G proteins from isolated Golgi membranes were partially insoluble in Triton X-100. Identification of the proteins that interact with the heterotrimeric G proteins in the Golgi-derived detergent-insoluble complex might help to reveal the regulation of protein secretion mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1985202738,"The reovirus cell attachment protein, ς1, is a lollipop-shaped homotrimer with an N-terminal fibrous tail and a C-terminal globular head. Biogenesis of this protein involves two trimerization events: N-terminal trimerization, which occurs cotranslationally and is Hsp70/ATP-independent, and C-terminal trimerization, which occurs posttranslationally and is Hsp70/ATP-dependent. To determine if Hsp90 also plays a role in ς1 biogenesis, we analyzed ς1 synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Coprecipitation experiments using anti-Hsp90 antibodies revealed that Hsp90 was associated with immature ς1 trimers (hydra-like intermediates with assembled N termini and unassembled C termini) but not with mature trimers. The use of truncated ς1 further demonstrated that only the C-terminal half of ς1 associated with Hsp90. In the presence of the Hsp90 binding drug geldanamycin, N-terminal trimerization proceeded normally, but C-terminal trimerization was blocked. Geldanamycin did not inhibit the association of Hsp90 with ς 1 but prevented the subsequent release of Hsp90 from the immature ς1 complex. We also examined the status of p23, an Hsp90-associated cochaperone. Like Hsp90, p23 only associated with immature ς1 trimers, and this association was mapped to the C-terminal half of ς1. However, unlike Hsp90, p23 was released from the ς1 complex upon the addition of geldanamycin.

It is now known that the folding of nascent proteins in the cytosol is mediated by a group of proteins known as chaperones. These chaperones are believed to be present as large macromolecular complexes whose major roles appear to be the prevention of protein aggregation and the promotion of correct folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins. Two candidate members of the chaperone family are the heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, of which Hsp70 has been well characterized. Through its ATPase activity and associated bind and release cycles, Hsp70 assists in the folding of a wide spectrum of denatured and nascent proteins (see Refs. 1Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 2Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar for reviews). In contrast, Hsp90 does not exhibit any enzymatic activity and has not been extensively probed in terms of its possible role in the folding of nascent proteins. Indeed, its activity in vitro only approximates that of a true chaperone. Specifically, Hsp90 is able to maintain some denatured proteins in a state competent for refolding by Hsp70 and the cochaperone, Hip (p48), but Hsp90 alone cannot on its own produce refolded proteins (3Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Studies on Hsp90 have focused mainly on the role of this protein in the activation of several families of protein kinases and of steroid hormone receptors. Protein kinases associated with Hsp90 have included receptor tyrosine kinases such as erbB2 (4Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Whitesell L. Schnur R. Moyer J.D.

In contrast, the nature of involvement of Hsp90 in the conformational maturation of hormone receptors is much better understood. Accumulated evidence suggests that Hsp90 is part of a multiprotein chaperone complex that interacts with steroid receptors, keeping them in a state that is competent for binding substrate yet functionally inactive (for reviews, see Ref. 13Pratt W.B.

In response to steroid binding, the chaperone complex is released, and the receptor becomes activated. In the case of the relatively well studied glucocorticoid receptor, maturation involves a series of complex but ordered interactions between a number of chaperones (16Smith D.F. Whitesell L.

Reconstitution experiments have shown that an Hsp90·p60·Hsp70 complex first interacts with the receptor to convert the latter to a steroid binding conformation (19Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, this intermediate complex is highly unstable and requires the additional presence of another cochaperone, p23, for stabilization (20Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Subsequently Hsp70 and p60 leave the complex and are replaced by any of the several immunophilins such as FKBP52 and CyP-40 (22Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This complex then binds hormone, and the receptor is then released as an active transcription factor (18Dittmar K.D Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). An invaluable tool in the study of Hsp90 has been the benzoquinone ansamycin, geldanamycin (GA). Originally characterized as an agent responsible for inactivation of select tyrosine kinases, GA has recently been shown to bind with high affinity to a specific binding pocket within Hsp90 (23Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar).

Thus GA is considered as a very specific inhibitor of Hsp90 function, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Very recently, the GA binding site was found to co-localize with an ATP binding site on Hsp90 (at the N terminus) (23Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P.

This has led to the suggestion that the ATP and GA binding site acts as a conformational switch to regulate the assembly of Hsp90-containing multichaperone complexes (28Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Although Hsp90 is generally accepted as a chaperone, its role in the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides has not been extensively probed until recently. Hartson et al. (29Hartson S.D. Barrett D.J. Burn P. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13451-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) studied the folding of the lymphoid cell kinase p56lck translated in vitro and demonstrated the association of Hsp90 with newly synthesized p56lck molecules. GA was found to disrupt this association and hence the proper folding of this kinase. A more recent study using the heme-regulated eIF-2α kinase translated in vitro shows that Hsp90 plays an obligatory role in this kinase acquiring and maintaining a conformation that is competent for transformation into an aggregation-resistant activable kinase (11Uma S. Hartson S.D. Chen J.-J. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11648-11656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The in vitro translation system has also been used extensively in our laboratory to reveal the mechanisms of folding and oligomerization of the reovirus cell attachment protein ς1, a trimeric protein positioned at the 12 vertices of the icosahedral virion (30Lee P.W.K.

The ς1 trimer is highly asymmetric, with an N-terminal fibrous tail that is anchored to the virion, and a C-terminal globular head that interacts with the cell receptor (37Banerjea A.C.

Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with N-terminal trimerization preceding C-terminal trimerization. The core of the N-terminal trimerization domain is the N-terminal one-third of the protein, which is highly α-helical and contains an extended heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues (45Bassel-Duby R. Jayasuriya A. Chatterjee D. Sonenberg N. Maizel Jr., J.V. Fields B.N. Nature. 1985; 315: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 46Nibert M.L. Dermody T.S. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2976-2989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), endowing this region with the intrinsic propensity to form a triple coiled coil. During ς1 biogenesis, assembly of three neighboring nascent chains occurs cotranslationally at the N terminus (35Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This process does not involve Hsp70 or ATP and results in the generation of a loose triple coiled coil (36Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This occurs at around the midpoint of the polysome where Hsp70 begins to interact with emerging residues, thereby sterically hindering tightening of the coiled coil. As the triplex moves down the polysome, more Hsp70 becomes associated with the elongating C termini, preventing their misfolding and aggregation. The immature trimer then leaves the polysome as a complex comprised of three ς1 subunits, Hsp70, and possibly other chaperones. Subsequent ATP-dependent release of Hsp70 presumably provides the opportunity for the loose coiled coil to quickly snap together (tightening the coiled coil), whereas the remaining portions of the three C termini are available for continued interaction with Hsp70 and other chaperones. This structure, with a stably assembled N terminus and an unassembled C terminus, is called “hydra-like intermediate,” and it migrates as a retarded trimer in SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions (34Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further ATP-dependent release and rebinding of Hsp-70 and other proposed chaperones leads to global assembly and folding of the C terminus, generating mature ς1 with the characteristic “lollipop”-shaped structure, which migrates as an unretarded trimer in SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions (34Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,35Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We contend that the involvement of two mechanistically distinct oligomerization events for the same molecule, one cotranslational and one posttranslational, may represent a common approach to the generation of oligomeric proteins in the cytosol (35Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the possible participation of Hsp90 in ς1 biogenesis in vitro . We demonstrate that Hsp90 associates with immature but not mature ς1. This association occurs at the C-terminal half, but not the N-terminal half of ς1. The cochaperone p23 also associates with the C terminus and immature ς1. Geldanamycin treatment, which releases p23 but not Hsp90 from ς1, has no effect on ς1 N-terminal trimerization but effectively blocks C-terminal trimerization. These observations suggest that Hsp90 actively participates in the biogenesis of the trimeric ς1 protein, and together with our previous data on Hsp70 involvement (35Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are compatible with an all-or-none concept of chaperone involvement in different oligomerization domains within a single protein. They also suggest a possible common usage of chaperones in the regulation of general protein folding and assembly and of steroid receptor activation. The plasmids encoding the full-length and various truncated ς1 products have been described previously (34Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol.

All transcripts were generated in vitro using the MEGAscriptTM transcription kit (Ambion) for Sp6 RNA polymerase promoters. A typical transcription reaction involved incubation of 1 μg of linearized plasmid with the prescribed contents of the Ambion transcription kit (total final volume of 20 μl) for 5 h at 37 °C. The mRNA product was isolated by LiCl precipitation followed by cleanup with the BIO 101, Inc., RNaid Kit. The purified mRNA was then resuspended in 0.1% DEPC-treated water to a final concentration of approximately 0.5 μg/μl and stored at −70 °C for future use. DEPC is diethyl pyrocarbonate. Transcripts were translatedin vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Typically, 0.5–1.0 μg of mRNA was incubated at 37 °C with 7 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 μl of 1.0 mm methionine minus amino acids (Promega), and 18 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) for the duration indicated in figure legends. The labeled product was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To follow the fate of the proteins synthesized, reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1.0 h at 4 °C (Beckman TLA 100.1 rotor, TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge) to pellet ribosomes. The supernatants, which had no translation activity, were then incubated at 37 °C for various durations and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE as outlined in the figure legends. Geldanamycin was prepared as a stock solution of 175 μmin 20% Me2SO. It was added (to a final concentration of 7 μm) to the reaction mixture at the onset of translation or to the postribosomal supernatant before the chase, as indicated in the figure legends. For control samples, an equal volume of 20% Me2SO was used. Discontinuous SDS-PAGE was performed using the protocol of Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Depending upon the size of ς1 products analyzed, 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels were used. Samples were incubated in protein sample buffer [final concentration: 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue] for 30 min at either 37 or 4 °C or, alternatively, boiled for 5 min before SDS-PAGE. The different SDS-PAGE conditions were used to differentiate between N- and C-terminal trimerization. Under dissociating conditions, where samples were boiled for 5 min before SDS-PAGE (carried out at room temperature), both N- and C-terminal trimers dissociated and migrated as monomers. Under nondissociating conditions, samples were either incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, at which temperature only the trimeric N-terminal domain is stable, or incubated at 4 °C, at which temperature both the N- and C-terminal trimeric domains are stable (SDS-PAGE was carried out at 4 °C in both cases). Initially we obtained the 3G3 monoclonal anti-Hsp90 antibody (IgM) from Dr. G. Perdew (48Perdew G.H. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the JJ3 anti-p23 antibody (IgG1) from Dr. D. Toft (49Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We subsequently purchased these antibodies from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. Immunoprecipitations were carried out on in vitro translations that were performed as outlined above. Typically, a 20-μl translation reaction was stopped by the addition of four volumes of TEM buffer (20-mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm ammonium molybdate, 50 mm NaCl). To this was added primary antibody at a dilution of between 1:35 and 1:150, as empirically determined for each antibody. For primary antibodies of IgG class, samples were incubated on ice for 1 h, and 50 μl of IgGsorb (The Enzyme Center) was then added. If primary antibody was of the IgM class, then IgGsorb with preadsorbed IgG anti-IgM was used. After incubation for an additional 30 min with periodic shaking, the samples were microcentrifuged, and the pellets were washed three times with TEM-buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X. The pellets were then resuspended in protein sample buffer, then boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For detection of trimeric ς1 intermediates, immunoprecipitates were first released from IgGsorb under high pH conditions before nondissociating SDS-PAGE as described previously (32Leone G. Duncan R. Mah D.C.W. Price A. Cashdollar L.W. Lee P.W.K. Virology. 1991; 182: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, this involved resuspension of the pellet in 70 μl of high pH release buffer (0.1% SDS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 6.0 mmurea, 0.1 m H3PO4, 50 mm Tris, adjusted to pH 11.6 with NaOH), followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was then neutralized with 3.5 μl of a solution containing 0.9 mH3PO4, 1.0 m Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.3% SDS. After microcentrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions. The L cell binding assay was essentially the same as described previously (30Lee P.W.K. Hayes E.C. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1981; 108: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 34Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Monolayers of mouse L cells were grown to 90% confluency on 35-mm Corning tissue culture plates in Joklik's minimum essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Media was aspirated from the plates, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH7.4) followed by incubation at 4 °C for 20 min with an overlay of cold PBS. The PBS was then replaced with [35S]methionine-labeled translation reactions diluted 10-fold in PBS. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with intermittent rocking, the monolayers were washed five times with cold PBS. The cells were then lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (PBS containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the nuclei were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 5000 × g . The supernatant was mixed with protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We previously reported that Hsp70 is associated with ς1 intermediates and is actively involved in ς1 biogenesis (35Leone G. Coffey M.C. Gilmore R. Duncan R. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8466-8471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine if Hsp90 was also part of the chaperone complex during ς1 assembly, full-length S1 transcripts encoding ς1 were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates for 12 min then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Hsp90 antibody. Subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis under dissociating conditions (Fig. 1 A ) revealed that ς1 coprecipitated with the anti-Hsp90 antibody but not with a control antibody (anti-CD8), suggesting that at least some ς1 was associated with Hsp90. To identify the ς1 intermediates associated with Hsp90, similar immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nondissociating conditions. The results (Fig. 1 B ) show that both the apparent monomer and higher order forms of ς1 (including the stable hydra form) were associated with Hsp90. Previously we demonstrated that the apparent monomer observed under these weakly denaturing conditions actually represents an early posttranslational form of the ς1 trimer (unstable trimer form) that is SDS-sensitive (36Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is a direct presursor of the stable hydra form, which in turn is a direct precursor of mature ς1 (compact form) (34Leone G. Maybaum L. Lee P.W.K. Cell. 1992; 71: 479-48"
https://openalex.org/W2128454272,"Retroviruses display a unique form of alternative splicing in which both spliced and unspliced RNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm. Simple retroviruses, such as avian sarcoma virus, do not encode regulatory proteins that affect splicing; this process is controlled solely through interactions between the viral RNA and the host cell splicing machinery. Previously, we described the selection and characterization of novel avian sarcoma virus mutants. These viruses were separated into two classes based upon analysis of splicing intermediates produced in infected cells and in a cell-free system. One class, which included mutants with altered polypyrimidine tract or branch point sequences, showed significant accumulation of intermediates, suggesting that splicing was regulated in step 2. The other class, which included mutants with deletions of exonic enhancer sequences, did not accumulate splicing intermediates, suggesting that splicing was regulated before step 1 of the splicing reaction. In this report, we show that a mutant blocked at step 1 fails to form a stable spliceosomal complex, whereas one blocked at step 2 shows a defect in its ability to transit through the last spliceosomal complex. Using UV cross-linking methods, we show that regulation at each step is associated with specific changes in the binding of cellular splicing factors. Regulation at step 1 is correlated with decreased cross-linking of the factor U2AF65, whereas regulation at step 2 is correlated with enhanced cross-linking of the factor SAP49. Because these mutations were isolated by selection for replication-competent viruses, we conclude that retroviral splicing may be regulated in vivo through altered binding of constitutive splicing factors.

Because these mutations were isolated by selection for replication-competent viruses, we conclude that retroviral splicing may be regulated in vivo through altered binding of constitutive splicing factors. Pre-mRNA splicing, the process by which introns are removed, takes place in the nucleus within a large structure termed the spliceosome and can be viewed as a two-step process (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Moore M.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 B ). In step 1, the pre-mRNA is cleaved at the 5′-splice site (5′-ss), 1The abbreviations used are: ss, splice site(s); PPyT, polypyrimidine tract; BPS, branch point sequence; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; SR, serine-arginine; ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; SAP, spliceosome-associated protein; ASV, avian sarcoma virus; NEPHGE, non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis; TEMED, N ,N ,N ′,N ′-tetramethyl-ethylenediamine. and a branched lariat-exon 2 intermediate is formed. In step 2, the two exons are ligated together, and the branched intron is released. In vertebrates, several loosely conserved sequence elements within the pre-mRNA are important for recognition by the splicing machinery, including sequences at the 5′-ss, the 3′-ss, the polypyrimidine tract (PPyT), and the branch point (BPS) (3Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Additional RNA elements have been described within the intron and the exon that can promote or inhibit splicing (reviewed in Refs. 4Chabot B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 5Inoue K. Ohno M. Shimura Y. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA splicing elements are recognized by trans -acting cellular components that include both small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and proteins known as splicing factors (6McKeown M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Nilsen T.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 8Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The snRNPs are composed of a highly structured RNA to which a number of shared as well as unique proteins are bound. The RNA component of some snRNPs recognizes elements in the splicing signals in pre-mRNAs through base pairing interactions. The U2 snRNP recognizes the BPS, and the U1 snRNP recognizes the 5′-ss. Two other snRNPs required for splicing, U4 and U6, participate in formation of the mature spliceosome (6McKeown M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Newman A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 462-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is believed that the RNA components of the snRNPs and pre-mRNA cooperate to catalyze both steps in the splicing reaction (10Lamond A.I. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The non-snRNP protein components of the spliceosome appear to assist in splice site selection, organization of snRNPs, and regulation of alternative splicing events. A subset of splicing factors contains motifs of repeating serine-arginine peptides, and these factors are called SR or SR-related proteins (11Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 12Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR proteins have distinct as well as overlapping functions; one role of SR proteins appears to be in the activation of splicing by exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). The ESE elements in the downstream exon promote splicing at the upstream 3′-ss usually through interaction with specific SR proteins (13Achsel T. Shimura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 15Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The limited base pairing potential between small nuclear RNAs and the pre-mRNA splicing signals, as well as the degenerate nature of these signals, suggests that the binding of snRNPs must be assisted by proteins. Several proteins have been implicated in tethering the U2 snRNP to its target element, the BPS. They include the splicing factor U2AF65 (U2-associatedfactor of 65 kDa), which binds to the PPyT and has RNA annealing activity (16Valcarcel J. Gaur R.K. Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Lee C.G. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13472-13478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs) can bind to pre-mRNA as well as to small nuclear RNA (8Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 18Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For example, the U2 snRNP-associated SAP49 and other SAPs have been shown to bind to pre-mRNA upstream of the BPS (19Gozani O. Feld R. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It appears that the combined binding of U2AF65 and several SAPs in the vicinity of the BPS may stabilize the binding of the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA. The molecular basis for the control of alternative splicing in vertebrate cells has been the focus of several recent in vitro studies (20Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar, 21Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In some cases, it appears that a protein factor can inhibit splicing by binding to a nearby RNA sequence (20Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar). In other cases, a protein factor can activate splicing by binding near a particular splice site (21Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 22Min H. Chan R.C. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Retroviruses display a unique form of regulated splicing that allows simultaneous expression of spliced and unspliced RNAs within the same cell. The integrated viral DNA produces a single primary transcript that may either be spliced, to allow for expression of the viral envelope glycoproteins, or may remain unspliced, to allow for expression of viral structural proteins and enzymes. In addition to serving as an mRNA, the unspliced RNA also comprises the genome for progeny virions. In the case of retroviruses with the simplest genomes, such as the avian sarcoma virus (ASV), approximately two-thirds of the primary transcripts remain unspliced, and the limited splicing that takes place uses a common 5′-ss and one of two 3′-ss (see Fig. 1). ASV requires an appropriate balance between spliced and unspliced RNAs for efficient replication. We have exploited this feature as a genetic selection tool to study the control of splicing at theenv splice site. We demonstrated that a specific insertion into the BPS, upstream of env , increased the efficiency of splicing and created a replication defect (23Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Upon prolonged passage, replication-competent viruses that contained spontaneous second-site suppressor mutations were isolated. The suppressor mutations were of two types: one type comprised base substitutions in the BPS, and the other deletions of the ESE within the env exon. Both types of suppressors down-regulated splicing. Up-regulation of splicing and a concomitant replication defect were also created by lengthening of the PPyT (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this case, selection for replication-competent mutants revealed a third type of suppressor comprising U to C transitions within the PPyT, which also down-regulated splicing. When the different types of suppressor mutants were examined in more detail, we found evidence for regulation at two distinct steps in the splicing reaction. The first class (mutants that include ESE deletions) showed a partial block in splicing prior to step 1, and the second class (mutants with alterations in the BPS or PPyT) showed a partial block subsequent to step 1, but prior to step 2 (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Fu X.D. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a more detailed in vitro characterization of RNA splicing control and of the protein factors that form complexes with ASV RNAs that include these two classes of splicing suppressor mutations. The plasmids used to prepare in vitro RNA splicing substrates have been described elsewhere (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and splicing assays were carried out as described (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Radioactive 32P-labeled run-off transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T7 polymerase and were then gel-purified for UV cross-linking experiments. For in vitro splicing reactions, RNA (105 cpm) was incubated with 3–10 μl of nuclear extract (∼30 μg, prepared as described previously (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), ATP (0.5 mm), creatine phosphate (20 mm), MgCl2 (3.2 mm), RNase inhibitor (5 Prime-3 Prime, Inc.) (0.25 units/reaction), dithiothreitol (2 mm), KCl (100 mm) and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6 in a 25-μl volume. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times and stopped by addition of an equal volume of proteinase buffer. One-hundred μg of proteinase K was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The RNA products were then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and heated to 70 °C for 5 min prior to loading on 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Conditions for gel shift assays have been described (26Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In vitro splicing reactions were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times, after which they were brought to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml heparin and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Samples were then loaded directly onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel (running and gel buffer was 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, and 50 mm glycine) and subjected to electrophoresis at 200 V for 5 h. The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Because it is unusual to detect significant amounts of complex C in splicing reactions, we analyzed our most efficiently spliced substrate, BG-uuu, in a similar manner (data not shown). As we detected amounts of complex C similar to that observed with I(−17), we attribute the increased detection of this complex to some general feature of our system. For UV cross-linking, the splicing reactions were incubated for the indicated times and then placed on ice in an inverted Eppendorf tube top. UV exposure was for 5 min at 10 cm from the source (Sylvania G64T6 lamp). After UV irradiation, the samples were treated for 15 min with an RNase mixture (Ambion Inc.) that contained RNases A and T1. An equal volume of 2× Laemmli loading buffer was added to the samples, which were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then loaded onto 10% SDS protein gels. The gels were then fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Non-equilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE) was carried out as described (27O'Farrell P.H. O'Farrell P.Z. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cross-linking reactions were treated with RNase, incubated with an equal volume of sample buffer (9.5 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.6% ampholyte, pH 5–8, and 0.4% ampholyte, pH 3–10) at 65 °C for 10 min, and then layered on top of a tube gel (9.2 m urea, 4% acrylamide (10:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio), 20% Nonidet P-40, 1.6% ampholyte, pH 5–8, 0.4% ampholyte, pH 3–10, 0.01% ammonium persulfate, and 0.1% TEMED). A solution of 100 mm NaOH was placed in the lower chamber, and 10 mm H3PO4 was placed in the upper chamber. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 500 V for 1 h and then at 750 V for 2 h. Each tube gel was then transferred to the top of a 10% SDS protein gel without a stacking gel. The protein gels were run until the dye reached the bottom, at which time they were transferred to nitrocellulose for blotting. To determine the location of cross-linked species and the location of specific proteins in the nuclear extract on the same gel, the membrane was subjected to chemiluminescence Western analysis (Pierce). The membrane was then washed overnight in a large volume of phosphate-buffered saline to remove chemiluminescence reagents and exposed to x-ray film to detect the location of 32P-labeled cross-linked species. An anti-SAP49 rat serum was prepared using a fragment of SAP49 comprising the RNA-binding domains (amino acids 1–180) (the SAP49 cDNA was kindly provided by Robin Reed (28Champion A.P. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). The pET28 system (Novagen) was used for Escherichia coli expression and purification through histidine tags at both termini. The bacteria were lysed with a French press, and the recombinant protein was purified by TALON metal chelate chromatography (CLONTECH). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rats by the Laboratory Animal Facility at the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Immunoblotting and chemiluminescence detection were performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Pierce). Fig.1 A shows the organization of the ASV genome and the location of RNA elements involved in splicing and the minigene RNA substrates used in this study. The nucleotide sequences of the regions spanning the BPS to the env 3′-ss for RNAs analyzed in this study are shown in Fig. 1 C . Two mutations, I(−17) and IS1cu (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Both increase splicing efficiency and cause a replication defect. The suppressor mutations listed were obtained by selecting for replication-competent viruses in cultures transfected with viral DNAs that contain the I(−17) or IS1cu mutations (Fig. 1 C ). These suppressor mutations all down-regulate splicing. Several of the suppressor mutations cause a partial block in step 2 of the splicing reaction detected by the accumulation of lariat-exon 2 intermediates both in cell-free splicing extracts and in cells infected with the mutant viruses (Fig. 1 C ) (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An additional substrate used in our studies is not described in Fig. 1, but has been described elsewhere (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This substrate replaces the weak wild type BPS with the strong β-globin BPS and adds a three-uridine extension onto the PPyT and it is thus denoted BG-uuu. The splicing of BG-uuu is very efficient compared with the wild type, and it was therefore used as a positive control when appropriate. We were interested in determining if suppressor mutants with partial blocks at either step in splicing could be distinguished from each other, or from an efficiently splicing RNA substrate, in their ability to form splicing-specific complexes. For these analyses, we chose the parental, oversplicing mutant I(−17) and the IΔ51 and IS1 suppressor derivatives that cause partial blocks in splicing before step 1 and at step 2, respectively (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Fu X.D. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As illustrated in thein vitro splicing assay shown in Fig.2 A , the lariat-exon 2 intermediates accumulated with IS1, but not with IΔ51, and spliced product was detectable only with the I(−17) parent. The association of a substrate RNA with the splicing machinery is known to occur through a stepwise process; several stages in this process can be visualized on a native gel. In the initial stage, the RNA is found in a heterogeneous, but fast migrating complex, designated H (26Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 29Jamison S.F. Crow A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which contains mainly heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (30Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8031-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After the H complex, RNAs can be found in splicing complexes, designated A, B, and C in order of increasing size and time of appearance. Step 2 splicing takes place in complex C, after which the spliced RNA is released, and the spliceosome disassembles (31Ares M.J. Weiser B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This complex is usually short-lived and often difficult to detect. Using the standard mobility shift assay, we found most of the RNA of the efficiently spliced substrate I(−17) in the fast migrating H form at the earliest time point (15 min), with only a small amount of complex A visible. With increasing time, the complex increased in size, first accumulating at the position of complex B and then complex C. Similar kinetics were observed with step 2-blocked IS1 RNA, despite the fact that most of the RNA remained unspliced (Fig. 2 A ). Quantitation of complex C formation is shown in Fig. 2 C . The efficiently spliced substrate I(−17) formed increasing amounts of complex C for the first 45 min. Thereafter, the amount remained relatively constant, despite the continued accumulation of spliced product. We interpret this plateau to reflect a steady state in which new C complexes are formed at the same rate as others are disassembled, following completion of the splicing reaction. The IS1 substrate was initially assembled into complex C at the same rate as I(−17). However, with IS1, a plateau was not observed. Instead, the amount of complex C increased linearly throughout the course of the reaction. This would be expected if the IS1 substrate is as efficient as I(−17) for step 1 of the splicing reaction, but is inhibited from completing step 2. As shown in Fig. 2 B (lanes 11–15 ), formation of splicing complexes was very inefficient with IΔ51 RNA, and the limited amount of complex H formed disappeared quickly. This result is not unexpected as we have shown by sedimentation analysis that RNA substrates with suppressor mutations that are ESE deletions (IΔ36 and IΔ51) do not form spliceosomes efficiently, but rather accumulate smaller complexes (25Fu X.D. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, the complex formation data are consistent with a model in which splicing is regulated very early in the pathway by the ESE deletion suppressors and later with the step 2 suppressors. We next wanted to determine if the partial blocks in splicing could be correlated with changes in the binding of cellular proteins.32P-Radiolabeled RNA substrates were incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extracts, and the bound proteins were cross-linked by exposure to UV light (32Will C.C. Kostner B. Luhrmann R. Higgins J.J. Hames B.D. Analysis of Ribonucleoprotein Interactions. I. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 141-177Google Scholar). Following digestion with RNase, proteins that contained cross-linked [32P]RNA adducts were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. We first examined the cross-linked products from RNA substrates containing the ESE deletion suppressor mutations (Fig.3 B ). Typical patterns fromin vitro splicing reactions with these RNA substrates are shown in Fig. 3 A . The block in splicing was less severe with the IΔ36 suppressor compared with the IΔ51 suppressor. When normalized for total radioactive content, only an ∼2-fold reduction in splicing was typically observed between IΔ36 and the I(−17) parent. This is consistent with our previous observation that IΔ36 only partially suppresses I(−17) oversplicing in vivo (23Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the gel analysis of cross-linked proteins (Fig. 3 B andC ), we observed differential cross-linking of a 65-kDa protein. Substrates corresponding to the I(−17) oversplicing parental mutant and the step 2-blocked IS1 RNA substrates exhibited stronger cross-linking to the 65-kDa protein, whereas step 1-blocked RNAs (IΔ36 and IΔ51) showed weaker cross-linking to this protein. The reduced cross-linking of the 65-kDa protein to the ESE-deleted substrates was observed in numerous experiments and was reproduced in all nuclear extracts tested. This 65-kDa protein was identified as U2AF65 based on the following criteria. (i) The cross-linked species comigrated with U2AF65. The cross-linking gel shown in Fig. 3 C (left panel ) was transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and subjected to autoradiography to identify the cross-linked species. Subsequently, the filter was immunoblotted with an antibody that recognizes U2AF65 (kindly provided by Dr. James Patton). The band detected by immunoblotting comigrated with the 32P-labeled, UV-cross-linked band (indicated by an arrow) . (ii) The 65-kDa species cross-linked extremely well to the most efficiently spliced substrate, BG-uuu (Fig. 4,lane 1 ). The U2AF65 protein has been shown to strongly cross-link other efficiently spliced substrates (33Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). (iii) Cross-linking to the 65-kDa species was observed in the absence of exogenous ATP (data not shown). This is consistent with the finding that U2AF65 binding to RNA substrates does not require ATP (33Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). (iv) Migration of the cross-linked species in NEPHGE was similar to that of U2AF65 (data not shown). (v) Cross-linking of the 65-kDa species was affected by mutations in the PPyT that have been shown previously to affect the cross-linking of U2AF65 (see below). The observation that cross-linking of U2AF65 to the efficiently spliced substrate I(−17) is stronger than to substrates containing the ESE deletions (IΔ51 and IΔ36) is consistent with models in which exon enhancers act indirectly to promote U2AF65 binding to the PPyT (see “Discussion”). The IS1 substrate, which is blocked at step 2, cross-links U2AF65efficiently. This is consistent with the hypothesis that U2AF65 is required very early in the splicing reaction. Because these suppressors were obtained by selection of replication-competent viruses, these data support a model of exon enhancer function in vivo that involves the splicing factor U2AF. We next asked if a partial block at step 2 is also correlated with differential binding of cellular proteins. In vitro splicing patterns for the seven RNA substrates used in these analyses are shown in Fig. 4 A . As expected, the BG-uuu substrate was spliced most efficiently, and no splicing was detected with the wild type substrate (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Results with I(−17) and IS1 were the same as those shown in Fig. 3 A . The substrate IS1cu, with an extended PPyT, was spliced more efficiently than IS1, from which it was derived (Fig. 4 A , comparelanes 5 and 6 ). Splicing patterns of RNA substrates derived from replication-competent viruses that contain additional mutations that suppress IS1cu (IS1cuU(−15)C and IS1cuU(−9,−15)C) are also shown (Fig. 4 A , lanes 7 and 8 ). As can be seen by comparing the patterns, the two suppressors of IS1cu restored a step 2 block in splicing similar to that seen in IS1 (Fig. 4 A , comparelanes 5, 7, and 8 ). These results are consistent with previous results from in vivo analyses (24Bouck J. Fu X.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2663-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows the cross-linking pattern of the substrates shown in Fig. 4 A . U2AF65 cross-linked to the BG-uuu substrate very efficiently (upper arrow ). Cross-linking to U2AF65 was also affected in some of the other substrates that have alterations in their PPyT. For example, IS1cuU(−9,−15)C cross-linked U2AF65 somewhat less efficiently than IS1cuU(−15)C (Fig. 4 B , compare lanes 6 and 7 ). We noted (Fig. 1 C ) that the −9 mutation reduced a five-uridine stretch to four. A five-uridine stretch in the PPyT has been shown to be important for efficient splicing as well as cross-linking of U2AF65 (34Roscigno R.F. Weiner M. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11222-11229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Coolidge C.J. Seely R.J. Patton J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to differences in the efficiency of U2AF65 cross-linking, several substrates showed relatively enhanced cross-linking to a 50-kDa protein (Fig. 4 B , lanes 4 , 6 , and7 ). As enhanced cross-linking of the 50-kDa protein to the IS1cuU(−9,−15)C substrate was also observed in the absence of ATP (data not shown), we reason"
https://openalex.org/W2098948934,"Within the chick central nervous system, expression of the β3 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene is restricted to a subset of retinal neurons, the majority of which are ganglion cells. Transient transfection in retinal neurons and in neural and non-neural cells from other regions of the chick embryo allowed the identification of the cis-regulatory domain of the β3 gene. Within this domain, a 75-base pair fragment located immediately upstream of the transcription start site suffices to reproduce the neuron-specific expression pattern of β3. This fragment encompasses an E-box and a CAAT box, both of which are shown to be key positive regulatory elements of the β3 promoter. Co-transfection experiments into retinal, telencephalic, and tectal neurons with plasmid reporters of β3 promoter activity and a number of vectors expressing different neuronal (ASH-1, NeuroM, NeuroD, CTF-4) and non-neuronal (MyoD) basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors indicate that the cis-regulatory domain of β3 has the remarkable property of discriminating accurately between related members of the basic helix-loop-helix protein family. The sequence located immediately 3′ of the E-box participates in this selection, and the E-box acts in concert with the nearby CAAT box.

In vertebrates, both negative and positive regulations play an important role in determining neuronal gene expression. Negative regulation (reviewed in Refs. 1Mandel G. McKinnon D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 323-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 2Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) is best exemplified by REST/NRSF, a factor that represses transcription of the SCG-10 and type II Na+ channel genes in non-neuronal cell-types, whereas most neurons lack REST/NRSF and thus express these two genes (3Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

Conversely, the Olf-1 transcription factor positively regulates several genes (e.g. the olfactory neuron-specific G protein, the type III adenylyl cyclase) specifically expressed in olfactory neurons (5Wang M.M.

Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) act as positive or negative regulators in the acquisition of neuronal identity. For instance, theatonal- and achaete-scute -related activators are transiently expressed in parts of the central and peripheral nervous system during early development, and their null mutation or ectopic expression profoundly influences neurogenesis (reviewed by Lee et al . (7Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar)). However, the direct regulation by bHLH proteins of genes that define neuronal identity has never been documented. Several neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) genes are expressed early in neural development (8Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.-M. Hernandez M.-C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S.

Berg D.K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), an understanding of their regulation should help explain how the genetic program puts together the mechanisms needed for epigenetic environmental cues to participate in development. This is illustrated in a recent report by Shatz and associates (14Feller M.B. Wellis D.P. Stellwagen D. Werblin F.S. Shatz C.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) showing that, in the developing retina, cholinergic synaptic transmission between newly generated amacrine and ganglion cells is responsible for the propagation of spontaneous waves of action potentials that may be critical for the establishment of visual system circuitry. Several nAChR subunit genes, including α4, β2, β3, and β4, are expressed in the chick retina (10Matter J.-M. Matter-Sadzinski L. Ballivet M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 2J.-M. Matter, unpublished data. and expression of β3 is confined to ganglion cells and amacrine neurons (15Hernandez M.-C.

Forsayeth and Kobrin (16Forsayeth J.R. Kobrin E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the β3 subunit co-assembles in vivo with the α4, β2, and β4 subunits to form a functional nicotinic receptor endowed with distinctive properties. We have isolated a short 5′-sequence of the β3 gene containing promoter elements that are sufficient to target reporter gene expression to those retinal neurons that normally express β3 in vivo (11Matter J.-M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3224-3233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The stringent neuronal specificity of the β3 promoter and its activation during the period of neuronal fate determination make it an attractive system in which to study the functional interactions between transcription factors and cis-acting regulatory elements that help establish the diverse neuronal phenotypes. In this report, we carry out a functional analysis of the cis-regulatory domain, establishing that transcription of the β3 gene is under the direct control of bHLH factors. Moreover, we show that the β3 promoter is able to discriminate accurately between related members of the bHLH family, thereby effecting the stringent neuron-specific regulation of the gene. Standard molecular biology techniques were used (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. Construction of the reporter plasmids β3RS-CAT and β3RS-lacZ and of the reference plasmids SV-CAT and SV-lacZ was described by Hernandez et al . (15Hernandez M.-C. Erkman L. Matter-Sadzinski L.

Point mutations in the β3RS sequence (Fig. 1 A ) were introduced by polymerase chain reaction and checked by sequencing. The mutant DNA fragments were cloned at the Sma I site of the pCAT00 plasmid (18Crossley M. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SF-E and SF-3E were obtained by ligation of Pvu II linkers (CCAGCTGG; New England Biolabs) to the 5′-end of fragment SF (Fig. 2 A ). α1KK encompasses nucleotides 151–334 of the chick α1 nAChR promoter (19Klarsfeld A.

The α1/β3 hybrid promoter was obtained by ligation of the 5′-end of α1KK with the 3′-end of β3RS at their shared Pvu II restriction site (Fig. 7 A ). The expression plasmid (pEMSV) encoding MyoD was kindly provided by the Weintraub laboratory (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, Seattle), the CTF-4 cDNA by J. Schmidt (SUNY, Stony Brook), and the CASH-1 cDNA by T. Reh (University of Washington, Seattle).Figure 2Analysis of the E-box in the β3 promoter. A , β3RS is the wild-type promoter. In the mutated E-box (E-box* ), the wild-type sequence was mutated to TAGCTA. In SF, the E-box was truncated, and the 5′-flanking sequence was deleted. In SF-E and SF-3E, oligonucleotide linkers containing, respectively, one (CCAGCTG G) and three E-boxes (CCAGCTG G)3 were added at the 5′-end of SF. B, the DNA fragments described in A were fused to the CAT gene and transfected into cells isolated from E5 neuroretina. Cells were assayed for CAT activity 48 h after transfection. C, the constructs were also transfected into neurons from the optic tectum and telencephalon, in glial cells, and in CEFs. The CAT activity obtained upon transfection of each cell type by SV-CAT is arbitrarily set at 100, and the promoter activities of the different DNA fragments are given relative to this value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Activity of the β3, α1, and hybrid α1/β3 promoters in retinal cells, CEFs, and myotubes.

The distal E-box in α1 and the E-box in β3 have the same sequence (CAGCTG, a site for the Pvu II restriction enzyme) and fragments were fused at this level. In α1/β3, the reconstructed E-box is flanked in 5′ by 56 bp from α1 and in 3′ by 69 bp from β3. B , the α1/β3-CAT and β3RS-CAT constructs were transfected in cells isolated from E5 neuroretina, and 48 h later cells were assayed for CAT activity. Note that both promoters have strong activities in retinal cells. C, the β3RS-CAT , α1KK-CAT, and α1/β3-CAT constructs were co-transfected with the MyoD (+) or the control expression vector (−) in primary (CEF + Myotubes ) or secondary (CEF) cultures of chick embryonic fibroblasts. Primary cultures contained 5–10% myotubes, whereas myotubes were absent in secondary cultures. Note the 15-fold higher promoter activity of the α1KK fragment in primary cultures, reflecting its much stronger activity in myotubes than in CEFs. In contrast, the β3 and α1/β3 promoters were inactive in myotubes and CEFs.

AHin dIII cDNA fragment encoding the bulk of the CTF-4 protein (22Tsay H.J. Choe Y.H. Neville C.M. Schmidt J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 202624Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was cloned in phase in the appropriate pDS bacterial expression vector (23Stüber D. Matile H. Garotta G. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 4: 121-152Crossref Google Scholar). High level accumulation of His-tagged fusion protein was achieved by incubating Escherichia coli transformants at 37 °C for 2 h with 2 mmisopropylthiogalactoside in rich broth. Purification of the fusion protein was performed on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in denaturing conditions. The eluted protein (48.5 kDa) was renatured from 8 m urea by serial dialysis and stored at −20 °C in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Retinae and optic tecta were dissected in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclei were isolated as described by Matter-Sadzinski et al . (24Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were obtained by adding NaCl to the suspension of nuclei to a concentration of 1m, in the presence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (both at 0.7 μg/ml), and Trasylol (1%), incubating for 15 min on ice, and centrifuging for 45 min at 50,000 rpm (Beckman TLA 100). The proteins in the supernatant were quantified (Bio-Rad protein assay) and stored at −70 °C. The probes were 35-bp double-stranded fragments (underlined in Fig.1 A ) end-labeled by fill-in of 5′-overhangs with Klenow enzyme in presence of [α-32P]dATP. For band shifts, bovine serum albumin was added to nuclear proteins to keep the total protein load at 6 μg/lane. Poly(dI-dC) (2.5 μg), used as nonspecific competitor DNA, was mixed with the probe (20,000 cpm) in FT buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl), proteins were added, and the mixture (20 μl) was incubated for 15 min on ice. The samples were then loaded on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5% glycerol. After a 2.5-h run at 200 V, the gel was dried and exposed overnight at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. All tissue culture reagents except as indicated were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Plasticware was from Nunc. Chick embryos were staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (25Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (10047) Google Scholar). Cells from different regions of the CNS were prepared as described previously (11Matter J.-M. Matter-Sadzinski L. Ballivet M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Neuroretina, pigment epithelium, optic tectum, telencephalon, and cerebellum were dissected from E4–E13 embryos, collected in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with 0.05% trypsin for 10 min (E4–E8) or with 0.1% trypsin for 20 min (E9–E13). Desoxyribonuclease I (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to 30 μg/ml for 5 min, and then trypsin was inactivated by adding fetal calf serum to 5%. Cells were pelleted, rinsed in Opti-MEM medium, resuspended in Opti-MEM at densities as indicated below, and subjected to the transfection procedure. Plasmid DNA (5 μg in 100 μl of Opti-MEM) was mixed with Lipofectin reagent (20 μg diluted in 200 μl of Opti-MEM), and the transfection solution was added to 200 μl of cell suspension containing 4–6 × 106 cells. In co-transfection experiments with two constructs, 5 μg of reporter plasmid was mixed with 3.5 μg of expression vector. In all instances, the ratio of DNA to Lipofectin was 4/1. Glial cells and primary or secondary cultures of CEFs were prepared and transfected as described by Matter-Sadzinski et al . (24Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 24 or 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and processed for CAT assay. The amount of acetylated14C-labeled chloramphenicol was determined by scintillation counting and/or by scanning the chromatogram with a Linear Analyzer LB 284/285 (Berthold). In each experiment, an aliquot of cells was transfected with pSV-CAT , and the resulting CAT activity was arbitrarily set at 100. The activities obtained in parallel with other constructs were calculated relative to this value. 100–150 μg of cytosolic proteins were used in CAT assays such that the proportion of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol in cells transfected with pSV-CAT did not exceed 70%. The activity of the SV40 promoter was similar in different neuronal and non-neuronal cell-types at different embryonic stages (24Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The means and S.D. values were calculated with data obtained in at least five independent experiments. Cells transfected with β-galactosidase reporter plasmids were plated into the chambers of a poly-dl-ornithine-coated plastic chamber slide (Lab-Tek). 24 or 48 h after transfection, X-gal staining was performed as described by Hernandez et al . (15Hernandez M.-C. Erkman L. Matter-Sadzinski L. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3224-3233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Blue cells were counted in 20–30 grid areas that each contained about 103 positive cells upon transfection with pSV-lacZ . 48 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in guanidine thiocyanate (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated, gel-fractionated, and hybridized as described (10Matter J.-M. Matter-Sadzinski L. Ballivet M.

We used as probe a32P-labeled β3 genomic fragment containing 250 bp of exon 5 (encoding amino acids Met308–Gln391) and 240 bp of intron 5 (15Hernandez M.-C. Erkman L. Matter-Sadzinski L. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3224-3233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the chick CNS, the β3 nAChR gene is selectively expressed in the neuroretina. We have previously shown that essential neuron-specific promoter elements are located in a shortEco RI-Sph I DNA fragment, 143 bp in length and located just upstream of the transcription start site (11Matter J.-M. Matter-Sadzinski L. Ballivet M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hernandez M.-C. Erkman L. Matter-Sadzinski L. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3224-3233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This β3RS fragment contains several putative binding sites for transcription factors: CACCC and CAGCTG (E-box) motifs, a CAAT box, and two TATA-like motifs located at −56 bp and −30 bp relative to the transcription initiation site (Fig.1 A ). To investigate how these different sites contribute to promoter activity, point mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction into each site, and the mutated fragments were fused to the CAT reporter gene. The constructs were transfected into neurons freshly dissociated from E5 chick neuroretina (24Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and 48 h later the transfected cells were processed for CAT activity. Mutations in the E-box and in the CAAT box produced spectacular effects, completely abolishing promoter activity in retinal cells. In contrast, mutations in the other motifs had no significant impact on promoter activity (Fig. 1 B ). The binding of nuclear proteins to a very short fragment (35 bp,underlined in Fig. 1 A ) encompassing both the E-box and the CAAT box was tested in gel mobility shift experiments. Extracts from E5 retina bound strongly to this region, whereas binding was much weaker with extracts prepared from cells that do not express β3, such as tectal neurons (Fig. 1 C ) or glial cells (data not shown). Consistent with the transfection experiments, a DNA fragment bearing a mutant E-box (TAGCTA) did not bind nuclear proteins. Deleting the 5′-end of β3RS, which contains the CACCC and E-box motifs (SF; Fig.2 A ), resulted in the complete inactivation of the promoter in retinal cells (Fig. 2 B ). Since mutating the E-box in the full-length β3RS fragment (E-box *, Fig. 2 A ) was sufficient to obtain a similar effect, we tested whether it is possible to reactivate the truncated SF fragment by adding one or several E-boxes at its 5′-end (constructs SF-E and SF-3E; Fig. 2 A ). The addition of one E-box restored promoter activity in retinal cells to a level comparable with that of the complete β3RS fragment, and three E-boxes allowed activity levels consistently higher than β3RS (Fig. 2, B and C ). The tissue specificity of the reactivated promoters was examined by transfection into cells in which the β3 promoter is normally silent, namely cells from the optic tectum and telencephalon, CEFs or glial cells (Fig. 2 C ). No promoter activity was detected in any of them, indicating that SF-E and SF-3E are regulated as specifically as the β3RS fragment. Thus, the addition of one E-box is sufficient to reconstitute a promoter with the same specificity and activity as the wild-type fragment, demonstrating that the E-box is a key regulator of the β3 nAChR gene. Mutation of the CAAT box, which is located 9 bp downstream of the E-box, abolishes promoter activity in retinal cells (Fig. 1 B ), suggesting that direct interactions between proteins bound to these two elements may take place. Due to the helicity of DNA, the addition or deletion of base pairs in the intervening sequence should disrupt the alignment of bound factors, thereby decreasing promoter activity. Several mutants were constructed by the addition or deletion of nucleotides between the E-box and the CAAT box, and they were tested for promoter activity in E5 retinal cells (Fig. 3). Reducing the distance by 1, 2, and 3 bp was sufficient to decrease promoter activity 5, 8, and 10-fold, respectively. In contrast, the addition of 1–4 bp had either a modest effect (Fig. 3) or no effect at all (SF-E, Fig. 2), depending on the particular additional base pairs. This suggests that steric hindrance between bound factors contributes to the decrease in promoter activity when the distance between the two motifs is reduced. Since the E-box is a binding site for transcription factors of the bHLH family, we postulated that expression of the β3 gene is under the control of such a factor in the neuroretina. Several bHLH genes are sequentially expressed in the developing chick CNS. While CASH-1 is expressed in proliferating cells (26Jasoni C.L. Walker M.B. Morris M.D. Reh T.A. Development. 1994; 120: 769-783PubMed Google Scholar), NeuroM is transiently expressed in cells that have withdrawn from the mitotic cycle but have not yet migrated in the outer layers, whereas NeuroD labels neurons that are migrating and differentiating (21Roztocil T. Matter-Sadzinski L. Alliod C. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. Development. 1997; 124: 3263-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CTF-4 (22Tsay H.J. Choe Y.H. Neville C.M. Schmidt J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 202624Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) is widely distributed in the nervous system, but its expression is significantly enhanced in the retina. 3T. Roztocil, unpublished observation. Since β3 expression at early stages of retina development coincides with expression of these different bHLH proteins, we tested if any of them was able to trans-activate the β3RS promoter. Co-transfections with expression vectors encoding CASH-1, NeuroM, NeuroD, or CTF-4 into E8 tectal and E9 telencephalic neurons revealed that none of these proteins was able to trans-activate the β3RS promoter ectopically, although all four were functional transcription factors capable of strongly enhancing activity of the E-box-driven promoter of the muscle nAChR α1 subunit (α1KK fragment, Fig. 4 A , TableI).Table IDifferential trans-activation of the α1 and β3 promoters by bHLH proteinsCell typesControlMyoDNeuroDCASH-1CTF-4TelE9α113 ± 3 (3)150 ± 10 (3)55 ± 5 (3)62 ± 5 (3)58 ± 5 (3)β30 (6)25 ± 5 (6)<1 (3)<1 (3)<1 (3)PEE5β30 (3)0 (3)NRE5α137 ± 7 (4)120 ± 18 (4)81 ± 7 (4)70 ± 7 (4)78 ± 8 (4)β315 ± 2 (20)15 ± 3 (5)15 ± 3 (3)15 ± 3 (3)15 ± 3 (3)NRE13β310 ± 2 (20)11 ± 3 (5)Cells dissociated from telencephalon (Tel), retinal pigmented epithelium (PE), and neuroretina (NR) were co-transfected with either α1KK-lacZ (α1) or β3RS-lacZ (β3) together with the expression vectors EMSV (Control), EMSV-MyoD , EMSV-NeuroD , EMSV-CASH-1 or EMSV-CTF-4 . β-Galactosidase-positive cells were revealed and counted 48 h later and expressed as a percentage of positive cells co-transfected with the control plasmids SV-lacZ and EMSV.

Open table in a new tab Cells dissociated from telencephalon (Tel), retinal pigmented epithelium (PE), and neuroretina (NR) were co-transfected with either α1KK-lacZ (α1) or β3RS-lacZ (β3) together with the expression vectors EMSV (Control), EMSV-MyoD , EMSV-NeuroD , EMSV-CASH-1 or EMSV-CTF-4 . β-Galactosidase-positive cells were revealed and counted 48 h later and expressed as a percentage of positive cells co-transfected with the control plasmids SV-lacZ and EMSV. Values for n are shown in parentheses. Next, we tested whether overexpression of these neuronal transcription factors in retinal cells increased the activity of the β3 promoter. Cells isolated from E5 retinae were co-transfected with the β3RS-lacZ reporter and each of the CASH-1, NeuroM , NeuroD, or CTF-4 expression vectors. On its own, the β3RS promoter drives the expression of β-galactosidase in 15 ± 2% of E5 retinal cells, and this proportion remained unchanged in cells that overexpressed CASH-1, NeuroM, NeuroD, or CTF-4 (Table I). Moreover, no influence of these factors on β3 promoter activity has been detected at later stages of retina development (data not shown). The α1 nAChR gene is not expressed in retina, but the transfected α1KK fragment displayed a significant promoter activity in retinal cells (most likely due to transactivation by endogenous bHLH factors), and co-transfection of the α1KK-lacZ reporter with the different neuronal bHLH proteins strongly increased the proportion of X-gal-positive retinal cells (Table I). Thus, although CASH-1, NeuroM, NeuroD and CTF-4 are functional transcription factors and instances of overlapping expression between these bHLH genes and β3 in the retina have been detected, 4L. Matter-Sadzinski, M. Ballivet, and J.-M. Matter, manuscript in preparation. none of these factors appears to be directly involved in the regulation of β3. Gel mobility shift analyses reveal that CTF-4 binds to the β3 E-boxin vitro (Fig. 4 B ) and that NeuroD binds to the CAGCTG motif (27Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). If such interactions take place in vivo , they are probably not sufficient for promoter activation. Weintraubet al . (28Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have shown that the base pairs flanking one of the IgH E-boxes constitute part of a negative cis-acting element enabling the IgH gene to discriminate between bHLH proteins. In the case of β3, mutation of the base pairs flanking the E-box did not modify the promoter specificity toward neuronal bHLH proteins (Fig.4 C ). Because functional domains are well conserved among members of the bHLH protein family, we asked if MyoD, a transcriptional activator of muscle-specific genes that binds to the CAGCTG motif (29Lassar A.B.

Changes in muscle activity (normal or experimentally induced) lead to modifications of the expression status of several muscle-specific genes. However, the transcription regulatory elements involved in the adaptative response are mainly unknown. The aldolase A muscle-specific promoter, pM, is expressed in adult fast twitch muscle with a preferential expression in fast glycolytic-2B fibers. Its activity is induced during postnatal muscle maturation, suggesting a role of nerve and/or muscle activity. Indeed, denervation of gastrocnemius in newborn mice prevented the activation of the promoter in this muscle, despite the nerve-independent formation of 2B fibers. Although the nerve was necessary for pM onset during development, denervating the gastrocnemius in adults had only mild effects on pM activity. By contrast, a transgene including the pM proximal regulatory sequences that are sufficient to reproduce the 2B fiber-specific expression of the endogenous promoter was shown to be highly sensitive to both neonatal and adult denervation. Transgenes containing muscle-specific pM proximal promoter elements were used to delineate the regulatory elements involved in this response to innervation and changes in the contractile activity pattern. Nerve- and activity-dependent elements could be localized in the 130-base pair-long proximal promoter region of the human aldolase A gene.

Adult skeletal muscle is a heterogenous tissue composed of different types of myofibers, endowed with different metabolic and contractile properties (1Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). This diversity is characterized at the molecular level by the selective expression of different sarcomeric protein isoforms and sets of metabolic enzymes, which results in the physiological specialization of muscle. Usually, myofibers can be classified in four major types according to the MyHC 1The abbreviations used are: MyHC, myosin heavy chain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; NRE, nerve response element; ADRE: activity-dependent response element; bp, base pair(s); M-mRNA, murine aldolase A pM-derived mRNA; ADR, arrested development of righting response. 1The abbreviations used are: MyHC, myosin heavy chain; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; NRE, nerve response element; ADRE: activity-dependent response element; bp, base pair(s); M-mRNA, murine aldolase A pM-derived mRNA; ADR, arrested development of righting response.isoform expressed: type 1 (slow twitch, oxidative), type 2A (fast twitch, oxidative), type 2B (fast twitch, glycolytic), and type 2X (fast twitch, mixed oxidative-glycolytic). Muscle differentiation first proceeds independently of the nerve, and fiber diversity is thought to arise from distinct myoblast populations (3Miller J.B. Everitt E.A. Smith T.H. Block N.E. Dominov J.A. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence shows that later during development, nerve instructions modulate the specialization of muscle fibers. Moreover, adult muscle fibers are plastic entities whose phenotype can change and adapt in response to external influences including relative muscle usage, motor neuron activity, energy source availability, and hormonal status (4Buonanno A. Rosenthal N. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The neuronal influence seems to be transmitted to skeletal muscle fibers mainly via contractile activity, and chronic low frequency electrical stimulation of muscle was shown to cause a transformation of fast fibers into slow fibers (5Hamalainen N. Pette D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Leeuw T. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that nerve and muscle contractile activity play a major role in the final specialization of adult muscle fibers. Adaptative changes to extrinsic factors are accompanied by modifications of the expression patterns of multiple sarcomeric proteins and metabolic enzymes, which are controlled in part at the transcriptional level (8Seedorf U. Leberer E. Kirschbaum B.J. Pette D. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The precise transduction pathways and regulatory mechanisms coupling external stimuli and muscle phenotypic plasticity are still poorly understood. As a first step to investigate such mechanisms, it is necessary to characterize the regulatory sequences and corresponding transcription factors involved in the response of genes whose transcription is affected by these stimuli. Aldolase A is a glycolytic enzyme that is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and whose expression was shown to be modulated in response to alterations in contractile activity in the chicken (9Shackelford J.E. Lebherz H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6423-6429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the rat (10Williams R.S. Garcia-Moll M. Mellor J. Salmons S. Harlan W. J. Biol.

Aldolase A expression is achieved through the use of alternative promoters that have distinct tissue and developmental specificities (12Maire P. Gautron S. Hakim V. Gregory C. Mennecier F. Kahn A. J.

The muscle-specific promoter, pM, is highly activated during postnatal muscle maturation, and in adults, pM-derived transcripts accumulate in fast twitch glycolytic muscles and to a much lower level in slow twitch muscles (14Concordet J.P.

We have previously shown that the proximal regulatory sequences (bp −310 to +45 relative to the transcription start site) of the human aldolase A muscle-specific promoter are sufficient to target the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene (pM310CAT transgene) to fast twitch muscles of transgenic mice, in a pattern mimicking its preferential expression in 2B fibers (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this paper we have investigated the role of innervation and muscle activity on both the murine endogenous muscle pM promoter and the pM310CAT transgene and define the regulatory sequences responsive to these stimuli. To examine the role of the nerve, sections of the sciatic nerve were performed either on newborn mice (before the induction of the promoter) or on adult mice (when the promoter is fully active); whereas neonatal denervation drastically affects the endogenous murine pM activity, only a mild effect is observed after adult denervation, suggesting that the nerve is required during a critical period of neonatal development. However, in both cases, the expression of the transgene is highly sensitive to denervation, showing that the proximal sequences of the human pM promoter contain a very efficient nerve-response element (NRE). To further investigate the influence of muscle activity on aldolase A expression, we crossed our transgenic mice with ADR mice that were affected by a recessive myotonia (21Steinmeyer K. Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M. Jockusch H. Grunder S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). ADR mice constitute a model of muscle hyperactivity (22Goblet C.

Disorders. 1994; 4: 205-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showing biochemical changes reminiscent of those observed in chronically stimulated muscle (24Reininghaus J. Fuchtbauer E.M. Bertram K. Jockusch H. Muscle Nerve. 1988; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Expression of the pM310CAT transgene is severely reduced in ADR both in formerly fast and slow muscles, suggesting that some elements of the pM promoter respond to muscle activity regardless of the fiber type. Studies of transgenes harboring shorter portions of the pM regulatory sequences enabled us to further delineate the sequences responsible for the nerve-response and the contractile activity-dependent expression elements to a small DNA region of 130 bp. The transgenic mice pM310CAT, M-tkCAT, and ΔAT-tkCAT have been described elsewhere (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Spitz F. Salminen M. Demignon J. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Maire P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mice were propagated in the B6/CBA background, and positive carriers of the transgene were identified by Southern blot analysis as described previously (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CAT activity was assayed as described previously (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), using various amount of protein extracts and different times of incubation to keep the enzyme activity in a linear range and to ensure detection of activities ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 cpm/μg/min of reaction. The ADR mouse colony originated from the kind gift of a couple of ADR heterozygote mice by Dr. Harald Jockusch. The mutation was originally in the A2G background, but this background was lost as the mice were bred with the aldolase A transgenic mice. Comparison of ADR and wild-type mice was always carried on littermate animals. Detection of the adr allele was performed by polymerase chain reaction on about 500 ng of tail genomic DNA using a specifically designed couple of oligonucleotides (one in the muscle chloride channel CPC1 gene, and the other in the transposon whose insertion has disrupted the gene (21Steinmeyer K. Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M. Jockusch H. Grunder S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)). The sequences of the primers used were: adr sense, 5′-CTGTCCAACCTAAACTCTCAAGC-3′; and adr antisense, 5′-TCCTACCGCATCCTCAGCAA-3′. Denaturation was performed at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (1 min at 94 °C, 45 s at 59 °C, 2 min at 72 °C). The reaction was performed using 50 pmol of each primer, 250 μm of each dNTPs in Taq polymerase buffer (Eurogentec) supplemented with 1.5 mm MgCl2. The specific amplified DNA fragment (591 bp) was then detected by migration of the polymerase chain reaction product on an 1% agarose gel. Heterozygous and homozygous mice were easily distinguished by the evident myotonic phenotype. Newborn mice were anaesthetized by brief exposure in ice, whereas intraperitoneal injection of avertin was used for older mice. The sciatic (or femoral) nerve was then exposed and surgically cut at two locations, and a section of the nerve was removed to prevent reinnervation during the time of the experiment. In all cases, for surgical and controls procedures, mice were handled in accordance with French and European laws governing animal use for experimental purposes. Total RNAs were prepared by the guanidium thiocyanate single-step procedure (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was done as described previously (14Concordet J.P. Salminen M. Demignon J. Moch C. Maire P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The murine aldolase A pM-derived mRNAs (M-mRNA)-specific probe corresponds to the M-specific exon of the mouse aldolase A gene (18Colbert M.C. Ciejek-Baez E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The myoglobin probe was synthesized by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and corresponds to the third exon of the gene (27Blanchetot A. Price M. Jeffreys A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MyHC-2B transcripts were detected using a 76-bp fragment of the 3′-untranslated region of the rat gene (28Weydert A. Daubas P. Caravatti M. Minty A. Bugaisky G. Cohen A. Robert B. Buckingham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13867-13874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in this case, hybridization was performed at 55 °C (in these conditions, there is no cross-hybridization with other MyHC as shown by the absence of signal in soleus (see Fig. 5) and diaphragm (not shown), which are devoid of 2B fibers). Normalization was performed by hybridization with the ribosomal (18 S) probe R45 (14Concordet J.P. Salminen M. Demignon J. Moch C. Maire P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or by staining the membrane with methylene blue (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Skeletal muscles were dissected from adult mice obtained by crossing the pM310CAT mice (B6/CBA background) with ADR mice (A2G background). Wild-type and ADR homozygous mice were issued from the same litter. Muscles were frozen in isopentan at liquid nitrogen temperature and cross-sectioned in a microtome cryostat. The 5–10-μm-thick unfixed serial sections were reacted with either BA-D5 (MyHC-1), SC-71 (MyHC-2A), BF-F3 (MyHC-2B), or BF-35 (all MyHC types except 2X) monoclonal antibodies (30Schiaffino S.

Motil. 1989; 10: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) (provided by Regeneron, Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY) and then treated as described previously (31Spitz F. Demignon J. Demeurie J. Sabourin J.-C. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Maire P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 561-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In mouse, pM is activated late during postnatal development (after day 10 after birth) (14Concordet J.P. Salminen M. Demignon J. Moch C. Maire P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), during a period that coincides with the end of polyinnervation and establishment of adult contractile activity (32Kyselovic J. Leddy J.J. Ray A. Wigle J. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21770-21777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first tested whether innervation is required for this postnatal pM activation. For this purpose, distal hindlimb muscles of newborn mice including gastrocnemius (a fast muscle mainly composed of 2B fibers in the adults) were denervated by section of the sciatic nerve. Six weeks later, we compared the amount of M-mRNAs in the denervated gastrocnemius and in the nonoperated contralateral muscle. As shown in Fig. 1, although M-mRNAs were easily detected in the innervated gastrocnemius, they were only barely detectable in the denervated gastrocnemius. This down-regulation of pM activity could result from muscle atrophy and/or improper fiber specialization caused by denervation. Because M-mRNAs are mostly expressed in 2B fibers (18Colbert M.C. Ciejek-Baez E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and thus coexpressed in adults with transcripts of the MyHC-2B gene, we checked by Northern blots (Fig. 1) and immunohistochemistry (not shown) whether the formation of 2B fibers and concomitant accumulation of MyHC-2B transcripts is altered following denervation. In agreement with previous works on rats (33Russell S.D. Cambon N. Nadal-Ginard B. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Russell S.D. Cambon N.A. Whalen R.G. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) we found that denervation leads only to a small decrease of the amount of MyHC-2B transcripts. Thus muscle atrophy induced by denervation did not prevent appearance of the 2B fibers in which pM is normally active. Therefore, contrary to postnatal accumulation of MyHC-2B transcripts, which is mostly innervation-independent, the presence of the nerve is required for the strong activation of pM. The regulatory elements of the proximal region of the human and the mouse promoters are highly conserved (17Stauffer J.K. Colbert M.C. Ciejek-Baez E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11773-11782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the pM310CAT transgene containing 355 bp of the human aldolase A pM promoter (bp −310 to +45 relative to the transcription start site) reproduced the fast muscle specificity of the endogenous gene in all transgenic lines analyzed (20Salminen M. Maire P. Concordet J.P. Moch C. Porteu A. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To see whether this transgene can also reproduce the nerve-dependent activation of the murine pM promoter, the sciatic nerve of newborn transgenic pM310CAT mice (line 98) was sectioned, and CAT reporter activity was measured 6 weeks later in both denervated gastrocnemius and soleus (a slow muscle devoid of 2B fibers) and in control contralateral muscles (Fig.2 A ). Denervation led to an about 100-fold decrease of CAT activity in the denervated gastrocnemius, showing that the pM310CAT transgene activation in this fast muscle requires the presence of the nerve as was observed for the endogenous murine pM promoter. Interestingly, although transgene expression was much less affected by denervation in the soleus (a less than 10-fold decrease is observed), a preferential expression still persisted after denervation in the (fast) gastrocnemius muscle compared with soleus. Taking advantage of the great sensitivity of the CAT enzymatic assay, we could follow transgene activation in denervated gastrocnemius and control contralateral at various times of development after neonatal denervation (Fig. 2 B ). Denervation-related down-regulation of transgene expression was already effective at 15 days, suggesting that innervation is required for pM expression even before its full activation. Surprisingly, a first step of this activation (between 15 and 25 days) was observed in denervated gastrocnemius with a fold of increase similar to what is observed in the control innervated muscles. However, denervation prevented further activation of the transgene after day 25, leading to the 100-fold difference between denervated and contralateral muscle at day 40–50 after birth. Taken together, these observations show that innervation is crucial for the high level postnatal expression of the aldolase A muscle-specific promoter in hindlimb fast twitch muscles and that the 355 bp of the human pM promoter are sufficient to reproduce this nerve-dependent activation. In addition, it suggests that distinct pathways are involved in the activation of different genes in the same type of myofibers, with some pathways depending on innervation (early pM developmental onset) while others seems to be innervation-independent (activation of the MyHC-2B gene). Then we examined whether nerve activity is also required for the maintenance of pM expression in an adult muscle. Hindlimb muscles of adult transgenic mice from two independent pM310CAT lines (lines 20 and 98) were denervated by section of the sciatic nerve. Because the great stability of the CAT protein could mask a rapid effect of denervation, we performed Northern blots experiments to detect CAT mRNAs in denervated and innervated muscles at various times after denervation (Fig.3). In control nondenervated muscles, two CAT mRNAs could be observed that correspond to the use of different polyadenylation sites in the SV40 3′ end of the pM310CAT construct. As illustrated in Fig. 3, no more CAT transcripts could be detected in muscles 3 or 7 days after denervation. The diminution of CAT transcripts was faintly detectable as early as 12 h after the nerve section (not shown) and was already marked 24 h after denervation of the gastrocnemius for one of the two CAT mRNAs, which is probably the less stable one (Fig. 3 A ). The induction of the myogenin gene, which is strongly induced after muscle denervation (35Voytik S.L. Przyborski M. Badylak S.F. Konieczny S.F. Dev. Dynamics. 1993; 198: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Eftimie R. Brenner H.R. Buonanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), was used here as a control of effective denervation. The induction of myogenin after denervation could be reproduced with the CAT gene under the control of myogenin regulatory sequences (37Buonanno A. Edmondson D.G. Hayes W.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5684-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), strenghtening the idea that the loss of CAT mRNAs that we observed in our denervation experiments is due to a transcriptional control of pM rather than changes in CAT mRNA stability. Thus denervation of gastrocnemius in adult mice leads to a dramatic and nearly immediate shut-down of the pM310CAT transgene expression. The activity of the endogenous murine aldolase A muscle promoter was affected by neonatal denervation. Surprisingly, in adult mice, the section of the sciatic nerve had only a minor effect on the amount of M-mRNAs (2–4-fold decrease after 7 days of denervation) as for MyHC-2B mRNAs (Fig. 3 B ). This could result from a very high stability of M-mRNAs. Alternatively, and perhaps more probably, this could result from the influence of additional regulatory sequences that could maintain the expression of the endogenous pM promoter in absence of innervation and that are not present in the pM310CAT transgene. Electrical stimulation of muscle was shown to lead to a lowered expression of aldolase A in rat and rabbit (10Williams R.S. Garcia-Moll M. Mellor J. Salmons S. Harlan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2764-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Williams R.S. Salmons S. Newsholme E.A. Kaufman R.E. Mellor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 376-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rabbit, a qualitative modification in the pattern of aldolase A transcripts was also observed (11Williams R.S. Salmons S. Newsholme E.A. Kaufman R.E. Mellor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 376-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through the use of alternative promoters, aldolase A gene gives rise to multiple transcripts of different sizes (alternative first exons have different lengths) (12Maire P. Gautron S. Hakim V. Gregory C. Mennecier F. Kahn A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,16Colbert M.C. Ciejek-Baez E. Dev.

Chem. 1986; 261: 3347-3354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The changes observed by Williams et al. (11Williams R.S. Salmons S. Newsholme E.A. Kaufman R.E. Mellor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 376-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), before the identification of the different promoters, probably reflected a decline in M-mRNAs, the remaining transcripts corresponding to longer mRNAs controlled by the other ubiquitous promoter. Muscle stimulation is rather difficult to perform on mice and usually results in milder changes in these animals than in other species (rats or rabbits). To overcome this difficulty, we have taken advantage of the ADR mutant strain. The ADR mice carry a mutation in the muscle chloride channel ClC1 gene (21Steinmeyer K. Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M. Jockusch H. Grunder S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which causes a reduction of the chloride conductance of their muscles. As a consequence, voluntary movements are followed by electrical after-activity leading to a series of “after-contractions” independent of neural transmission (24Reininghaus J. Fuchtbauer E.M. Bertram K. Jockusch H. Muscle Nerve. 1988; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The chronic electrical activity of this myotonia is similar to a chronic stimulation at low frequency (as normally observed in slow twitch fibers). Indeed, the expression pattern of several genes is modified in the ADR mice in a similar fashion to those in chronically stimulated muscles (22Goblet C. Whalen R.G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Schleef M. Zuhlke C. Schoffl F. Jockusch H. Neuromusc.

Muscle Nerve. 1988; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In particular, the expression pattern of MyHC isoforms is changed in ADR mice, with a disappearance of MyHC-2B replaced by the 2X, 2A, and 1 isoforms and a shift to an oxidative phenotype (22Goblet C. Whalen R.G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Reininghaus J. Fuchtbauer E.M. Bertram K. Jockusch H.

Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1990: 429-443Crossref Google Scholar). By successive breeding, we transferred the pM310CAT transgene from line 20 and line 98 onto the adr background. Then we compared the transgene activity in ADR homozygous mice to their wild-type (or heterozygous) littermates and investigated how the expression pattern of fiber-specific genes is changed by the adr mutation (Fig.4). A comparative immunohistochemical analysis of the gastrocnemius of wild-type and ADR/transgenic mice (Fig. 4) illustrated the almost complete disappearance of 2B fibers in ADR gastrocnemius (rare 2B fibers were observed (data not shown), but they represented less than 1% of their normal proportion), which were replaced mostly by 2X fibers. By contrast, the fiber composition of the ADR/transgenic soleus was not significantly modified (Fig. 4). Northern blot analysis of the normally glycolytic muscles (vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius) in ADR/transgenic mice confirmed the disappearance of MyHC-2B transcripts with a concomitant increase of myoglobin expression (marker of oxidative fibers) (Fig. 5). The endogenous murine pM promoter was only weakly (2–3-fold) affected by the ADR phenotype (Fig. 5). Previous studies of the pattern of expression of the endogenous pM have suggested that it is expressed both in 2B and 2X fibers rather than in 2B only as is the case for the pM310CAT transgene.

It is well established that the efficient transport of class I molecules to the cell surface depends on the assembly of the heavy chain/β2m dimer with peptides, most of which are generated by cleavage of proteins in the cytosol and are actively transported into the ER by a heterodimeric complex, known as transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). The trimeric complex is then transported though the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. En route to complex formation, the nascent heavy chain transiently associates with the ER resident proteins calreticulin and calnexin, as well as with the adaptor molecule tapasin and with TAP (7Solheim J.C.

We have previously shown that in cell lines derived from primary embryonal fibroblasts from transgenic mice expressing both the endogenous H-2 genes and a miniature swine class I transgene (PD1), transformation with the highly oncogenic Ad12 results in a significant reduction in peptide transporter (TAP1 and TAP2) and in proteasome-associated (LMP2 and LMP7) gene expression, and consequently in suppression of cell surface expression of all class I antigens (15Rotem-Yehudar R.

Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels encoded by class I heavy chain and β2m genes in most of these cell lines are reduced by only 2–3-fold (15Rotem-Yehudar R. Vinograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Shemesh J. Rotem-Yehudar R. Ehrlich R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of these genes is either normal or up-regulated in cells transformed by the non-oncogenic virus Ad5. Re-expression of TAP and LMP gene products by stable transfection of an Ad12-transformed cell line completely reconstituted the cell surface expression and assembly of PD1 but did not affect the expression of H-2Kb molecules (21Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of β2m in the cells further induced the assembly and expression of PD1 but did not affect the cell surface expression of H-2 molecules (22Mey-Tal S.V. Schechter C. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These data raised the possibilities that a modest reduction in H-2 mRNA levels critically affects the efficiency of assembly of H-2 complexes, that the H-2 heavy chains are mutated, and/or that Ad12-transformed cells are deficient in a factor(s) that facilitates the assembly of β2m with a particular set of class I heavy chains. We now show that a modest enhancement in the steady state level of class I mRNA, above a threshold level, results in complete reconstitution of assembly and cell surface expression of fully conformed class I complexes. These studies brought to light the existence of a large pool of biologically inactive, free heavy chains in both “normal” and transformed cells that we characterized and whose biological significance we discuss. The Ad12-transformed (VAD12.79, VAD12.42), E1Ad5-transformed (A5O5), TAP-transfected cell line (VAD12.79/TAP), and the “normal” cell line M1 have been previously described (19Shemesh J.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and amphotericin B at the recommended concentrations (23Jacoby W.B. Pastan I.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Media and supplements were purchased from Biological Industries (Bet Ha'emek, Israel). Cell lines were treated with 600 units/ml of IFN-α/β (Lee Biomolecular Research Inc., San Diego) or 100 units/ml IFN-γ (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) for the indicated time periods before harvesting. VAD12.79 and VAD12.79/TAP were transfected by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (21Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture contained 10 μg of plasmid DNA (the H-2Kb cDNA expressed from a CMV promoter in pcDNAI (Invitrogen)), 1 μg of plasmid DNA containing the puromycin gene (pBabe encoding the puromycin resistance gene was a kind gift from P. Murray, Whitehead Institute, Boston), and 5 μg of carrier DNA (sheared salmon sperm DNA, Sigma). 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium was added; after 24 h, the medium was supplemented with 110 units/ml puromycin (Sigma). Following selection of puromycin-resistant cells, individual cell colonies were isolated and expanded in culture. The following antibodies were routinely used for FACS analyses and immunoprecipitations: 20.8.4S (recognizes the α1/α2 epitope on H-2Kb) (24Ozato K. Sachs D.H. J.

Cells were harvested by mild trypsinization, followed by washes in media supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.01% sodium azide. About 106 cells were incubated at 4 °C with the appropriate concentration of the first antibody for 60 min, washed, and then incubated in the dark for another 45 min with the second antibody. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fluorescence intensity was analyzed with a Becton-Dickinson cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells were grown to 80% confluence and starved for 60 min in methionine-free medium. They were then labeled in methionine-free medium containing 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham International, Little Chalfort, UK) for 60 min unless otherwise indicated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and chased for the indicated intervals. The cells were lysed with buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 150 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were washed with buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 150 mm NaCl. For Endo H treatment, immunoprecipitates were eluted by adding 25 μl containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was added to 25 μl of 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 1000 units of Endo H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, followed by the addition of sample buffer. All the buffers contained the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (Sigma), and equivalent protein amounts were loaded on the gels. The protease inhibitor MG-132 at a concentration of 10 μm(Calbiochem) was added to the chase media as indicated. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated on 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and X-OMAT AR x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.) were exposed to the dried gels. The following probes were previously described (19Shemesh J. Rotem-Yehudar R. Ehrlich R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shemesh J. Ehrlich R. J. Biol.

The PD1 specific probe was aSac I-Bam HI genomic fragment containing exons 2–7 of the PD1 gene; the H-2 probe was anEco RI-Hin dIII fragment derived from pH-2d33 (H-2Kd); the β2m probe was a Pst I-Pst I fragment from β2m cDNA; ribosomal RNA probe (rRNA) was aHin dIII-Hin dIII fragment derived from pWES. A plasmid containing H-2Kb cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. L. Eisenbach (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). The hybridization solution contained 4× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.2% SDS, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C, followed by washes with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and 0.2× SSC at temperatures ranging between 55 and 65 °C. After stripping with a boiling solution of 0.1% SDS, the blots were used for additional hybridizations. Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared using a modification of the White and Bancroft method (28White B.A. Bancroft F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8569-8572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (21Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RNA was denatured and fractionated on a 1.2% formaldehyde/formamide agarose gel, blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham International, Little Chalfort, UK), and hybridized with the appropriate probe, which had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Rotem Industries, Dimona, Israel), using a random priming labeling kit (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Dried radioactive gels or blots were exposed to a phosphoimager screen and analyzed with a phosphoimager (Fuji BAS1000, Tokyo). The data are presented as phospho-stimulated luminescence (PSL) units. The reconstitution of cell surface expression of the miniature swine transgene product PD1 but not of H-2Kb class I complexes in Ad12-transformed cells that have been reconstituted for TAP and LMP expression (15Rotem-Yehudar R. Vinograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that mutation(s) in the endogenous H-2 genes (in particular in the H-2Kb gene), but not in the transgene, result in their aberrant conformation such that they are not recognized by conformation-dependent antibodies. To test this possibility, we have treated the cells with either α/β- or γ-IFNs that induce the expression of most genes that are associated with antigen presentation and compared the resulting cell surface expression with that of the “normal” cell line M1. The results of a representative FACS analysis are summarized in Fig.1. All the cell lines were derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing H-2Kb, H-2Db, and PD1 genes. The data demonstrate that the Ad12-transformed cells (VAD12.79, VAD12.42) can be induced to express all the class I gene products (Fig. 1, A–C ). The enhancing effects of IFN treatment on the cell surface expression of class I molecules by the “normal” cell line M1 and the E1Ad5-transformed cell line A5O5, which expresses high levels of these molecules, are minimal (data not shown). Both types of IFNs induced more efficiently the expression of PD1 (15-fold induction by IFN-γ and 25-fold induction by IFNs-α/β) then the expression of H-2Dbmolecules (5–10-fold induction) or H-2Kb molecules, whose expression is less enhanced then H-2Db. The same results were obtained with a large panel of Ad12-transformed cell lines and with seven monoclonal antibodies that recognize different H-2Kb epitopes (20.8.4S, Y3, B8.24.3, 5F1, 28.8.6S, 28.13.3S, and AF6 88.5.3). These data, as well as the fact that direct sequencing of short polymerase chain reaction fragments derived from the extracellular domains of the H-2Kb gene did not reveal the existence of nucleotide substitutions, show that the H-2Kb gene is not mutated in Ad12-transformed cells, and when all the essential factors for assembly and transport of class I complexes are expressed as by IFN induction, the cell surface level of H-2 molecules reaches normal or higher levels (Fig. 1, comparepanels A–C with panel D ). To examine if increased class I expression was due to increase in mRNA steady state levels, the effect of IFNs on class I heavy chain, β2m, and peptide transporter genes was tested for Ad12-transformed cell lines and compared with that of M1 and A5O5 cells. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.2 A , and the results of the individual experiments are summarized in Fig. 2 B . In Fig.2 B , the PSL values for each mRNA have been normalized to those of rRNA, and the expression of H-2, PD1, and β2m genes in untreated Ad12-transformed cells has been arbitrarily defined as 100% (Fig. 2 B (panels a and c )). Because we could not detect a hybridization signal for TAP genes in untreated cells (see also Ref. 15Rotem-Yehudar R. Vinograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the hybridization signal values for TAP1 and TAP2 in treated cells were normalized to those of rRNA and are presented as 100 × PSL units (Fig. 2 B (panels b and c )). The figure shows that the expression of β2m following treatment with γ-IFN is induced by 2-fold (a and c ) and the expressions of TAP1 and TAP2 are induced from zero to levels that are equal or higher then those expressed by M1 and A5O5 cells (compare panels b andc to panel d ), whereas the expression of H-2 class I heavy chain mRNA increases by a maximum of 1.5-fold, and the expression of PD1 is not induced at all (a andc ). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was utilized to distinguish H-Db from H-2Kb mRNA (22Mey-Tal S.V. Schechter C. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that both were comparably induced (data not shown). The compiled data demonstrate that the transcription of β2m and TAP genes is more effectively induced by IFN-γ then by IFN-α/β and that both IFNs affect to the same extent (1.5-fold induction) the steady state level of H-2 heavy chain mRNA. Previous analyses of several individual Ad12-transformed cell lines revealed the following: (a ) there is only 1.5–3-fold decrease in the H-2 steady state mRNA levels of Ad12-transformed cells as compared with the “normal” or E1Ad5-transformed cell lines, yet Ad12-transformed cells did not express any cell surface H-2 complexes (15, 19, 21, 22; see also Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3); and (b ) TAP-transfected Ad12-transformed cells express normal levels of PD1 but very low or undetectable levels of H-2 molecules, whereas the steady state level of PD1 is only 2-fold higher than that of H-2 mRNA (15, 21, 22; see also Fig.3). These observations, in addition to the dramatic effects of IFNs on the cell surface expression of H-2 complexes relative to the weak enhancement in class I heavy chain mRNA levels, suggested that a small increase (1.5–2-fold) in the level of class I heavy chain mRNA can dramatically affect the cell surface expression of class I complexes. To directly test this hypothesis, an Ad12-transformed cell line (VAD12.79) and TAP1+TAP2 transfected VAD12.79 cells (VAD12.79/TAP) were stably transfected with a vector expressing H-2Kb from a CMV promoter. Individual clones that express 1.5–2-fold higher levels of H-2KbmRNA than the parental VAD12.79 cells, and thus comparable levels to the “normal” cell line M1 or to the E1Ad5-transformed cells line A5O5, have been expanded in culture and analyzed. Fig. 3 shows a representative FACS analysis of control and transfected cells. The E1Ad5-transformed cell line A5O5 expresses all class I molecules (the data for H-2Db are not shown), whereas VAD12.79 expresses neither, as was demonstrated before (15Rotem-Yehudar R. Vinograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Mey-Tal S.V. Schechter C. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). VAD12.79/TAP cells are reconstituted for the expression of PD1 but do not express H-2Kb complexes as was described previously (15Rotem-Yehudar R. Vinograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.-M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Mey-Tal S.V. Schechter C. Ehrlich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The re-expression of normal levels of H-2Kb mRNA induces high cell surface expression of H-2Kb complexes only in VAD12.79/TAP cells (VAD12.79/TAP/Kb). Hence, nearly complete reconstitution of H-2 expression in Ad12-transformed cells can be achieved by re-expression of peptide transporters coupled with a 2-fold induction in H-2Kb mRNA level. Thus, the level of cell surface expression of class I complexes increases exponentially when mRNA steady state levels are enhanced beyond a certain threshold. These data clearly show that class I heavy chain mRNA must exceed a certain threshold to generate efficient assembly of class I complexes for cell surface expression. The potential significance of this phenomenon for antigen presentation by tumor cells and virus-infected cells in vivo led us to perform a detailed analysis of class I heavy chain biogenesis in “normal” and transformed cells. Cell lysates prepared from the cell lines described above were immunoprecipitated with the conformation-dependent antibody 20.8.4S and the anti-heavy chain antiserum (anti-HC) that immunoprecipitates only H-2Kb and H-2Db free heavy chains and does not react with conformed heavy chains. Two experiments are shown in Fig.4, A and B , demonstrating that the “normal” cell line M1 (Fig. 4 A ) and the E1Ad5-transformed cell line A5O5 (Fig. 4 B ) express, in addition to the fully conformed H-2Kb complexes, a large pool of free heavy chains. VAD12.79 cells (Fig. 4, A andB ) do not express a significant level of conformed complexes but express a small amount of free heavy chains. The level of free heavy chains depends both on the amount of newly synthesized class I heavy chains and on the expression of TAP genes, as both VAD12.79/Kb (Fig. 4 A ) and especially VAD12.79/TAP (Fig. 4 B ) express higher levels of free heavy chains than the parental non-transfected cells (VAD12.79). VAD12.79/TAP/Kb cells (Fig. 4 B ) express more conformed H-2Kb complexes than VAD12.79/Kb, as expected, and these cells also express very high levels of free class I heavy chains. Because VAD12.79/TAP/Kb cells over-express TAP1 and TAP2 (15Rotem-Yehudar R. Vinograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the data suggest that there is a stable pool of free heavy chains in the cells even when peptide transporter genes are over-expressed; thus, presumably, a sufficient amount of class I binding peptides exists in the ER. To test directly whether under such steady state conditions these free class I heavy chains can be converted to conformed class I complexes, the turnover rate of free heavy chains and of conformed class I complexes was analyzed in pulse-chase experiments using A5O5 cells. A5O5 cells were utilized because they express peptide transporter and LMP genes and, as shown in Fig. 4, both conformed class I complexes and free heavy chains. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 5 A . Quantitation of these results as shown in Fig. 5 C reveal that the free heavy chain pool (H-2Kb+H-2Db) is relatively stable with a half-life of about 2 h. By utilizing lower percentage acrylamide gels, the free H-2Kb and H-2Dbnascent chains could be separated, and the half-life of each was determined and compared with that of the conformed H-2Kbcomplexes. The compiled data of three individual experiments are summarized in Fig. 5 D . The data show that nascent H-2Kb and H-2Db chains have a half-life that ranges between 60 and 100 min, respectively, and that both have a shorter half-life then conformed H-2Kb complexes (130 min). The free heavy chains remain Endo H-sensitive throughout the chase period, implying that they are retained in the ER (Fig. 5 B ). Because the half-life of free H-2Kb heavy chains is less then that of the conformed H-2Kb complexes, one can postulate that during the chase period some nascent heavy chains associate with β2m and peptides and are converted into conformed complexes. However, treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 during the chase prevents the degradation of at least 50% of the free heavy chains such that their half-life is about 150 min (Fig. 6, A andB ). The concentration of MG-132 used in these experiments does not affect the assembly and transport of class I complexes (data not shown), indicating that the enhanced expression of free heavy chains following MG-132 treatment does not result from the dissociation of fully conformed complexes. Moreover, the fact that the degradation of free heavy chains could be prevented, and yet the level and the half-life of conformed complexes were not affected, indicates that at steady state, free heavy chains are not converted into conformed class I complexes. Thus, a pool of free heavy chains is present in fibroblast-derived cell lines, it is slowly degraded intracellularly, apparently by the proteasome, and it does not serve as a major reservoir for the establishment of conformed class I complexes.Figure 6Degradation of free class I heavy chains can be inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. E1Ad5-transformed cells (A5O5) were pulsed with [35S]Met for 25 min and chased for 150 and 300 min in the absence or presence of 10 μm MG-132 (A ). Class I heavy chains were immunoprecipitated with anti-HC antibodies. The results were quantitated and are presented in B .
