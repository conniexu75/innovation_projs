https://openalex.org/W2617583723,"Background Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) are guideline-recommended interventions for symptom management in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Their effect on survival is controversial and the impact on causes of death is unknown. Objective To investigate the effect of NIV and PEG on survival and causes of death in ALS patients. Methods Eighty deceased ALS patients underwent a complete post mortem analysis for causes of death between 2003 and 2015. Forty-two of these patients consented for genetic testing. Effects of NIV and PEG on survival and causes of death were analyzed in a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression. Results Six patients, who requested assisted suicide causing drug-induced hypoxia, were excluded from final analysis. Respiratory failure was the main cause of death in 72 out of 74 patients. Fifteen out of 74 died of aspiration pneumonia 23/74 of bronchopneumonia and 8/74 of a combination of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Twenty died of hypoxia without concomitant infection, and six patients had pulmonary embolism alone or in combination with pneumonia. NIV (p = 0.01) and PEG (p<0.01) had a significant impact on survival. In patients using NIV bronchopneumonia was significantly more frequent (p <0.04) compared to non-NIV patients. This effect was even more pronounced in limb onset patients (p<0.002). Patients with C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions showed faster disease progression and shorter survival (p = 0.01). Conclusion The use of NIV and PEG prolongs survival in ALS. This study supports current AAN and EFNS guidelines which recommend NIV and PEG as a treatment option in ALS. The risk of bronchopneumonia as cause of death may be increased by NIV."
https://openalex.org/W2619593685,"Intrinsic protein fluorescence is inextricably linked to the near-UV autofluorescence of aromatic amino acids. Here we show that a novel deep-blue autofluorescence (dbAF), previously thought to emerge as a result of protein aggregation, is present at the level of monomeric proteins and even poly- and single amino acids. Just as its aggregation-related counterpart, this autofluorescence does not depend on aromatic residues, can be excited at the long wavelength edge of the UV and emits in the deep blue. Differences in dbAF excitation and emission peaks and intensities from proteins and single amino acids upon changes in solution conditions suggest dbAF's sensitivity to both the chemical identity and solution environment of amino acids. Autofluorescence comparable to dbAF is emitted by carbonyl-containing organic solvents, but not those lacking the carbonyl group. This implicates the carbonyl double bonds as the likely source for the autofluorescence in all these compounds. Using beta-lactoglobulin and proline, we have measured the molar extinction coefficients and quantum yields for dbAF in the monomeric state. To establish its potential utility in monitoring protein biophysics, we show that dbAF emission undergoes a red-shift comparable in magnitude to tryptophan upon thermal denaturation of lysozyme, and that it is sensitive to quenching by acrylamide. Carbonyl dbAF therefore provides a previously neglected intrinsic optical probe for investigating the structure and dynamics of amino acids, proteins and, by extension, DNA and RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2619158343,"Lung transplant patients are a vulnerable group of immunosuppressed patients that are prone to frequent respiratory infections. We studied 60 episodes of respiratory symptoms in 71 lung transplant patients. Almost half of these episodes were of unknown infectious etiology despite extensive routine diagnostic testing.We re-analyzed respiratory samples of all episodes with undetermined etiology in order to detect potential viral pathogens missed/not accounted for in routine diagnostics. Respiratory samples were enriched for viruses by filtration and nuclease digestion, whole nucleic acids extracted and randomly amplified before high throughput metagenomic virus sequencing. Viruses were identified by a bioinformatic pipeline and confirmed and quantified using specific real-time PCR.In completion of routine diagnostics, we identified and confirmed a viral etiology of infection by our metagenomic approach in four patients (three Rhinovirus A, one Rhinovirus B infection) despite initial negative results in specific multiplex PCR. Notably, the majority of samples were also positive for Torque teno virus (TTV) and Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). While TTV viral loads increased with immunosuppression in both throat swabs and blood samples, HHV-7 remained at low levels throughout the observation period and was restricted to the respiratory tract.This study highlights the potential of metagenomic sequencing for virus diagnostics in cases with previously unknown etiology of infection and in complex diagnostic situations such as in immunocompromised hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2617082402,"The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function."
https://openalex.org/W2617840951,"Despite the wealth of knowledge available for C. reinhardtii, the central metabolic fluxes of growth on acetate have not yet been determined. In this study, 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) was used to determine and quantify the metabolic pathways of primary metabolism in C. reinhardtii cells grown under heterotrophic conditions with acetate as the sole carbon source. Isotopic labeling patterns of compartment specific biomass derived metabolites were used to calculate the fluxes. It was found that acetate is ligated with coenzyme A in the three subcellular compartments (cytosol, mitochondria and plastid) included in the model. Two citrate synthases were found to potentially be involved in acetyl-coA metabolism; one localized in the mitochondria and the other acting outside the mitochondria. Labeling patterns demonstrate that Acetyl-coA synthesized in the plastid is directly incorporated in synthesis of fatty acids. Despite having a complete TCA cycle in the mitochondria, it was also found that a majority of the malate flux is shuttled to the cytosol and plastid where it is converted to oxaloacetate providing reducing equivalents to these compartments. When compared to predictions by flux balance analysis, fluxes measured with 13C-MFA were found to be suboptimal with respect to biomass yield; C. reinhardtii sacrifices biomass yield to produce ATP and reducing equivalents."
https://openalex.org/W2618076952,"Background Women with signs and symptoms of ischemia, no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) often have diastolic dysfunction and experience elevated rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including heart failure (HF) hospitalization with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We evaluated the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers for long-term HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality in these women. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis to investigate the relationships between inflammatory biomarkers [serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA)] and median of 6 years follow-up for all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization among women with signs and symptoms of ischemia, non-obstructive CAD and preserved EF. Multivariable Cox regression analysis tested associations between biomarker levels and adverse outcomes. Results Among 390 women, mean age 56 ± 11 years, median follow up of 6 years, we observed that there is continuous association between IL-6 level and HF hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 2.5 [1.2–5.0], p = 0.02). In addition, we found significant association between IL-6, SAA levels and all-cause mortality AHR (1.8 [1.1–3.0], p = 0.01) (1.5 [1.0–2.1], p = 0.04), respectively. Conclusion In women with signs and symptoms of ischemia, non-obstructive CAD and preserved EF, elevated IL-6 predicted HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality, while SAA level was only associated with all-cause mortality. These results suggest that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of development of HFpEF, as well all-cause mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2618730849,"The detection of faked identities is a major problem in security. Current memory-detection techniques cannot be used as they require prior knowledge of the respondent’s true identity. Here, we report a novel technique for detecting faked identities based on the use of unexpected questions that may be used to check the respondent identity without any prior autobiographical information. While truth-tellers respond automatically to unexpected questions, liars have to “build” and verify their responses. This lack of automaticity is reflected in the mouse movements used to record the responses as well as in the number of errors. Responses to unexpected questions are compared to responses to expected and control questions (i.e., questions to which a liar also must respond truthfully). Parameters that encode mouse movement were analyzed using machine learning classifiers and the results indicate that the mouse trajectories and errors on unexpected questions efficiently distinguish liars from truth-tellers. Furthermore, we showed that liars may be identified also when they are responding truthfully. Unexpected questions combined with the analysis of mouse movement may efficiently spot participants with faked identities without the need for any prior information on the examinee."
https://openalex.org/W2620345815,"Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a widely used single-molecule technique for measuring nanoscale distances from changes in the non-radiative transfer of energy between donor and acceptor fluorophores. For macromolecules and complexes this observed transfer efficiency is used to infer changes in molecular conformation under differing experimental conditions. However, sometimes shifts are observed in the FRET efficiency even when there is strong experimental evidence that the molecular conformational state is unchanged. We investigate ways in which such discrepancies can arise from kinetic effects. We show that significant shifts can arise from the interplay between excitation kinetics, orientation diffusion of fluorophores, separation diffusion of fluorophores, and non-emitting quenching."
https://openalex.org/W2618930710,"Purpose To investigate visual field changes after vitrectomy for macular diseases in glaucomatous eyes. Methods A retrospective review of 54 eyes from 54 patients with glaucoma, who underwent vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane (ERM; 42 eyes) or macular hole (MH; 12 eyes). Standard automated perimetry (Humphrey visual field 24–2 program) was performed and analyzed preoperatively and twice postoperatively (1st and 2nd sessions; 4.7 ± 2.5, 10.3 ± 3.7 months after surgery, respectively). Postoperative visual field sensitivity at each test point was compared with the preoperative value. Longitudinal changes in mean visual field sensitivity (MVFS) of the 12 test points within 10° eccentricity (center) and the remaining test points (periphery), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, and the association of factors with changes in central or peripheral MVFS over time were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. In addition, 45 eyes from 45 patients without glaucoma who underwent vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane (ERM; 34 eyes) or macular hole (MH; 11 eyes) were similarly examined and statistically analyzed (control group). Results In glaucomatous eyes, visual field test points changed significantly and reproducibly; two points deteriorated only at the center and twelve points improved only at the periphery. Central MVFS decreased (p = 0.03), whereas peripheral MVFS increased postoperatively (p = 0.010). In the control group, no visual field test points showed deterioration, and central MVFS did not change significantly after vitrectomy. BCVA improved, GCC thickness decreased, and IOP did not change postoperatively in both groups. The linear mixed-effects models identified older age, systemic hypertension, longer axial length, and preoperative medication scores of ≥2 as risk factors for central MVFS deterioration in glaucomatous eyes. Conclusions Visual field sensitivity within 10° eccentricity may deteriorate after vitrectomy for ERM or MH in glaucomatous eyes."
https://openalex.org/W2618196277,"Similar to vehicles on roadways, trains frequently kill wildlife via collisions along railways. Despite the prevalence of this mortality worldwide, little is known about the relative importance of wildlife attractants associated with railways, including spilled agricultural products, enhanced vegetation, invertebrates, and carcasses of rail-killed ungulates. We assessed the relative importance of several railway attractants to a provincially-threatened population of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada, for which rail-caused mortality has increased in recent decades without known cause. We examined the relationship between the use of the railway and diet by fitting 21 grizzly bears with GPS collars in 2011–2013 and measuring the stable isotope values (δ15N, δ34S) derived from their hair. We also examined the importance of rail-associated foods to grizzly bears by analyzing 230 grizzly bear scats collected from May through October in 2012–2014, some of which could be attributed to GPS-collared bears. Among the 21 collared bears, 17 used the rail rarely (<9% of the days they were monitored), and only four bears (which included the three smallest bears and the largest bear in our sample) used the rail frequently (>20% of their monitored days). We found no significant relationships between δ15N and δ34S values measured from the hair of grizzlies and their frequency of rail use. Instead, δ15N increased with body mass, especially for male bears, suggesting large males consumed more animal protein during hair growth. All four bears that used the railway frequently produced scats containing grain. Almost half the scats (43%) collected within 150 m of the railway contained grain compared to only 7% of scats found >150 m from the railway. Scats deposited near the rail were also more likely to contain grain in the fall (85% of scats) compared to summer (14%) and spring (17%), and those containing grain were more diverse in their contents (6.8 ± 2.2 species vs. 4.9 ± 1.6, P < 0.001). Lastly, scats collected near the rail were more likely to contain ungulate hair and ant remains, especially in the summer. Our results support local management knowledge that some bears in the region use the railway to forage and supplement their diets with spilled grain, but that individual use of the railway and associated foods were highly variable. We suggest that managers continue to reduce the risk of bears being killed by trains by reactively removing grain and ungulate carcasses from the railway, reducing the amount of grain spilled by trains, and target mitigation to the specific individuals and locations that attract recurrent rail-based foraging."
https://openalex.org/W2618265492,"The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) was established in 2010 to ensure timely access to low-cost generic versions of patented antiretroviral (ARV) medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through the negotiation of voluntary licences with patent holders. While robust data on the savings generated by MPP and other major global public health initiatives is important, it is also difficult to quantify. In this study, we estimate the savings generated by licences negotiated by the MPP for ARV medicines to treat HIV/AIDS in LMICs for the period 2010–2028 and generate a cost-benefit ratio–based on people living with HIV (PLHIVs) in any new countries which gain access to an ARV due to MPP licences and the price differential between originator’s tiered price and generics price, within the period where that ARV is patented. We found that the direct savings generated by the MPP are estimated to be USD 2.3 billion (net present value) by 2028, representing an estimated cost-benefit ratio of 1:43, which means for every USD 1 spent on MPP, the global public health community saves USD 43. The saving of USD 2.3 billion is equivalent to more than 24 million PLHIV receiving first-line ART in LMICs for 1 year at average prices today."
https://openalex.org/W2618617063,"The aim of the study was to analyse a panel of 11 sphingolipids in plasma and three blood fractions (platelet-poor plasma, platelets and red blood cells) of women with mild preeclampsia.We recruited 21 women between 25-40 weeks gestation with diagnosed mild preeclampsia to the study group and 36 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, who corresponded with the study group according to gestational age, to the control group. To assess the concentration of 11 sphingolipids in the blood plasma and blood fractions, we used ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS).We showed a significant increase in the concentration of eight sphingolipids in the plasma of women with preeclampsia in comparison to the control group: Sph (p = 0.0032), S1P (p = 0.0289), C20-Cer (p < 0.0001), C18-Cer (p < 0.0001), C16-Cer (p = 0.012), C18:1-Cer (p = 0.003), C22-Cer (p = 0.0071), and C24:1-Cer (p = 0.0085).We showed that selected sphingolipids, especially C20-Cer and C18-Cer, are totally new factors in the pathomechanism of PE and that these bioactive lipids may play an important role in apoptosis and autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2619211231,"Through systematic Reef Life Survey censuses of rocky reef fishes, invertebrates and macroalgae at eight marine reserves across northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands, we investigated whether a system of no-take marine reserves generates consistent biodiversity outcomes. Ecological responses of reef assemblages to protection from fishing, including potential trophic cascades, were assessed using a control-impact design for the six marine reserves studied with associated reference sites, and also by comparing observations at reserve sites with predictions from random forest models that assume reserve locations are fished. Reserve sites were characterised by higher abundance and biomass of large fishes than fished sites, most notably for snapper Chrysophrys auratus, with forty-fold higher observed biomass inside relative to out. In agreement with conceptual models, significant reserve effects not only reflected direct interactions between fishing and targeted species (higher large fish biomass; higher snapper and lobster abundance), but also second order interactions (lower urchin abundance), third order interactions (higher kelp cover), and fourth order interactions (lower understory algal cover). Unexpectedly, we also found: (i) a consistent trend for higher (~20%) Ecklonia cover across reserves relative to nearby fished sites regardless of lobster and urchin density, (ii) an inconsistent response of crustose coralline algae to urchin density, (iii) low cover of other understory algae in marine reserves with few urchins, and (iv) more variable fish and benthic invertebrate communities at reserve relative to fished locations. Overall, reef food webs showed complex but consistent responses to protection from fishing in well-enforced temperate New Zealand marine reserves. The small proportion of the northeastern New Zealand coastal zone located within marine reserves (~0.2%) encompassed a disproportionately large representation of the full range of fish and benthic invertebrate biodiversity within this region."
https://openalex.org/W2618445506,"Stromatolitic iron-rich structures have been reported from many ancient environments and are often described as Frutexites, a cryptic microfossil. Although microbial formation of such structures is likely, a clear relation to a microbial precursor is lacking so far. Here we report recent iron oxidizing biofilms which resemble the ancient Frutexites structures. The living Frutexites-like biofilms were sampled at 160 m depth in the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden. Investigations using microscopy, 454 pyrosequencing, FISH, Raman spectroscopy, biomarker and trace element analysis allowed a detailed view of the structural components of the mineralized biofilm. The most abundant bacterial groups were involved in nitrogen and iron cycling. Furthermore, Archaea are widely distributed in the Frutexites-like biofilm, even though their functional role remains unclear. Biomarker analysis revealed abundant sterols in the biofilm most likely from algal and fungal origins. Our results indicate that the Frutexites-like biofilm was built up by a complex microbial community. The functional role of each community member in the formation of the dendritic structures, as well as their potential relation to fossil Frutexites remains under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2619462082,"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV), Porcine Delta Corona Virus (PDCoV), and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) are major threats to swine health and contaminated feed plays a role in virus transmission. The objective of our study was to characterize inactivation of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in various feed ingredient matrices. Samples of complete feed, spray dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, and corn dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed (5 g/sample) into scintillation vials and inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV. Samples were incubated at room temperature for up to 56 days. Aliquots were removed at various time points followed by preparing serial 10-fold dilutions and inoculating in cell cultures to determine the amount of surviving virus. Inactivation kinetics were determined using the Weibull model, which estimates a delta value indicating the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. Delta values of various ingredients were compared and analyzed as to their nutrient composition. Soybean meal had the greatest delta value (7.50 days) for PEDV (P < 0.06) as compared with all other ingredients. High delta values (P < 0.001) were observed in soybean meal for PDCoV (42.04 days) and TGEV (42.00 days). There was a moderate correlation between moisture content and the delta value for PDCoV (r = 0.49, P = 0.01) and TGEV (r = 0.41, P = 0.02). There was also a moderate negative correlation between TGEV survival and ether extract content (r = -0.51, P = 0.01). In conclusion, these results indicate that the first log reduction of PDCoV and TGEV takes the greatest amount of time in soybean meal. In addition to this, moisture and ether content appear to be an important determinant of virus survival in feed ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W2619755875,"ABCF1 is an ABC transporter family protein that has been shown to regulate innate immune response and is a risk gene for autoimmune pancreatitis and arthritis. Unlike other members of ABC transporter family, ABCF1 lacks trans-membrane domains and is thought to function in translation initiation through an interaction with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). To study ABCF1 expression and function in development and disease, we used a single gene trap insertion in the Abcf1 gene in murine embryonic stem cells (ES cells) that allowed lineage tracing of the endogenous Abcf1 promoter by following the expression of a β-galactosidase reporter gene. From the ES cells, heterozygous mice (Abcf1+/-) were produced. No live born Abcf1-/- progeny were ever generated, and the lethality was not mouse strain-specific. Thus, we have determined that Abcf1 is an essential gene in development. Abcf1-/- mice were found to be embryonic lethal at 3.5 days post coitum (dpc), while Abcf1+/- mice appeared developmentally normal. Abcf1+/- mice were fertile and showed no significant differences in their anatomy when compared with their wild type littermates. The Abcf1 promoter was found to be active in all organs in adult mice, but varies in levels of expression in specific cell types within tissues. Furthermore, we observed high promoter activity in the blastocysts and embryos. Overall, Abcf1 expression in embryos is required for development and its expression in adults was highly correlated with actively proliferating and differentiating cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2616954148,"Scabies is a parasitic disease, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, and is considered one of the top 50 epidemic diseases and one the most common human skin disease, worldwide. Allergic dermatitis, including an intense itch, is a common symptom, however diagnosis is difficult and there is currently no effective vaccine. The goal of this study was to examine the immune interaction mechanism of both S. scabiei and infected hosts. mRNA-seq and microRNA-seq were conducted on the S. scabiei mite and on infected and uninfected hosts. We focused on differential expression of unigenes and microRNAs, as well as the real targets of unigenes in enriched immune signaling pathways. S. scabiei enhanced host immune function and decreased metabolism after infection, while the immune response of the host inhibited S. scabiei proliferation and metabolism signaling pathways. Differentially expressed unigenes of S. scabiei were enriched in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The differential expression analysis indicated that microRNAs of S. scabiei and hosts have major roles in regulating immune interactions between parasites and hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2616978245,"Tears of the human supraspinatus tendon are common and often cause painful and debilitating loss of function. Progressive failure of the tendon leading to structural abnormality and tearing is accompanied by numerous cellular and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) changes in the tendon tissue. This proteomics study aimed to compare torn and aged rotator cuff tissue to young and healthy tissue, and provide the first ECM inventory of human supraspinatus tendon generated using label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS. Employing two digestion protocols (trypsin and elastase), we analysed grain-sized tendon supraspinatus biopsies from older patients with torn tendons and from healthy, young controls. Our findings confirm measurable degradation of collagen fibrils and associated proteins in old and torn tendons, suggesting a significant loss of tissue organisation. A particularly marked reduction of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) raises the possibility of using changes in levels of this glycoprotein as a marker of abnormal tissue, as previously suggested in horse models. Surprisingly, and despite using an elastase digestion for validation, elastin was not detected, suggesting that it is not highly abundant in human supraspinatus tendon as previously thought. Finally, we identified marked changes to the elastic fibre, fibrillin-rich niche and the pericellular matrix. Further investigation of these regions may yield other potential biomarkers and help to explain detrimental cellular processes associated with tendon ageing and tendinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2618056929,"Targeting epigenetic changes in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) may provide a novel treatment option for patients. This report demonstrates that sodium valproate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), can increase the cytotoxicity of carboplatin in an additive and synergistic manner in DIPG cells in vitro. Sodium valproate causes a dose-dependent decrease in DIPG cell viability in three independent ex vivo cell lines. Furthermore, sodium valproate caused an increase in acetylation of histone H3. Changes in cell viability were consistent with an induction of apoptosis in DIPG cells in vitro, determined by flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V staining and assessment of apoptotic markers by western blotting. Subsequently, immunofluorescent staining of neuronal and glial markers was used to determine toxicity in normal rat hippocampal cells. Pre-treatment of cells with sodium valproate enhanced the cytotoxic effects of carboplatin, in three DIPG cell lines tested. These results demonstrate that sodium valproate causes increased histone H3 acetylation indicative of HDAC inhibition, which is inversely correlated with a reduction in cell viability. Cell viability is reduced through an induction of apoptosis in DIPG cells. Sodium valproate potentiates carboplatin cytotoxicity and prompts further work to define the mechanism responsible for the synergy between these two drugs and determine in vivo efficacy. These findings support the use of sodium valproate as an adjuvant treatment for DIPG."
https://openalex.org/W2619694483,"Tropical tuna fisheries are among the largest worldwide, with some having significant bycatch issues. However, pole-and-line tuna fisheries are widely believed to have low bycatch rates, although these have rarely been quantified. The Maldives has an important pole-and-line fishery, targeting skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). In the Maldives, 106 pole-and-line tuna fishing days were observed between August 2014 and November 2015. During 161 fishing events, tuna catches amounted to 147 t: 72% by weight was skipjack, 25% yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and 3% other tunas. Bycatch (all non-tuna species caught plus all tuna discards) amounted to 951 kg (0.65% of total tuna catch). Most of the bycatch (95%) was utilized, and some bycatch was released alive, so dead discards were particularly low (0.02% of total tuna catch, or 22 kg per 100 t). Rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) together constituted 93% of the bycatch. Live releases included small numbers of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) and seabirds (noddies, Anous tenuirostris and A. stolidus). Pole-and-line tuna fishing was conducted on free schools and schools associated with various objects (Maldivian anchored fish aggregating devices [aFADs], drifting FADs from western Indian Ocean purse seine fisheries, other drifting objects and seamounts). Free school catches typically included a high proportion of large skipjack and significantly less bycatch. Associated schools produced more variable tuna catches and higher bycatch rates. Fishing trips in the south had significantly lower bycatch rates than those in the north. This study is the first to quantify bycatch rates in the Maldives pole-and-line tuna fishery and the influence of school association on catch composition. Ratio estimator methods suggest roughly 552.6 t of bycatch and 27.9 t of discards are caught annually in the fishery (based on 2015 national catch), much less than other Indian Ocean tuna fisheries, e.g. gillnet, purse-seine, and longline."
https://openalex.org/W2619507790,"Fluorescence spectroscopy techniques like Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) have become important tools for the in vitro and in vivo investigation of conformational dynamics in biomolecules. These methods rely on the distance-dependent quenching of the fluorescence signal of a donor fluorophore either by a fluorescent acceptor fluorophore (FRET) or a non-fluorescent quencher, as used in FCS with photoinduced electron transfer (PET). The attachment of fluorophores to the molecule of interest can potentially alter the molecular properties and may affect the relevant conformational states and dynamics especially of flexible biomolecules like intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP). Using the intrinsically disordered S-peptide as a model system, we investigate the impact of terminal fluorescence labeling on the molecular properties. We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations on the labeled and unlabeled peptide and compare the results with in vitro PET-FCS measurements. Experimental and simulated timescales of end-to-end fluctuations were found in excellent agreement. Comparison between simulations with and without labels reveal that the π-stacking interaction between the fluorophore labels traps the conformation of S-peptide in a single dominant state, while the unlabeled peptide undergoes continuous conformational rearrangements. Furthermore, we find that the open to closed transition rate of S-peptide is decreased by at least one order of magnitude by the fluorophore attachment. Our approach combining experimental and in silico methods provides a benchmark for the simulations and reveals the significant effect that fluorescence labeling can have on the conformational dynamics of small biomolecules, at least for inherently flexible short peptides. The presented protocol is not only useful for comparing PET-FCS experiments with simulation results but provides a strategy to minimize the influence on molecular properties when chosing labeling positions for fluorescence experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2619615217,"Background In malaria endemic regions, Plasmodium falciparum infection is characterized by extensive genetic diversity. Describing this diversity provides important information about the local malaria situation. This study was conducted to evaluate the extent of genetic diversity of P. falciparum in Pawe district, North West Ethiopia, using the highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein 2 gene. Methods Atotal of 92 isolates from patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum attending Pawe Health Centre were collected from September to December 2013. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Chelex method and analyzed by length polymorphism following gel electrophoresis of DNA products from nested PCR of msp2 (block 3), targeting allelic families of FC27 and 3D7/IC. Results There were twenty-two different msp2 alleles, 11 corresponding to the 3D7/ IC and 11 to the FC27 allelic family. The frequency of isolates of the msp2 3D7/IC allelic familywas higher (51%) compared to FC27 (49%). The majority of the isolates (76%) contained multiple infections andthe overall mean multiplicity of infection was 2.8 (CI 95% 2.55–3.03). The heterozygosity index was 0.66 for msp2. There was no statically significant difference in the multiplicity of infection by age or parasite density. Conclusions The results of this study show that P.falciparum polymorphismsare extensive in Northwest Ethiopia and most of the infections are composed of multiple clones."
https://openalex.org/W2617607067,"Previous seascape genetics studies have emphasized the role of ocean currents and geographic distances to explain the genetic structure of marine species, but the role of benthic habitat has been more rarely considered. Here, we compared the population genetic structure observed in West Pacific giant clam populations against model simulations that accounted habitat composition and configuration, geographical distance, and oceanic currents. Dispersal determined by geographical distance provided a modelled genetic structure in better agreement with the observations than dispersal by oceanic currents, possibly due to insufficient spatial resolution of available oceanographic and coastal circulation models. Considering both habitat composition and configuration significantly improved the match between simulated and observed genetic structures. This study emphasizes the importance of a reefscape genetics approach to population ecology, evolution and conservation in the sea."
https://openalex.org/W2618411371,"This paper proposes a combination of non-local spatial information and quantum-inspired shuffled frog leaping algorithm to detect underwater objects in sonar images. Specifically, for the first time, the problem of inappropriate filtering degree parameter which commonly occurs in non-local spatial information and seriously affects the denoising performance in sonar images, was solved with the method utilizing a novel filtering degree parameter. Then, a quantum-inspired shuffled frog leaping algorithm based on new search mechanism (QSFLA-NSM) is proposed to precisely and quickly detect sonar images. Each frog individual is directly encoded by real numbers, which can greatly simplify the evolution process of the quantum-inspired shuffled frog leaping algorithm (QSFLA). Meanwhile, a fitness function combining intra-class difference with inter-class difference is adopted to evaluate frog positions more accurately. On this basis, recurring to an analysis of the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), a new search mechanism is developed to improve the searching ability and detection accuracy. At the same time, the time complexity is further reduced. Finally, the results of comparative experiments using the original sonar images, the UCI data sets and the benchmark functions demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2619871843,"In many computer vision and machine learning applications, the data sets distribute on certain low-dimensional subspaces. Subspace clustering is a powerful technology to find the underlying subspaces and cluster data points correctly. However, traditional subspace clustering methods can only be applied on data from one source, and how to extend these methods and enable the extensions to combine information from various data sources has become a hot area of research. Previous multi-view subspace methods aim to learn multiple subspace representation matrices simultaneously and these learning task for different views are treated equally. After obtaining representation matrices, they stack up the learned representation matrices as the common underlying subspace structure. However, for many problems, the importance of sources and the importance of features in one source both can be varied, which makes the previous approaches ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Robust Auto-weighted Multi-view Subspace Clustering (RAMSC). In our method, the weight for both the sources and features can be learned automatically via utilizing a novel trick and introducing a sparse norm. More importantly, the objective of our method is a common representation matrix which directly reflects the common underlying subspace structure. A new efficient algorithm is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoretical proof on its convergency. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark multi-view datasets well demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W2610608594,"Many types of cancer express high levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that are molecular chaperones regulating protein folding and stability ensuring protection of cells from potentially lethal stress. HSPs in cancer cells promote survival, growth and spreading even in situations of growth factors deprivation by associating with oncogenic proteins responsible for cell transformation. Hence, it is not surprising that the identification of potent inhibitors of HSPs, notably HSP90, has been the primary research focus, in recent years. Exposure of cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors, including 17-AAG, has been shown to cause resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment mostly attributable to induction of the heat shock response and increased cellular levels of pro-survival chaperones. In this study, we show that treatment of glioblastoma cells with 17-AAG leads to HSP90 inhibition indicated by loss of stability of the EGFR client protein, and significant increase in HSP70 expression. Conversely, co-treatment with the small-molecule kinase inhibitor D11 leads to suppression of the heat shock response and inhibition of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Beside HSP70, Western blot and differential mRNA expression analysis reveal that combination treatment causes strong down-regulation of the small chaperone protein HSP27. Finally, we demonstrate that incubation of cells with both agents leads to enhanced cytotoxicity and significantly high levels of LC3-II suggesting autophagy induction. Taken together, results reported here support the notion that including D11 in future treatment regimens based on HSP90 inhibition can potentially overcome acquired resistance induced by the heat shock response in brain cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2619223019,"To examine the association between maternal depression and anxiety disorders (MDAD) and child development assessed during the kindergarten year.Administrative data from several health and social databases in Manitoba, Canada, were used to study 18,331 mother-child pairs. MDAD over the period from one year prior to the child's birth to the kindergarten year was defined using physician diagnoses and filled prescriptions. Child development was assessed during the kindergarten year using the Early Development Instrument (EDI) which measures vulnerability across five domains of development. Structural equation modeling was used to examine associations between timing, recurrence and severity of MDAD and child outcomes. Health at Birth (preterm, low birth weight, neonatal intensive care stay and long birth hospitalization), Family Context (teen mother, lone parent, socio-economic status (SES)), child age and child sex were covariates.MDAD had a modest negative association with child EDI scores across all models tested, particularly for social, emotional and physical development. Prenatal MDAD had a stronger negative association with outcomes than other time periods; however, recurrent MDAD had a stronger negative association with outcomes than any specific time period or MDAD severity. The influence of MDAD was mediated by Family Context, which had a strong, negative association with outcomes, particularly language and cognitive development.The number of time periods a child was exposed to MDAD in early childhood was more negatively associated with five areas of child development than timing or severity. Prenatal exposure may be more sensitive to MDAD than other time periods. The familial context (teen mother, lone parenthood and low SES) had a stronger influence on child outcomes than MDAD. Findings can be used to inform interventions which address maternal mental health from the prenatal period onward, and to support disadvantaged families to encourage healthy birth outcomes, early childhood development and school readiness."

Previous research suggests that the principles of Construal Level Theory can be applied to enhance self-control, as measured by delay discounting. The present studies replicate and expand on this work by examining whether theory-informed priming manipulations lead to delay discounting reductions in a repeated-measures design. Study 1 conceptually replicated previous work, with reduced delay discounting observed as a function of thinking abstractly. Studies 2 and 3 expanded on this work by reinterpreting (a) preference for immediate outcomes as preference for outcomes that are construed concretely, and (b) dispreference for delayed outcomes as dispreference for outcomes that are construed abstractly. Study 2 provided support for the first interpretation, as reduced delay discounting was observed as a function of thinking concretely about the future. Study 3 provided support for the second interpretation, as reduced delay discounting was observed as a function of thinking abstractly about the present. In studies 1 and 3, significant condition × order interactions were observed. In all three studies, the same impact of order of exposure to priming manipulation was observed, indicating specific carryover effects."

We generated in bacteria and then purified a recombinant GST-ASPG protein that we used to characterize the biochemical and cytotoxic properties of the human ASPG. We demonstrated that ASPG possesses asparaginase and PAF acetylhydrolase activities that depend on a critical threonine residue at position 19. Consistently, ASPG but not its T19A mutant showed cytotoxic activity in K562, NALM-6 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines but not in normal cells. Regarding the mechanism of action of ASPG, it was able to induce a significant apoptotic death in K562 cells. Taken together our data suggest that ASPG, combining different enzymatic activities, should be considered a promising anti-cancer agent for inhibiting the growth of leukemia cells."
https://openalex.org/W2617285952,"Given the numerous threats against Earth's coral reefs, there is an urgent need to develop means of assessing reef coral health on a proactive timescale. Molecular biomarkers may prove useful in this endeavor because their expression should theoretically undergo changes prior to visible signs of health decline, such as the breakdown of the coral-dinoflagellate (genus Symbiodinium) endosymbiosis. Herein 13 molecular- and physiological-scale biomarkers spanning both eukaryotic compartments of the anthozoan-Symbiodinium mutualism were assessed across 70 pocilloporid coral colonies sampled from reefs of Fiji's easternmost province, Lau. Eleven colonies were identified as outliers upon employment of a detection method based partially on the Mahalanobis distance; these corals were hypothesized to have been displaying aberrant sub-cellular behavior with respect to their gene expression signatures, as they were characterized not only by lower Symbiodinium densities, but also by higher levels of expression of several stress-targeted genes. Although these findings could suggest that the sampled colonies were physiologically compromised at the time of sampling, further studies are warranted to state conclusively whether these 11 scleractinian coral colonies are more stress-prone than nearby conspecifics that demonstrated statistically normal phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2618500983,"To gain a better understanding of cold acclimation in rhododendron and in woody perennials in general, we used the 2D-DIGE technique to analyze the rhododendron proteome during the seasonal development of freezing tolerance. We selected two species varying in their cold acclimation ability as well as their thermonasty response (folding of leaves in response to low temperature). Proteins were extracted from leaves of non-acclimated (NA) and cold acclimated (CA) plants of the hardier thermonastic species, R. catawbiense (Cata.), and from leaves of cold acclimated plants of the less hardy, non-thermonastic R. ponticum (Pont.). All three protein samples (Cata.NA, Cata.CA, and Pont.CA) were labeled with different CyDyes and separated together on a single gel. Triplicate gels were run and protein profiles were compared resulting in the identification of 72 protein spots that consistently had different abundances in at least one pair-wise comparison. From the 72 differential spots, we chose 56 spots to excise and characterize further by mass spectrometry (MS). Changes in the proteome associated with the seasonal development of cold acclimation were identified from the Cata.CA-Cata.NA comparisons. Differentially abundant proteins associated with the acquisition of superior freezing tolerance and with the thermonastic response were identified from the Cata.CA-Pont.CA comparisons. Our results indicate that cold acclimation in rhododendron involves increases in abundance of several proteins related to stress (freezing/desiccation tolerance), energy and carbohydrate metabolism, regulation/signaling, secondary metabolism (possibly involving cell wall remodeling), and permeability of the cell membrane. Cold acclimation also involves decreases in abundance of several proteins involved in photosynthesis. Differences in freezing tolerance between genotypes can probably be attributed to observed differences in levels of proteins involved in these functions. Also differences in freezing tolerance may be attributed to higher levels of some constitutive protective proteins in Cata. than in Pont. that may be required to overcome freeze damage, such as glutathione peroxidase, glutamine synthetase, and a plastid-lipid-associated protein."

Different from existing proxies of the investors' attention, such as the Google trends, Baidu index (BI), we argue the collective attention from the stock trading platforms could reflect the investors' attention more closely. By calculated the increments of the attention volume for each stock (IAVS) from the stock trading platforms, we investigate the effect of investors' attention measured by the IAVS on the movement of the stock market. The experimental results for Chinese Securities Index 100 (CSI100) show that the BI is significantly correlated with the returns of CSI100 at 1% significance level only in 2014. However, it should be emphasized that the correlation of the new proposed measure, namely IAVS, is significantly at 1% significance level in 2014 and 2015. It shows that the effect of the measure IAVS on the movement of the stock market is more stable and significant than BI. This study yields important invest implications and better understanding of collective investors' attention."
https://openalex.org/W2619907573,"Background The impact of tuberculosis (TB) is exacerbated in Africa because of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) diagnosis is difficult in HIV-infected patients and negative sputum results are more common which leads to diagnostic delay and increases morbidity and mortality. Extra-pulmonary samples such as stool may be easier to obtain and our approach may therefore significantly improve PTB detection in people living with HIV. Objective To detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the stool of HIV sero-positive individuals suspected of pulmonary TB. Method A total of 117 HIV-infected individuals from three public health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia were enrolled consecutively in the study. Paired morning sputum and stool samples were simultaneously collected from anti-retroviral therapy (ART) naïve individuals living with HIV and suspected for PTB. The diagnostic accuracy of the smear microscopy, culture and region of difference (RD)9–based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in stool was compared with the accuracy of sputum testing. Chi-square test and kappa value were used to compare different method used. Results Sputum culture positivity for mycobacteria was confirmed in 33(28.2%) of the study subjects. Of 33 individuals positive for sputa culture, 10 individuals were observed to be stools culture positive. Of the 84 individuals negative for mycobacteria by sputum culture, three (3.6%) were stool culture positive and thus, the sensitivity and agreement between stool culture as compare to sputum culture were 30.3% and 0.33, respectively. Of 117 individuals, 11(9.4%) were sputum smear positive and of 11 sputum smear positive three were also stool smear positive. While of the 106 sputum smear negative individuals’, only one was stool smear positive resulting in 12.1% sensitivity and 0.18 agreements against sputum culture. On the other hand, the sensitivity of RD9-based PCR directly on stool was 69.7% by considering sputum culture as a reference standard. Moreover, RD9-based PCR directly on sputum detected 7(6.0%) individuals who were sputum culture negative for M. tuberculosis. Conclusion M. tuberculosis was detected in stool of individuals living with HIV who were negative for sputum smear microscopy and culture. Hence, examination of stool samples alongside with sputum samples increases the detection of PTB in individuals living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2617696712,"Background 
It is believed that activation of c-Src bound to the integrin β3 subunit initiates outside-in signaling. The involvement of αIIb in outside-in signaling is poorly understood.


Objectives 
We have previously shown that CIB1 specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of αIIb and is required for αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Here we evaluated the role of CIB1 in regulating outside-in signaling in the absence of inside-out signaling.


Methods 
We used αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide and CIB1-function blocking antibody to inhibit interaction of CIB1 with αIIb subunit as well as Cib1-/- platelets to evaluate the consequence of CIB1 interaction with αIIb on outside-in signaling.


Results 
Fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 results in calcium-dependent interaction of CIB1 with αIIb, which is not required for filopodia formation. Dynamic rearrangement of cytoskeleton results in CIB1-dependent recruitment of FAK to the αIIb complex and its activation. Disruption of the association of CIB1 and αIIb by incorporation of αIIb peptide or anti-CIB1 inhibited both FAK association and activation. Furthermore, FAK recruitment to the integrin complex was required for c-Src activation. Inhibition of c-Src had no effect on CIB1 accumulation with the integrin at the filopodia, suggesting that c-Src activity is not required for the formation of CIB1-αIIb-FAK complex.


Conclusion 
Our results suggest that interaction of CIB1 with αIIb is one of the early events occurring during outside-in signaling. Furthermore, CIB1 recruits FAK to the αIIbβ3 complex at the filopodia where FAK is activated, which in turn activates c-Src, resulting in propagation of outside-in signaling leading to platelet spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2617900975,"Proper identification of spinal cord levels is crucial for clinical-pathological and imaging studies in humans, but can be a challenge given technical limitations. We have previously demonstrated in non-primate models that the contours of the spinal ventral horn are determined by the position of motoneuron pools. These positions are preserved within and among individuals and can be used to identify lumbosacral spinal levels. Here we tested the hypothesis that this approach can be extended to identify monkey and human spinal levels. In 7 rhesus monkeys, we retrogradely labeled motoneuron pools that represent rostral, middle and caudal landmarks of the lumbosacral enlargement. We then aligned the lumbosacral enlargements among animals using absolute length, segmental level or a relative scale based upon rostral and caudal landmarks. Inter-animal matching of labeled motoneurons across the lumbosacral enlargement was most precise when using internal landmarks. We then reconstructed 3 human lumbosacral spinal cords, and aligned these based upon homologous internal landmarks. Changes in shape of the ventral horn were consistent among human subjects using this relative scale, despite marked differences in absolute length or age. These data suggest that the relative position of spinal motoneuron pools is conserved across species, including primates. Therefore, in clinical-pathological or imaging studies in humans, one can assign spinal cord levels to even single sections by matching ventral horn shape to standardized series."
https://openalex.org/W2616993522,"The onset and progression of diabetes mellitus type 2 is highly contingent on the amount of functional beta-cell mass. An underlying cause of beta-cell decay in diabetes is oxidative stress, which markedly affects the insulin producing pancreatic cells due to their poor antioxidant defence capacity. Consequently, disturbances of cellular redox signaling have been implicated to play a major role in beta-cell loss in diabetes mellitus type 2. There is evidence suggesting that the glutaredoxin (Grx) system exerts a protective role for pancreatic islets, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. In this study, a mouse model for diabetes mellitus type 2 was used to gain further insight into the significance of Grx for the islets of Langerhans in the diabetic metabolism. We have observed distinct differences in the expression levels of Grx in pancreatic islets between obese, diabetic db mice and lean, non-diabetic controls. This finding is the first report about a decrease of Grx expression levels in pancreatic islets of diabetic mice which was accompanied by declining insulin secretion, increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production level, and cell cycle alterations. These data demonstrate the essential role of the Grx system for the beta-cell during metabolic stress which may provide a new target for diabetes mellitus type 2 treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2617375743,"Renal vascular development is a coordinated process that requires ordered endothelial cell proliferation, migration, intercellular adhesion, and morphogenesis. In recent decades, studies have defined the pivotal role of endothelial receptor tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) in the development and maintenance of renal vasculature. However, the expression and the role of receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) in renal endothelium are poorly understood, though coupled and counterbalancing roles of RPTKs and RPTPs are well defined in other systems. In this study, we evaluated the promoter activity and immunolocalization of two endothelial RPTPs, VE-PTP and PTPμ, in developing and adult renal vasculature using the heterozygous LacZ knock-in mice and specific antibodies. In adult kidneys, both VE-PTP and PTPμ were expressed in the endothelium of arterial, glomerular, and medullary vessels, while their expression was highly limited in peritubular capillaries and venous endothelium. VE-PTP and PTPμ promoter activity was also observed in medullary tubular segments in adult kidneys. In embryonic (E12.5, E13.5, E15.5, E17.5) and postnatal (P0, P3, P7) kidneys, these RPTPs were expressed in ingrowing renal arteries, developing glomerular microvasculature (as early as the S-shaped stage), and medullary vessels. Their expression became more evident as the vasculatures matured. Peritubular capillary expression of VE-PTP was also noted in embryonic and postnatal kidneys. Compared to VE-PTP, PTPμ immunoreactivity was relatively limited in embryonic and neonatal renal vasculature and evident immunoreactivity was observed from the P3 stage. These findings indicate 1) VE-PTP and PTPμ are expressed in endothelium of arterial, glomerular, and medullary renal vasculature, 2) their expression increases as renal vascular development proceeds, suggesting that these RPTPs play a role in maturation and maintenance of these vasculatures, and 3) peritubular capillary VE-PTP expression is down-regulated in adult kidneys, suggesting a role of VE-PTP in the development of peritubular capillaries."

Other antihypertensives such as calcium channel blockers achieve similar therapeutic effectiveness in attenuating hypertension-related renal damage progression. Our objective was to explore the value of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of renal AT1 receptor (AT1R) to guide therapy in the 5/6 subtotal-nephrectomy (Nx) rat model of CKD. Ten weeks after Nx, Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 10mg/kg/d enalapril (NxE), 30mg/kg/d diltiazem (NxD) or left untreated (Nx) for an additional 8–10 weeks. Kidney AT1R expression was assessed using in vivo [18F]fluoropyridine-losartan PET and in vitro autoradiography. Compared to shams, Nx rats exhibited higher systolic blood pressure that was reduced by both enalapril and diltiazem. At 18–20 weeks, plasma creatinine and albuminuria were significantly increased in Nx, reduced to sham levels in NxE, but enhanced in NxD rats. Enalapril treatment decreased kidney angiotensin II whereas diltiazem induced significant elevations in plasma and kidney levels. Reduced PET renal AT1R levels in Nx were normalized by enalapril but not diltiazem, and results were supported by autoradiography. Reduction of renal blood flow in Nx was restored by enalapril, while no difference was observed in myocardial blood flow amongst groups. Enhanced left ventricle mass in Nx was not reversed by enalapril but was augmented with diltiazem. Stroke volume was diminished in untreated Nx compared to shams and restored with both therapies. [18F]Fluoropyridine-Losartan PET allowed in vivo quantification of kidney AT1R changes associated with progression of CKD and with various pharmacotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2616475739,"Cigarette smoking is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with repeated and sustained infections linked to disease pathogenesis and exacerbations. The airway epithelium constitutes the first line of host defense against infection and is known to be impaired in COPD. We have previously identified Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 (FABP5) as an important anti-inflammatory player during respiratory infections and showed that overexpression of FABP5 in primary airway epithelial cells protects against bacterial infection and inflammation. While cigarette smoke down regulates FABP5 expression, its mechanism remains unknown. In this report, we have identified three putative c-Jun binding sites on the FABP5 promoter and show that cigarette smoke inhibits the binding of c-Jun to its consensus sequence and prevents LPS-induced FABP5 expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have determined that c-Jun binds the FABP5 promoter when stimulated with LPS but the presence of cigarette smoke greatly reduces this binding. Furthermore, cigarette smoke or a mutation in the c-Jun binding site inhibits LPS-induced FABP5 promoter activity. These data demonstrate that cigarette smoke interferes with FABP5 expression in response to bacterial infection. Thus, functional activation of FABP5 may be a new therapeutic strategy when treating COPD patients suffering from exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W2617985163,"A growing body of evidence from animal models and cell culture studies indicate an important role of a local regulatory complement system (CS) in peritoneal injury during peritoneal dialysis (PD). We investigated the expression of the local regulatory CS (reflected by CD46,CD55,CD59) in the peritoneal tissue of patients with different membrane function characteristics.Biopsies from the parietal peritoneum were taken from 24 patients on PD, 22 uremic patients prior to PD. PD patients were grouped according to the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D/P Cre) and ratio of dialysate glucose at 4 hours versus dialysate glucose at time zero (D/D0 glucose) into low or low-average peritoneal transport status (L/LA) and high-average or high-transport status (HA/H) groups. CD46, CD55, and CD59 RNA expression were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further localization of membrane complement regulators (CRegs) and semiquantitatively analysis was done by immunohistochemistry (IHC).CD46 and CD59 expression were similar in all groups. CD55 expression was significantly decreased in the HA/H group compared to the L/LA group and to uremic controls (p < 0.05 and p = 0.05, respectively). No statistically significant differences in CD46, CD55, and CD55 expression were detected when considering the history of peritonitis. There was no statistically significant correlation between PD duration and the expressions of CD46, CD55, and CD59. IHC revealed strong CD46, CD55, and CD59 expression in mesothelial cells. CD55 and CD59 were additionally detected in the vasculature. Using IHC, CD46 was lower in PD patients compared to uremic controls (p>0.05), but there was no difference between the L/LA compared to the H/HA group. Moreover IHC confirmed decreased expression of CD55 in the HA/H group compared to the L/LA group and uremic controls (p<0.0001 and p = 0.0001, respectively).CD55 expression is decreased in patients with fast transporter membrane function, whereas peritonitis and PD duration do not appear to alter CReg expression."

This study aimed at developing and validating continuous measures of asthma severity in adult patients with ever asthma from the general population, to be used in epidemiological studies. Methods Respiratory symptoms, anti-asthmatic treatment and lung function were measured on 520 patients with ever asthma aged 20–64 years from the general Italian population (GEIRD study; 2007/2010). The variables that represent the same dimension of asthma severity were identified through an exploratory factor analysis and were summarized through a multiple factor analysis. Results Only respiratory symptoms and anti-asthmatic treatment were summarized in a continuous score (STS). STS ranges from 0 (no symptoms/treatment) to 10 (maximum symptom frequency and treatment intensity). STS was positively correlated with the Global Initiative for Asthma classification of asthma severity computed on the 137 cases with a doctor's diagnosis (Spearman’s coefficient = 0.61, p-value<0.0001) (concurrent validity). Furthermore, using a cohort of 1,097 European asthmatics (ECRHS II study; 1999/2002), increasing STS levels at baseline (1991/1993) were positively associated with long-term outcomes (hospitalization and lost workdays for breathing problems, asthma attack frequency and use of asthma controllers) (predictive validity). Finally, the STS scores computed from the GEIRD and ECRHS II data were comparable (Lin’s coefficient = 0.95, p-value<0.0001) (replication analysis). Conclusions STS is a valid and replicable measure of asthma severity in adults, which could be used in association studies."

We model segments of the sign time series as Markov sequences and apply a local hypothesis test to evaluate the symmetries of independence and time reversion in different periods of the market. For the test, we derive the probability of a binary Markov process to generate a given set of number of symbol pairs. Using such analysis, we could not only segment the time series according the different behaviors but also characterize the segments in terms of statistical symmetries. As a particular result, we find that the foreign exchange market is essentially time reversible but this symmetry is broken when there is a strong external influence."
https://openalex.org/W2620434918,"The knowledge about ovarian reserve is essential to determine the reproductive potential and to improve the methods of fertility control for overpopulated species, such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of age on the female reproductive tract of white-tailed deer, focusing on ovarian features. Genital tracts from 8 prepubertal and 10 pubertal females were used to characterize the preantral follicle population and density, morphology, distribution of follicular classes; stromal cell density; and apoptosis in the ovary. In addition, uterus and ovary weights and dimensions were recorded; and the number and the size of antral follicles and corpus luteum in the ovary were quantified. Overall, fawns had a greater (P < 0.05) preantral follicle population, percentage of normal follicles, and preantral follicle density than does. The mean stromal cell density in ovaries of fawns and does differed among animals but not between age groups. The apoptotic signaling did not differ (P > 0.05) between the ovaries of fawns and does. However, apoptotic ovarian cells negatively (P < 0.001) affected the preantral follicle morphology and density, and conversely, a positive correlation was observed with stromal cell density. As expected, the uteri and ovaries were larger (P < 0.002) and heavier (P < 0.001) in does than in fawns. In conclusion, this study has shown, for the first time, the preantral follicle population and distribution of classes, rate of morphologically normal follicles, and density of preantral follicles and stromal cells in white- tailed deer. Therefore, the findings herein described lead to a better understanding of the white-tailed deer ovarian biology, facilitating the development of new methods of fertility control."
https://openalex.org/W2618514476,"Psychological challenges, including traumatic events, have been hypothesized to increase the age-related pace of biological aging. Here we test the hypothesis that psychological challenges can affect the pace of telomere attrition, a marker of cellular aging, using data from an ongoing longitudinal-cohort study of Kaqchikel Mayan women living in a population with a high frequency of child mortality, a traumatic life event. Specifically, we evaluate the associations between child mortality, maternal telomere length and the mothers’ hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), or stress axis, activity. Child mortality data were collected in 2000 and 2013. HPAA activity was assessed by quantifying cortisol levels in first morning urinary specimens collected every other day for seven weeks in 2013. Telomere length (TL) was quantified using qPCR in 55 women from buccal specimens collected in 2013. Results: Shorter TL with increasing age was only observed in women who experienced child mortality (p = 0.015). Women with higher average basal cortisol (p = 0.007) and greater within-individual variation (standard deviation) in basal cortisol (p = 0.053) presented shorter TL. Non-parametric bootstrapping to estimate mediation effects suggests that HPAA activity mediates the effect of child mortality on TL. Our results are, thus, consistent with the hypothesis that traumatic events can influence cellular aging and that HPAA activity may play a mediatory role. Future large-scale longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm our results and further explore the role of the HPAA in cellular aging, as well as to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved."

During the early Shijiahe culture (c, 4850-4400 cal BP), the climate was warm and humid. Fire was intensively used to clear the vegetation. In the mid-period of the Shijiahe culture (c, 4400-4200 cal BP), the climate became slightly dry-cold and this was accompanied by decreasing water, leading to settlements. From c, 4200 cal BP, severe drought eroded the economic foundation of rice-cultivation.

Superoxide radical (O2.-) converts IRP1 from a [4Fe-4S] aconitase to a [3Fe-4S] ""null"" form possessing neither aconitase nor trans-regulatory activity. Genetic ablation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), an antioxidant enzyme that acts to reduce O2.- concentration, revealed a new O2.--dependent regulation of IRP1 leading to the reduction of IRP1 protein level and in consequence to the diminution of IRP1 enzymatic and IRE-binding activities. Here, we attempted to establish whether developmental changes in SOD1 activity occurring in the mouse liver, impact IRP1 expression. We show no correlation between hepatic SOD1 activity and IRP1 protein level neither in pre- nor postnatal period probably because the magnitude of developmental fluctuations in SOD1 activity is relatively small. The comparison of SOD1 activity in regards to IRP1 protein level in the liver of threeSOD1 genotypes (Sod1+/+, Sod1+/- and Sod1-/-) demonstrates that only drastic SOD1 deficiency leads to the reduction of IRP1 protein level. Importantly, we found that in the liver of fetuses lacking SOD1, IRP1 is not down-regulated. To investigate O2.--dependent regulation of IRP1 in a cellular model, we exposed murine RAW 264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages to paraquat, widely used as a redox cycler to stimulate O2.-production in cells. We showed that IRP1 protein level as well as aconitase and IRE-binding activities are strongly reduced in macrophages treated with paraquat. The analysis of the expression of IRP1-target genes revealed the increase in L-ferritin protein level resulting from the enhanced transcriptional regulation of the LFt gene and diminished translational repression of L-ferritin mRNA by IRP1. We propose that O2.--dependent up-regulation of this cellular protectant in paraquat-treated macrophages may counterbalance iron-related toxic effects of O2.-."
https://openalex.org/W2619609920,"The knowledge of genomic DNA variations in patient samples has a high and increasing value for human diagnostics in its broadest sense. Although many methods and sensors to detect or quantify these variations are available or under development, the number of underlying physico-chemical detection principles is limited. One of these principles is the hybridization of sample target DNA versus nucleic acid probes. We introduce a novel thermodynamics approach and develop a framework to exploit the specific detection capabilities of nucleic acid hybridization, using generic principles applicable to any platform. As a case study, we detect point mutations in the KRAS oncogene on a microarray platform. For the given platform and hybridization conditions, we demonstrate the multiplex detection capability of hybridization and assess the detection limit using thermodynamic considerations; DNA containing point mutations in a background of wild type sequences can be identified down to at least 1% relative concentration. In order to show the clinical relevance, the detection capabilities are confirmed on challenging formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tumor samples. This enzyme-free detection framework contains the accuracy and efficiency to screen for hundreds of mutations in a single run with many potential applications in molecular diagnostics and the field of personalised medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2619959718,"Hypocitraturia has been associated with metabolic acidosis and mineral disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of urinary acidification defects underlying hypocitraturia.This retrospective observational study included 67 patients (32 men), aged 40.7±15.1 years with hypocitraturia (<1.67 mmol/24-h) and nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and/or bone demineralization, referred to our center from 2000 to 2015. We aimed to assess renal distal acidification capacity, prevalence and mechanisms of urinary acidification defects. Patients with low baseline plasma HCO3- (<22 mmol/L) were studied by bicarbonate loading or furosemide/fludrocortisone tests. Patients with normal baseline plasma HCO3- had an ammonium-chloride challenge test. A normal response was a decrease in urinary pH <5.3 and an increase in urinary NH4+ ≥33 μmol/min and defined idiopathic hypocitraturia.Eleven patients (16.4%) had low HCO3- and overt distal acidification defect. Three had a mutation in the gene encoding AE1, 4 had Gougerot-Sjögren syndrome and no cause was found in the remaining 4 cases. Fifty-six patients (83.6%) had normal HCO3-; of those, 33 (58.9%) had idiopathic hypocitraturia. Among the 23 (41%) remaining patients, 12 were unable to increase urinary NH4+ excretion (among them, 8 were able to decrease urinary pH and 4 were not) whereas 11 were able to increase urinary NH4+ excretion but unable to decrease urinary pH. These 11 patients had higher fasting urinary calcium, reflecting bone resorption, than the other 12 patients: median 0.41 [0.24-0.47] vs. 0.22 [0.08-0.37] mmol/mmol creatinine (P = 0.04).Patients with hypocitraturia and normal plasma HCO3- frequently show a latent acidification defect that can be further dissected into one of several subtypes based on urinary pH and NH4+ response to the acid load. Those patients with impaired urine acidification capacity but preserved NH4+ excretion exhibit particularly high calciuria and should be identified to optimize nephrolithiasis prevention."

This genus is closely associated with the genus Parabolopona Webb but differs in shape of the head, placement of antennae, male genitalia and molecular analysis using Histone H3 and COI genes confirmed the difference. The taxonomic and phylogenetic position of Chandra is discussed using morphological characters and preliminary molecular evidence of the new genus and related genus Parabolopona."
