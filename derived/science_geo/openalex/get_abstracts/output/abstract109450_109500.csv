https://openalex.org/W1587918801,"NaCl-sensitive yeast mutants were isolated to identify genes essential for NaCl tolerance. Complementation of a mutant highly sensitive to Na+ and Li+ led to the isolation of the CNB1 gene. This gene encodes the regulatory subunit (CNB) of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. Cells deficient in CNB accumulated Li+ due to reduced expression of ENA1, a gene encoding a P-type ATPase involved in Na+ and Li+ efflux. In addition, the K+ transport system of cnb1 delta cells was not converted to the high affinity state that facilitates better discrimination of K+ over Na+. Thus the cnb1 delta strain resembled a trk1 mutant. These results indicate that adaptation to NaCl stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a signal transduction pathway involving Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. In this pathway, calcineurin would coordinate gene expression and activity of ion transporters to facilitate ion homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1520363389,"The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured in single pancreatic mouse islets superfused in a system allowing concomitant recordings of insulin release. When glucose was raised from 3 to 11 mM, [Ca2+]i responded by a transient lowering followed by a rise to an average level of 192 +/- 11 nM. In 77% of the islets the rise was associated with the gradual appearance of oscillations, which were either fast (2-7/min), slow (0.3-0.9/min), or a combination of both types. The characteristics of the fast [Ca2+]i oscillations were those expected from a relationship with the electrical burst activity in islets. Accordingly, in most cases the fast oscillations were remarkably regular. The slow [Ca2+]i oscillations had characteristics similar to the large amplitude ones in individual beta-cells. Whereas glucagon and dibutyryl cAMP could transform slow islet oscillations into fast ones, the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine had the opposite effect. The rapid islet oscillations were also facilitated by elevated concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. Reinforcing the arguments for [Ca2+]i oscillations as responsible for a pulsatile insulin secretion it was possible to demonstrate that the release of the hormone from single islets is synchronized with the slow [Ca2+]i oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1486074435,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potent mitogen for hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells and may play an important role in regeneration following hepatic and renal injury. HGF is first synthesized as a single chain precursor which is then converted to a heterodimeric form by proteolytic processing. This proteolytic conversion is required for HGF to function as a mitogen. In this study, we examined whether the proteolytic activation of HGF occurred in response to hepatic and renal injury. HGF remained as an inactive single chain form in the liver, kidney, lung, and spleen of normal rats. The production of HGF markedly increased in the liver after hepatotoxin treatment and in the kidney after nephrotoxin treatment. A significant portion of the increased HGF was converted to the active heterodimeric form, whereas in other tissues, conversion did not occur although the production of HGF increased in some of them. Furthermore, an enzymatic activity that converts the single chain form of HGF to the active heterodimeric form was detected in the injured liver but not in the normal liver. These results indicate that HGF is proteolytically activated in response to tissue injury, and this activation is mediated by an enzymatic activity which is induced exclusively in the injured tissues. Thus, the proteolytic activation system functions in vivo as a mechanism for localizing HGF activities to injured tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1530340727,"Aggregation of Fc gamma RII (CD 32), a low affinity receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG), on the monocytic cell line THP-1 induces protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. Several distinct cellular proteins, including Fc gamma RII itself, are phosphorylated on tyrosine following cross-linking of the receptor. Fc gamma RII lacks intrinsic PTK activity. In this report we demonstrate that a kinase activity was coprecipitated with Fc gamma RII in THP-1 cells. The kinetics of the receptor-associated kinase activity paralleled the appearance of tyrosine phosphorylation events observed following Fc gamma RII activation of THP-1 cells. Several proteins were associated with the receptor. Reimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that lyn gene products were among the proteins coprecipitated with Fc gamma RII. p59hck (Hck) and p56lyn (Lyn) were the most abundant Src-related PTKs (Src-PTKs) in THP-1 cells. Enzymatic activity of both kinases, as measured by an in vitro kinase assay, was increased following specific cross-linking of Fc gamma RII. Furthermore, Fc gamma RII was specifically associated with both enzymes following its engagement and served as a substrate for both of these kinases. The association of Fc gamma RII with Src-PTK was specific for Fc gamma RII activation of THP-1 cells, since activation of cells via the high affinity Fc gamma receptor, Fc gamma RI (CD 64), did not result in association of Fc gamma RII with Hck or Lyn. Our data demonstrate a functional and physical association of Fc gamma RII with Hck and Lyn consistent with the involvement of Src-PTK in Fc gamma RII-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1513288125,"The interactions of ceramides with phosphatidate and lysophosphatidate in the regulation of signal transduction in rat fibroblasts were examined. C2- and C6-ceramides (N-acetylsphingosine and N-hexanoylsphingosine, respectively) at 10 microM inhibited the stimulation of DNA synthesis that was produced by 50-100 microM phosphatidate, or lysophosphatidate, or by exogenous phospholipase D. Sphingosine (10 microM) had the opposite effect to the ceramides on DNA synthesis. C2- or C6-ceramides failed to inhibit the stimulation of DNA synthesis by insulin or serum. The ceramides did not modify the actions of phosphatidate, or lysophosphatidate, in decreasing the forskolin-induced increase in cAMP. C2- and C6-ceramides inhibited the stimulation of phospholipase D activity by: (a) phosphatidate, lysophosphatidate, phorbol ester, thrombin, or serum in intact fibroblasts and (b) phorbol ester or guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate in permeabilized fibroblasts. The ceramides can therefore modify cell signaling via phospholipase D, but this effect alone could not explain the decreased DNA synthesis. Incubation of fibroblasts with C2- or C6-ceramides or sphingomyelinase inhibited the interaction of exogenous phosphatidate or lysophosphatidate with the fibroblasts by 42 and 53%, respectively. Furthermore, a greater proportion of the phosphatidate, or lysophosphatidate, that was associated with the fibroblasts was metabolized further when the cells were pretreated with ceramides or sphingomyelinase. This effect was accompanied by an increased activity of N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. Ceramides may therefore produce part of their growth inhibitory effects by blocking some of the signal transducing effects of phosphatidate and lysophosphatidate."
https://openalex.org/W1536708473,"The L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene is slightly active in normal and tumoral endocrine pancreatic tissues while, in vivo, this gene is not transcribed in the exocrine pancreas. Nevertheless, the L-PK gene is re-expressed at a very low level in cultured 266.6 cells derived from an exocrine pancreas carcinoma. The L-PK gene is early activated in endodermal tissues, e.g. yolk sac and primitive intestine; it remains transcribed in fetal pancreas. In adult, L-PK gene expression is restricted to some endocrine cells. Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1 and HNF4 are the main tissue-restricted transcription factors involved in tissue-specific expression of the L-PK gene. HNF1 concentration is similar in liver and all pancreatic cells. HNF4 concentration is high in liver, much lower in islets of Langerhans, endocrine pancreatic tumors, and cultured insulinoma cells, and is scarcely detectable in adult exocrine pancreas. This distribution of HNF4 parallels the expression of the L-PK gene. In vivo footprinting experiments show that the HNF1 binding site is similarly occupied in both adult liver and adult pancreas, in which this gene is practically inactive. In this latter tissue, however, the HNF4 binding site is differently occupied with respect to the liver. Since the chromatin structure remains open around the L-PK promoter in pancreas, the L-PK gene can probably be re-expressed under certain circumstances, for instance in cancerous pancreatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551497686,"To define the transmembrane topology of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), we determined the subcellular location of the hydrophilic segment (residues 2463-2529 of mouse type 1 InsP3R) believed to be located at the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the six-transmembrane model but at the cytoplasmic side in the eight-transmembrane model. This hydrophilic segment includes two consensus sites for N-glycosylation (Asn-2475 and Asn-2503). We prepared an anti-peptide antibody against residues 2504-2523. Electron microscope immunocytochemical studies of mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells showed that binding of this antibody frequently occurs in the intracisternal space of the ER. We constructed three mutant receptors by site-directed mutagenesis of Asn to Gln (N2475Q, N2503Q, and N2475Q/N2503Q). By concanavalin A column chromatography of these receptors, we found that both Asn-2475 and Asn-2503 are glycosylated. These results indicate that residues 2504-2523, Asn-2475, and Asn-2503 are exposed to the ER lumen. We therefore propose that InsP3R has six membrane-spanning segments. Based on the transmembrane topology and subunit organization, we suggest that InsP3R is a member of the superfamily that includes the voltage- and second messenger-gated ion channels on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1599169471,"Studies with site-directed labeling reagents have identified residues near the ligand binding pocket of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Among these residues are three conserved tyrosines, Tyr-93, Tyr-190, and Tyr-198 of the alpha subunit. Previous studies combined mutagenesis, expression in Xenopus oocytes, and dose-response analysis to examine contributions of these tyrosines to agonist affinity. In this study, we prepared a series of mutants at each position, expressed them in 293 HEK cells, and studied binding of agonists and antagonists to mutant receptors on intact cells. We show that all three tyrosines contribute to binding of agonists, and that each tyrosine contributes roughly equally to the binding energy. Although the contributions are roughly equivalent, the nature of the contribution is not equivalent at each position. For Tyr-93 and Tyr-190 the aromatic hydroxyl is essential, whereas for Tyr-198 aromaticity of the side chain is essential. Nearly identical results were obtained for the elementary quaternary ligand tetramethylammonium, indicating that these tyrosines contribute to stabilization of the quaternary ammonium portion of agonist. Tyr-190 and Tyr-198 also contribute to binding of the competitive antagonist dimethyl-d-tubocurarine; the side chain specificity for binding supports tyrosine interactions with one of two quaternary ammonium groups in dimethyl-d-tubocurarine. Y190F, in addition to altering binding affinity, also affects the equilibrium between activatable and desensitized receptor states."
https://openalex.org/W1594147709,"The three-dimensional structure of a ligand-free closed form of the glucose/galactose binding protein from Salmonella typhimurium has been determined at a resolution of 1.9 A. The crystallographic R-factor for the refined structure is 17.9%. The model contains all the atoms of the 309 residues of the protein sequence, a calcium ion, and 174 water molecules. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations for the whole molecule are: 0.010 A for bond lengths and 2.44 degrees for bond angles, indicating a good stereochemistry for the model. This structure shows that the protein is able to close in the absence of ligand, adopting a conformation similar to the liganded form but slightly more open. Water molecules satisfy the hydrogen bonding ability of the hydrophilic side chains of the binding site in a manner which is reminiscent of the sugars' hydrogen-bonding patterns. Since packing forces are weak, the crystallization event is unlikely to trigger a change from an open to a closed conformation. Instead, the latter must be one of the species in equilibrium in solution which is selected by packing in the crystal lattice."
https://openalex.org/W1544923804,"A digitonin-permeabilized HepG2 cell system has been developed and used to characterize the pathway responsible for apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) degradation. Degradation of 35S-labeled apoB occurred after an initial lag period and resulted in the loss of approximately 75.8% of apoB after 2 h of chase. The degradation rate in permeabilized cells was slower than that in intact cells, but approximately the same percentage of apoB was lost over 2 h of chase. The loss of intact apoB in permeabilized cells coincided with the appearance of a number of degradation fragments, including 335- and 70-kDa fragments. The detection of a 70-kDa fragment was a sensitive indicator of degradation. ApoB degradation was inhibited at temperatures below 37 degrees C and maximally activated at 42 degrees C. Degradation was also pH-dependent, with inhibition at pH > or = 7.5. ApoB decay was stimulated by ATP supplementation but not GTP and was inhibited in the presence of energy inhibitors. Degradation was not significantly affected by cycloheximide. However, the stability of the 70-kDa fragment was prolonged with cycloheximide. Preincubation of cells with brefeldin A and nocodazole, as well as monensin, did not diminish the degradation of intact apoB or the appearance of the 70-kDa fragment, suggesting a lack of requirement for intracellular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum. Among the various protease inhibitors tested, degradation was most sensitive to N-acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal (ALLN), which abolished the generation of the 70-kDa fragment in a dose-dependent manner. ALLN-sensitive degradation of apoB was unaffected by the calcium ionophore, A23187. Interestingly, degradation of unglycosylated apoB, detected in tunicamycin-pretreated cells, occurred earlier, resulted in generation of additional fragments, and was largely uninhibited by ALLN. In summary, apoB degradation occurs in permeabilized HepG2 cells by a temperature- and pH-sensitive, pre-Golgi degradation system and is catalyzed by a calcium-independent, ALLN-sensitive protease. Specificity of the initial apoB cleavage may require the proper N-linked glycosylation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1512691892,"The gamma subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins (G gamma) are subject to carboxyl-terminal processing. This processing involves prenylation of a cysteine residue initially 4 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, endoproteolytic truncation of the 3 terminal amino acids, and methylation of the now carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine residue. The significance of each of these modifications in the ultimate properties of G proteins is not yet clear. We have developed in vitro systems for the production of the three processing intermediates (unmodified, prenylated, and truncated-prenylated) for two G gamma subunits, one which is subject to farnesylation (G gamma 1) and one which is geranylgeranylated (G gamma 2). Assessment of the functional consequences of the processing of G gamma was found to require reconstitution of the polypeptides with a G protein beta subunit (G beta). The ability of recombinant G beta, produced in Sf9 cells, to assemble into stable beta gamma complexes (G beta gamma) with each of the G gamma processing intermediates was assessed. Both prenylated and unprenylated G gamma subunits formed stable complexes with G beta, but surprisingly, neither of the truncated-prenylated G gamma subunits were competent for this assembly. The G beta gamma complexes which were formed were examined for their ability to interact with a G protein alpha subunit (G alpha). Only those G beta gamma complexes containing a prenylated G gamma subunit were functional in this assay. These data indicate that: 1) prenylation of G gamma is not required for G beta gamma assembly; 2) assembly of the G beta gamma complex occurs prior to the proteolytic processing of G gamma; and 3) G beta gamma complexes require prenylated G gamma for interaction with G alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1588845829,"Abstract High plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and its unique apolipoprotein, apo(a), are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plasma Lp(a) levels vary over a 1000-fold range and are determined by the apo(a) locus, which has at least 34 alleles expressing apo(a) isoforms with molecular weights from 800,000. In addition, apo(a) alleles produce no detectable plasma apo(a). We used primary cultures of baboon hepatocytes to investigate the molecular basis for null apo(a) phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation of apo(a) after radiolabeling of hepatocytes revealed that some null alleles gave rise to intracellular protein products that were not secreted. Pulse-chase analysis and endoglycosidase digests demonstrated that these proteins were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We also examined the molecular basis for the documented inverse correlation between apo(a) size and plasma Lp(a) concentration. Steady-state labeling and pulse-chase analysis of hepatocytes from animals expressing two isoforms of apo(a) revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum residence time of secreted apo(a) isoforms was determined by their size. This accounted for the inverse relationship between isoform size and level of secretion. We conclude that the efficiency of post-translational processing of apo(a) is a major determinant of plasma Lp(a) concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1518461235,"ATP is not hydrolyzed during the transport cycle of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), yet depletion of the nucleotide drastically reduces the rate of cation exchange. The mechanism underlying this inhibition was investigated in fibroblasts transfected with NHE-1, the growth factor-sensitive isoform of the antiport. NHE-1 was found to be phosphorylated in serum-starved, unstimulated cells. Acute ATP depletion induced a profound inhibition of transport without detectable changes in NHE-1 phosphorylation. Analysis of cells transfected with truncated mutants of NHE-1 indicated that the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain of the antiport is required for expression of its ATP dependence. To define whether inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange resulted from internalization of NHE-1, extracellularly exposed proteins were labeled with impermeant biotin derivatives. The proportion of NHE-1 exposed to the surface was comparable before and after ATP depletion. Immunofluorescence determinations revealed focal accumulations of NHE-1 on the membrane of untreated cells. NHE-1 redistributed following ATP depletion, showing a more homogeneous localization. F-actin, which co-localizes with the antiport in untreated cells, also redistributed when cells were ATP depleted. These findings suggest an interaction of NHE-1 with the cytoskeleton. Accordingly, disassembly of actin filaments with cytochalasin D induced redistribution of the antiport. However, Na+/H+ exchange activity was unaltered by cytochalasin D. We propose that ancillary proteins confer ATP sensitivity to the antiporter and may also mediate its association with the cytoskeleton. Depletion of the nucleotide would alter the interaction between NHE-1 and the putative regulator, inhibiting Na+/H+ exchange and inducing subcellular redistribution. However, disruption of the cytoskeleton at distal sites, such as induced by cytochalasins, is insufficient to inactivate the antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1643683726,"Several subspecies of human high density lipoprotein (HDL) exist, and particle surface charge is one parameter that can be used to distinguish them. For instance, pre-beta HDL has a lower negative surface charge than the bulk of plasma HDL resulting in slower migration when subjected to electrophoresis in an agarose gel at pH 8.6. The molecular basis for the variations in HDL particle surface charge have been established in this work. Quantitative analysis of electrophoretic mobilities in agarose gels indicates that the surface potentials of reconstituted pre-beta HDL and alpha-HDL3 are -7.6 and -11.4 mV, respectively. The difference of 3.8 mV corresponds to an apparent 1e more net negative charge on alpha-migrating HDL3. The contributions of the lipid and protein components to the charge of HDL3 were defined using reconstituted particles (rHDL) containing various combinations of HDL3 protein and lipid. The surface potentials of spherical and discoidal rHDL are not affected by the particle apoprotein composition. Thin layer chromatography of the HDL3 phospholipid fraction from five normolipidemic subjects revealed that it consists of approximately 84% phosphatidylcholine, 12% sphingomyelin, and 4% phosphatidylinositol (PI) by weight. PI significantly affects the charge of discoidal rHDL and is responsible for approximately 0.7 mV of the surface potential difference between pre-beta- and alpha-HDL. Reconstitution of spherical complexes containing apolipoprotein AI, palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, and HDL3 neutral lipid esters showed that particles containing a neutral lipid core migrate to an alpha position in an agarose gel. The change in particle shape accounts for approximately 3 mV of the difference in surface potential between pre-beta and alpha-HDL. Overall, the charge of HDL particles is determined by 1) a direct contribution of negative charge from PI molecules in the surface of the lipoprotein and 2) the conformation of the resident apolipoprotein(s) which is influenced by the presence of neutral lipids and the particle shape. This quantitative understanding of surface charge provides a basis for understanding variations in function of HDL subspecies."
https://openalex.org/W1513614477,"Using a cell line stably transfected with the rat follitropin (FSH) receptor cDNA we demonstrate that the FSH receptor becomes phosphorylated when cells are exposed to FSH. Since binding of FSH to its receptor results in an increase in cAMP and inositol phosphate accumulation, we examined the potential involvement of protein kinase A and C in mediating receptor phosphorylation. Stimulation of protein kinase A does not appear to be necessary because hFSH-induced receptor phosphorylation was minimally impaired in a cell line that overexpresses cAMP phosphodiesterase. Moreover, stimulation of the protein kinase A pathway with other agonists result in minimal phosphorylation of the FSH receptor. Stimulation of the protein kinase C with a phorbol ester did result in an increase in receptor phosphorylation, and down-regulation of the protein kinase C decreased, but did not abolish, the FSH-induced receptor phosphorylation. The possible impact of phosphorylation on the functions of the receptor was examined by testing if conditions that lead to phosphorylation decrease the ability of FSH to stimulate cAMP synthesis. Our data show that as with the addition of FSH, addition of a phorbol ester also results in a decrease in the ability of FSH to stimulate cAMP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1489457306,"Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase is a monomeric 110-kDa protein that hydrolyzes two substrates in the inositol phosphate pathway. Inositol 3,4-bisphosphate is converted to inositol 3-phosphate, and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate is converted to inositol 1,3-bisphosphate. We have exploited the fact that inositol hexasulfate inhibits the enzyme to devise an affinity elution scheme from a Mono S cation exchange column that resulted in an 11,300-fold purified preparation of rat brain 4-phosphatase. The resulting 4-phosphatase hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate with a first order rate constant 120-fold greater than that for inositol 3,4-bisphosphate and 900-fold greater than that for inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. This is now the third example wherein the same enzyme hydrolyzes both an inositol lipid and its analogous inositol phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1565831796,"PTP2C, a widely distributed protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) containing two SH2 domains, was expressed as a recombinant enzyme in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. The purified enzyme and a truncated form lacking the SH2 domains (delta SH2-PTP2C) have been characterized with four commonly used substrates. Both forms showed pH optima of around neutrality for protein substrates but below 5.5 for a peptide substrate and para-nitrophenylphosphate. The dependence of the enzymes on ionic strength varied with the nature of the substrates involved. Like its analog PTP1C, PTP2C displayed a specific activity of less than 0.1% of that observed with other known PTPs toward protein substrates. Deletion of the SH2 domains increased its activity by 12-45-fold, depending on the substrates used. Limited trypsinolysis which cleaved about 4 kDa from the carboxyl terminus resulted in a 2-5-fold activation of the full-length enzyme but was essentially without effect on the truncated enzyme. Both forms showed similar responses to effectors including activators (e.g. anionic phospholipids) or inhibitors (e.g. vanadate, molybdate, or Zn2+). PTP2C and delta SH2-PTP2C were phosphorylated in vitro by mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C, and various protein tyrosine kinases; in the latter case, they underwent autodephosphorylation. No significant effect of the phosphorylation reactions on enzyme activity could be observed in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1605151524,"The Wilms' tumor gene, WT1, is expressed in few tissues, mainly the developing kidney, genitourinary system, and mesothelium, and in immature hematopoietic cells. To develop an understanding of the role of WT1 in development and tumorigenesis, we have identified transcriptional regulatory elements that function in transient reporter gene constructs transfected into kidney and hematopoietic cell lines. We found three transcription start sites of the WT1 gene and have identified an essential promoter region by deletion analysis. The WT1 promoter is a member of the GC-rich, TATA-less, and CCAAT-less class of polymerase II promoters. Whereas the WT1 promoter is similar to other tumor suppressor gene promoters, the WT1 expression pattern (unlike Rb and p53) is tissue-restricted. The WT1 GC-rich promoter is promiscuous, functioning in all cell lines tested, independent of WT1 expression. This finding suggests that the promoter is not tissue-specific, but that tissue-specific expression of WT1 is modulated by additional regulatory elements. Indeed, we have identified a transcriptional enhancer located 3' of the WT1 gene > 50 kilobases downstream from the promoter. This orientation-independent enhancer increases the basal transcription rate of the WT1 promoter in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562, but not in any of the other cell lines tested."
https://openalex.org/W1528357521,"Visual arrestin plays an important role in quenching phototransduction via its ability to preferentially bind to phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin (P-Rh*). Recently we proposed a mechanism for the binding of visual arrestin to P-Rh* that helps to explain the nature of the conformational changes in arrestin observed upon binding. This mechanism involves a multisite interaction between arrestin and P-Rh* and implies an interaction between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of arrestin. To obtain further insight into the mechanism of arrestin-rhodopsin interaction we have characterized the ability of polyanions to inhibit the interaction of wild type and mutant arrestins to different functional forms of rhodopsin. These studies reveal that: 1) heparin is most potent at inhibiting arrestin binding to dark phosphorylated rhodopsin > light-activated rhodopsin > P-Rh*; 2) C-terminal deletions in arrestin increase arrestin sensitivity to heparin inhibition while an N-terminal deletion (residues 2-16) decreases heparin inhibition; 3) the sensitivity of chimeric arrestins to heparin inhibition is determined by the origin of the N terminus of the chimera; and 4) heparin also inhibits arrestin binding to truncated 329G-Rh*, suggesting it does not mimic the phosphorylated C terminus of rhodopsin. Taken together, these data suggest that heparin mimics the regulatory acidic C terminus of arrestin. Since the basic N-terminal region of arrestin appears to serve as a site of heparin binding it is a likely candidate to be involved in the intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal region. The interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains of arrestin may control the conformational rearrangements in arrestin that occur upon binding to P-Rh*."
https://openalex.org/W1493760709,"Integrin alpha IIb-beta 3 binds fibrinogen via the recognition sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS). We have used the baculovirus/insect cell expression system to study the structural requirements for the formation of a functionally active fragment of alpha IIb-beta 3. A tandem baculovirus transfer vector was constructed containing the cDNA coding for the heavy chain of human alpha IIb (alpha IIbH, amino acids 1-874) and the cDNA coding for a truncated form of human beta 3 (t beta 3; amino acids 1-469). Sf9 insect cells were infected with the corresponding baculovirus, and the produced soluble recombinant proteins were purified using an RGD-like affinity column. The bound receptor fragments were specifically eluted with RGDS and existed as a heterodimeric complex (rec alpha IIbH-t beta 3) with an apparent M(r) of 160,000. In an immunocapture assay, the monoclonal antibody pl-55, which only recognizes the functionally active form of alpha IIb-beta 3, bound to the purified complex. Rec alpha IIbH-t beta 3 specifically bound 125I-fibrinogen with an affinity comparable with that of purified platelet alpha IIb-beta 3. Electron micrographs of rotary-shadowed rec alpha IIbH-t beta 3 showed that the complex had the characteristic globular head, but the two rodlike tails were 4-6 nm shorter than those found in intact alpha IIb-beta 3. Thus, the cysteine-rich repeats of beta 3 are not required for assembly, stability, and functional activity of this integrin."
https://openalex.org/W1563301223,"The roles of the 8 conserved cysteines and 1 arginine in the low molecular weight phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis of the recombinant bovine heart enzyme. Single mutants of cysteine to serine were studied for each cysteine; alanine replacements were also made for Cys-12, Cys-17, and Arg-18. The CD spectra of the purified proteins were effectively superimposable, consistent with the conclusion that no major structural alterations had occurred, but 1H NMR spectroscopy did reveal some spectral shifts in the aromatic region. Kinetic analysis of the mutant proteins demonstrated that only Cys-12, Cys-17, and Arg-18 had significantly altered catalytic activity toward the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate at pH 5. The Cys-12 and Arg-18 mutants were effectively inactive. Thus, it is concluded that Cys-12 is the catalytic nucleophile, and Arg-18 presumably serves an essential function in substrate binding. The C17S mutant had 6% residual activity compared with wild type protein, whereas the C17A mutant had 37% activity. Consistent with the observed activity of the Cys-17 mutant, a covalent phosphocysteine intermediate was trapped and identified by 31P NMR. Further kinetic analysis of C17A using several aryl phosphate monoester substrates with different leaving group pK alpha values indicated that no change in the rate-determining step of the catalytic mechanism had occurred, that is, dephosphorylation of the covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate remains rate-limiting. The C17A mutant had a 4-fold higher phosphate Ki and slightly higher Km values for p-nitrophenyl phosphate suggesting that Cys-17 may be important for optimal positioning of the substrate phosphate moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1516015249,"The coat proteins of RNA phages MS2 and GA are specific RNA-binding proteins which function to encapsidate viral RNA and to translationally repress synthesis of the viral replicase. The two proteins have highly homologous amino acid sequences, yet they show different RNA binding specificities, recognizing RNA stem-loop structures which differ primarily in the nucleotide sequences of their loops. We sought to convert MS2 coat protein to the RNA binding specificity of GA through the introduction of GA-like amino acid substitutions into the MS2 coat protein RNA-binding site. The effects of the mutations were determined by measuring the affinity of the coat protein variants for RNA in vitro and by measuring translational repression in vivo. We found five substitutions that affect RNA binding. One dramatically reduces binding of MS2 coat protein to both operators. Three others compensate for this defect by nonspecifically strengthening the interaction. Another substitution accounts for the ability to recognize the differences in the RNA loop sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1584547878,"Earlier covalent modification experiments indicated that histidine, arginine, and carboxylic acid residues were involved in the catalytic mechanism of the acid phosphatase enzyme from human prostate. The present study utilizes site-directed mutagenesis to evaluate the catalytic importance of 7 residues of human prostatic phosphatase, namely His12, His257, Asp258, Arg11, Arg15, Arg54, and Arg79, which are highly conserved in the sequences of high molecular weight acid phosphatases. Both wild type and mutant enzymes were expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as fusions to a leader peptide of prepro-alpha-factor, which resulted in the secretion of processed proteins into the culture media. The kinetic parameters of the recombinant wild type enzyme were shown to be effectively identical with those of the native protein. The circular dichroism spectra of wild type and mutant proteins were effectively superimposable. Replacement of His12, which was previously shown to be transiently phosphorylated during catalysis, as well as the adjacent Arg11, both resulted in > 10(4) reductions of enzyme activity. Consistent with a postulated involvement of arginine residues in substrate binding, large reductions in Vmax caused by the R15A and R79A mutations were accompanied by marked increases in Km. However, the mutation R54A had only small effects on kinetic parameters. Essential roles for both His257 and Asp258 were also established. The D258A mutation not only caused larger decreases of Vmax toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate compared to the effect of the H257A mutation, but it also caused the reaction to become more sensitive to the nature of the leaving group. It is concluded that His12 and Asp258 are involved in the formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate as an acceptor of the phospho group and a proton donor for the substrate leaving group, respectively, while His257 may participate in substrate binding or may facilitate the breakdown of the phosphoenzyme by maintaining the protonated state of the phosphorylated His12 residue."
https://openalex.org/W1564947621,"EnvZ is a membrane-bound histidine kinase that functions as an osmotic sensor capable of phosphorylating the regulator protein OmpR in Escherichia coli. To characterize the site of phosphorylation biochemically, we overexpressed a 36-kDa truncated EnvZ protein (Glu-106 to Gly-450) that formed inclusion bodies in the cell. After solubilization, the inclusion body form of EnvZ was cleaved into two major fragments with molecular weights of 25,000 and 10,000. The 25-kDa fragment, EnvZc, was purified and found to exist as a dimer. N-terminal sequence analysis established that cleavage had occurred at Arg-214, indicating that EnvZc contained most of the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ. After labeling EnvZc with [gamma-32P]ATP, the protein was proteolytically digested, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography using high performance liquid chromatography. One major radioactive peptide containing greater than 90% of the recovered peptide-associated radioactivity was isolated. Amino acid analysis of this purified peptide indicated that the composition was consistent with a peptide that contained His-243. The amino acid sequence of this peptide was determined to be MAGVSHDLRTP (residues 238-248). These results indicate that His-243 is the major site of phosphorylation on EnvZ and represents the first biochemical characterization of the site of phosphorylation of a membrane histidine kinase of the two-component regulatory family of molecules in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1480088585,"Calcium (Ca2+) binding to the N-terminal Ca(2+)-specific sites on troponin C (TnC) regulate the contraction-relaxation cycle of skeletal muscle. A mutant TnC (F29W) and dansylaziridine-labeled TnC undergo large fluorescence increases when Ca2+ binds to their Ca(2+)-specific sites (half-maximal at pCa 5.8). Calmidazolium and the additional mutation of Met-82 to Gln (F29W,M82Q) increased Ca2+ affinity at these Ca2+ sites by approximately 4-fold (half-maximal at pCa approximately 6.4). Calmidazolium and the M82Q mutation decreased the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the Ca(2+)-specific sites approximately 3.4-fold (from approximately 462 +/- 84/s to approximately 138 +/- 30/s) at 22 degrees C. Ca2+ associated with the Ca(2+)-specific sites of these proteins at 1-2 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 at 4 degrees C. These drug- and mutation-induced increases in Ca2+ affinity occur solely from large decreases in the Ca2+ off-rate without an effect on the Ca2+ on-rate. Thus, Ca2+ can bind to the Ca(2+)-specific sites of TnC as rapidly as it can diffuse to the protein, consistent with the extreme speed of skeletal muscle contraction. Drugs and/or site-directed mutagenesis can modify the Ca2+ sensitivity and the rate of Ca2+ exchange with TnC's Ca(2+)-specific sites to perhaps alter the rate of relaxation and/or the rate of rise of tension."
https://openalex.org/W1566693207,"We have proposed that cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) hydroxylation is carried out by a multienzyme system involving CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase (the terminal enzyme of the system), cytochrome b5, and an NADH-dependent cytochrome b5-reducing factor (Kozutsumi, Y., Kawano, T., Yamakawa, T., and Suzuki, A. (1990) J. Biochem. 108, 704-706). The CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase was purified to homogeneity from the cytosolic fraction of mouse liver, using ion exchange columns, a Red-Sepharose column, and a soluble cytochrome b5-immobilized Sepharose column. The purified enzyme exhibited a single band (64 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a single peak (58 kDa) on gel permeation chromatography, indicating that it is composed of a single polypeptide chain. The absorption spectrum did not indicate the presence of a heme prosthetic group in the enzyme. Atomic absorption spectrometry and an inhibition test using an iron chelator indicate that the enzyme contains non-heme iron as an electron acceptor. A reconstitution experiment with the purified CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase, soluble cytochrome b5, and recombinant NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase revealed that these three factors are essential for the reaction. The hydroxylase exhibited high affinity to CMP-NeuAc (Km = 5 microM) and was greatly stabilized by CMP-NeuAc. The molecular activity of the enzyme (approximately 500/min) is much lower than that reported for NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, suggesting that the activity or amount of hydroxylase is rate-limiting in CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) biosynthesis. These results, together with the previous observation that the level of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity was associated with the expression of NeuGc in various tissues, support the notion that the enzyme is the key for regulation of the overall velocity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylation and consequently for the expression of NeuGc-containing glycoconjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2104814824,"Conditioned medium factor (CMF) is an 80-kDa glycoprotein which is the signal in a cell density-sensing system used by developing Dictyostelium cells. CMF is slowly secreted by cells when they starve, and the extracellular level of CMF then becomes an indicator of the density of starving cells. To examine how CMF is sensed, we have made bacterially synthesized recombinant CMF and found that it has as much activity as native CMF, indicating that glycosylation is not part of the active site of CMF. Expression of recombinant fragments of CMF indicates that the active site lies within an 88-amino acid region near the N terminus. To determine whether CMF is sensed by cell surface receptors, we examined binding of iodinated recombinant CMF to live cells. We found saturable binding to 6-h starved cells at 3.9 x 10(4) molecules/cell with a KD of 2.1 nM. The binding saturates in 30 min, and a Scatchard plot indicates that there is only one class of receptor. The binding is competed off by the addition of either the native or recombinant CMF, or the 88-amino acid active fragment region; no binding competition is seen from the nonactive regions or other proteins. Very little binding to vegetative cells is seen, with maximal binding seen in cells starved for 6-8 h. The amount of cell surface CMF binding then decreases during later development. Normal levels of CMF binding are seen to CMF- cells, indicating that CMF is not required for the accumulation of its own receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1538489656,"Dichloromethane dehalogenase from Methylophilus sp. DM11 is a glutathione S-transferase homolog that is specifically active with dihalomethane substrates. This bacterial enzyme and rat liver glutathione S-transferases were purified to investigate their relative reactivity with CH2Cl2 and related substrates. Rat liver alpha class glutathione transferases were inactive and mu class enzymes showed low activity (7-23 nmol/min/mg of protein) with CH2Cl2. theta class glutathione transferase 5-5 from rat liver and Methylophilus sp. dichloromethane dehalogenase showed specific activities of > or = 1 mumol/min/mg of protein. Apparent Kcat/Km were determined to be 3.3 x 10(4) and 6.0 x 10(4) L M-1 S-1 for the two enzymes, respectively. Dideutero-dichloromethane was processed to dideutereo-formaldehyde, consistent with a nucleophilic halide displacement mechanism. The possibility of a GSCH2X reaction intermediate (GS, glutathione; X, halide) was probed using CH2ClF to generate a more stable halomethylglutathione species (GSCH2F). The reaction of CH2ClF with dichloromethane dehalogenase produced a kinetically identifiable intermediate that decomposed to formaldehyde at a similar rate to synthetic HOCH2CH2SCH2F. 19F-NMR revealed the transient formation of an intermediate identified as GSCH2F by its chemical shift, its triplet resonance, and H-F coupling constant consistent with a fluoromethylthioether. Its decomposition was matched by a stoichiometric formation of fluoride. These studies indicated that the bacterial dichloromethane dehalogenase directs a nucleophilic attack of glutathione on CH2Cl2 to produce a halomethylthioether intermediate. This focuses attention on the mechanism used by theta class glutathione transferases to generate a halomethylthioeter from relatively unreactive dihalomethanes."
https://openalex.org/W1580192221,"Functional domains of the bacteriophage phi 29 prohead RNA (pRNA) that are essential for in vitro packaging of DNA-gp3 into the prohead were mapped using pRNA mutants. Oligonucleotide-directed mutant pRNAs were produced that contained deletions and sequence alterations but were predicted to retain the overall secondary structure of wild-type pRNA. Mutant pRNAs were compared to wild-type pRNA for prohead binding in a competition assay and for DNA packaging in the defined in vitro system. The prohead binding site was previously localized to residues 22-84 on the 120-residue domain I of pRNA by ribonuclease footprinting (Reid, R. J. D., Bodley, J. W., and Anderson, D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 5157-5162). Mutations of pRNA within the prohead binding site resulted in substantial loss of prohead binding capacity, while mutations outside of the footprint had moderate effects on prohead binding. DNA-gp3 packaging activity was correlated with pRNA binding activity for mutations within the footprint. This mutational analysis showed that both sequence and secondary structure of residues 40-91 of pRNA were crucial for prohead binding and that elements of the A helix formed from residues 1-28 and 117-92 were needed for DNA packaging functions other than prohead binding."

Biol. 132, 544-553), we found the presence of a heavily glycosylated polyprotein, isolated from the unfertilized eggs of Oryzias latipes. We now report our detailed analysis of the structure of the N-glycan chain in L-hyosophorin, the smallest repeating unit of H-hyosophorin, which was isolated from the fertilized eggs of O. latipes and formed from H-hyosophorin upon fertilization. The N-glycan structures were defined by a combination of compositional analysis, methylation analysis, selective chemical degradation (i.e. mild methanolysis, periodate-Smith degradation, and hydrazinolysis-nitrous acid deamination), enzymatic (endo-beta-galactosidase, peptide:N-glycanase, and Newcastle disease virus sialidase) digestion, and instrumental analyses (one- and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry) which revealed novel and unique features: (a) the presence of highly branched poly-N-acetylactosamino pentaantennary structures; (b) the presence of a beta-galactosylated Lewis X antigenic epitope, Gal beta 1-->4 Gal beta 1-->4 (Fuc alpha 1-->3) GlcNAc beta 1-->; (c) the presence of a beta-galactosylated sialyl Lewis X structure, Gal beta 1-->4 (Neu5Ac alpha 2-->3) Gal beta 1-->4(Fuc alpha 1-->3) GlcNAc beta 1-->; (d) the presence of Gal beta 1-->4 Gal beta 1--> and Gal beta 1--> 4Gal beta 1-->4Gal beta 1--> as the major and minor groupings, respectively; and (e) the presence of the branched Gal residues, -->4GlcNAc beta 1-->3(Gal beta 1-->4) Gal beta 1-->. This study represents the first detailed investigation regarding the nature of highly branched complex asparagine-linked pentaantennary glycans in glycoproteins. The unique expression of such bulky multiantennary glycan units on proteins could be essential during early embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1531626387,"Analysis of inhibitor studies indicates that carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I has two separate sites for inhibitor binding. One site is located on the cytoplasmic side of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Malonyl-CoA, the most important physiological inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, binds primarily to this site, but it can also bind to another site. A second inhibitory site is located at the active site of carnitine palmitolytransferase-I. Coenzyme A, a product/inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I binds primarily at this site and can inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I at physiological concentrations, but can also attenuate malonyl-CoA inhibition. Analogs of malonyl-CoA and other simpler compounds containing two carbonyl groups but no coenzyme A moiety inhibit only at the cytoplasmic site, indicating that this site has an absolute requirement for two carbonyl groups but has no absolute requirement for a coenzyme A moiety. Inhibitors acting through the active site included the active-site-directed inhibitor (+)-hemipalmitoylcarnitinium. These studies support the existence of two regulatory binding sites for the control of hepatic fatty acid oxidation: (a) the active site, for regulation by the inhibitory binding of coenzyme A and acetyl-CoA, and (b) a separate regulatory malonyl-CoA-binding site that is physical separated from the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1541645799,"Cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin, inhibitors of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump were shown to elevate [Ca2+]i in Friend erythroleukemia cells, line F4-6, at concentrations of 1-5 microM and 0.5-2 nM, respectively. At the same concentrations, these agents induced a strong suppression of c-myb mRNA levels within 3 h, whereas c-myc expression remained unaffected. The c-myb expression recovered and approached pretreatment levels at 9-12 h of incubation. The decrease in c-myb mRNA was prevented in Ca(2+)-free medium. Treatment of F4-6 cells with EGTA led to a transient increase in c-myb mRNA with the same kinetics as the Ca2+ pump inhibitor-induced suppression, indicating that c-myb expression is bidirectionally regulated by changes in [Ca2+]i. Studies on the differentiation status of F4-6 cells following cyclopiazonic acid or thapsigargin exposure demonstrated a marked increase in beta-globin mRNA synthesis at 60h and in hemoglobin production at 96 h. These results provide further evidence that a rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is capable, in Friend erythroleukemia cells, of inducing an early transient suppression of c-myb mRNA levels, which is followed by terminal erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1559136026,"Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) and human transforming growth factor-alpha (hTGF-alpha) are structurally related growth factors that share relatively little sequence homology. They both exert their biological action by binding to the cell-surface EGF receptor. hEGF and hTGF-alpha bind with similar affinity to the hEGF receptor, but hEGF binds with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity to the chicken EGF receptor compared with hTGF-alpha. To map the region in hTGF-alpha that confers its ability to bind with high affinity to the chicken EGF receptor, 10 hybrids of hEGF and hTGF-alpha were constructed by exchanging domains bordered by the third, fourth, and sixth conserved cysteine residues. The activity of the expressed chimeric proteins was determined by their ability to compete with 125I-labeled mouse EGF for binding to NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the hEGF receptor. Subsequent binding competition studies of NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the chicken EGF receptor showed that chimeras carrying TGF-alpha sequences COOH-terminal of the sixth cysteine have a high affinity for this receptor, similar to hTGF-alpha. In contrast, chimeras with EGF sequences in this COOH-terminal domain have only low binding affinity, similar to hEGF. We conclude that the COOH-terminal linear region of hTGF-alpha is important for its high affinity interaction with the chicken EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1493158425,"We have recently reported the cloning of the rat zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein GP-3 and the related pancreatic secretory lipase (Wishart, M. J., Andrews, P. C., Nichols, R., Blevins, G. T., Logsdon, C.D., and Williams, J. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10303-10311). Specific antipeptide antibodies were generated against both GP-3 and secretory lipase and used for the biochemical and physiological characterization of GP-3. Western blotting confirmed that GP-3 was found exclusively in zymogen granule membranes and was absent from zymogen granule content which contains the majority of secretory lipase. Extraction of zymogen granule membranes with Triton X-114 showed GP-3 to be significantly more hydrophobic than lipase. The GP-3 amino acid sequence contains one potential N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-336. The loss of concanavalin A labeling after both chemical deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and enzymatic deglycosylation with N-glycanase showed GP-3 to possess a small N-linked oligosaccharide side chain. Digestion of intact and permeabilized zymogen granules with the nonspecific protease Pronase localized GP-3 to the inner surface of zymogen granule membranes. Since GP-3 is resident on the inner surface of the zymogen granule membrane, it should appear on the outer cellular surface after exocytosis. Although membrane attachment of GP-3 was resistant to treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, we observed that GP-3 is released into the pancreatic juice and that secretion of GP-3 was greatly enhanced by cholecystokinin."
https://openalex.org/W1547593448,"Protein histidine kinase (Motojima, K., and Goto, S. (1993) FEBS Lett. 319, 75-79) and phosphatase in rat liver extract were characterized. The histidine kinase was recovered mostly in the membrane and the phosphatase in the soluble fraction. The kinase and its substrate 36-kDa protein (P36) were co-solubilized from the membrane under conditions in which most of the other kinases, and their substrate proteins were not solubilized. The solubilized kinase and P36 were co-eluted after high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration, showing an apparent molecular mass of 70-75 kDa. They were also co-eluted after ion exchange chromatography. These characteristics, together with its complete resistance to genistein, indicate that the rat liver histidine kinase is not cognate to the yeast enzyme (Huang, J., Nasr, M., Kim, Y., and Matthews, H.R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15511-15515). The phosphatase that dephosphorylates histidyl-phosphorylated P36 was also studied using rat liver subcellular fractions and in vitro phosphorylated P36 as the substrate. The characteristics of the phosphatase, that is, 1) Mg2+ requirement for activity, 2) apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa by high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration, and 3) resistance to 100 microM okadaic acid, suggest that the primary phosphatase active in vitro is protein phosphatase 2C."
https://openalex.org/W1617341782,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) attenuated angiotensin II (AII)-or bradykinin (BK)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and omega-conotoxin-sensitive high K(+)-induced Ca2+ influx in the human neuroblastoma cell line SMS-KAN. All three NPY actions were mediated via Y2 receptors. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin completely abolished all of the NPY actions. Activation or down-regulation of protein kinase C had no effect on any NPY-mediated effect; herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, only abolished the inhibitory effect of NPY on AII- or BK-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Herbimycin A also blocked platelet-derived growth factor-induced Ca2+ mobilization, which involves tyrosine kinase activation, and there was a good correlation in the concentration dependency between the two effects of herbimycin A, strongly suggesting that its ability to cancel the NPY effect is due to inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity. NPY attenuated AII- or BK-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, and herbimycin A reversed this NPY effect. These results provide the first evidence that Y2 receptors negatively couple to AII- or BK-induced phosphoinositide turnover leading to Ca2+ mobilization through pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein(s). Inhibition of phospholipase C-beta activity by NPY seems to be mediated by activation of protein-tyrosine kinase or phosphotyrosine-containing protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1580075587,"In order to investigate positive and negative regulatory elements of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene, synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to control Epo transcription by means of an antigen strategy. We devised a new method for detecting regulatory elements of genes that have a weak promoter. Synthetic oligonucleotides were incubated with Hep3B cells in the presence or absence of CoCl2 or hypoxia. To exclude the effect of translational regulation, Epo mRNA concentration was determined by competitive polymerase chain reaction. The addition of antisense oligonucleotide for CACCC elements decreased the production of Epo mRNA in a dose-dependent fashion when cells were stimulated by CoCl2 or hypoxia. In contrast, the addition of antisense oligonucleotide for the GATA element caused a dose-dependent stimulation of Epo mRNA production either in the presence or absence of CoCl2 or hypoxia. Triple helix formation was revealed by electrophoresis. CACCC elements were demonstrated to be positive regulatory elements of the Epo gene, whereas the GATA element was a negative regulatory element. Furthermore, by gel mobility shift assays, we demonstrated evidence for the presence of factors in Hep3B cell nuclear extract that specifically bind to CACCC or GATA elements. Based on these observations, we presented the possibility that triple helix formation could serve as a novel means for transcriptional regulation of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1499168078,"Following sequestration into the endoplasmic reticulum, wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) assemble into polymers through intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These polymers, which also include low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), have a broad distribution of molecular mass reaching up to several million daltons. To study the mechanism of assembly of the HMW-GS, we have expressed x- and y-type HMW-GS in transgenic tobacco plants. Both types, when expressed individually or in combination, were incorporated into polymers. Partial reduction of polymers formed by different subunits resulted in different patterns of release of homodimers, heterodimers, and monomers. This suggested different arrangements of intermolecular disulfide bonds or different peptide conformations in the vicinity of the disulfide bonds linking x-x, y-y, and x-y type HMW-GS. A mutant of the x-type subunit, lacking a conserved cysteine in the C-terminal domain, assembled into oligomers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds, but not into large polymers. This mutant was deposited, however, in dense protein bodies, similar to those formed by the native HMW-GS, suggesting that polymer formation and packaging into protein bodies may be the result of different types of interactions. Pulse-chase labeling of proteins in wheat endosperm showed that the assembly of the HMW-GS into insoluble polymers occurs by a slow process which apparently continues after the initiation of protein body formation."
https://openalex.org/W2164128415,"Factor XIII catalysis proceeds via formation of thioester acyl enzyme intermediate involving an active site cysteine residue at position 314. The contribution of other residues to catalysis has not been established. Earlier studies of the pH dependence of factor XIII activity suggested the existence of a putative active site histidine. We used chemical modification and oligonucleotide directed site-specific mutagenesis to investigate the role of histidines. Photo-oxidation with methylene blue resulted in a complete loss of catalytic activity under conditions that oxidized histidine but did not affect the essential cysteine. Single substitution of each of the 14 histidine residues in the a-subunit of factor XIII by asparagine or alanine led to mutants with catalytic activities generally not significantly different from the wild-type recombinant enzyme. The only exceptions were the H373N and H373A mutants that were poorly expressed, had no detectable rate of [14C]putrescine incorporation into dimethylcasein, and failed to cross-link fibrin gamma-chains. Thus, the a-subunit His-373 may function in the active site of factor XIII, by analogy with papain's mechanism, as a histidinium cation that increases the nucleophilicity of the essential Cys-314. Decreased expression levels of His-373 mutants also indicate that this residue may be critical for enzyme stability."
https://openalex.org/W1568245756,"Abstract The homogeneous nature of the rat intermediate pituitary makes it a powerful model system in which to study peptide hormone secretion. Adult male rats were treated with bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, or haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, for 3 weeks. In cDNA libraries prepared from the neurointermediate pituitaries of these rats, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expression exhibited the expected decrease in response to bromocriptine, and increase in response to haloperidol. We report the identification of six transcripts that are coregulated with POMC in the intermediate pituitary by these dopaminergic agents. In addition to demonstrating parallel dopamine-regulated expression of carboxy-peptidase E, chromogranin B, binding protein/glucose-regulated protein, and tenascin, two novel regulated transcripts are described. The expression of one of these novel transcripts, RESP18, is limited to neural and endocrine tissue. The RESP18 transcript is approximately 800 nucleotides in length; its cognate translation product is 20 +/- 1 kDa, contains a putative signal sequence, and has many characteristics of a secreted protein. Cell-free translation experiments in the presence of microsomal membranes demonstrate that the 20 +/- 1-kDa RESP18 protein is cleaved to an 18 +/- 1-kDa protein and sequestered within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Tissue in situ hybridization analysis shows that RESP18 mRNA is highly expressed in both the intermediate and anterior pituitary, as well as in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus."

We report that the number and order of S and W half-sites in a direct repeat TRE determines whether it mediates ligand-dependent or independent transcriptional activation or inhibition in the presence of TR or TR and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR); and whether a TRE is preferentially bound by TR homodimers, TR-RXR heterodimers, or CV1 cell TR accessory protein (TRAP)-TR heterodimers. TR homodimers bound equally to TREs composed of the 5‘-S and 3‘-W (SW) and the opposite (WS) arrangement of half-sites. TR-RXR gamma heterodimers bound SW better than WS. TR-TRAP heterodimers bound WS better than SW. Transcription of a reporter gene cis-linked to WS responded to unliganded TR and RXR, and either ligand stimulated expression 2-fold more. Reporter expression cis-linked to SW was not altered by unliganded receptors, and T3 stimulated transcription only in the presence of both TR and RXR. SS was strongly activated by liganded, but not by unliganded TR. SS was activated by unliganded TR and RXR gamma together, and T3 further stimulated transcription 2-fold. Under these conditions, transcription was inhibited 60% by 9-cis-retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1550995632,"The effect and mechanism of action of glucocorticoids (GC) on Na-Pi cotransport were evaluated in opossum kidney cells. Dexamethasone (1-1000 nM) inhibited sodium-dependent Pi uptake in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition was maximal after a 6-h incubation with dexamethasone and was prevented by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. The effect was related to a 37% decrease of the Vmax value after incubation with 100 nM dexamethasone. The effect of dexamethasone was mimicked by cortisol and blocked by GC receptor antagonists RU38486 and progesterone. GC affected neither glucose or alanine uptake nor Na/H exchange activity. Inhibition of Pi uptake persisted when Na/H was blocked by amiloride or dimethylamiloride. GC had no effect on basal or parathyroid hormone- and forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP content. Dexamethasone and extracellular cAMP, parathyroid hormone, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine had additive inhibitory effects on Pi uptake. Staurosporine, GF109203X, or calphostin C (three dissimilar inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC)) and PKC down-regulation blunted the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on Pi uptake. GC increased both membrane-bound PKC activity and the membrane/cytosol PKC activity ratio. This is the first report of GC activation of PKC in renal cells, which appears to mediate the steroid inhibitory effect on Pi transport."
https://openalex.org/W1535124446,"We present data demonstrating that hydrogen peroxide markedly decreases release of progeny hepatitis B virus particles in cultured cells. The presence of reduced glutathione prevents this effect. Hydrogen peroxide also decreases secretion of the hepatitis B virus surface and e antigens, with a concomitant decrease in the steady-state levels of the corresponding viral transcripts. This effect is specific to viral gene expression, since hydrogen peroxide at the concentration used does not have any significant effect on the overall pattern of host cell protein synthesis nor on the secretion of growth hormone from a co-transfected plasmid. Since hepatitis B virus can cause acute and chronic hepatitis and since inflammatory cells release significant amounts of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide, this phenomenon may be of pathophysiological importance in the viral life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1509107903,"Human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is specifically expressed in the liver to convert L-phenylalanine to L-tyrosine. Deficiency of the PAH enzyme causes classic phenylketonuria, a common genetic disorder. The human PAH gene has a TATA-less promoter with multiple transcriptional initiation sites. A 9-kilobase DNA fragment 5'-flanking to the human PAH gene is sufficient to confer tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice. Deletion studies showed that the -121-base pair proximal promoter still retained a significant level of activity in hepatic cells. At least two protein binding sites, PAH-A and PAH-B, were identified in the proximal region of the human PAH promoter using rat liver nuclear extract. The PAH-A site covers a unique palindromic sequence, and the PAH-B site contains CCCTCCC repeats. Both elements are ubiquitous and essential regulatory elements for transcriptional activity. Nuclear protein factors that bind to the PAH-A and -B sites are detected in different cell types and are distinct from previously characterized transcription factors. No tissue-specific transcription factor binding sites have been detected within the proximal promoter region of the human PAH gene. These results suggest that the PAH gene promoter has a unique organization of regulatory elements for its tissue-specific expression in comparison with other liver gene promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1678012608,"The effects of glucagon on serine: pyruvate/alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (SPT/AGT) gene expression were studied in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. When hepatocytes had been precultured for 16-18 h under serum- and hormone-free conditions, the addition of glucagon caused (after a lag period of about 2 h) a remarkable increase in the cellular level of SPT/AGT mRNA by 4 h in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The induced mRNA was that for mitochondrial SPT/AGT, as judged by ribonuclease protection analysis. A nuclear run-on assay revealed that activation of transcription is responsible for the increase in mitochondrial SPT/AGT mRNA and that the maximal rate of transcription occurs 1.5 h after glucagon addition. The effect of glucagon was mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP and suppressed by N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), while both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and A23187 were without effect in elevating the SPT/AGT mRNA level, suggesting that the cAMP/protein kinase A system is involved in the regulation of SPT/AGT gene expression. In hepatocytes precultured for 16-18 h under serum- and hormone-free conditions, the glucagon-induced transcription was severely inhibited by cycloheximide. When the preculture was for 2 h, on the other hand, the activation of transcription by glucagon was more rapid, and the inhibition by cycloheximide was less than that observed with cells precultured for 16-18 h, suggesting that a short-lived protein factor is involved in the hormonal regulation. The glucagon-induced expression of the SPT/AGT gene was also turned off by dexamethasone."
https://openalex.org/W1585179304,"Mouse steroid 15 alpha-hydroxylase P-450 2a-4 is restricted in its substrate specificity to the delta 4, 3-ketone steroids such as androstenedione. As a result, the P-450 exhibits little hydroxylase activity toward delta 5, 3-hydroxysteroids including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). A single amino acid mutation of Ala at position 117 to Val, however, is enough to confer a high DHEA hydroxylase activity to P-450 2a-4 with 7 alpha-OH DHEA as one of the two major hydroxylated metabolites. Mouse coumarin 7-hydroxylase P-450 2a-5 contains Val at position 117, but it exhibits very low DHEA hydroxylase activity. P-450 2a-5 acquires high DHEA hydroxylase activity, however, by a mutation of Phe-209 to Asn. Moreover, the mutant P-450 2a-5 loses its activity when Val is replaced by Ala at position 117. The residue at position 117, therefore, plays the principal role in the determination of the DHEA hydroxylase activity of the P-450s. Conversely, mutations at residue 117 have little effect on the androstenedione hydroxylase activities of the P-450s. Further modeling of the DHEA binding orientation in the substrate-heme pocket of bacterial P-450cam (Iwasaki, M., Darden, T., Pedersen, L., Davis, D. G., Juvonen, R. O., Sueyoshi, T., and Negishi, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 759-762) provides support for the hypothesis that the type of residue at position 117 determines the steroid-substrate specificity of the P-450 depending on the substituent at the C3 position of steroid molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1554753929,"Lipofuscin is a general term assigned to fluorescent material that accumulates in cells as they age. It is apparent from this study that the fluorescent intensity of detergent-solubilized liver from Fisher-344 rats increased as a function of age. The fluorophore responsible for this increase was extracted with methanol and could be resolved from other cellular components when the methanol extracts were chromatographed over a reverse phase column. This compound was identified as retinyl palmitate and was found to increase throughout the entire life of the Fisher-344 rat (2-24 months), from a value of 0.26-1.77 mg/g of liver. In addition, the results presented here demonstrate that concentration, time between extraction and analysis, exposure to light, and degree of purity affect the observed fluorescent properties of retinyl palmitate. These factors affect many fluorophores and are likely to be, at least in part, responsible for the multiplicity of reported properties of lipofuscin. As has been reported for lipofuscin, retinyl palmitate accumulates in intracellular granules and exhibits fluorescence between 450 and 600 nm. Due to these similarities, the relationship between retinyl palmitate and lipofuscin warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1958451483,"Bipinnatin-A, -B, and -C belong to a family of naturally occurring marine neurotoxins known as the lophotoxins. The lophotoxins are unique in that they irreversibly inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by forming a covalent bond with a tyrosine residue at position 190 in the alpha-subunit of the receptor. In this study, we show that the inhibitory activity of the bipinnatins against the nicotinic receptor increased with preincubation of the toxins in aqueous buffer prior to incubation with the receptor. The parent species of the bipinnatins displayed little, if any, affinity for the nicotinic receptor. Preincubation of the toxins appeared to produce a single, relatively stable, active toxin species that irreversibly inhibited the two acetylcholine-binding sites on the nicotinic receptor with two distinguishable apparent pseudo first-order rates. The difference in the rates of irreversible inhibition of the two binding sites on the receptor was exploited to selectively inhibit one site for the pharmacological investigation of the other. The bipinnatins preferentially inhibited the binding site near the alpha/delta-subunit interface that displays low affinity for metocurine and high affinity for acetylcholine. The bimolecular reaction constants for the interaction of the bipinnatins with the nicotinic receptor decreased in the order bipinnatin-B > bipinnatin-A > bipinnatin-C for both acetylcholine-binding sites. The ratio of the bimolecular reaction constants for the two binding sites on the receptor was not the same for the three bipinnatins. This indicates that the reaction of the bipinnatins with the nicotinic receptor is sensitive to differences in the structure of the two acetylcholine-binding sites. The bipinnatins may be useful in the design of novel drugs for the nicotinic receptor that exclusively inhibit one of the two binding sites and for the investigation of structural differences between the two acetylcholine-binding sites of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1487879160,"Protein kinases and phosphatases play an important role in signal transduction. In the T cell, activation via the T cell receptor-CD3 complex results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, as well as subsequent increases in serine/threonine phosphorylation. The Raf serine/threonine kinase has been implicated in many receptor signaling pathways, including those of platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, and interleukin-2 receptors. We show here that Raf is associated with the T cell receptor-CD3 complex in unstimulated murine T cells. Using a COS cell expression system, we show that a hypophosphorylated form of Raf specifically associates with the CD3 gamma and delta chains but not with the CD3 epsilon or zeta chains. These results suggest that Raf mediates signal transduction from the gamma and delta chains of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex, analogous to the role played by ZAP-70 in signal transduction mediated by the zeta chain."
https://openalex.org/W83365202,"Treatment of rats with isoproterenol resulted in elevated levels of prolyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase activities in the parotid and submandibular glands. This increase in enzyme activity was accompanied by an increase in the bi-functional glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase and of a low molecular weight form of prolyl-tRNA synthetase. Isoproterenol also induced the synthesis of proline-rich glycoproteins in the parotid and submandibular glands. Withdrawal from the drug was accompanied by a decline in prolyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase activities and by a decline in the levels of proline-rich glycoproteins in the salivary gland. During the time course of isoproterenol treatment, little change in the levels of mRNA encoding the bi-functional glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase was detected by Northern blot analysis. These results indicate that the synthesis of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase is regulated at a post-transcriptional step and that the synthesis of this bifunctional protein may be linked to the utilization of proline and glutamic acid in protein synthesis."
